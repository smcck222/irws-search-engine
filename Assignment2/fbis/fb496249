<F P=106> [Article by Zinat Ibrahim: "Social Affairs Minister Before </F>
Consultative Council"] 
  [Text] The beginning was an item in one of the 
government-owned newspapers: 
  "Number of juveniles in welfare institutions drops to only 
200." 
  Dr. Amal 'Uthman, minister of insurance and social affairs, 
gave the figure in her statement before the Consultative 
Council's committee on services. 
  The minister did not say whether the figure was the result 
of 
a decline in the juvenile crime rate or whether there were other 
causes. 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH weekly posed the question to officials 
responsible for juveniles in police stations and welfare 
institutions in an attempt to monitor the facts. 
  The details of the news item said there were fewer than 200 
juveniles between the ages of 15 and 18 in welfare institutions 
throughout the republic. 
  The constant decrease in this number has forced the ministry 
to convert some juvenile institutions to other functions. In 
addition, there are governorates where there are no juveniles 
who have received judicial sentences. 
<H5>  Figures </H5>
  Public Security reports for 1993 state that a total of 
17,896 
juveniles committed acts of theft, murder, prostitution, etc. 
  The reports show that 74 boys and 12 girls under age 7; 132 
boys and 15 girls under age 11; 1,000 boys and 93 girls under 
age 13; 5,000 adolescent boys and 411 adolescent girls under age 
16; and 9,000 adolescent boys and 439 adolescent girls under age 
18 committed crimes punishable under the juveniles law. 
  Among them were 3,347 who committed crimes of deception, 
5,181 who committed crimes of battery, 285 who committed crimes 
of murder and wrongful injury, 3,487 who committed crimes of 
public transport or vagrancy, 216 who committed crimes of 
vandalism, and 65 who committed crimes of violation of trust. 
  There were 7,031 juveniles who committed various 
misdemeanors. 
  Security reports for 1993 also recorded a definite increase 
in the number of crimes and juvenile perpetrators compared with 
1992. 
  The reports recorded 257 felony cases committed by 299 
juveniles in 1992. There were 6,327 juvenile misdemeanor and 
vagrancy cases. There were 15,536 male juveniles charged and 
1,274 females. 
  Public Security reports also list 27 juvenile welfare 
institutions and homes under the Ministry of Social Affairs. 
  The penal institution at al-Marj contains at least 500 
juveniles. It is administered by the Prisons Department and 
Juvenile Police Administration. Juveniles who have been 
judicially sentenced are committed to it. 
  It is the only institution whose case records show not a 
single case of escape. This is because it enforces the closed 
institutions law and is under strict security guard. 
  Other juvenile welfare institutions and homes: 
  For example, according to security reports, 70 juveniles 
have 
been committed to the al-Jizah classification center by judicial 
sentences. 
  There are 120 juveniles in the education home in al-Jizah, 
100 juveniles in the youth institution in 'Ayn Shams, 50 
juveniles in the people's education home in Old Cairo, 50 girls 
in the institute for minors charged in cases of prostitution and 
out-of-wedlock pregnancy, 115 girls in the al-'Ajuzah girls' 
institution, and 50 male and female juveniles in the al-Jizah 
observation home. 
  The security reports also say that an average of 5,841 
juveniles run away every year from juvenile welfare institutions 
and homes. 
  Social and security studies and research confirm the 
evidence 
of the public security reports. 
  The most recent study on juvenile misdemeanor was done by 
Colonel 'Uthman 'Abd-al-Khaliq, head of the Juvenile 
Investigation Department in Cairo. 
  The field study proved the phenomenon of juveniles running 
away and that there are insufficient welfare homes and refuges 
to absorb delinquents, vagrants, and orphans. Those who manage 
most of the institutions have a low level of qualification, and 
budget and facilities are meager. 
<H5>  Increase in Juvenile Crimes </H5>
  We asked Col. 'Uthman 'Abd-al-Khaliq, "How many juveniles 
come in every day?" 
  He replied: "There is no fixed daily statistic, as the 
number 
depends on police campaigns. For example, there were 180 
juveniles arrested on 27 March. On 31 March the number dropped 
to 35." 
  Is there an actual decrease in the number of crimes 
committed 
by juveniles? 
  'Atiyat Muhammad Salih, head of police women social workers 
at the department, replied: "The answer definitely is no. There 
is a clear increase in the rate of crimes of various kinds and 
degrees of seriousness committed by juveniles. 
  "The decrease has occurred only with regard to cases of 
subjection to delinquency including: begging; gathering 
cigarette butts; sleeping in streets, large water pipes, ruins, 
and garbage bins; and other cases that lack the element of 
crime." 
  She continued: "Also, there are gaps in Law 31 of 1974. In 
the 20 years since the law was passed, the community's scale of 
values has changed due to social, economic, and psychological 
circumstances. 
  "For example, anyone caught for the first time is handed 
over 
to his guardian, who is warned to watch his behavior carefully. 
If the same juvenile is apprehended again, the guardian has the 
right to lodge a complaint within 10 days, in which case the 
guardian will be charged with the misdemeanor of negligence and 
pay a fine of only 5 pounds." 
<H5>  Where Do They Go? </H5>
  How does the chief woman social worker of the Cairo police 
explain the phenomenon of juveniles running away from social 
welfare institutions and homes? 
  She answered: "I personally am asking that the welfare 
institutions belonging to the Ministry of Social Affairs be 
abolished. More private associations should be established, such 
as the My Children Association (Gam'iyat Awladi) in 
al-Ma'adi, the Firm Handhold Association (Gam'iyat 
al-'Urwah al-Wuthqa) in the Citadel, and other associations 
that provide physical, social, educational, and psychological 
care for youngsters. 
  "Most of the institutions under the Ministry of Social 
Affairs financially, technically, and administratively can be 
seen as schools to graduate children who are even more 
delinquent and more dangerous to the community. 
  "These institutions are unable to absorb juveniles because 
of 
meager resources and mismanagement. An institution's board of 
directors does not meet at the scheduled times. No one knows the 
secrets of these institutions that are managed in an inhumane 
manner. 
  "We may remember that most of the victims of the American 
tourist Mr. William were children who had run away from 
institutions. 
  "In addition there are repeated cases of flight due to 
inhumane treatment in most of these homes. This treatment comes 
across in the stories of the young runaways who are 
reapprehended and return to us. These cases are documented in 
police station books. The number of runaways is at least 50 
percent. 
  "One of the most important factors aiding juveniles to run 
away is that most of these institutions implement an open-door 
system without guards. 
  "The 'Ayn Shams popular institutions and girls' welfare 
homes 
are open institutions. Juveniles in them are allowed to go out 
once a week. Usually a juvenile goes out and does not return. 
  "Juveniles in other institutions are allowed to go out daily 
and carry on their normal lives." 
  Major General Hamdi al-'Awadi, director of the Cairo police 
investigation department, thinks that the lack of a strict 
security guard at the institutions contributes primarily to 
juveniles running away. 
  "Most of these institutions are negligent in performing 
their 
mission, which is to reform and educate juveniles, caring for 
them medically and psychologically, so that they become good 
citizens in the community. 
  "There are many reasons for this. Most important, the role 
of 
Social Affairs is limited to establishing juvenile institutions. 
There is no attention to protecting the basic rights of 
juveniles, respecting their feelings, and providing the 
specialized expertise to undertake their care. 
  "Young people are extremely sensitive to the labels with 
which they are branded. Criminology investigations dealing with 
the process of applying criminal labels have shown the damage 
that results from characterizing young people permanently as 
miscreants or criminals." 
  He continued: "This necessitates the formation of a high 
commission on juveniles. It should include all the organizations 
and agencies active in the area. There should be full 
coordination between the juvenile police, the juvenile courts, 
the Social Affairs Ministry's social welfare institutions, and 
private associations. 
<H5>  Confessions of a Runaway </H5>
  Ahmad is a child who has run away from the 'Ayn Shams 
institution. We met him at the Cairo Juvenile Police Station. 
  Ahmad, who had run away, refused to give his full name for 
fear of punishment when he returned--first from the director of 
the institution, then from its seven supervisors, its head, and 
finally the head of the ward. 
  Punishments are many and varied in the institution. 
  There is hair shaving; cleaning and sweeping the wards; 
chores and services in the homes of officials; sweeping, 
cleaning, and shaking out bedding and carpeting; polishing 
furniture; washing dishes; and hanging out laundry. 
  On returning, a juvenile gets a grade. Four disobediences 
mean being beaten with a cane across the hand or being made to 
kneel for hours on end. 
  Full meals are not served. The food listed on paper is quite 
different from what is distributed to the juveniles. 
  A sick juvenile gets no doctor or medicine. He works and 
sweeps even if he comes down with a fever. 
<H5>  Human Crime </H5>
  I left the juvenile police station at al-Azbakiyah for the 
juvenile welfare homes. 
  The Egypt Society for the Protection of Women and Children 
depends financially, technically, and administratively on the 
Ministry of Social Affairs. 
  The society is located on Dikirnis Street, off al-Khalifah 
al-Mansur Street, in the Safir section of Heliopolis. 
  It includes the Women's Protection Home, registry no. 94 of 
the year 1969, as well as al-Amal Nursery School, license no. 
469 for the year 1986. 
  Before going, we telephoned the home about whether it would 
accept a young girl. 
  The woman official agreed to accept the girl at once, 
without 
asking any questions. 
  According to regulations, this home is supposed to accept 
only girls who have been sentenced by the juvenile prosecutor. 
  We hesitated for a long time before entering the home--an 
old-fashioned villa with faded walls flecked with yellow paint 
that gives you a feeling of gloom and mystery. 
  In the neglected garden are scattered remains of old toys, a 
broken swing, and a few chairs on which a child could not sit 
without falling and being hurt. 
  The villa has two stories. The reception room and the 
nursery 
school are on the first floor. 
  There were four girls, aged between four and five. One 
supervisor was in charge of all the children's affairs. 
  We asked about the director of the home. 
  "She's not in," answered a young girl. 
  "Who is in charge here now?" 
  "I," she answered, in a tone tinged with fear and caution. 
  The girl exchanged long glances with the supervisor of the 
nursery school. She left us and went into a side room. 
  We asked the nursery school supervisor: "Where are the girls 
who live in the home?" 
  "There are no girls now. But there is a girl coming in a 
while." She meant the imaginary girl whose coming we had 
announced! 
  A few moments later, a woman in her thirties appeared--a 
mute. She came from the upper story and was accompanied by 
another woman. 
  The two women were, as they say, skin and bone--withered 
features, in their eyes a sad downtroddenness reminiscent of the 
system of forced labor and humiliation. 
  We asked again for the name of the directress of the home. 
  The nursery school supervisor replied: "Ghadah Muhammad 
Amin. 
She lives permanently on the top floor of the home. There is a 
room for her and two rooms to receive visiting girls." 
  We asked to see the register of visiting girls, but the girl 
on duty suddenly returned to ask us to make an urgent telephone 
call. 
  The girl dialed a certain number, and Hilmi Mahmud Salih, 
the 
society's director, told us over the line: "You are forbidden to 
obtain any information. Photographing is forbidden." We would 
have to see him first at the general administration in Qasr 
al-'Ayni! 
  I left the room where the mute woman was sitting. We tried 
to 
communicate with her by signs and glances. 
  The woman said quite innocently, "Pregnant girls come here. 
They leave immediately after giving birth." 
  We asked the overseer of the nursery school, "Where do the 
girls go after giving birth?" 
  "As soon as a girl gives birth, the directress of the home 
turns the infant over to the police station, and they take 
charge of placing it in an orphanage. The mother leaves the 
home." 
  We left the home stunned. How could girls be allowed to go 
out and risk becoming delinquent again and again? 
  We got the answer from someone in the vicinity of the home. 
  A man who refused to allow his name to be mentioned told us: 
"The circumstances of this home are suspicious. It accepts any 
girl carrying an out-of-wedlock child. When she gives birth, she 
becomes a domestic servant with the knowledge of the home, which 
takes her entire salary and gives her a small part of it. 
  "I know lots of stories about the girls who leave the 
home--'Abir, Hiyam, and many others. Some obey the orders of the 
directress; others run away onto the streets, into the unknown." 
  The man continued very nervously: "Last week there were 10 
girls here. Day before yesterday there were three. Where did 
they go? 
  "Those here permanently are the mute and her companion. 
Their 
health has been ruined from working night and day. 
  "Those in the early months of pregnancy manage to work in 
domestic service. The others do chores around the home until it 
comes time to give birth." 
<H5>  Papa Wahid </H5>
  Al-Hurriyah Institution for Social Care has more than one 
shift. 
  The 75-year-old institution used to be called the Fu'ad I 
Orphanage of the Egyptian Society. Its head in 1919 was 'Ali 
Pasha Mahir. 
  It subsequently became the 'Ayn Shams Social Administration. 
It is under the Ministry of Social Affairs. 
  Although we entered the institution without an appointment, 
we saw healthy children living a normal life in a peaceful house 
in which one could feel real, not artificial warmth. 
  When we asked some of them whether they were happy here, 
they 
answered with childish innocence: "Very happy, thanks be to God. 
We all love Papa Wahid." 
  We learned that Papa Wahid is the director in charge of 
al-Hurriyah Institution and that it accepts children who are 
victims of orphanhood, divorce, poverty, or illegitimacy. 
  The director was the only child of parents whom he never has 
seen all his life. He does not even know what they look like. He 
was raised with his paternal uncle and his wife. There he 
learned the meaning of orphanhood and the cruelty of 
discrimination between children living in one house. 
  When he grew up and obtained a crafts school diploma, he 
decided to repeat the General Secondary Examination and enroll 
in the Social Service Institute in order to devote himself to 
caring for these youngsters. 
  For 32 years he has been caring for children whom he regards 
as his own. There are 95 children in the institution, and they 
call him "papa." 
  His own son lives in the building and spends his spare time 
with his "brothers" in the home. 
  They are children against whom no court rulings have been 
passed, but their social and economic circumstances have made 
them orphans although their fathers and mothers are still alive. 
  The director of the institution said very bitterly: 
"Although 
the home has room to accept at least 120 children, insufficient 
resources prevent us from accepting any but critical cases. The 
budget is very meager and not fixed, and the money never 
stretches far enough. The result is that there are neglected 
victims--children exposed to delinquency of whom the streets are 
full." 
  A child is subjected to thorough social investigations 
before 
being committed to the home. The institution accepts children 
from the age of six. It provides them with care and gives them 
opportunities for a normal education from primary school until 
graduation from university or technical and crafts schools, 
depending on their talent and ability. 
  Despite the meager budget, the institution seems model. 
Original oil paintings by College of Fine Arts students living 
in the home adorn the walls. 
  In the extensive long halls, one sees only flowerpots of 
green plants that the children carefully tend. 
  The kitchen is extremely clean and lacks nothing. The 
refectory has clean and serviceable tables and chairs. 
  The dormitories are divided according to the children's 
ages. 
  All the dormitories remind one of four-star hotels. A social 
specialist supervises each wing. 
  There is a mosque for prayer, a study hall, and a dispensary 
equipped with various kinds of drugs. 
  We saw not a scrap of paper on the floor and not a single 
fly. 
  What most drew one's attention were the children's 
expressions, which radiated joy, contentment, and a sense of 
confidence and security. 
  We asked the director of the home whether the institution's 
rolls recorded a single case of running away. 
  Khalid and Sayyid answered together: "Once Mr. Richard came 
here. He took us to al-Amal Village in Madinat Nasr. We couldn't 
stay there, although the institution is pretty and has 
everything. We came back because Papa Wahid and our brothers and 
sisters are here. We all love each other." 
  How has the home's director been able to provide these 
facilities for the children of the institution? 
  "The budget from the government is very meager, amounting to 
120,000 pounds. Half of it is allocated to employees' salaries; 
the other half to feeding the children. 
  "I therefore turn to the method of nonmonetary contributions 
in kind. Charitable people provide us with all the needs of the 
children: clothing, school equipment, medicine, even some kinds 
of food, candy, and drinks that the children ask for." 
  I asked how he explained the running away of children. 
  He answered: "It results primarily from the policy of the 
institution's management--whether the institution can become a 
factor attracting the young person by providing love and 
affection first, and then comprehensive care."

<F P=106> [Article by Kamran Qurah Dafghi: "Israel and Iraq"] </F>
  [Text] This is not the first time that Iraq leaks to the 
press that it is secretly contacting Israel through 
European-Palestinian go-betweens. This time around, in a 
departure from the previous time, Baghdad apparently chose a 
European capital, rather than Amman, to leak the "information" 
and opted for a French rather than a Palestinian mediator as a 
conduit between it and Israel; apparently to lend validity to 
the leak. 
  The first time was six months ago when the Iraqis leaked 
through Jordanian newsmen that Baghdad would be willing to 
patriate some 400,000 Palestinian residents of South Lebanon in 
return for Israeli intercession with the United States to lift 
the economic embargo of Iraq. 
  First of all, that contacts with Israel are no longer an 
Arab 
no-no and the Iraqi regime did not have to shroud such contacts 
in secrecy. That has not been a problem since "Madrid." Secrecy 
has been meaningless since the Oslo talks and no longer seems to 
create a magical aura. Furthermore, the Iraqi regime is not one 
to shy away from any action that would deliver it from its 
current isolation. 
  The question here is not whether Iraq is secretly seeking to 
contact Israel. Rather, it is whether Israel would agree and 
whether it would serve its interests to do so. The answer lies 
in such questions as: Is Israel willing to create a problem, 
even a crisis, with the United States for the sake of a regime 
that Washington and its allies in the West, and particularly in 
the region, consider a threat to their interests and security? 
  What could Israel, at a time when it is pre-occupied with 
the 
peace process and the negotiations with the Palestinians, 
possibly gain by contacts with a regime whose validity is at a 
low ebb; which is isolated from the Arabs and from other 
countries of the region and of the world; and which no longer 
has any political, military, or moral weight and whose continued 
existence is a burden to the region and to the rest of the 
world? The only possible outcome of such contacts would be to 
create complications for Israel, for the Americans, and for the 
Palestinians and other Arabs. 
  The peace process, therefore, would not be served under 
these 
circumstances if any of the parties concerned embroiled itself 
in secret contacts with Baghdad. The problem is that it is in 
Baghdad's interest to seek contacts with Israel and with any 
other party that could help it escape its isolation. But, what 
can an isolated regime like Baghdad's do to gain Israeli 
acceptance and willingness to help it in its crisis and despair? 
  Iran is the only card that Saddam believes to be meaningful 
to Israel. Truth is, the Iraqi president has never ceased to 
allude to that card in order to entice the United States to 
forgive him on the premise that any other regime would mean that 
Tehran could extend its influence to Iraq; and that the 
constancy of his regime is therefore the only guarantee against 
the Iranian threat to Israel and to the peace process. This 
reasoning is practically the only argument underlying Iraq's 
current diplomatic campaign to lift or ease the embargo against 
it. This premise has been emphasized by Tariq 'Aziz in all his 
meetings two weeks ago with members of the Security Council. 
  It is unfortunate for Saddam Husayn that his premise was not 
seriously "bought" either by Israel, which denied six months 
ago, and still does, that it is in contact with Iraq; or by the 
United States to which Baghdad had previously relayed its desire 
to contact Israel. Israel has determined that it is in its best 
interests to support Washington's "dual containment" policy 
towards both Iraq and Iran. The only distinction is that a 
dialogue between Washington and the regime in Tehran is not 
being spurned. 
  It behooves everyone to abandon those flights of fancy 
perpetuated by the Baghdad regime. The only practical long-range 
strategy to isolate fundamentalism and bolster the process of 
peace and security in the region can be provided only by an Iraq 
that derives its strength from a peaceful system of multipartite 
democracy.

<F P=106> [Article by Hani 'Abbas Ilyas Khidr al-Hadithi, Baghdad </F>
University: "Political Insights Into the Attitude of the 
Security Council"] 
  [Text] In the last few days, there has been a difference of 
opinion over new developments in the international [UN] Security 
Council [UNSC] regarding the continued economic sanctions on 
Iraq, especially after the council's failure to issue its usual 
statement. This was due to the differing points of view among 
the permanent member states over the nature of the statement, 
and the extent of Iraq's compliance with the Security Council's 
resolutions. 
  The question that must now be asked is related to the 
significance of this difference of opinion and its implications 
for the future. 
  In other words: do the permanent members have genuinely 
different interpretations in their common views, or have 
political fabrication and selfish interests led to this relative 
change? 
  We believe that the answer to this question is what defines 
the true worth of the UNSC's recent change. 
  First, we can see that Iraq's implementation of the Security 
Council resolutions and its genuine commitment to them has given 
an opportunity to the powers that so wish, to rectify the 
situation to reformulate a political view at variance to their 
unfair foreign policy conduct towards Iraq. Thus Iraq has set 
the scene for a new political course on their part. 
  As to the other powers, their political views and positions 
can be analyzed on the bases of crucial changes that have had an 
effect of their subsequent conduct. 
  With Russia, there is an objective fact that must be taken 
into consideration. It is the legacy of the Soviet Union, as 
well as a tsarist imperialist legacy, that has always played a 
distinct role in its international relations. History has 
inevitably left its mark on the role political powers play in 
the world. 
  One must note that communism, and the misery and official 
oppression it caused, led to a general stampede away from it and 
inability, after getting rid of its nightmares, to revert to a 
system capable of providing the minimum of humanity, freedom, or 
democracy. The nationalist factor began to play a more active 
role, pressuring and influencing Russian decisionmaking, and 
pushing it in the direction of restoring Russia's role in the 
former Soviet republics, based on Russia's restored standing as 
a superpower. This tendency was able to impose political 
settlements between President Yeltsin and the former leaders of 
the parliamentary opposition, accused of plotting against him. 
Thus this internal variable was bound to have an effect on 
Russia's external political policies. This has become clear in 
subsequent statements, not only in terms of Rssia's role as a 
global superpower, but also in terms of many international 
issues such as Yugoslavia and Iraq. 
  This should not cause us to ignore another basic and 
important factor: the economic factor. The collapse of economic 
growth has brought it back to zero, according to Gorbachev's 
statements, the basis and natural prelude to the retreat and 
collapse of the Soviet Union, both economically and politically. 
Hence, the economic pressure, in the form of covetousness and 
intimidation not only on the part of the United States, but also 
on the part of its Gulf regimes, through bribery. And yet the 
position is still suspended between Russian readiness to 
persevere in strategic order, or submitting to the strict 
measures, which the last two years have not appeared feasible 
for the Russian economy. 
  As to France, it has long had a deeply rooted tendency 
towards independence; here we must recall that France deserves 
the greatest credit for calling for European unity. Its plan 
with Germany after World War II, in 1951, specifically, to 
establish an iron and steel joint venture, marked the beginning 
of the European bloc that led to the European Common Market, and 
the movement to form a federal European bloc. 
  It was also natural that France, and Germany as well, should 
continue their joint efforts in this plan; and it was also 
natural that Britain should find the object of its dreams in the 
United States, which saw, in European unity, a threat to its 
ambitions to build a monopolar new world order. 
  Thus there were special circumstances and causes for the 
French alignment with the United States in the aggression on 
Iraq, but this situation will not necessarily continue, due to 
the profound disparity in the political course, which France has 
previously strengthened by withdrawing from the military 
committee of the Atlantic alliance, and reaffirming the French 
nuclear umbrella to guarantee French-European security. France 
also refused to subject its nuclear capability to the nuclear 
arms limitation talks between the United States and the former 
Soviet Union. 
  This gives France credibility in its different 
interpretation 
from the United States, if we assume France's return to its 
common "strategic" view, giving it ample opportunity to achieve 
its interests in Iraq and the Arab region, and throughout the 
Middle East, contrary to American hegemony and subjugation to 
the United States. 
  This leaves us the Chinese position, which is influenced by 
three basic variables: 
  The problem of Taiwan, and China's wish to gather American 
support for restoring it to mainland control; the question of 
its continuing to enjoy most favored nation trading status, 
which enables it to to take advantage of Western, especially 
American, aid and technology, to modernize the Chinese economy; 
and the Hong Kong problem, which is directly connected to 
Britain, as negotiations are still ongoing, and sometimes 
difficult, on its return to China in 1999. And there is the 
issue of America's pressure on Britain, for good or ill. 
  These strategic issues face China, which finds that its 
abilities, in light of the collapse of global equilibrium in 
favor of the United States, do not allow it to resist American 
pressure. And yet it has not forgotten its program, which relies 
on a combination of socialist thought and China's cultural 
heritage. Its ambitions as a superpower have significant 
interests throughout Asia, chiefly, and in the world. It is 
entitled to confirm the well-known Chinese wisdom between 
practical reality and future aspitations. Thus in the Security 
Council it has abstained from voting on the criminal resolutions 
against Iraq, to give itself a special attribute, setting itself 
apart from the other permanent members. 
  It appears that China is still waiting for its chance, and 
the right time, to voice its opinion on global issues of 
importance, especially since China considers itself a superpower 
defending the rights of the states of the South (the Third 
World) and an Asian power, which is an alternative to the former 
Soviet role, and a competitor to Japan in southeast Asia, and 
Asia as a whole. 
  The history of China shows that its leaders know how to be 
patient and wait for long periods, and because of this China can 
find, in any international change affecting the rebalancing of 
global relations, a way in which to serve its own interests. 
Perhaps in what preceded there is a convincing explanation for 
its standing beside Russia and France in having views different 
from those of the United States and Britain. 
  Based on this, common strategic assumptions lead one to say 
that persisting in these positions will lead in the future not 
only to helping Iraq's position in the Security Council, but 
also to an important tendency restoring global relations to 
equilibrium and stability, incompatible with absolute American 
hegemony. And in any case this may be a relative balance in 
which economic, technological, and military capabilities can 
impose their will in defining this relativity. 
  We still have an important question: will the United States 
allow these powers to profit from this "gap," to accomplish what 
they want? 
  I believe that it is useful to say that the United States 
may 
find itself in a course with these powers to prevent them from 
achieving their interests at the expense of the United States. 
Thus the world may see numerous changes in global policy, but in 
the end they will favor the balance of global relations, even if 
it is an exploration of a historic era, with the logic of nature 
prevailing. 
  Putting aside the extent of disparity in interpretations 
among the Security Council's permanent members over Iraq's 
cooperation and readiness to end or ease the unjust sanctions on 
our people, there remains an important question before 
us--specifically, before Iraqi diplomacy: what to do? 
  We think that the present position requires profound 
analysis 
by relevant specialists who find that their options are limited, 
and that political acumen is needed to identify them. None of 
these options should be ignored in order to complete the 
comprehensive and genuine story as a basis that is indispensable 
in choosing the best alternative. The first vital conditions 
required by that are accurate information, time, steadiness, and 
decisiveness. 
  This means necessarily not giving any chance, however small, 
to our enemy, for him to exploit in an attempt to reassemble 
opposition to Iraq. This means, in result, delicate control of 
media policy, to say nothing of official political statements 
going in only one direction, and this is a service to 
rationality and goal of political decisionmakers. 
  This is in domestic terms, which require the preparation of 
careful and balanced plan of action, making media policy 
comparable to foreign policy. Thus it is necessary for Iraqi 
minds to take part in the discussion and prepare this plan of 
action. 
  In terms of policy abroad, we believe that foreign events 
that may appear positive, however small or minor, require a 
positive reaction, not proportional to the event but surpassing 
it in positivity. 
  This does not mean that Iraqi action must constituute mere 
reaction to action abroad; it should move from a state of 
inaction to one of action. This action should take concrete form 
and be used it at the highest levels. The policy should be put 
to use in influential global quarters, secretly or openly, as 
circumstances require. Popular diplomacy--quasi-official or 
party-level diplomacy--can play an ancillary role here, but it 
is not necessarily the means intended to take over the basic, 
effective policy. 
  What we need to do is assess the policy by its outcome; 
assess profits and losses with extreme care, in action and 
struggle, so that positive and impressive events will 
accumulate; and accept some losses, perhaps as a necessary 
condition, as we know that these events may lead to changes that 
can help to rebuild the new world order.

<F P=106> [Report from Kuwait: "Kuwaiti Government Unaware of the </F>
Magnitude of General Fiscal Crisis in the Country"] 
 &lt;{txt&gt; [Text] The al-Shall economic office in Kuwait noted in its 
weekly report that nearly 63 percent of all debtors secured 
their debt balances with amounts totalling some 5.375 billion 
dinars [KD]. The report also pointed to joint responsibility for 
Kuwait's foreign investment scandals and emphasized that, those 
calamities notwithstanding, certain principals are still 
occupying leadership positions in the management of foreign 
investments. 
  The report underscored the "lack of government awareness of 
the magnitude of the general fiscal crisis" and noted that some 
90 percent of oil revenues anticipated in the new budget will be 
expended on salaries whereas about 59 percent is earmarked for 
military outlays, foretelling of substantial future deficits. 
Following is the text of the report: 
<H5>  Underperforming Debt </H5>
  A majority of deputies does not wish to amend Law 41/93, 
which governs underperforming debts, according to the secretary 
of the Public Funds Guardian Committee. We also believe this to 
be the assembly's sentiment. Several ministers have expressed 
the government's desire to amend the underperforming debt law 
but have not made it clear whether the desired amendments would 
cover fiscal matters or procedural aspects. We believe that the 
government would face a serious conflict with the assembly 
should it propose to postpone the instantaneous settlement 
deadline, extend the rescheduling period from 12 to 20 years, or 
even merely indicate that it would consider payment in kind. 
  The governor of the Central Bank of Kuwait was quoted as 
saying that 3,174 clients, or 33 percent of the original 9,523 
or so, have already secured their settlements. We assume that 
some 2,783 others have settled instantaneously in response to 
the law and there was no reason to secure their settlements. 
This means that some 5,957 clients, or about 63 percent of total 
debtors, have responded to the law. They accounted for about 
KD5.375 billion in accumulated debt, or 96 percent of the 
KD5.591 billion in combined original debt. Those figures 
generally agree with a previous finance minister's statement 
that about 6,000 clients have responded to the law. The finance 
minister added, however, that those who did not respond have 
combined balances of some KD900 million, leaving a difference of 
about KD216 million in the balances of those who responded to 
the law and whose who did not. This difference is explained by 
the fact that the acquired debt balance is higher than the 
balance of debt instruments because of bank discounting and the 
possible inclusion of other types of debt. 
  It would have been incumbent upon the Central Bank of Kuwait 
and the Ministry of Finance to divulge the balance of acquired 
debt and to reveal its components. 
<H5>  Oil Investments </H5>
  Reports by the Audit Bureau, a public oversight agency, on 
correcting the investments of the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation 
are being published in a local newspaper. Those reports have 
been overdue for 10 years during which the public treasury 
incurred huge losses. Nevertheless, they are a healthy outcome 
of the separation of the branches of governance and indicate the 
restoration of a degree of respect for the law and for oversight 
agencies. The oil investments case is almost an exact duplicate 
of Kuwait's foreign direct investments case, both of which are 
currently under investigation by the general prosecutor's office 
as well as by the British and Spanish court systems. They are 
also quite similar to the oil tanker case, which is also before 
the courts in Kuwait. A single team seems to be fully or 
partially responsible for all cases from the Santa Fe case to 
the Spanish incident to the British Petroleum deal to the 
remittances made during the occupation period and its aftermath. 
  The Audit Bureau's reports underscore the pattern of 
misconduct itself--i.e., purchases made without the benefit of 
serious prior studies; purchases at above going prices; direct 
funding support of projects in which they got themselves 
entangled; disregard for the constitution and other laws when 
providing guarantees and loans, the creation of phantom 
companies and tampering with financial books, and the founding 
of certain firms at the expense of others. 
  The same team remains in positions of management in spite of 
poor financial performance and the lack of periodic due 
diligence by the parent organization, which failed to take 
meaningful corrective steps either because of hurried meetings 
of because of buck passing. Those policies and decisions went 
unchallenged by the Supreme Petroleum Council and the cabinet 
either because they were not deemed important or because of 
over-confidence and of allowing personal considerations to 
outweigh the fundamentals of public administration. 
  The Audit Bureau's reports are not all out yet but they 
indicate losses in the billions of dollars on top of foreign 
investment losses. This is something that should be given 
attention and adequate consideration, as a profound lesson if 
nothing else. Those reports, which are no doubt being 
scrutinized by government, should be studied by relevant 
National Assembly committees as well. 
  Politics aside, it must be emphasized once again that all of 
us without exception have been victimized by such misconduct. 
<H5>  The General Budget </H5>
  We reported two weeks ago that new 1994/95 budget figures 
released by the government show expenditures of KD4.390 billion 
against revenues of KD2.537 billion, of which oil revenues 
account for KD2.235 billion or 88 percent. 
  The new budget figures therefore indicate a budget deficit 
of 
KD1.853 billion, compared with a deficit of KD1.223 billion 
estimated for the current 1993/94 fiscal year. The deficits for 
the current and upcoming years are comparable when the impact of 
added defense expenditures is excluded. 
  We also previously noted that the proposed budget was no 
accomplishment and that it is antithetical to last January's 
recommendations by the Ministry of Finance. We further noted 
that the budget did not reflect a true picture of the country's 
fiscal position next year because it was not comprehensive and 
its forecast of the country's fiscal position did not go beyond 
one fiscal year. 
  Preliminary figures indicate that new budget allocations for 
wages and salaries may be as high as KD2.011 billion, as opposed 
to published estimates of KD1.144 billion, after adding salary 
allocations for subsidiaries (KD211 million), autonomous 
agencies (about KD338 million) and salaries for the military 
(KD318 million). The figure accounts for about 90 percent of 
estimated oil revenues and for about 79 percent of total 
anticipated revenues. The government employs about 97 percent of 
the Kuwaiti labor force outside the military sector. 
  Defense outlays are estimated at about KD980 million or 
approximately 44 percent of total oil revenues forecast. 
Allotments for the Interior Ministry and the National Guard 
would raise anticipated defense outlays to about KD1.325 
billion, or 59 percent of total estimated oil revenues. It is to 
be noted, however, that military salaries are included in the 
general allocations for both defense and wages and salaries and 
the duplication should be corrected. 
  There is little chance of directly containing wages and 
salaries expenditures in the short-term but this is not the case 
with defense outlays if alternatives were considered without 
sensitivities or pressure. 
  The new budget allows only KD220 million to cover interest 
due on Treasury notes and bonds with no provision for interest 
due on underperforming loans or on foreign debt. The Kuwaiti 
prime minister is said to have requested expeditious 
ratification of outlays for state acquisition of private real 
estate. If true, this would be another indication of the lack of 
government recognition of the magnitude of the general fiscal 
crisis. 
  As to revenues, the government adjusted its oil revenue 
forecasts in the new budget downward from $15 to $12 per barrel. 
It had proposed a downward adjustment last January to $10.5 per 
barrel but no change was made in the dollar exchange rate, which 
remained at 299 Kuwaiti fils. Expected oil revenues consequently 
declined by some $185 million, about 7.6 percent, even though 
production was estimated to expand by about 11 percent or 
200,000 barrels per day.

<F P=106> [Article by editor in chief, Hasan Sabra] </F>
  [Text] It is not unusual for President Hafiz al-Asad to 
receive his official guests early in his office at Tishrin 
Palace. But Dennis Ross, the U.S. coordinator of Arab-Zionist 
negotiations, was set to meet the president at 1100 on 
Wednesday, 23 March 1994. However, the appointment was moved 
back to 0800, because President al-Asad would be going directly 
to the airport after receiving Ross to fly in his private plane 
to al-Qardahah. There, he was to find his distinguished family 
waiting to accompany him to the grave of his late son, Basil, to 
read the Surat-al-Fatihah [the opening passage of the Koran] for 
Basil's virtuous soul. This occurred on Basil's 32d birthday, 
the first at which he would not be present. 
  Basil's father opened his hands toward the sky, reading the 
Surat-al-Fatihah, praying for mercy for his eldest son's soul. 
He then murmured an apology to his son, Bashshar, for his late 
arrival at the grave to commemorate his son Basil, now under 
God's protection, two months and one week after Basil's 
departure to his maker. The meaning of the garden of eternity is 
that, after death, one is reborn in the hands of God. 
  No one except for his family saw al-Asad's tears, shock, and 
emotion as he stood, head bowed, his eyes fixed on the ground, 
as if he were reading there the phrase of [the Syrian poet] 
Abu-al-'Ala': "Tread lightly. The ground, I believe, is composed 
but of these bodies." 
  Dr. Bashshar accompanied his father back to the car, which 
would take them to their home, so that he could hear from the 
president what the premature spirit of responsibility had placed 
upon his shoulders following his older brother's death. 
  Al-Asad's sons had perceived their brother Basil's 
shouldering of responsibility upon their father's direction. 
They had overflowed with happiness over the eldest son's 
preparation for assuming responsibility based on his worthiness, 
competence, enterprising spirit, initiative, excellent 
reputation, rectitude, and noble character--characteristics that 
honored the family. Each son had devoted himself to his work and 
independently chosen post, satisfied and confident. Bashshar's 
hobby and passion has been ophthalmology, which he began 
studying at the University of Damascus. He excelled in this and 
then went on to continue his specialization in London. The other 
son, Mahir, joined the armed forces, where he distinguished 
himself for his bravery, which is not unusual for the al-Asad 
family. 
  However, the trusteeship fell upon Bashshar and his hobby 
and 
academic studies. 
  Major Basil al-Asad was killed on the morning on which he 
had 
been scheduled to meet his brother Bashshar in London. Basil had 
been en route to the Damascus Airport to fly on a civilian plane 
to Germany and then to London to meet his brother Bashshar. But 
fate was faster than the speed with which Basil drove the car. 
"We are nearer to you than the jugular vein." "It is but like 
lightning." 
  Bashshar was notified of the need to interrupt his studies 
in 
London to go to Damascus before President al-Asad learned of his 
eldest son's death. Bashshar had called his father from London 
to ask him why he had been summoned to Damascus at daybreak on 
that densely foggy London morning. Bashshar had made that call 
before the president received another telephone call from two 
officials in the capital, Lieutenant General Hikmat al-Shihabi 
and Lt. Gen. Mustafa Talas, who had asked to see the president 
on that tragic morning. The president/father made a connection 
between the two calls. He asked the two officials: Did something 
happen to Basil, oh my God. The father's heart and feelings told 
him that something awful had happened to his son, whom he knew 
was to have left for Europe on a plane. 
  Yes, Basil has passed on. 
  And Bashshar came to Damascus to bear responsibility. 
<H5>  The Intelligentsia's Questions </H5>
  When news of Basil al-Asad's death became known, the hearts 
of millions in the Arab world, specifically in Syria and 
Lebanon, trembled in anxiety and grief, as never before, over 
the loss of this young public servant. Their political and 
emotional sympathy stemmed from the pain, which they felt over 
the loss of a young politician considered a model of responsible 
youth, and from the fact that he was the son of a leader to whom 
millions have given their trust out of love and conviction, even 
after that leader had made difficult decisions, which might not 
have been popular at first (e.g., his historical, strategic 
positions regarding Lebanon and the Gulf). 
  This sad public consensus was the outcome of a previous 
poll, 
which paid homage to Basil in the presence of his father, may 
God prolong his life. When Basil left to be at God's side, the 
people wanted to tell al-Asad that their homage to Basil stemmed 
primarily from their homage to al-Asad and from al-Asad's trust 
in Basil, trust that reflected the people's trust in this 
promising young man. 
  When Basil died, the people saw that a dream of the leader 
had been buried, and that the dream goes beyond the strictly 
human aspect to the political continuity that President al-Asad 
found embodied in his eldest son, and that he mentioned with 
each step taken by Basil in his youth. 
  Continuity in any regime, especially after it has been 
established and tested, safeguards the accomplishments that that 
regime achieved in the period of its establishment and testing. 
The Syrian regime is the creation of al-Asad's hands, effort, 
intellect, and calculations. It is Hafiz al-Asad's regime in 
every sense of the word. If we now wish to assess this regime, 
we have only to look at Syria's position on the political map of 
the Arab east, the Arab world, and the world. It is no surprise 
that, according to the assessment of the majority of prominent 
Western political writers, Hafiz al-Asad is one of the most 
skillful politicians of this era, and Syria has been at the acme 
of its role and radiance in al-Asad's era. The man acknowledges 
his stature modestly, confidently, and with the strength of 
character of an enlightened person. He allowed his eldest son to 
become familiar with the regime's intricacies and role by 
serving as a model father, distinguished political and strategic 
leader, and brilliant political visionary. 
  Basil's father was correct to think well of Basil. Hafiz 
al-Asad was truly proud of his son and the effort made by his 
son, who spared no action or skill for the sake of success. 
  Basil's success was a guarantee of continuity in the sense 
that we have depicted above. With Basil gone, the hope is that 
Bashshar will take up the banner. 
  Some of the intelligentsia have questioned, publicly and 
perhaps privately, the advantage and rightfulness of a son 
succeeding his father in a republican, presidential system. They 
have also asked whether the opportunity, circumstances, and 
superior effectiveness of Basil guaranteed continuity, and 
whether this means that Bashshar can embody the same continuity! 
  Some have posed these questions based on their fundamental 
opposition to hereditary succession in a republican, 
presidential system. Others have asked them based on their 
criticism of al-Asad's regime and their objection to its 
foundation. 
  However, we examine this question from a different, 
objective 
angle in this quickly compiled report. We maintain that the 
issue of who was to succeed Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir was earnestly 
and agonizingly posed during two historical stages in the life 
of Egypt and the Arabs after the death of that Arab leader. 
  The first was immediately after Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir's death, 
when Anwar al-Sadat assumed power in his capacity as the vice 
president temporarily on 28 September 1970. 
  The second was after Anwar al-Sadat's coup against 
'Abd-al-Nasir's regime on 13 May 1971. 
  We were in the prime of life. Everyone's deepest anxiety 
after 'Abd-el-Nasir's death concerned the search for continuity. 
Some of us had delusions about 'Abd-al-Nasir's institutions 
serving as the basis for continuity. These institutions included 
the Arab Socialist Union with its pioneering organizing work, 
legislative and executive organizations, the security and 
intelligence agencies, the armed forces, the Interior Ministry, 
and the information agencies. These institutions were supposed 
to have filled the vacuum. 
  The popular sentiment--and I am closer to party restraint, 
ideological inquiry, philosophy, and theorization--was 
autocratical. The people asked, why Anwar al-Sadat? Where are 
the sons of Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir? Where is Khalid 
['Abd-al-Nasir's son]? 
  We laughed at the "naivete" of the people's questions. We 
maintained that continuity lay in organization, institutions, 
and.... However all of this collapsed suddenly in one cunning 
coup engineered by Anwar al-Sadat, a man who turned his back on 
all institutions and was able to arouse the people's emotions 
with several slogans, in the absence of any role for his rival, 
'Abd-al-Nasir's lieutenants. Al-Sadat filched power, and our 
theorizing proved wrong. The people's intuition remained more 
reliable. Why is it that Khalid 'Abd-al-Nasir did not succeed 
his father and take power? 
  The answer is that 'Abd-al-Nasir did not prepare any of his 
sons for power. Moreover, he did not permit any of them to 
engage in political activity. He did not place them in any 
organizational, institutional, security, or military cadre. They 
learned only those military matters learned by other compulsory 
conscripts. 'Abd-al-Nasir had his opinion regarding this 
exclusion. 
  'Abd-al-Nasir died, and power was transferred to 
institutions. A man named Anwar al-Sadat came and stole the 
government, imprisoning everyone, including the institutions. If 
only there had been a moment of regret. 
  Hafiz al-Asad did not exclude his children from politics. 
Rather, they have been immersed in political activity their 
entire life, since their earliest awareness. As a head of state, 
he provided them with everything that can benefit them in their 
political training, fundamental orientation, knowledge of 
secrets, and knowledge of the shortest, soundest routes to sound 
decision making and logical thinking. 
  Hafiz al-Asad did well to find someone who shared his home, 
dining table, and the corners of his office with whom he could 
debate and discuss the issues based on love, without hypocrisy, 
fawning, fear, dread, hesitation, or calculations. Leaders 
throughout the ages have tended to develop such relationships. 
The almighty God addressed his most noble, Arab Prophet, God 
bless him and grant him salvation, about bringing hearts 
together and about those whose hearts are bought with money. 
  There is thus nothing strange in Basil being the main person 
with whom his father could be open and candid and with whom he 
could examine the issues without having to be calculating. Why 
should Bashshar not play the same role? No one in the world can 
for a moment doubt Hafiz al-Asad's good education and guidance 
of his children. 
  If it was fortuitous that a difference in age briefly 
granted 
continuity to the martyr Basil, it was also fortuitous that fate 
itself granted continuity to Dr. Bashshar after his older 
brother's death. 
<H5>  As for Now </H5>
  I have been leading up to Bashshar. From the very outset, 
this young man has possessed the basic elements that embody 
continuity. 
  In his first meeting with Lebanese President Ilyas 
al-Hirawi, 
Bashshar made an outstanding impression on the president with 
his incisive personality, disciplined spirit, and scientific 
mind. 
  Bashshar came to the Guest Palace to meet President 
al-Hirawi, who had personally asked to meet him--after he left 
his camp for his home to put on his civilian clothes--in order 
to address him confidentially and to give him an attentive 
audience, a primary characteristic of success being that one 
excel at listening before excelling at speaking. 
  Those who know the two brothers say that Basil was both shy 
and self-confident, and that Bashshar is bold and decisive. 
  It thus comes as no surprise to see the continuation of the 
Basil's course of pursuing violators of the law and smugglers of 
narcotics and goods over the Lebanese-Syrian border, without 
hesitation and tirelessly with respect to narcotics dealers. 
  Perhaps the most curious incident seen by the security 
agencies in the Lebanese governorates of al-Biqa' and al-Shamal 
[North Lebanon] is the following: On the evening of 17 January 
1994, two days after Basil's death, a Lebanese security officer 
received a report over the radio about three smuggling and 
kickback operations in Tripoli. His first comment when he heard 
the report was, "What has broken loose? The man [Basil] has been 
gone only two days." 
  However, the security officer regained his composure after 
Dr. Bashshar took up his responsibilities. He no longer reads in 
the security reports anything to the effect that anything has 
changed in Basil's absence, for Bashshar represents continuity.

  [Text] New Delhi, April 18 (PTI)--The Prime Minister, Mr 
P.V. Narasimha Rao, today stoutly defended the signing of the 
GATT treaty by India, asserting that on-slaughts against the 
government for taking this step would certainly be warded off. 
  "We are now under attack for doing that. But with the 
cooperation, with the corroboration of scientists and 
economists, we would certainly ward off these attacks," he said 
while apparently referring to opposition criticism to India 
being a signatory to the GATT treaty. 
  Speaking at a function after presenting the G.D. Birla award 
for scientific research for 1993, to Dr R.A. Mashelkar and 
Shankar Puraskar to Prof Raghuvansh, he said integration of 
trade with the world economy had to be total. 
  "If it has to be total, we have to show our talent as being 
second to none. Our people have gone abroad, they are working 
there. For decades and decades, they have brought laurels to the 
countries where they are working. But here in the country, we 
seem to be diffident. This diffidence has to go," he said. 
  The Prime Minister observed that what was needed in the new 
context of integration was "a new morale, a high morale on the 
part of everyone in this country which is transmitted to the 
last person." 
  He said if the people themselves were not given the morale 
that was needed, then neither the scientist could help nor the 
person working behind the scenes or behind the walls of the 
laboratory could help. 
  He said, "what is happening today is just to demoralise the 
last person, the common man in this country, I am sorry to say, 
that is not on." 
  Referring to the scientist's observation that the 
liberalised 
programme and the integration of Indian economy with world 
economy meant nothing if it was not accompanied by a similar 
integration of science and technology here with the science and 
technology that was available anywhere in the world, Mr Rao said 
"I feel very happy that something which we started two and a 
half years ago stands vindicated." 
  The Prime Minister said Indian people have shown their 
talent, their eminence in every field--science, art, philosophy, 
etc. 
  "You have no right to put them under the lid and say you 
shall be backward, you shall remain backward all the time and 
that national planning will be based on the fact that you are 
going to be backward. We are afraid of patents, we are afraid of 
competition, we are afraid of everything. This will not do," he 
observed. 
  Technology has to be fashioned out of science which means 
money, capital and organisation, he said. "These are things that 
are waiting to be done. The original spark is already there and 
it is going to grow." 
  Urging the scientists to speak up, he said the message had 
to 
be effectively conveyed to the common man. "If I speak, they 
will take me as a politician." 
  The Prime Minister congratulated the G.D. Birla Foundation 
for having instituted these awards for those making outstanding 
contributions in various fields.

<F P=106> [Article by Arun Shourie: "We Need to Face GATT With an Open </F>
Mind"] 
  [Text] The Americans have a term for it, IRI, which stands 
for instant rejection instinct. Whenever a new idea is 
presented, especially if it calls for changes, we instinctively 
jump up to dismiss it. 
  Our intelligence works to make this tendency stronger. We 
suddenly create a network of aspects that would be adversely 
effected by the new idea. After visualizing all those 
possibilities, this proclivity is further strengthened. The 
whole burden of proving something is put on the person who had 
proposed the change with, "What proof do you have of the 
benefits of this idea? What guarantee is there that A or B or C 
will not be decreased?" 
  The result is further helped by another habit that we have 
adopted. We begin to look for various principles behind every 
bush even when we do not follow these principles in our own 
lives. The less our leaders or commentators know about that 
subject--new technology, patents, for example--the more these 
basic principles they try to apply. 
  While looking for these theories, which we insist that we 
must fully explore before we put them to practice, we do not 
think about any restrictions or morals. We drag in unrelated and 
far-fetched ideas whenever we can. For example, during the 
recent campaign against Dunkel [GATT proposals], efforts were 
made to convince some chief ministers to take this issue to the 
Supreme Court. This is a strange argument. The argument is that 
although the Center has the right to have treaties, it cannot 
have a treaty which effects areas that are under the state list 
in the Constitution. Can the Center agree to a treaty which 
affects the basic form of the Indian Constitution? You can 
imagine the questions that will be raised: The form of 
autonomous union, what is it? What is the difference between the 
Indian union and other nations? If it is different, then how 
much so? What is its power to have treaties? How appropriate is 
the state list in the 7th article of the Constitution? 
  Then, of course, there are the moral questions which we 
never 
forget. Is it appropriate that meals be patented? Is it 
appropriate that life be patented? Are not there contradictions 
in these words? Is it not the lowest deterioration brought about 
by capitalism? How can you treat intelligence as a commodity? 
  Two results are clear. The debate is stretched into such 
questions that one gets farther and farther from the issue under 
debate and time is wasted. 
  If we move on Dunkel following our usual method, we will be 
entangled in spiritual questions while the others are taking 
over patents. 
  Supplementary Specialties: These bad results become even 
more 
complex because of the special skills that our intellectuals, 
bureaucrats, and politicians share. 
  The question has not even been raised and we announce our 
overstated attitude. This is neither a yes nor a no and the 
negative or positive aspects of the issue do not affect either 
of these responses; it is our stand compared to the other party 
that decides it. If we are in the government, we say yes and if 
we are in the opposition, we will scream no. We would have 
embraced this idea gladly if we were sitting on the government 
side. This tendency works in the minds of people on each side. 
If our opponent says yes, we scream no. If the opponent is 
taking a moderate stand, we will declare our stand to be clear, 
unambiguous, and bold. 
  We not only adopt exaggerated attitudes, but also take 
aggressive and extremist stands. Sit-ins, rallies, and demands 
to do-or-die become a daily occurrence in no time. All this 
happens even before one of the sides tries to explore the issue 
further. Once we adopt that attitude, it is natural that we kick 
out facts that create doubts. We rush to the facts or arguments 
that strengthen our stand. 
  In addition, we do not examine that "fact" or argument; we 
just throw it in the air and run with it. I had given a strange 
example of criticizing Dunkel earlier. Making the period of a 
patent 20 years (our present law allows a patent to be effective 
from 7 to 14 years), will force us to pawn ourselves to 
multinational companies for longer periods. This is unfair and 
would be hard to bear in this period of fast changing 
technology. A little thinking can show that the logic works for 
the other side. Since technology changes fast, there will be 
less effect of a longer period for a patent, because a new 
product will leave the patented item behind. 
  Another strong but curious example emerges in this debate. 
Advocating the implementation of the rights to intellectual 
property more strictly, the United States and other countries 
emphasized that this is because manufacturing companies spend a 
lot of money on new drug and inventions. We argued (for example 
in the book, Intellectual Property Rights Flawed), that 
invention of new drugs does not really cost much since the U.S. 
drug companies charge 35 percent profit over their cost. 
However, it means that if it does not cost as much as we are 
told then we can also try to invent those drugs by spending less 
money. 
  Then there is the sickness of forgetting. We suddenly forget 
the argument that we gave only yesterday, and begin to advocate 
something entirely different just because the new argument 
protects us from change. Until yesterday, the Indian drug 
industry was the villain in this story. Its picture was 
presented in such a way that all government efforts to formulate 
a new drug price policy were wasted. This was the industry that 
was trapping us into its system of poisonous, harmful, and 
addicting drugs. This was also the industry that was cutting us 
off from our medical heritage--the Ayruvedic and Unani 
medicines--which are most beneficial and appropriate for us. The 
treatment and drugs in these systems agree with our bodies and 
habits. Since the ingredients for these drugs were collected 
from jungles, the aborigines also benefitted from them. 
Suddenly, all this is forgotten now. Now the argument is that 
Dunkel is dangerous because it will hinder Indian drug industry 
from competing with its Western counterparts. Until 15 December, 
it was said in the arguments related to GATT that many awful 
things will happen if the agreement is not amended. A 
destructive trade war will start and so forth. The agreement was 
not even signed and we started to express opposing fears in our 
debates how signing it would cause catastrophes. 
  Therefore, I not only look for the instinct with which I 
began this article but also for another staple habit: It is our 
hobby to worry about one or the other thing. 
  Our opposition parties oppose every position that our 
government takes and reduce the possibility of any astute debate 
on that issue and the government, by not sharing facts with the 
people, reduce this opportunity for debate even further. The 
Indian representatives tried hard to get some of the provisions 
during the discussions on Dunkel changed. However, they gave up 
this struggle last March. It was possibly done after we saw that 
no one supported us, but this change in stand was never 
explained to us. Now when the government says that we have been 
forced to agree with everyone because we had isolated ourselves 
in the past, it appears to justify something after it has 
already happened. This impression is even further magnified 
because during this time the eardrums of people have been burst 
from all the noise they have been hearing about the accusation 
that the government is working under pressure from multinational 
companies, IMF, the World Bank (and we do not know what else). 
  What should we do? We have to pay a high price for this all. 
Since we adopt an exaggerated attitude--either yes or no--we 
never could even come close to those reforms which we could have 
implemented otherwise. Since we jump to adopt an attitude based 
on enmity--if someone supports something then I must oppose it. 
We lose the opportunity to benefit from those reforms which we 
could implement if we worked together. Because we take the path 
to violent activities in a hurry--do or die declarations, 
violence, and other such steps, moderate or middle-of-the-way 
solutions are pushed away from our reach. Our politicians' 
apathy toward general ideas and the weakness of the 
government--meaning weakness of the bureaucracy regardless of 
which party is in, the government--makes us lose access to those 
reforms which we could have had. 
  Therefore, to change things, we have to change our form of 
debates and discussions. Especially, we should: 

  -  Listen more to those who work than leaders and 
intellectuals. 
  -  Listen to those who have studied the issue and those who have 
special knowledge about it instead of the status-quo 
commentators, people actively looking for some issue, and 
people's politicians. 
  -  Investigate the subject methodically before deciding on a 
stand 
and understand "facts" and arguments thoroughly. 
  -  Instead of the quick jump to "yes" or "no", we should keep 
our 
minds open for moderate suggestions.

<F P=106> [Article by B. Sahay: "RSS To Stress `Swadeshi' Move"] </F>
  [Text] Patna, April 18--The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh 
(RSS) has decided not to give top priority to the agitation 
against the Dunkel draft in its programme of action for the 
present. Instead, it plans to accelerate the pace of the 
swadeshi movement in the country, the national RSS 
chief, Mr Rajendra Singh, told a crowded news conference here 
today. 
  He described the signing of the Dunkel draft as a symbol of 
economic slavery but said the RSS did not want to deploy its 
full strength to oppose it as the country was passing through 
more serious crises which warranted urgent solutions. Growing 
corruption and a marked deterioration had been causing immense 
harm to the country. The RSS would confront these problems at 
all levels in public life and the Swadeshi Jagaran Manch was 
educating the masses against these evils as well as helping to 
counter the dangers of economic slavery of the multinationals, 
he maintained. 
  Mr Singh reaffirmed RSS support to the Vishwa Hindu Parishad 
(VHP) for the liberation of Ayodhya, Kashi and Mathura. He, 
however, opined that the agitation for Kashi or Mathura should 
be taken up after the commencement of the temple construction 
work at the Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya. It would not be 
strategically befitting to open three fronts at a time. He said 
that even the socialist leader, the late Ram Manohar Lohia, had 
advocated the liberation of all these religious places while 
addressing the Ramayan Mela at Chitrakut in 1967-68. Mr Lohia, 
he recalled, had called for launching a civil obedience movement 
if the situation so warranted. 
  Replying to a question, Mr Singh denied that the RSS was 
opposed to Muslims. The RSS, he claimed, had always been trying 
to enthuse Muslims to join the shakhas but the 
response was very poor. Even those who joined shakhas 
had to withdraw themselves under pressure from leaders of their 
community. He, however, admitted that a handful of Muslim youths 
who had joined the shakhas at various places for a 
brief period were not attracted by the ideology of the RSS but 
by the morning drills and physical trainings. 
  Replying to another question, he alleged that Pakistan's 
Inter Service Intelligence (ISI) with the support of some 
traitors was trying to consolidate its foothold in different 
parts of the country. In Kashmir, the ultras had the support of 
some local disgruntled elements and hence the situation was 
explosive despite the best efforts from the Indian security 
forces, he said. 
  Mr Singh denied that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had 
been distancing itself from the RSS. But at the same time the 
RSS did not try to inject any political ideology into the BJP. 
Both the organisations were like-minded so far as the Hindutva 
and Swadeshi approach were concerned. The BJP, he said, was free 
to plan any action to confront the national issues including the 
Dunkel draft. The party looked upon the Ayodhya controversy as a 
national issue and never as a religious issue, he added. The 
pradesh RSS chief, Mr Krishna Ballabh Prasad Narayan Singh, was 
also present at the conference. 
  In Jammu, the RSS general secretary, Mr H.V. Sheshadri, 
today 
said his organisation will lend full support to the Dharam 
Sansad for starting a satyagraha if the Centre 
failed to hand over possession of the disputed land at Ram 
Janambhoomi site in Ayodhya soon. 
  Addressing a press conference here, Mr Sheshadri blamed the 
Narasimha Rao government for delaying a decision on the issue 
and of playing "vote bank politics."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Arjun-Rao Unannounced War Continues"] </F>
  [Text] Ever since Narasimha took over the reins of this 
country, Human Resources Development Minister Arjun Singh (who 
was a candidate for the prime minister's position) has been 
voicing his opposition to his performance very eloquently. Again 
and again, he does something or says such things that cause 
problems and worries for Narasimha Rao. On 20th April, while 
talking informally with the news media, he told them out of the 
blue, "The era when people caused problems between me and the 
prime minister has gone. It will not happen again. The problems 
that the ruling party and the nation are facing now are so 
serious that there is no room for such activities. 
  "There was a time when each word I uttered was 
misinterpreted and misunderstandings were created between us. 
However, from now on, these people will not get the opportunity 
to cause such disagreements between us. 
  "After the vidhan sabha elections in northern states, I had 
met the prime minister on my own and discussed the political 
scenario. I had told Mr. Rao directly that it did not matter 
what people said, I believed that it was not in anyone's 
interest to let such things go on and on. The prime minister had 
agreed with me in that meeting. I have also shared my feelings 
in the recent Congress high command meeting." 
  While Mr. Arjun Singh said this all, he also hinted that he 
disagreed over the GATT agreement, however, he was going to 
stand by whatever decision the Party makes. 
  It is especially important to mention here that Arjun 
Singh's 
opinion about GATT is his own and he had asked Prime Minister 
Narasimha Rao to call a meeting of all political parties to 
discuss GATT so that a national opinion can be formed. 
  When Arjun Singh was asked if he agreed with the government 
over GATT, he said that he was on one side in the cabinet 
decision and also did understand the meaning of "collective 
responsibility." The way Arjun Singh said that made it clear 
that he had his own opinions about GATT and several aspects of 
the economic policy. 
  When the correspondents asked Mr Arjun Singh if he supported 
the idea of knowing national opinion about GATT, he replied that 
we must look at his issue very carefully. We all have accepted 
the idea of liberalization and joining our economy with the rest 
of the world. India cannot survive in total isolation. 
Therefore, we have to develop standards keeping our nation's 
interests in mind. Can a person deny the fact that these 
standards should be collaborative and according to people's 
desires? 
  Mr. Arjun Singh said that he had suggested to Prime Minister 
Narasimha Rao before GATT was brought to debate in the 
Parliament to call a meeting of representatives of major 
political parties to form a consensus after listening to their 
ideas. However, this meeting could not be called in the time 
that was available. Mr. Arjun Singh used every word very 
cleverly and cautiously when talking about Mr. Narasimha Rao's 
efforts to call this meeting. 
  The reporters asked Mr. Arjun Singh why he did not defend 
the 
government over GATT in the Parliament. Mr. Singh presented a 
lengthy explanation. He said that an informal meeting of the 
central cabinet was held in the presence of Narasimha Rao on 28 
February 1994. It was said in that meeting that many people were 
raising "totally unrelated issues" to benefit politically. It 
was decided at that time to prepare brief responses to issues 
that were creating misunderstanding in order to share facts with 
the public. 
  Mr. Singh said that the prime minister asked him to prepare 
the list of these issues. After talking with the people who had 
something to say about these issues, he prepared a list of those 
issues according to his ability and sent to Commerce Minister 
Pranab Mukherji after the prime minister's approval. 
  Talking further, Mr. Singh said that when he returned from 
Egypt on 24 May [as published], he learned about the opinions of 
the commerce minister on each of those issues. At that time, it 
has been already decided to have special discussion on 29 March, 
however, it was not possible to call a meeting of all parties 
representatives during that time. It was very difficult for him 
to talk or discuss these issues in the Parliament because of 
these developments and because the people who had to say 
something about these issues were not contacted for their input. 
  Mr. Singh took the reporters back to the recent past and 
said 
that he was asked to chair the cabinet committee formed in 1992 
to review the Dunkel draft. This committee held some meetings 
and opinions of various groups and people was solicited as the 
issues included in this draft were very sensitive and important 
for our nation's future. This committee seeing the long-range 
implications of this issue, unanimously recommended that this 
whole issue should be debated in the Parliament and only then 
should the government make its decision. 
  All in all, Mr. Singh meant that by not getting opinions of 
the major political parties before signing the GATT agreement, 
the recommendation made by the cabinet committee was ignored. 
His statement, which was delivered in very careful words, has 
created a difficult situation for Narasimha Rao's government 
once again. Its proof is that clarification of this statement 
was requested in the Parliament yesterday and the government had 
to face embarrassment. 
  Instead of going into the details of GATT and Dunkel 
proposals or debating their appropriateness or unsuitability, it 
would not be out of context to mention here that no one can 
object to the idea of getting opinions from all major political 
parties as it is important to have national agreement over 
important national issues. However, the way he blows hot and 
cold in the same breath, talking about ending his differences 
with the prime minister, and then talking about ignoring the 
cabinet committee's recommendations is really amazing. This 
indicates that he has not changed his ways yet--his undeclared 
war against the prime minister is still going on. 
  As for difference of opinion, differences are an important 
part of the democratic process, however, there should be some 
principle about expressing differences. Any difference of 
opinion with the party or the government should be taken care of 
within those organizations. No one benefits when these 
differences are aired in public; instead, everyone gets hurt. 
  Anyhow, the way Arjun Singh has made contradictory 
statements 
at the same time has forced every intelligent person to wonder 
which one is right and which is wrong. The poet [Kabir] was 
right about Arjun Singh when he wrote, "God will not understand 
whatever he does."

<F P=106> [Article by Rajendra Dwivedi: "The Process of Polarization </F>
in the State Is Accelerating"] 
  [Text] The political turmoil in U.P. [Uttar Pradesh] for 
the last month indicates that political polarization is 
accelerating there. Usually, political polarization in a 
democratic country is considered a good sign. However, a large 
number of political parties does not prove to be good for 
democracy. 
  At present, there are two basic doctrines active in the 
state. One of these belongs to the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] 
and the second is espoused by the parties that accuse the BJP of 
creating religious factionalism in the nation. The 
representative or the leader of the second doctrine is the 
present Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav. The people 
subscribing to this school of thought do not want the BJP to 
emerge [from defeat] at any cost. That is why some of the 
parties that are not happy with Mulayam Singh are forced to 
support Mulayam Singh's government. 
  The week of 11 April appeared to be the week of competition 
for joining the Samajwadi Party (SP). Everyday, there were two 
announcements telling people who was joining the SP. Kunwar 
Rewati Raman Singh, former state leader and V.P. Singh's right 
hand, resigned from the Janata Dal and decided to join the SP. 
For the announcement, he called an "equality conference" on 11 
April. 
  Chief Minister Mulayam Singh welcomed them to his party and 
even called this "returning home." He said that the leaders who 
had decided to join the SP and fight for the principles it 
stands for will always be known as holy men. The BJP was accused 
of spreading religious factionalism and was greatly criticized 
in this conference. Chief Minister Yadav called the BJP militant 
for the first time. He said that there was no difference between 
the Kashmiri militant groups and the BJP that helped tear down 
the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya. 
  Kunwar Rewati Raman's "equality conference" was to begin on 
Monday, 11th April. Without any prior notice, the chief minister 
called a press conference at 1000. In this press conference, 
Ramawadhesh Singh, national president of the Lok Dal, announced 
his decision to join the SP. Mr. Ramawadesh Singh announced that 
he will formally merge the Lok Dal into the SP on 6 May in Patna. 
  Yadunath Singh, former state president of the Janata Dal 
(Ajit), also announced his decision to join the SP. Mr. Yadunath 
is very influential in the Mirzapur area. The next day, another 
meeting was arranged in Ravinderalya. The meeting was organized 
by Mittersen Yadav and Ram Chander Baksh Singh who were leaving 
the Communist Party of India to join the SP. One special aspect 
of this meeting was that they both had the blessings of veteran 
leader Dr. Z.A. Ahmed. The CPI [Communist Party of India] 
leaders who were joining the SP claimed that this meeting was 
the state level meeting of their party. They also claimed that 
the people who were present in that meeting represented 80 
percent of the CPI membership. 
  There are three CPI members in the Vidhan Sabha. If 
one-third 
of the total members desert, it is not called desertion, but 
division of the party. Mittersen Yadav took full advantage of 
this rule as he was one-third of the total! Mr. Uddal, the 
leader of the party in the Vidhan Sabha, strongly condemned this 
desertion, however, at the same time, he also said that he and 
his party will continue to support Mulayam Singh. 
  The same situation is of the Janata Dal. Ten legislators of 
the total 27 have left it to join the SP. According to political 
sources, six more legislators are ready to leave. The leaders of 
this party are very upset at this party hopping. However, they 
are helpless because of the political atmosphere of the state, 
will have to support Mulayam Singh's government. 
  The Congress (I) is even in worse condition than this. Its 
leaders strongly support the idea of backing Mulayam Singh. At 
the same time, they want to maintain their party's image as an 
opposition party in the Vidhan Sabha and in the Vidhan Parishad. 
Perhaps, that is why they showed so much anger as if he [Mulayam 
Singh] was going to uproot the government in the context of 
discussions on Mahatma Gandhi and Govind Ballabh Pant. They 
showed the same level of anger over the firing incident in 
Meerut and even threatened to resign from all the legislative 
committees. However, what happened today is what was going to 
happen. The government still has the Congress (I) support. The 
truth is that the Congress (I) not only supports the government 
in the Vidhan Sabha, but also acts as the "shock absorber" for 
it. No one attacks the BJP as fiercely as does Congress Party 
leader Pramod Tiwari. 
  Thus, the BJP is alone both within and outside of the 
legislative assembly, and the other parties are on the other 
side. This is the first step in the polarization process. We are 
waiting for the next step. 
  Now the question is: Why this sudden acceleration in this 
political polarization? If this had happened before the vidhan 
sabha elections, the political scene in the state would have 
been different. The political leaders who now consider 
themselves invincible and very powerful, would not have achieved 
this status. There is a lot of talk in political circles that 
Chief Minister Mulayam Singh wants to make himself strong by any 
means so that he does not have to depend on any other party, and 
he will Mulayam [mellow] in name only! He will become a powerful 
Singh [lion] when it comes to obeying his orders and following 
his principles.

<F P=106> [Article by Brijnandan Singh: "Will the By-Elections Change </F>
the Balance?"] 
  [Text] The Election Commission has decided the date for 
holding the vidhan sabha by-election in Uttar Pradesh [U.P.] The 
political corridor of the state started to buzz as soon as the 
election was announced and political activities are increasing 
as the election date approaches. All the political parties will 
try to test their strength in this by-election as this will be 
the first election since the November 1993 election that will 
show which party still has the hold on the people and which 
party is losing its support. 
  There were seven seats vacant in the state and the Election 
Commission is holding elections for six of these seats. The 
election for the remaining seat will be possible only after the 
Supreme Court issues its decision as several cases associated 
with this controversial district are being tried in the Supreme 
Court. The seven districts where elections are to be held are: 
Hastinapur (Meerut), Nidholikala, Kasganj (Eta district), 
Jaswant Nagar (Etawah district), Unnao (Unnao district), 
Manjhanpur (Allahabad district), and Gazipur (Gazipur district). 
The Commission has suspended the by-election in Jaswantnagar 
until the Supreme Court makes its decision. Therefore, at 
present election will be held only in six districts. Among 
these, Hastinapur (Meerut) and Manjhanpur (Allahabad) are 
reserved seats. 
  The most important election races will be in Nidholikala and 
Kansganj because the candidates who later became chief ministers 
had run for elections here and these seats were vacated because 
of their appointments. Present Chief Minister Mulayam Singh had 
run from Nidholikala and former Chief Minister Kalyan Singh from 
Kasganj. These chief ministers had run for election from other 
districts also and had to give up these seats because they had 
won there as well. The national working committee of the BJP 
[Bharatiya Janata Party] has decided that tickets for these 
seats will be issued to the same candidates who had ran for 
election here the last time and has decided the names of its 
candidates already. It will make the announcement after looking 
at the list of candidates running on the main rival, the SP-BSP 
[Samajwadi Party-Bahujan Samaj Party] coalition. If necessary, 
candidates may be changed in special situations. It is difficult 
to change candidates once the announcement has been made. 
Meanwhile, the names of SP-BSP coalition candidates have also 
been decided. According to their agreement, both BSP and SP will 
have candidates run in two constituencies. 
  The two major political parties of the state--the Congress 
and the Janata Dal--will not stay behind. They also consider 
these by-elections important. The Congress and the Janata Dal 
will also have their former candidates in those districts run 
again. However, both these parties need strong candidates with 
money and power behind them in Nidholikala and Kasganj 
districts. The Janata Dal will nominate Yadav candidates in both 
districts because they had Yadav candidates the last time also. 
Anil Yadav had run on the Congress ticket in Nidholikala last 
time, however, the Congress Party can also change its both 
candidates for the by-elections. 
  The Kasganj and Nidholikala districts are more important 
than 
others. The political situation in Nidholikala and Kasganj is 
very similar, because both districts are similar in size and 
population. The make up of voters is different. In Kasganj 
vidhan sabha district, there are 45,000 Lodhis, 18,000 Brahmans, 
20,000 Banias [trader caste], and the rest is made of other 
castes. The former Chief Minister Kalyan Singh had ran for 
election here keeping this distribution of voters in mind. 
Kalyan Singh was successful because all the votes of higher 
castes (Lodhi, Brahman, and Bania) went to him. Kalyan Singh got 
the Lodhi vote because of his caste, and Brahman-Bania votes 
because of his party. Kalyan Singh had won the election by 
45,000 votes. The remaining votes of Harijans, backwards, and 
Muslims were shared by all candidates. The number of these votes 
was small. 
  The voter distribution in Nidholikala is similar to Kasganj. 
The majority of voters (40,000) are Yadavs. There are 19,000 
Rajputs, and 10,000 Lodhis. The remaining votes are of other 
caste members. Mulayam Singh had run for elections considering 
the Yadav votes as his base. He was successful as he got 40,000 
Yadav and some Harijan and Muslim votes as well as 2,000 Lodhi 
votes. The specialty of these two seats and the two candidates 
was that both of them were candidates for chief ministership 
which helped them get the votes of their own caste as well as 
vote from support groups. The situation in these by-elections is 
very different. There is no chief minister aspirant who had put 
the caste pride in the hands of the voters of their own caste, 
which this had helped remove all in-fighting and differences. 
Those who were running for vidhan sabha seats could not raise 
any issue or slogan as caste was controlling everything here. 
  The caste will not control the election this time. The 
people 
will focus on development projects and issues, and will votes 
after analyzing the good and bad deeds of the government. The 
government has started some work to keep Harijans and Muslims 
happy. Recently, a confrontational situation had developed 
between the Harijans and the police over a statue of Amedekar. 
The state government transferred the police officers from 
Shergarhi police station and took over the task of installing 
the statue and finding land for it. 
  In order to charm the Muslim voters, the government changed 
the name of Kanpur village to Akbarpur. The people there were 
openly opposing it. The leaders of other parties complained that 
the government was changing names of places following the policy 
of appeasement in order to benefit in the by-election. The 
question is whether the Harijans will vote for the party in 
power again because the incidence of confrontation between the 
Harijans and other backward castes has increased after the 
SP-BSP government was installed. The Harijans have not forgotten 
it. The officials in the government media are also opposing the 
government's publicity methods.

<F P=106> [Article by R.C. Pandit: "Congress Party's Internal </F>
Dissatisfaction"] 
  [Text] The administrative style of Prime Minister Narasimha 
Rao, president of the Congress (I) Party, has sent forth a wave 
of dissatisfaction in the inner camp of the party. Some Congress 
leaders say that the party president has formed the policy 
according to the suggestions of his favorite people who have 
their own vested interests. They get the approval of the party 
president for whatever they want and use it for controlling 
state politics. This has resulted in mutual differences between 
all states from north to south and from east to west. In states 
where a party president must be elected, the reports presented 
by the committees and observation teams will get attention 
depending on the politics of the party president's favorite 
people who have the permission to stand around him. It would not 
be inappropriate to say that getting the favorable interest of 
these favored people is in the minds of all state party leaders 
and workers. It is said that if anyone takes the courage to say 
anything about these favored people, the party president without 
any investigation puts such a stamp on the campaigner that that 
person has no alternative but to remain silent in the future. 
However, the request made by 50 prominent Congress leaders in 
Bihar to the party president on 20 April to reorganize Bihar 
state's Congress Party structure and veteran Congress Leader Dr 
Jagan Nath Mishra's supporters's opposition to it illustrates 
the situation that has arisen in the inner camp of the party. 
The deputation of eight veteran leaders from Bihar that met with 
the prime minister reminded us of the forgotten fact that 
between 1990 and 1994 the state Congress (I) neither held a 
rally in Patna's Gandhi Maidan nor did the state party president 
travel at the district level to strengthen the party. Now that 
the committees' terms have ended on 14 April, many obstructions 
are seen in the path to obstruct those committees preparing for 
the next vidhan sabha elections. Now they are waiting for the 
prime minister's visit to Bihar on 30 April. According to 
sources close to the prime minister, Mr. Rao will be successful 
in controlling the situation there by making some important 
announcements during his visit. It is also possible that the 
prime minister will announce the establishment of Jharkhand 
independent federation and be successful in changing the image 
of his party. He has controlled the controversial situation in 
Bihar to an extent by inviting Dr. Jagannath Misra for talks in 
Delhi and also by including Ram Lakhan Yadav in the central 
cabinet. We cannot say how much wMr. Rao's quiet politics will 
be successful in U.P. [Uttar Pradesh] because the party 
position in U.P. is a lot worse than it is in Bihar. The result 
of this situation is seen in the recent vidhan sabha election. 
To control the situation, four powerful members of the Congress 
Party's central committee--Mr. Jaffar Sharif, Mr. Beant Singh, 
Mr. Venkataraman Swami, and Navalkishore Sharma--have been sent 
there to interview former legislators. Will all this information 
be presented to the party president accurately? There is also 
the fear that in any situation Mr. Rao will pay more attention 
to his favorite political advisors. Will the Congress workers 
from western U.P. and from other parts of the state have the 
freedom to express their feelings to the prime minister so that 
they can be brave like those eight members from Bihar were? The 
hardworking U.P. leaders who are spending the last part of their 
life in the capital say that the U.P. leaders have the tendency 
to bow down to the high command from the beginning. 
Traditionally, U.P. leaders have done whatever the high command 
had ordered them. The high command decision will be the same as 
his closer associates desire, because the central cabinet 
members who represent the U.P. Congress have developed the habit 
of not opposing any decision. According to political observers, 
the height of those who represent U.P. at the Center has 
diminished in the eyes of the prime minister. The remaining 
leaders from the state have either been expelled or have been 
silenced by awarding them with minor positions or have promised 
them such positions. They are all waiting to see who will be the 
president and whose luck will shine by getting one of the other 
vacant positions. Whatever the close associates of the party 
high command decide will be implemented. The politicians in the 
capital are expressing doubts about Congress Party (I) getting a 
new life in Bihar and U.P. because those who have damaged the 
party image do no seem to be interested in the future of the 
party. Why has work that was needed to be done in U.P. and Bihar 
been ignored for the last two years? The three powerful 
members--Madhavrao Scindia, K.C. Lekha, and Party General 
Secretary Scinde--who were sent to Himachal Pradesh, said that 
Chief Minister Virbhadar Singh should continue on in his two 
positions. It will depend on the high command whether or not the 
committee members will present their reports. The teams sent to 
Andhra Pradesh under the leadership of Chief Minister Vijay 
Bhaskar Reddy and composed of Ahmed Patel, Jagdish Titler, and 
Mrs. Kailashpati recommended that a president of the state 
Congress Party must be appointed, because former president 
Madren has been appointed the leader of the legislative group. 
The decision on a state party president should be made according 
to the report of this committee and the results of inquiry that 
is being made now. Who will that person be? The prime minister 
will have to decide that. A similar answer was given by the four 
members of the visiting team--Ramlakhan Singh Yadav, Sushil 
Kumar Scinde, Mohsina Kidwai and R.K. Dhawan--on return from 
Bhopal. They said, they have to go back again. Madhya Pradesh 
has a lot of support for such leaders as Madhav Rao Scindia, 
Vidhyacharan Shukla, Shyamcharan Shukla, Arjun Singh, and 
Digvijay Singh. It is very difficult to make a decision about 
this state, because the director of Madhya Pradesh leadership is 
in Delhi and whatever he wishes will probably will be approved 
by the high command. This is the situation in the Hindi-speaking 
states or the so-called Hindi Heartland. One can glimpse in 
Delhi what is happening to the party in southern states. The two 
factions of the party from Tamil Nadu are fighting with each 
other. The main reason for this dissension according to veteran 
party leaders is the policies adopted at the Center. The two 
groups are so lost in their fight that even Moopnar, the party 
leader, has failed to straighten out the situation. It is said 
that one Congress group supports Tamil Nadu's Chief Minister 
Jayalalitha and the other group opposes her. At present, they 
cannot decide whether to remove or keep Rama Murthy, the 
president of the Tamil Nadu Congress.

<F P=106> [Article by Safadder Rizwi: "Congress Is Again Involved in </F>
Exercise Drills for Garnering Muslims Votes"] 
  [Text] New Delhi, 29 April. The exercise drills to garner 
Muslim votes are increasing in the Congress Party now. This time 
around, they are trying to incarnate Ghulam Nabi Azad as the 
messiah of the Muslims. It is possible that Mr. Azad will be 
credited with the success in loosening the rules. This game will 
be played because the Muslims are upset. They will consider 
anyone who helps them rid of it their supporter. 
  In this exercise to bring Mr. Azad to the front, many 
veteran 
Muslim leaders have been pushed back. Salman Khursheed, Aslam 
Sher Khan, Tariq Anwar, P.M. Sayyed, C.K. Jaffer Sharif, Ahmed 
Patel, Ammar Rizwi, Sibt-e Razi, and Asad Madni will have the 
role of Mr. Azad's associates. Meetings and conferences have 
been started to promote Azad's new image. He is being cheered in 
these meetings and conferences according to a strategy. 
  The Congress (I), which was pushed away from the Muslims 
after the Babri Masjid incident, is eager to get back its old 
vote bank. The efforts are to develop one of its leaders as a 
Muslim sympathizer, so that his name can be used to attract 
votes during the next election. This leader will have to tell 
the Muslims at the time of the election what he had done for 
them. The hint will be that Mr. Azad and Prime Minister 
Narasimha Rao had formed a similar policy. Mr. Azad is following 
the prime minister's instructions. He has also started various 
meetings. After understanding this whole game, other ministers 
like C.K. Jaffar and P.M. Sayyed have also become very active on 
this front. 
  However, Ghulam Nabi Azad is in the forefront of this race 
to 
become the leader of Muslims. He has already sponsored two major 
conferences on Muslim problems. His major achievement was 
holding the conference of Urdu editors. The Urdu editors were 
greatly opposed to the Congress until recently. It is hoped that 
after this conference, they will be softened towards the 
Congress Party. These programs are organized in a way that the 
people do not suspect involvement of the Congress Party. 
Therefore, new faces are being pulled in for the success of 
these programs. Even the meeting organizers are not made aware 
of the plan to develop leaders. In order to keep the reality 
hidden from the people, leaders of other parties are also 
included in the program. This was especially kept in mind when 
holding meetings of Urdu editors and of the so-called ulemas 
(Muslim scholars). Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Mulayam 
Singh, was invited to the Urdu editors conference. E. Ahmed, 
secretary of the Muslim League, and Abdul Samad Siddiqui, a 
Janata Dal leader, were invited to the ulemas conference. Mr. 
Azad announced in the conference that he wanted to have everyone 
with him and this conference did not have any thing to do with 
the Congress government. In the ulema conference, Mr. Azad was 
trying to prove himself to be more popular than non-Congress 
leaders. He called the non-Congress leaders to him for talks and 
had himself recorded on videos for this purpose. 
  Efforts were made to raise the burning issues related to 
Muslims in these conferences. In both conferences, Mr. Azad 
raised issues showing he was not happy with the central 
government's policies. Mr. Azad went as far as to say that he 
did not care for his cabinet position when it came to resolving 
the problems faced by the Muslims. Taking the courage to say 
this clearly shows that his Congress bosses had given him the 
green flag to do so. 
  It has been decided to bring the Muslim into the Congress 
fold for the elections. This can happen only when the problems 
faced by the Muslims are alleviated. The Congress is aware now 
that it must do something to reduce the problems faced by the 
Muslims before it asks for their votes, so that the Congress 
leaders can declare that the Congress had helped the Musims. 
Then Muslims will have to do a favor in return for this favor. 
  Jaffar Sharif is not as successful in establishing himself 
as 
the leader of Muslims as is Ghulam Nabi Azad. Both of them spoke 
in the Urdu editors conference. Mr. Azad used sycophancy and 
emotions to deceive the Muslims. Mr. Sharif had to say in the 
end that he did not want to talk like Mr. Azad and lose sight of 
his goal. He spoke very emotionally. It was too much in the 
ulemas style. The whole Congress drama was fully rehearsed. The 
plan was to declare Mr. Azad the leader of all Muslims in the 
country. No one got wind of it before this. The information 
about this conference was privy to only a few people. 
Salamatullah had gathered people from here and there for this. 
The journalists were not informed about this conference. 
  One major reason for not informing eminent leaders in the 
capital was to avoid their opposition to this plan. Mr. Azad has 
neither any importance among the Muslims nor is he called 
dishonest or deceptive like other leaders. In addition, the 
ulemas who were going to make this announcement were not well 
known. Salamatullah is known as a cemetery salesman and 
government broker. Still, these two leaders were declared the 
leaders of the whole Muslim community in the nation in the 
presence of a few bearded people. 
  Another conference in this series was held to discuss 
education on 28 April. Mr. Azad was the guest of honor. 
Parliament Member Sunil Dutt was also invited, however, he did 
not attend. However, A.M. Khusro, chancellor of Aligarh 
University, M.N. Farookhi, vice chancellor, and several other 
professors and intellectuals expressed their opinions. This 
conference was also organized by Salamatullah.

<F P=106> [Article by Ram Bahadur Ray: "Muslims and Backwards Are No </F>
Longer With Janata Dal--Ghafur"] 
  [Text] New Delhi, 3 May. Mr. Abdul Ghafur, parliamentarian 
and former cabinet member, is sure that the backwards and the 
Muslims are not with the Janata Dal now. He said that the main 
reason for this change is the dramatic political style of Lalu 
Prasad. He says that if they run for the next election under 
Lalu Prasad's leadership, the future will be very dark. Seeing 
all this, the Bihar Janata Dal legislators are planning to 
establish a new party and Abdul Ghafur is one of them. 
  Thus, history repeats in full circles! Abdul Ghafur is 
leading the revolt against Lalu Prasad. Two decades ago, a 
revolt had risen from the opposite direction. Lalu Prasad was 
also involved in that. The target was then-Chief Minister Abdul 
Ghafur! We have to call it political irony that both of them 
belong to the same party. They are both from the same district. 
The legislator from Gopalganj is dismissing his chief minister 
by calling him theatrical and arrogant. 
  Is the Janata Dal breaking up? Abdul Ghafur responded that 
it 
was a historical necessary. Why? This is the only party which 
has no national leadership. There is no central leader left. He 
explains this in detail. V.P. Singh was elected president by 
acclaim and he declared himself a "Gorbachev" later. We know 
that Gorbachev dissipated the communist world with his reforms. 
V.P. Singh is also looking for a Yeltsin in the Janata Dal. We 
join him in his hope. What reaction will be in the Janata Dal 
over it? He said bitterly that people will go where they want to 
go. 
  Abdul Ghafur is the most veteran politician in the Janata 
Dal. He has been in politics most of the 76 years of life. After 
getting his B.A. (Geography) and L.L.B (Law) degrees from 
Allahabad University in 1941, he jumped into the political arena 
as a follower of Netaji Subhash Chander Bose. He went to jail in 
1942. The word, "soldier of the independence war" has heavy 
connotations. Abdul Ghafur has played even heavier roles than 
that. He has been in the legislature since 1952 and has won all 
the elections except for in 1967 and 1989. In 1967, the Congress 
Party was almost wiped out in Bihar. He also lost, however, he 
was elected to the Vidhan Parishad on the Congress ticket. He 
was the chairman of the Vidhan Sabha before being elected the 
chief minister. They tried to get him into the Janata Dal in 
1989 and he joined it in 1991. 
  He talked less about his past and spent more time talking 
about the present smoke raised by the Janata Dal. He said that 
the Janata Dal is finished in Uttar Pradesh and it would be 
beneficial to the Janata Dal leaders to join Mulayam Singh's 
Samajwadi Party there. If they do not like this, advised Ghafur, 
they should do what they think is appropriate. He said that the 
situation in Bihar was getting worse. Loknayak Jayaprakash 
Narayan had started the movement of "total revolution." The 
present chief minister who had joined that movement as a foot 
soldier is destroying those values. The devoted Janata Dal 
leaders of the "total revolution" are becoming preys to his 
anger. 
  Abdul Ghafur said that what could be worse than the fact 
that 
Lalu Prasad could not find even one candidate to run for 
by-election in Vaishali. He had Kishori Sinha resign from the 
Congress Party and made him the Janata Dal candidate. This was 
the first time when a chief minister himself went to nominate a 
candidate. The Janata Dal has taught him a lesson. The 
nomination was delayed for one and half hours because of 
protests. 
  He says with hurt feelings that the backwards are not with 
the Janata Dal now. Are 100 percent backwards opposed to the 
Janata Dal? He said that 80 percent are definitely unhappy. What 
about the Muslims? Abdul Ghafur thought for a few minutes and 
said that they are also in the backward category. He repeated 
that even Yadavs among the backwards are upset with the Janata 
Dal. He said, "The Muslim mentality could be understood from one 
example. There is a medical college in Katihar and Maulana Azad 
Engineering College in Patna. Mufti Mohammed Sayyed, Yunus 
Salim, Shafi Qureshi, and I kept asking Lalu Prasad to accredit 
those colleges. He declined it. The case reached the Supreme 
Court and the decision was made in our favor. A committee was 
formed and it recommended giving accreditation. Recently, the 
chief minister tried to stop Governor Kidwai from going there." 
Ghafur Said that this was but one example; there were hundreds 
of such examples. 
  He said that only God knew what would happen if elections in 
Bihar were held under the present leadership. Did he mean Lalu 
Prasad Yadav by "present leadership?" He replied in the 
affirmative. What plans are experienced leaders like you making? 
He replied that a decision will be made after postmortem 
ceremonies of Ramvilas Paswan's father. All this will be done 
within a week. Ramvilas Paswan, Chhedi Paswan, Nitish Kumar, and 
Harikishore Singh were involved in this effort. There are many 
others whose names will appear later. 
  Abdul Ghafur says that the Janata Dal is at the breaking 
point in Bihar. All Janata Dal legislators and more than half 
council members will join the new party. He was confident that 
Ram Sunder Das will also join his party. Thus, a new political 
polarization is taking place. Abdul Ghafur was showing the 
"labor pains" of this process. Was the Vaishali by-election a 
reason for it? He responded that the "pitcher of Lalu Prasad's 
sin is full" and this is the result of it. He said that law and 
order, financial catastrophe, looting of government treasury, 
and corruption have broken all previous records in Bihar. 
  He was reminded that during the Jayaprakash movement, he was 
recognized as a honest politician and that movement was about 
corruption. Then we asked him, "Will you certify Lalu Prasad a 
honest politician?" Abdul Ghafur was not comfortable with this 
question. He went down the memory lane for a while. His face 
showed agitation. He said after calming down a little, "The 
truth is that I wanted Lalu Prasad to continue as the chief 
minister. However, he will not be saved because of my wishes 
alone. The people are against him and the government machinery 
is against him. The people are tired of his histrionics. I have 
never seen such an arrogant leader." Ghafur does not usually 
employ such language. We asked him again if he would give a 
certificate of honesty to Lalu Prasad. He gave a clear answer 
this time. He said, I wish I could do that. He will wait for 
Lalu Prasad's reaction. There are many missiles in Abdul 
Ghafur's arsenal to silence Lalu Prasad.

<F P=106> [Article by Niraj Joshi: "A Round of Movements in </F>
Uttarkhand"] 
  [Text] The people in Uttarkhand are vigorously campaigning 
for various districts, counties, and blocks. Dozens of such 
movements to organize such small units are raging in Garhwal and 
Kumaon. The "save block, county, and district movement" in 
Kumaon has become so strong these days that it outshines even 
the movement for a separate Uttarkhand. In Kumaon's Pithoragarh 
region alone, they have such movements as "Establish Champavat 
district," and "Establish Didihat district, county, precinct, 
block" in addition to marches, hunger strikes, fasts-unto-death, 
and sit ins. 
  Using traditional drums and dances, the enthusiasm of the 
villagers from remote rural areas gathered in district and 
country seats and camping there for as long as five days has 
been brought to its peak. Even the Nainital valley is rumbling 
with the noise raised for making Champavat district. The 
movement for Bageshwar district is comparatively old. 
  The political groups are viewing the emerging flood of 
movements in the inner Uttarkhand from various perspectives. The 
left-wing parties consider this to be the result of infiltration 
of Naxalite groups in the hills such as MPF [Maoist People's 
Front] into politics. The BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] family 
believe this to be the product of the "growth of the idea of 
balanced progress through their small units." The Congress Party 
and other moderate groups considers it to be the result of their 
absence. These scattered movements for new counties, blocks, 
districts, and even a separate state have made it clear that in 
the difficult terrain of Uttarkhand the central and state 
development projects cannot have much effect. Instead, colonial 
types of luxury projects such as tourism have widened he chasm 
between cities and villages in Uttarkhand. 
  The movement for Champavat district in Pithoragarh has 
crossed the state to the Center. The political circles have 
become alert at this bustle about these various movements. The 
political parties are trying to snatch these movements for 
separate Uttarkhand and districts from the people. The letter 
from Harish Rawat, head of the Rashtariya Sewa Dal, to Mulayam 
Singh asking him to declare Champavat a separate district is 
proof of such efforts. 
  Why are efforts to organize small unit when the 
cabinet-level 
Kaushik Commission established by Mulayam Singh is already 
holding its meetings? The answer to this question was clear in 
the Kaushik Commission's meeting in the Circuit House in Almora. 
It is not necessary to say that R.S. Toling, chief of Uttarkhand 
Development Department, and six members of Mulayam Singh's 
Kaushik Commission met with the representatives of the people. 
Many questions were raised in this meeting over Kaushik 
Commission's overlooking the intellectual, political, and 
self-employed groups in Uttarkhand. Later in the Commission's 
meetings in Pauri and Terai, the people demanded from the state 
government to provide constitutional recognition to the 
geographical boundaries and the capital of the proposed state. 
They asked the state to first reorganize districts and counties 
before starting the process of forming a separate state. The 
Kaushik Commission and the U.P. [Uttar Pradesh] government 
rejected this demand right then and there. This has resulted in 
fasts-unto-death and hunger strikes for small units of 
administration in various places. 
  Still, the present reasons cannot account for this prevalent 
dissatisfaction. Villagers living 50 or 100 miles away from any 
major road do not come out with their drums to hold 
demonstrations year round and start hunger strikes. It is clear 
that the turmoil in the few cities of Uttarkhand has spread to 
rural areas. The process that did not affect them at all from 
distance or up close is now materializing with the time. The 
wave of movements is also rising with the emergence of this 
awareness. 
  If we take a broader look, we will find that the present 
movement in the backwoods of Uttarkhand is the movement of rural 
awareness. Why is the rural hill population which is more than 
80 percent of the total population of 600,000 so angry? There 
are several reasons for it. The first is the neglect of hill 
regions by the state and central governments since independence. 
The second reason is the imposition of urban development model 
here despite the different geographic situation of Uttarkhand 
because of its hilly terrain, and the prejudice shown by the 
messiahs of separate Uttarkhand in their narrow and regional 
mentality. The third reason is the weakened political situation 
of the Uttarkhand representatives at the state and central 
government levels. The fourth, and most important, reason is the 
lack of basic facilities in the hills because of wrong planning 
or wrong priorities during the last 45 years. 
  The Congress Party had political supremacy here until 1990. 
In each election, the Congress raised the slogan for 
development. The December 1993 vidhan sabha election could be an 
exception because the Congress had added the issue of a separate 
and autonomous federation. Other parties that came to power here 
also recognized the Uttarkhand people's belief that the only 
route to progress was having a separate state. After recognizing 
this belief, the BJP and the Samajwadi Party started to wrangle 
over the Uttarkhand issue. 
  The issue of basic facilities that should have been given 
top 
priority but was ignored is still being ignored. The situation 
now is that an average village groups does not have any basic 
facility. Because of the curse of local geography, villages are 
usually located more than five kilometers apart. A gramsabha 
[village council] is established for each of such six or seven 
villages. According to government standards for providing 
primary education if a village has 300 people living in it and 
is more than 1.5 kilometers from another village, then the first 
number does not meet one criteria and the second is much more 
than needed. However, this results in having only one school in 
the gramsabha [of six or seven villages]. Because of the Forest 
directive of 1980 and the increasing watchfulness of the forest 
department, villages lying 50 kilometers away have not been 
joined by roads. Even when connecting roads are built, 
landslides during the first rains wipe those roads out. It is 
natural for a group to start a movement if it is deprived of 
such basic amenities as education, health care, electricity, 
water, roads and inns. 
  Still, we cannot say that money is not being spent on 
development work in Uttarkhand. They are spending money here 
over priority projects under annual and 5-year plans. How much 
money was spent on the governments former priority projects and 
which group benefitted from them is a separate issue. The 
central and state governments have given priority to development 
of tourism in Uttarkhand. Crores of rupees are being spent on 
tourism. Why, then, are the people agitated? The answer to this 
question is the attack of the modern tourism on the religious 
and traditional concept of travel. This has worried the rural 
population. The desire to visit famous holy places in Haridwar, 
Badrinath, Kedarnath, Bageshwar, Jageshwar, and Patal 
Bhuvneshwar is decreasing among the outsiders. On the other 
hand, developments for recreation and luxury living in cities 
like Nainital, Mussoorie, Kaushani, Pithoragarh, and Almora are 
on the rise. What do the villagers living 50 kilometers from the 
nearest road and 150 kilometers from the district headquarter 
have to do with hang gliding, para gliding, mountain climbing, 
skiing, swimming pools, and other such flashy things? The rural 
population of Uttarkhand understands this question very well and 
even women are holding demonstrations in many places. The 
meaning of the movements for districts, counties, and blocks is 
simple awareness which is a good sign for the future of rural 
population. Will the U.P. and central governments and the 
representatives of the hill region try to understand the wrath 
of the people by rising above their biases? Only the future will 
tell us.

<F P=106> [Jaroslav Kmenta article: ``The Army Tested Small Pox''] </F>
  [Text] Prague -- Although only a month ago army officials 
kept quiet about the smallpox virus ever having been studied in 
Czechoslovakia, the army admitted yesterday that military 
scholars worked with this dangerous virus in the 1960's and 
1970's. Moreover, according to the former employees of the 
Military Health Institute, the smallpox virus has never been 
destroyed. 
  There was no smallpox virus in the viral strain bank that 
the 
army liquidated last February, while, according to information 
available, it was not destroyed in the 1980's either. So far, 
none of the army or civilian officials we asked has explained 
what has actually happened to the smallpox virus. 
  The director of the Central Military Health Institute, 
Vladimir Radovnicky, believes that the virus was destroyed 
between 1976 and 1978. ``The smallpox virus strain (variola 
maior) was here once, because there is a diagnostic serum. It 
was a problem of the 1970's. The strain was probably destroyed. 
Nevertheless, I cannot give a definite answer of when and how 
it was destroyed. I can only confirm that the smallpox virus 
was not in the strain bank that was destroyed earlier this year. 
It would be hard for me to trace what happened in the 1960's 
and 1970's,'' he said. He then emphasized that there is no 
viral strain, even less the smallpox one, in his institute now. 
  A former employee of the same institute, who wishes to 
remain 
anonymous, and who used to work with the smallpox viruses, 
asserted that, after the smallpox research was concluded in the 
1970's, the strain was frozen in liquid nitrogen and placed in a 
special container. 
  In 1979, when thanks to the world-wide systematic 
inoculation, smallpox was completely suppressed, the General 
Commission for Elimination of Smallpox recommended that all 
remaining stock of smallpox virus be either destroyed or 
transferred to reference laboratories in the United States and 
the USSR. ``We have not respected the research recommendation 
by the world commission out of laziness, rather than out of bad 
intentions,'' the former staffer of the research laboratory 
admitted.

  [Text] Sao Paulo, 22 Apr (EFE) -- In a final declaration 
issued at the end of the fourth meeting of foreign ministers, 
the Rio Group and the EU today agreed to call for a total ban on 
nuclear tests in the world and condemned every form of terrorism. 
  Regarding their commitment to disarmament and to 
nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the 
participants of the fourth Rio Group-EU ministerial meeting 
expressed their complete agreement in condemning every form of 
nuclear testing. 
  The Sao Paulo Declaration, which was approved by 13 foreign 
ministers of the Rio Group and representatives of the EU member 
countries, states: ``The ministers (of the Rio Group and the 
EU) agree on proposing the signing of a multilateral treaty that 
would impose a total ban on nuclear tests and would be fully 
verifiable.'' 
  In the Sao Paulo Declaration, the Rio Group and the EU also 
expressed their total condemnation of terrorism. 
  The declaration states: ``The ministers...condemn without 
reservations -- as an unjustifiable crime -- every act of 
terrorism, irrespective of who perpetrates them, where, or why, 
because acts of terrorism endanger and claim the lives of human 
beings. They also undermine human dignity and are a threat to 
democracy and to a state of law.'' 
  The ministerial meeting between the Rio Group and the EU is 
the fourth since bilateral talks were institutionalized by the 
Rome Declaration (1990). The meeting, which is being held at 
the Latin American Parliament (Parlatino) building in the city 
of Sao Paulo, is scheduled to close on 23 April but the final 
declaration was released today. 
  In addition to condemning nuclear tests, the Rio Group-EU 
ministers praised the ``recent progress made in consolidating 
the regime for a total ban on nuclear weapons in Latin America 
and the Caribbean as established in the Tlatelolco Treaty.'' 
  The declaration also expressed support for the Convention 
Banning the Development, Production, Storage, and Use of 
Chemical Weapons and Their Destruction, and revealed their 
resolve to adopt specific measures to fully implement the 
Convention on Biological Weapons. 
  The Rio Group and the EU also voiced their desire to 
cooperate to give openness to international arms trade. 
  The latter point was specifically requested by Andean 
countries like Colombia, which has been affected by arms 
trafficking financed by narcotrafficking and terrorist 
organizations. 
  The two blocs' representatives agreed to promote a UN 
Registry of Conventional Weapons with a view to effectively 
controlling arms possession around the world. 
  In the Sao Paulo Declaration, which consists of 19 points 
focusing on economic and political issues, the Rio Group and the 
EU reaffirm their respect for democracy and the principles of 
free trade. 
  The Rio Group and the EU also have agreed to define a new 
model of bilateral relations in which the Latin American 
countries would have greater participation in various 
international issues such as world security and the reform of 
the UN Charter. 
  The Latin American countries also expressed their concern 
about the social, environmental, and labor conditions some 
European nations are starting to impose on their trade with 
developing countries. 
  The continuation and expansion of the Generalized System of 
Preferences (GSP), which expires this year and regulates trade 
between the EU and Latin American countries, was another request 
made by the Rio Group that was included in the final declaration. 
  The Sao Paulo meeting was attended by all of the foreign 
ministers of the Rio Group -- which consists of Argentina, 
Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, 
Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Attending the meeting as 
observers were the ministers of Trinidad and Tobago and 
Guatemala, representing the Caribbean and Central America, 
respectively. 
  The EU was represented by the foreign ministers of Spain and 
Portugal; Greek Alternate Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos, 
who is vice president of the EU; deputy ministers; and deputy 
ministers of the other members of the ``Group of 12'' (Denmark, 
Germany, Italy, United Kingdom, Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg, 
the Netherlands, and France).

<F P=106> [Silvia Aloisi report: ``Al-Qadhdhafi's Secret Weapon'' -- </F>
all Libyan place names as published] 
  [Text] Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi's deadly secret is hidden in 
the sandy desert, at Tarhunah, 65 kilometers south-east of 
Tripoli. It is here that the Libyan leader is having an 
enormous installation built for the production of chemical 
weapons, thus complementing the existing production plant at 
Rabta. 
  For years the U.S. secret service had suspected al-Qadhdhafi 
of planning to build a second chemical plant. Rabta 
technological center's Pharma-150 plant was detected by the 
Pentagon in 1988, thanks to photographs taken by the Keyhole 
satellite. It was immediately defined as ``the greatest 
chemical weapon production plant in the Third World. It was 
pointless for Tripoli's colonel to deny the facts and say that 
the plant was only a harmless `pharmaceuticals factory.''' 
First Ronald Reagan and later George Bush repeatedly threatened 
to bomb the plant unless al-Qadhdhafi agreed to an international 
inspection. The use of force, however, proved unnecessary, 
since in March 1990 the Rabta plant was half-destroyed by a 
mysterious fire, which the Libyan authorities attributed to 
Western-instigated sabotage. 
  The Tripoli government has not forgotten American threats 
nor, above all, the allied bombing of Iraqi military 
installations during the Gulf War and, subsequently, in 1993. 
Al-Qadhdhafi's decision to have the suspect plant and materials 
transported to a new secret site was therefore predictable. 
This, in fact, would enable him to open the doors of the 
entirely rebuilt Rabta plant to UN inspectors, as a sign of 
goodwill toward the West. 
  The construction of the new Tarhunah plant was entrusted to 
the Jowfe state-owned enterprise, a bogus company which was set 
up to purchase the necessary equipment for building the plant 
and manufacturing poison gas. The plant, which is scheduled to 
become operational by 1995, will be capable of producing mustard 
gas at the rate of 1,000 metric tons a year, Sarin gas (90 
metric tons), and Soman gas (1,300 metric tons). All of these 
substances are highly toxic to human beings: A small drop is 
enough to kill an individual within a few minutes. 
  Suspicions concerning Tripoli's intentions were aroused by 
the discovery, in England, of a Jowfe purchase order for two 
chemical production installations. The contract, worth half a 
million pounds sterling (approximately 1.2 billion lire), had 
been awarded to the Multinational Engineering Group company, 
which is part of the British APV company. The deal was 
camouflaged by means of a three-way operation: Jowfe contacted 
APV's Malaysian subsidiary APV Hills and Hills, which passed on 
the order to its parent company in London. In addition to the 
equipment, the order included materials for gas production and, 
in particular, pinacolone alcohol, the basic component for the 
production of Soman nerve gas. 
  Other toxic substances were supplied to Jowfe by the Belgian 
company Hassco, based in Ostend. Among them, ethylene oxide, 
used for manufacturing mustard gas and incendiary bombs, and 
dimethylamine, a component of Tabun nerve gas. It is difficult, 
however, to draw up precise accusations since many toxic 
products used for chemical weapons are commonly used as 
fertilizers or pesticides, and are therefore not included in the 
international list of ``risk'' substances whose export is 
forbidden. Ethylene oxide, for example, is used for the 
production of industrial resins and detergents. 
  However, the nature of the Tarhunah plant, which is 
officially presented as a petrochemical complex, also seems to 
be confirmed by the type of materials bought for its 
construction. Libya is currently subjected to an international 
embargo because of its involvement in the 1988 terrorist action 
against a Pan Am Boeing 747 over Lockerbie. Tripoli is refusing 
to extradite the two Libyan agents who are suspected of having 
planted the bomb in the airliner. However, getting round the UN 
embargo was easy: In fact, the Jowfe company obtained -- from 
Switzerland -- the technical specifications for the construction 
of parallel underground tunnels, 150 meters long, designed by 
the Sauer engineering company of Salzburg (Austria). This type 
of tunnel is commonly used in other secret military 
installations. Furthermore, Libya purchased chemical weapon 
production equipment whose internal components are covered with 
enamel or teflon -- materials that are extremely resistant to 
corrosive toxic substances. A sophisticated Swiss 
air-purification plant -- protected by special fire-resistant 
materials -- and a computerized system enabling instruments to 
function automatically are considered further evidence for the 
military intended use of the Tarhunah complex. 
  Libya did not subscribe to the international convention 
against the proliferation of chemical weapons, which was signed 
in Paris in January 1993, and it has always refused to have its 
chemical installations open to international inspection. The 
Tripoli government supports the position taken by the majority 
of Arab League countries, which make their possible adhesion to 
the convention conditional upon international inspection of 
Israel's secret nuclear installations. In fact, chemical 
weapons are considered the Arab countries' response to the 
Jewish state's nuclear potential. 
  The discovery of the Tarhunah plant may trigger off a new 
crisis between Tripoli's colonel and the West. The Libyan 
Government is already facing trouble on its internal front, 
following the violent anti-regime revolt which broke out last 
March in the small town of Bani Walid -- although al-Qadhdhafi's 
personal power does not seem to be seriously called into 
question. The colonel survived the administrations of his 
longstanding enemies, Reagan and Bush. But Bill Clinton may 
well decide that the moment has come to resume the hostilities.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 5 TASS -- A bilateral group of Russian 
and U.S. experts from the Russian and U.S. defense ministries 
met in session in Moscow on 4 May. The meeting is being held in 
a constructive and friendly atmosphere, said Russian Deputy 
Chief of Staff Dmitriy Kharchenko today. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS Kharchenko said that the 
sides 
exchanged opinions on problems of European security, the 
situation in Bosnia, Russia's joining the Partnership for Peace 
programme, nuclear weapons in Ukraine and prospects for the 
development of contacts between the armed forces of the two 
countries. General Kharchenko pointed out that the Pentagon 
delegation led by the U.S. defence secretary's aide for issues 
of nuclear security, Ashton Carter, displayed a particular 
interest in cooperation in ensuring nuclear security, the 
reduction and elimination of weapons of mass destruction. 
  The Russian delegation to the talks led by the Russian 
defence minister's aide for military politics, Gennadiy Ivanov, 
informed the American side about the Russian Duma's stance on 
joint Russo-U.S. exercises of peacekeeping forces scheduled to 
be held at a Totsk test site in the Orenburg region in May. 
Pentagon officials believe that it is important to explain to 
Russian lawmakers that similar exercises are scheduled to be 
conducted next time on the American soil. The U.S. point of 
view will be brought to the notice of the Russian military and 
political leadership, Kharchenko said. The meeting between the 
two working groups of the U.S. and Russian defense departments 
continues.

  [Text] Moscow May 4 TASS -- Ukraine has removed to Russia 
180 strategic nuclear missiles as of today, Igor Sergeyev, 
commander of the Russian strategic missile forces, said. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday, Sergeyev said 
that the missiles will be scrapped at Russian plants as 
envisaged by the agreements signed by Russia, Ukraine and the 
United States and START-1 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. 
  Sergeyev recalled that under the Lisbon Protocol, 
Byelorussia 
[Belarus], Kazakhstan and Ukraine are also parties to the treaty 
which has been ratified by the U.S., Russia, Byelorussia and 
Kazakhstan. 
  He stressed that Russia has already scrapped over 350 
missiles and about 300 missile launchers. He added, however, 
that the implementation of the treaty depends not only on 
Russia, but also other ex-Soviet republics which posses nuclear 
weapons. 
  Russia has signed an agreement with Byelorussia to transfer 
a 
group of strategic missile troops in Byelorussia under Russia's 
control. Russia is also withdrawing strategic missile units 
from that republic. 
  A similar agreement was signed with Kazakhstan in March 
1994. 
Both sides are now working on an agreement on the elimination of 
missile facilities.

<F P=106> [Viktor Litovkin report: ``U.S. Equipment Idle at Russian </F>
Missile Range''] 
  [Text] The racks visible in this photograph are on the 
third floor of the Russian Strategic Missile Forces' State Test 
Range located in the town of Mirnyy, Arkhangelsk Oblast. It is 
equipment made by the U.S. firm of ``Metrum-97'' [name as 
transliterated] for reproducing telemetry data. More precisely, 
it is a magnetic tape player for decoding the flight parameters 
of strategic missiles developed and launched on test flights by 
the United States. 
  It was supplied here last year under a bilateral agreement 
between the countries, when the second Strategic Arms Reduction 
Treaty (START II) was signed. Similar Russian-made equipment -- 
in six rather than two racks -- has been set up on U.S. soil 
near Washington by our officers. 
  It was assumed that when the two states' parliaments 
ratified 
the treaty, the countries would, as a mark of the trust between 
them, exchange telemetry and other information on the 
performance of their new and old strategic missiles, their 
behavior in flight, and other important information which would 
allow the generals, politicians, and missile designers to take a 
calm and very respectful view of both sides' scientific and 
technical developments and to monitor them with greater 
confidence. 
  They even exchanged as a goodwill gesture reels of magnetic 
tape recordings of previous test telemetry -- the Americans gave 
us information on their ground-launched missile, while we gave 
them information on our sea-launched missile. Once again, they 
sent us one spool, while we sent them several. 
  This is not a question of excessive generosity. It is simply 
that the Americans take the information on their missiles' 
behavior in flight from a single satellite, while our testers 
have to take the information from nine measuring stations sited 
along the country's northern seaboard. From Mirnyy to 
Kamchatka. There are stations in Naryan-Mar, Taymyr, Yakutsk, 
and even on Novaya Zemlya. The information is sent back by 
military couriers. This is when aircraft are flying and 
reindeer are not roaming the tundra. [sentence as published] 
  Because of this the countries set the timetable for the 
exchange of telemetry at 50 days. Less than that would be 
impossible. Otherwise there might be suspicions of dishonesty. 
It would then have to be proved that there was no way out from 
Novaya Zemlya. That would be no justification in 
military-diplomatic circles -- especially as delivery of 
magnetic tapes is subsequently provided for by diplomatic pouch. 
  But, so far, there is nothing to deliver. Apart from the 
so-called demonstration reels, the high contracting parties have 
not exchanged anything else. Our parliament -- neither the old 
one nor the new one -- has not ratified START II. 
  A whole telemetry exchange department has been set up at the 
Russian test range. Colonel Aleksandr Vasilyev, its deputy 
chief, agreed to be photographed alongside the U.S. equipment 
for this newspaper. He says that they are not wasting time but 
are preparing to do serious work on the transatlantic missile 
information. In principle they are already ready to do so. 
  So the ball is now in the State Duma's court.

<F P=106> [Viktor Litovkin report: ``Russia's Missile Guard Increased </F>
by Nine Topols''] 
  [Text] Yoshkar-Ola-Moscow -- This was unprecedented. The 
until recently top-secret strategic missile regiment belonging 
to the Kiev-Zhitomir Order of Kutuzov Missile Division deployed 
in Yoshkar-Ola inaugurated the performance of alert duty in the 
presence of Mariy-El Republic President Vladislav Zotin and 
before the gaze of television journalists, pressmen, and 
photographers, among whom were IZVESTIYA special correspondents. 
  The regiment comprises nine RS-12M Topol road-mobile 
delivery 
vehicles. Journalists were shown the holy of holies -- the 
alert forces' fixed command post which controls the launch of 
missiles, the launch area equipment, its protection and defense 
system, and the guard quarters where the missilemen perform 
their alert duty -- and had all the questions that interest us, 
including where the missiles are targeted, answered. 
  Before giving you that answer I would inform you that the 
regiment was assembled out of different pieces, as it were. Its 
officer backbone is made up of men who served in the missile 
unit belonging to the 43d Vinnitsa Army stationed in the 
settlement of Lebedin, Suma Oblast, Ukraine. The regiment was 
once equipped with SS-20 Pioneer intermediate-range missiles, 
which were destroyed some years ago under the Treaty on 
Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles. The new 
equipment was received last August from the city of Postava, 
Belorussia [Belarus], from the Topol strategic missile division 
which was disbanded there and withdrawn from the republic's 
territory. 
  These systems replaced some of the RS-12 (SS-13 according to 
the U.S. classification system) fixed-site missiles with which 
the Yoshkar-Ola division is equipped. Officer retraining took 
six months, and they entered on alert duty on their new systems 
on 19 April. 
  It is also interesting that the regiment disbanded in 
Ukraine 
was created in Akhtyrka in 1655. It was the oldest military 
unit in Russia and had taken part in the Battle of Poltava. By 
edict of Empress Elizabeth the regiment was named the Akhtyrka 
Hussars. It was commanded at the battle of Borodino by General 
Denis Davydov, who took it as far as Paris. Lermontov and 
Alyabyev served there... 
  Now its colors and combat decorations, including the Orders 
of the Red Banner, Kutuzov, and Bogdan Khmelnistskiy are kept in 
the Central Museum of the Armed Forces. 
  The missile officers, I was told by assistant commander 
Lieutenant Colonel Vitaliy Lezhanin, have asked the Defense 
Ministry leadership to restore the memorabilia and the honorary 
title to them, but only time will tell whether the General Staff 
will heed them. In the opinion of those who perform alert duty 
today, they have every right. 
  Colonel Vladimir Kashkin, the commander of the regiment, 
told 
me that he doesn't know what his missiles are targeted on. Only 
the General Staff has such information. But division commander 
Major General Musa Tsegoyev clarified the position, stating that 
under the strategic missile agreement with the United States 
strategic missiles have ``zero'' targeting and that their 
mission will only be programmed at a time of threat. They 
maintain watch to deter any potential aggressor so that never 
comes to pass. 
  The missilemen's unprecedented openness in inviting 
journalists to see the regiment's entry on alert duty is, in my 
view, not just a desire on their part to report gradually on the 
execution of their international commitments. There is another 
reason for this too. As is well known, the former Russian 
Supreme Soviet did not ratify START, but the reequipping of the 
missile division in Yoshkar-Ola and the disbandment of strategic 
regiments in Belorussia and Ukraine constitute the 
implementation of that treaty. 
  Russia will keep its word, although the parliamentarians 
have 
not turned this word into law.

  [Text] Moscow April 28 TASS -- ``Missile retargeting'' 
planned for this coming May is not to impair the combat 
readiness of Russian missile forces, according to their 
commander-in-chief, Colonel-General Igor Sergeyev. 
  In an interview with TASS after today's meeting with some 
foreign military attaches, Sergeyev said the ``retargeting'' 
will be performed in full accordance with the Moscow declaration 
signed by the Russian and U.S. Presidents. Under this document, 
Moscow and Washington are obliged to retarget their strategic 
nuclear missiles by 30 May 1994, so that they should not be 
targeted at each other. This initiative was also joined by 
Great Britain. 
  According to experts, the scheme of retargeting is not 
complicated: geographical reference of the targets in Russia and 
the United States put in the computer working memory are 
expected to be replaced by those of some desert areas of the 
world ocean.

<F P=106> [``First-Hand'' Interview with Lieutenant General (Reserve) </F>
Anatoliy Kuntsevich, former chairman of Russian president's 
Committee for Convention Problems of Chemical and Biological 
Weapons, by Andrey Vaganov; date, place not given: ``Anatoliy 
Kuntsevich: `I Do Not Discuss Orders.' `Chemical' General's 
First Interview Since His Dismissal'' -- first four paragraphs 
are introduction] 
  [Text] The closer Russia comes to the point that the air 
force calls ``the point of no-return,'' in this case to 
ratification of the Convention on the Prohibition of the 
Development, Production, Stockpiling, and Use of Chemical 
Weapons and on their Destruction, the more acute the squabbles 
in public and in private over this problem become. 
  One of the most important manifestations of the internal 
struggle within the top echelons of power was President 
Yeltsin's 7 April 1994 edict relieving Russian Academy of 
Sciences Academician Anatoliy Kuntsevich of his post as chairman 
of the Russian president's Committee for Convention Problems of 
Chemical and Biological Weapons. The edict contained the 
following wording -- ``for a single gross breach of professional 
duty.'' The president's press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov 
interpreted this as follows: ``The committee agreed to toxins 
being transported and stored in a major population center.'' 
However, it seems that, if this actually did occur, it was more 
of an excuse than the real reason. (Suffice it to say that Mr. 
Kuntsevich was ill at the time the edict was drafted). 
  The story linking Anatoliy Kuntsevich's dismissal with a 
``moral victory for the military-chemical dissident'' Vil 
Mirzayanov and company is even less plausible. 
  Strangely enough, Lt. Gen. (Reserve) Kuntsevich does not 
seem 
to have suited certain structures within the Russian Defense 
Ministry. And they are not the only ones. Whatever you say 
about Anatoliy Kuntsevich, his status as a top-class 
professional and his undoubted international prestige gave him a 
many opportunities for candor. It is extremely likely that 
someone thought that the committee led by Kuntsevich was too 
``extradepartmental.'' Your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA was told by a 
highly-placed official from this department, who asked to remain 
anonymous, that ``there are more than enough people who are 
unaware of the problem but who want to head up this 
organization. Many people are attracted by the chairmanship, 
which holds ministerial rank. Moreover, it will be easier for 
`competent' organizations to control such an incompetent 
person.'' 
  Vaganov: The specific wording of the presidential 
edict regarding your dismissal is pretty surprising for an 
official of your rank. Do you have any comment to make? 
  Kuntsevich: I would like to say right away that, 
in accordance with the old soldier's custom, I do not discuss 
orders from above. 
  Vaganov: Fine. Could you tell us how much of a 
surprise this was to you? 
  Kuntsevich: This situation can be regarded in 
different ways. I do not want to get personal. There is a 
Russian presidential edict which I am obliged to implement. 
  But I must say on the whole that the problem of chemical 
disarmament concerns very important and extremely sensitive 
aspects of our state's activity. Naturally a whole range of 
opinions arise when these matters are being decided. How can 
they be resolved so as to accord with national interests above 
all? On the other hand we have to act so that Russia does not 
``drop out'' of civilized forms of communication with other 
states. 
  Vaganov: How did the Committee on Convention 
Problems begin its activity? 
  Kuntsevich: The Convention on the Prohibition of 
Biological Weapons was formulated way back in 1972. The USSR 
subscribed to it in 1975. However, no legal documents were 
adopted at the time banning the development of offensive 
biological programs in the USSR. 
  In February 1992 the Committee on Convention Problems of 
Chemical and Biological Weapons was set up under the Russian 
president, and 11 April that same year a Russian presidential 
edict appeared with the committee's direct participation aimed 
at ensuring Russia's fulfillment of international convention 
commitments in the sphere of biological weapons and banning the 
implementation in our country of any offensive biological 
programs. The committee was made responsible for supervising 
implementation of this edict's provisions. The matter was 
finalized in law. In my view, this was the committee's first 
major act, and it drew worldwide attention. 
  It was then necessary to discover forms and means of working 
that would make it possible to remove mutual suspicion and 
anxiety between Russia, the United States, Britain, and other 
countries in the sphere of biological weapons. We proposed 
carrying out a series of inspections. This approach of ours was 
put into effect in September 1992 in a tripartite -- 
Russian-U.S.-British -- joint statement, which also made 
provision for the principle of carrying out mutual inspections. 
  These inspections have gone ahead in 1993-1994. A joint 
group of U.S. and British experts and inspectors inspected four 
facilities in Russia. Russian specialists accordingly visited 
three installations in the United States and one in Britain. A 
real foundation developed for comparing our countries' 
scientific, technical, and industrial potential in this field 
with facts and figures in hand. Thus, we brought our relations 
to the point of possible quantitative juxtaposition and 
comparison. Today, a good working roundtable has formed at 
which any problems can be constructively discussed. 
  Vaganov: And this is the moment when you, one of 
the people who set up this roundtable, are unexpectedly removed 
from the chairmanship of the Committee on Convention Problems. 
It looks as though there is a negative opinion of your work in 
this post. 
  Kuntsevich: That has nothing to do with the 
committee's activity. I do not think that this decision was 
based on what you have said. The committee is not me alone. 
There are 57 people working on it today. By current standards 
that is a small collective, but it comprises eminent 
specialists. Perhaps that is my main achievement -- that I 
succeeded in finding people who are professionally aware of the 
full complexity and multifaceted nature of the problems and 
really have an idea of the possible ways of resolving them 
without harming Russia's national interests and security. 
  Vaganov: What do you think are the main 
difficulties facing Russia in the sphere of chemical disarmament? 
  Kuntsevich: The most challenging problem is the 
problem of what is to be done with the Convention on the 
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons which Russia signed in January 
1993. It concerns Russia's highest international and national 
interests. 
  No matter how my opponents reproach me for rushing to sign 
this convention, I categorically disagree with that. The 
negotiating process began back in 1980 or even earlier. 
Moreover, as for the history of this problem, Russia came to 
the negotiating table back in... 1868. It was then that the 
first legal document in the field of chemical weapons appeared 
in St. Petersburg -- a declaration banning the use of poisoned 
bullets was signed. 
  Vaganov: To return to today's events.... 
  Kuntsevich: We are in effect talking about one 
thing today -- whether or not to ratify the convention. 
  Vaganov: What do you predict? 
  Kuntsevich: This is all pretty tricky. I spoke 
about it at the State Duma hearings 24 March this year. We have 
to square economic, financial, and technological potential with 
our commitments under this convention and determine the real 
priorities in disarmament. Russia's international political, 
moral, and ethical prestige is undoubtedly in the balance. 
  From the time when the committee was formed I always said 
that, for Russia to be able to join this convention, it was 
essential to create powerful international support for it, 
bearing in mind our current difficult economic and financial 
situation. This international support must undoubtedly come 
under our intellectual, scientific and technical, and 
organizational leadership. I am talking not about obtaining 
some kind of financial or technological handout but about 
creating a committed pool of support for Russia's chemical 
weapons destruction program -- which is particularly important 
during the initial phase. 
In addition, previously my opponents tried via the mass media 
to present me as a rabid supporter of the military-chemical 
complex, dreaming of how to drag out the process of chemical 
disarmament and ridding Russia of the heavy military-chemical 
burden. However, to be fair I must say that of late my 
opponents have done a complete turnabout. They are now trying 
to persuade the public that Kuntsevich was allegedly in a hurry 
and impelled Russia to sign the Convention on the Prohibition of 
Chemical Weapons. I categorically refute that opinion and 
consider it unprofessional in every respect -- from both the 
state, the political, and the general human viewpoints. 
  It is now being said that the committee chairman was 
developing pro-Western sentiments and upholding a Western line. 
But, pardon me for saying so, what strategic line should I have 
developed in the interests of my taxpayer? Would it really have 
been bad for the committee to try to obtain $6 billion in aid 
(and the preconditions for that did exist)? I can say that the 
preconditions are still there today for us to obtain almost $1 
billion in foreign aid. Can that really be bad for Russia? 
  Vaganov: So, someone in the top ranks of the 
Russian leadership has decided that it is bad.... 
  Kuntsevich: I do not think that this decision came 
from the top. However, there are obviously politicians and 
various currents that are trying to play this card in their own 
interests. 
  Vaganov: Now a very tough question: Where are the 
chemical weapons to be destroyed? 
  Kuntsevich: We have to be realistic about this: 
There is not a single component of the Federation today that 
would voluntarily accept chemical munitions for destruction on 
its territory. And few would even allow them to be transported 
across their territory. So we must design a system whereby 
these weapons will be destroyed right in the areas where they 
are stored. National unity has to be secured on this: All the 
other components of the Federation must not simply be left as 
detached observers, especially since the timeframes for the safe 
storage of chemical weapons are ebbing away before our eyes. 
  The regions must join forces with industrial and 
entrepreneurial structures and set up a system of funds. And 
corresponding concessions enshrined in legislation by the State 
Duma are needed in order for regions where chemical weapons 
destruction facilities are located to obtain the requisite 
investment. 
  Vaganov: Following your dismissal, do you still 
have a real chance of influencing the destruction of chemical 
weapons? 
  Kuntsevich: I am a chemist by profession. In the 
more specialized sense I am a specialist in the destruction of 
toxic substances. I began studying this in 1958 right after 
graduating from the Academy of Chemical Protection. I will most 
likely now return to the Russian Academy of Sciences, where 
before my committee appointment I was working mainly on the 
recycling of intermediate products and toxic substances and on 
the conversion of production facilities. 
  In particular, I will do everything in my power to implement 
the idea of creating a system of funds to support the program 
for the destruction of chemical weapons. There are many people 
who are interested in this. But they want guarantees from the 
state, they want to be sure that they are involved not in a vain 
undertaking but in an important, promising job. And there are 
elements that they find very appealing. First, involvement in 
what is effectively a global project for the destruction of 
chemical weapons. In this connection -- and this is the second 
point -- the project has strong political ``protection.'' Any 
authority -- I mean any sensible authority -- will do its utmost 
to reinforce this political ``protection.'' Consequently, 
guarantees of stability -- political and state -- exist that 
will ultimately not only enable Russia to meet its international 
commitments under the convention but will also make it possible 
to rid Russian citizens and all mankind of the threat of one of 
the most insidious kinds of mass-destruction weapon.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Zamyatin and Aleksandr Koretskiy: </F>
```Kuntsevich Case' May Replace `Mirzayanov Case': United States 
on Russia's Possession of Biological Weapons''] 
  [Text] Yesterday THE WASHINGTON POST newspaper, 
quoting an anonymous source in the Clinton administration, said 
that Russia continues to develop biological warfare 
agents--despite Boris Yeltsin's assurances to the contrary and 
the fact that the then-USSR signed the 1972 Convention on 
Banning Biological Weapons. The United States, however, does not 
accuse Yeltsin personally. The Clinton administration believes 
that he is ``not in the loop.'' 
  According to an anonymous source from Clinton's inner 
circles, the White House allegedly has ``irrefutable proof that 
Russia has a biological warfare program.'' Specifically, 
according to the newspaper, the point is the existence in Russia 
of some ``biological infrastructure of noncommercial purpose.'' 
According to the same anonymous source, information on the 
existence in Russia of a program to develop and produce 
biological weapons had been received from sources in the United 
States in Great Britain, including from a Russian scientist who 
immigrated to the United States last year. However, another 
anonymous source from the American White House, whose opinion 
THE WASHINGTON POST also quotes, believes that there is no proof 
to support such a sensational accusation. In his opinion, what 
may be meant here is the existence in Russia of ``specialized 
equipment of nonmilitary purpose,'' which nevertheless ought to 
be dismantled along with the military one. 
  So far there is no reaction from Russia. It is interesting, 
however, that the scandalous newspaper item in the United States 
coincided with the resignation of Anatoliy Kuntsevich, the 
chairman of the Committee on Convention-Related Problems of 
Chemical and Biological Weapons under the president of Russia. 
Lately he had been Russia's ``chief chemist,'' and many 
varieties of second-generation toxic agents had been developed 
with his direct participation. His functions included the 
development of a chemical weapons destruction program and 
monitoring its implementation (Moscow had always denied that it 
had biological weapons but nevertheless had a committee on its 
``convention'' on the grounds of ensuring compliance with the 
1972 Convention). The reason for Kuntsevich's resignation, given 
yesterday at a briefing by Vyacheslav Kostikov--``giving consent 
to transportation and storage of a serious consignment of toxic 
agents within the limits of a large city''--is questioned by 
everyone who is even minimally familiar with the chemical 
weapons problem. It is laughable to remove from the job a 
person, who in the past had sanctioned transportation and 
destruction of entire arsenals of toxic agents in densely 
population areas of the Volga region, just for giving consent to 
carry out only part of this program. 
  An interesting suggestion came from one of KOMMERSANT's 
competent sources, according to whom there is a connection 
between Russia being accused of continuing work on biological 
weapons and Mr. Kuntsevich's resignation (the assumption is that 
there has been a leak of certain information, which was the true 
reason for resignation). This assumption is indirectly supported 
by the fact that at the hearings in the former Supreme Soviet 
and in the State Duma Kuntsevich persistently understated the 
true size of Russia's combat toxic agents arsenal by a factor of 
seven or eight at a minimum (according to estimates by 
independent observers). 
  There is only one way, however, to counter Washington's 
accusations: The Yeltsin-Clinton joint statement, issued in 
Moscow in January, allows for the ``possibility of mutual visits 
to facilities and holding meetings of experts in order to 
monitor compliance with the Convention on Banning Biological and 
Toxic Weapons.''

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Frolov article ``Lateral Move: Generals Come and </F>
Go, Chemical Weapons Remain''] 
  [Text] General Anatoliy Kuntsevich, chairman of the 
Committee for Convention-Related Problems of Chemical and 
Bacteriological Weapons, has suffered a defeat. His dismissal 
by an edict of the president of the Russian Federation was 
arranged according to the new Russian traditions: The press 
knew about it before Kuntsevich's co-workers did. The 
formulation was also mysterious: ``for a single gross violation 
of his labor responsibilities.'' Isn't the president giving us 
to understand that Mr. Kuntsevich all but unleashed chemical 
war? One way or another, the general, who at first ran the 
military-chemical complex but then took upon himself the 
responsibility for its destruction, turned out to be unsuitable. 
  Apparently, it is considered that the incident is thus 
closd. 
Vil Mirzayanov, who let the city and the world know about the 
existence of Russian binary weapons, can now relax: Lefortovo 
[prison] no longer threatens him. The moral victory of the 
``military-chemical dissident'' is plain to see. As for whether 
the problem itself has been solved--that is still unclear: 40 
thousand tonnes of chemical weapons [CW]--which is just what has 
been officially declared--as before have nowhere to go outside 
Russia, and must all the same be destroyed. Besides which, no 
fundamental decisions have been made about the use of more or 
less safe technologies for destruction of CW in Russia. One can 
hardly expect that just a few personnel shifts will help.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 20 TASS -- Ratification by Russia of 
the Convention on Chemical Disarmament is designed to stabilize 
the situation in the entire world, said Lieutenant-General 
Anatoliy Kuntsevich, a full member of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences. He opened here on Wednesday the second international 
conference on chemical disarmament, ``Moskon' 94,'' with a 
presentation on problems of elimination of chemical warfare 
agents. 
  Kuntsevich said Russia now possesses the world's biggest 
stock of toxic agents. According to official data, it has 
accumulated on its territory over 40,000 tons of products by the 
military chemical complex, which is enough to poison every 
living being on the globe. 
  The issue of recycling chemical warfare agents is out of the 
scope of Russia's interests. Participants in the conference 
noted that introduction of imperfect technologies might create 
hotbeds of ecological tension not only on the cites of war gases 
elimination but also in other regions. Experience gained in 
this sphere by other countries, in particular by the United 
States, cannot be copied in Russia. Developments by Russian 
researchers are opposed by foreign experts just out of 
considerations of competition. Some Western theoreticians and 
industrialists insist that lewisite be incinerated, while 
Russian specialists suggest extracting highly-pure arsenic out 
of this hazard chemical agent. 
  Russian supplies of this valuable material used in making 
solar energy plants designed to replace atomic stations in the 
next century will somewhat squeeze Western arsenic producers on 
the world market. Thus, purely scientific problems raised by 
participants in the forum are acquiring a very different meaning. 
  Professor Vladlen Malyshev, adviser to the head of the 
Committee for Conventional Problems of Chemical and Biological 
Weapons under the Russian president, told TASS that ``Moskon' 
94'' had drawn chemical researchers from many countries. In 
coordination with their colleagues from the Russian Academy of 
Sciences and producers, they are seeking ways of safest 
destruction of Russia's huge stock-piles of toxic agents. In 
doing this, the adviser said, we should first of all take into 
account humane ecological problems and national interests. 
  ``At the same time, researchers and specialists of the 
military chemical complex understand quite well that 
ratification by Russia of the convention on chemical disarmament 
will stabilize the situation across the world, but this truth 
should also become an axiom for politicians, lawmakers and the 
public at large,'' Malyshev stressed.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Sitnikov] </F>
  [Text] United Nations April 26 TASS -- President Boris 
Yeltsin reaffirmed Russia's adherence to continue the moratorium 
on nuclear tests, General Secretary of the Geneva Disarmament 
Conference Vladimir Petrovskiy said at a press conference held 
at the UN Headquarters today. 
  ``During talks with the UN secretary-general at the 
beginning 
of April, President Boris Yeltsin had expressed Russia's 
adherence to continue the moratorium on nuclear tests which was 
initially declared by ex-Soviet president Gorbachev,'' 
Petrovskiy said. 
  Petrovskiy noted that similar steps taken by other nuclear 
states would considerably help the multilateral talks on 
concluding a universal nuclear test ban treaty, now underway in 
Geneva. He called ``realistic'' the conclusion of such a treaty 
by the end of 1996. He said that a draft treaty will be 
presented for consideration in June this year. 
  In this context, he said that participants in the 
disarmament 
conference welcome the decision adopted by the United States in 
March to extend the moratorium on nuclear tests until September, 
1995 as an ``important contribution to the creation of a 
favourable climate for talks.'' ``It is important to acknowledge 
that for the first time not only the U.S., Russia and Great 
Britain, but France and China are also now taking part in the 
talks, which directly affect their nuclear interests,'' 
Petrovskiy noted.

  [Text] Moscow 19 April -- The current level of financing 
the armed forces will leave Russia without nuclear weapons by 
the end of the century, Lieutenant General Yuriy Merkulov said 
at parliamentary hearings in the State Duma. The Russian 
Defense Ministry representative supported his conclusion by an 
analysis of the state of strategic nuclear forces. All the 
indicators are showing a negative tendency. Thus, according to 
him, the submarine missile fleet is being forcibly reduced, 
aviation regiments are not getting new bombers and the funds 
allocated are not enough to service the missile facilities of 
strategic missile forces. 
  Today's hearings at the State Duma Defense Committee ``On 
the 
implementation of the USSR-U.S. treaty on reducing and limiting 
strategic offensive armaments and on concomitant problems'' 
revealed the difficulties which Russia is encountering while 
implementing its obligations. It was noted, inter alia, that 
START-I has been ratified but has not come into force. Its 
implementation is linked to long-term operations aimed at 
eliminating weapons and to the volumes of funding. 
  According to committee chairman Sergey Yushenkov, today's 
hearings should be regarded as a preliminary stage of the 
START-II ratification process. In Yushenkov's view, it will 
soon be submitted to the State Duma for ratification. The U.S. 
side is interested in the results of the forthcoming 
examination. A group of U.S. Congressmen is expected in Moscow 
in May. The main purpose of their visit is to ascertain the 
partners' attitude to the implementation by Russia of the treaty 
obligations for further reducing strategic offensive weapons.

<F P=106> [Weapons Developer Georgiy Tsyrkov interviewed by Vladimir </F>
Gubarev: ``Reflection of the Nuclear Age: Georgiy Tsyrkov on the 
Fate of Nuclear Weapons Past and Present''] 
  [Text] I have been trying to interview Georgiy 
Aleksandrovich Tsyrkov for 25 years. I think it was a few days 
before a gas flare was extinguished in Urtabulak that Minister 
of Medium Machine-Building Yefim Pavlovich Slavskiy gave 
permission to me, a correspondent for KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA in 
those years, to witness an experiment. ``And now I will 
introduce you,'' he said, ``to our main `producer.' Take a good 
look at him, for a journalist he is a mine of information! He 
knows everything about weapons, but he won't talk about them. 
Bear in mind that I am permitting all subjects except 
`products,' you have no right to go near that subject. But don't 
worry: You won't be allowed to anyway.'' Yefim Pavlovich 
laughed, apparently quite pleased with his joke. 
  A few minutes later I met Georgiy Aleksandrovich Tsyrkov, 
chief of the ministry's most secretive chief administration. As 
it turned out, we established a good rapport. To be honest, I 
tried several times in recent years to strike up a conversation 
about weapons, but Georgiy Aleksandrovich always said no. And 
understandably so, for his assessments of various researchers, 
designers, events, successes, and failures could not be ``purely 
personal''--he held too high a position in the ``nuclear 
pyramid'' that had formed not just in our country, but also 
throughout the world. To bear responsibility for a nuclear 
weapons program is too heavy a load, and he always has to be 
cautious. After all, people are people, and the comments of a 
chief administration director are too important. Moreover, it is 
hard to assess one's own work from the side, for Georgiy 
Aleksandrovich Tsyrkov has been at the center of events from the 
creation and testing of the first atomic bomb to the present. 
  However, quite recently I nonetheless succeeded in 
conducting 
the much-sought interview. There was a good occasion for doing 
so: The birthday of Yuliy Borisovich Khariton is approaching, 
and I took advantage of it. Georgiy Aleksandrovich couldn't help 
but say some good things about Khariton. Then the discussion 
moved on to other subjects, although again, Tsyrkov could not 
speak with a level of openness that would fully open many pages 
of the history of nuclear weapons. And he was probably right 
again on this score: The time has not yet come when it might be 
possible to tell all secrets to the public. In both the past and 
the present, the development, production and testing of nuclear 
and thermonuclear weapons remain one of the most tightly guarded 
secrets of any state. And international treaties ban the 
proliferation of nuclear technologies--the world is too fragile 
and not as secure as some might think. 
  And so I present excerpts of my discussion with Georgiy 
Aleksandrovich Tsyrkov. We talked only about the tip of the 
iceberg; the bulk of it remains in the depths of an ocean of 
secrecy. 
  Gubarev: When did you first meet Yuliy Borisovich? 
  Tsyrkov: In 1948, when intensive efforts were 
under way to develop the first model of our nuclear weapon. I 
saw him at work, and he was energetic and demanding. He followed 
literally every measurement and carefully analyzed all areas of 
work. In general, Khariton was everywhere. At least that's the 
impression one got, and it was close to reality. 
  Gubarev: Where was that? 
  Tsyrkov: In Arzamas. I went there and ended up in 
the sector that was intensively engaged in developing the 
warhead, and so Yuliy Borisovich and I immediately established 
working contact. 
  Gubarev: What exactly were your duties? 
  Tsyrkov: To fine-tune the design of the first 
warhead in actual dimensions. Many parts were various laboratory 
models and so forth, and I was assigned to a group led by 
Zakharenkov. We were engaged in so-called ``physical final 
design.'' 
  Gubarev: In the celebrated ``green house''? 
  Tsyrkov: It was white then. 
  Gubarev: Where the security was especially tight, 
with the lowest rank being captain, as I recall? 
  Tsyrkov: That's right. 
  Gubarev: And Khariton was there all the time? 
  Tsyrkov: Of course. He hardly ever left. 
  Gubarev: He was the director, a theoretician, was 
he not? 
  Tsyrkov: That's incorrect. He was always not only 
a very talented theoretician, but also a very talented 
experimenter. He was interested in every detail, every 
experimental method. And for this reason his advice was always 
useful. He had an encyclopedic knowledge of nuclear physics, 
explosives, and metallurgy. It was simply amazing: His knowledge 
in all fields of science was so vast! I am not saying this for 
flattery, not because it is Khariton's birthday. It is the 
absolute truth! 
  Gubarev: But today many people in both the West 
and in our country write that the first atomic bomb was not our 
achievement, that all the data were obtained by intelligence 
operatives, and that Fuchs, in particular, provided detailed 
information about the bomb. 
  Tsyrkov: Yes, that's what they say, but I can't 
agree. I became convinced from my own experience that we had to 
work through literally every detail of the ``product,'' and very 
carefully at that. Naturally, I did not know at the time, nor 
did most people, that Fuchs had provided any materials. We 
didn't read anything, and we worked out all the details from 
scratch, from ``a'' to ``z.'' Maybe Khariton and Shchelkin read 
something. If Fuchs did pass something on, it was a general 
plan, but all the technology and details are incredibly complex. 
The verification methods, physical parameters, technology for 
making the most complex measurements and so forth--Fuchs did not 
pass on any of that, nor could he have! The general plan for the 
first American atomic bomb would have something else. Such data 
would be important, of course, especially for that time, but the 
development of our first model required the development of an 
entire complex of sciences and production, the acquisition of 
equipment and much, much more. At the time, we who were directly 
involved in the project thought that we were doing everything 
from scratch. We had no prompting. 
  Gubarev: How did it happen that you were 
immediately assigned to Zakharenkov's special group? 
  Tsyrkov: I worked in the Ground Forces Engineering 
Academy where professor Georgiy Iosifovich Pokrovskiy was head 
of a department and laboratory. He was a very talented 
researcher in gas dynamics and demolitions. 
  Gubarev: As well as a very talented artist! 
  Tsyrkov: That's right. And a very intelligent and 
kind man. And fortunately, I worked for him after graduating 
from the Moscow Higher Technical School. I was working on 
munitions. When they started selecting specialists for 
Arzamas-16, I got an offer to go there. Obviously, because I was 
already a demolitions specialist, and for that reason I was 
immediately assigned to Zakharenkov's group. 
  Gubarev: No doubt all that was happening seemed 
strange to you. 
  Tsyrkov: Absolutely. We realized what an enormous 
task confronted the country--it was essential to end the 
Americans' monopoly on nuclear weapons, and so everybody worked 
at full capacity. Everybody without exception. We worked till 
two and four o'clock in the morning, ignoring our own interests; 
there was just one desire--to develop the atomic bomb as quickly 
as possible. Incidentally, we never mentioned it, except perhaps 
only in whispers, although everybody know, of course, what we 
were doing. This, the work, is what was unusual. And the whole 
country was helping us. While it was sometimes hard to obtain 
equipment and various materials for Pokrovskiy's laboratory, 
there we had a ``green light.'' The work was interesting and 
enjoyable. 
  Gubarev: You are one of the few people present at 
the tests of the first atomic bomb. What did you do there? 
  Tsyrkov: I was assigned by General Pavel 
Mikhaylovich Zernov to the operations group, which consisted of 
three people: Yegorov, Maslov, and myself. We made sure that 
preparations for the first test proceeded on schedule. I had 
responsibility for ``scientific aspects of preparations,'' which 
is to say physical measurements, equipment, and preparation of 
the ``product.'' Maslov was in charge of design, and Yegorov was 
in charge of experimental production. Pavel Mikhaylovich 
obviously saw me as a fairly good organizer, and that path 
ultimately led to become director of the Ministry of Medium 
Machine-Building and the Russian Ministry of Nuclear Power chief 
administration in charge of producing nuclear weapons. When I 
went to the test range, it happened that I essentially become 
the assistant to Igor Vasilyevich Kurchatov for all matters 
relating to coordinating the work of all divisions and so on. In 
addition to organizational work, I also participated in 
Zhuchikhin's group, which prepared the ``product'' detonation 
lines. We were also in the tower, prepared the control panel in 
the command and control facility and the detonation lines. We 
were supervised by Kirill Ivanovich Shchelkin. 
  Gubarev: The man who was ``responsible'' for the 
bomb and who detonated it? 
  Tsyrkov: At that time he was neither a three-time 
Hero nor a corresponding member. 
  Gubarev: Were those good times? How do you look 
back at them? 
  Tsyrkov: I think those years were exceptionally 
unusual. The work was interesting, important, and enjoyable. We 
knew that we were doing something very important and essential 
for the country. 
  Gubarev: Who stands out in your memory most? I 
know that you consider Zernov your mentor. What about the others? 
  Tsyrkov: At the tests, Igor Vasilyevich Kurchatov. 
He was striking in terms of his energy, knowledge, and 
determination. You would look into his eyes and feel that some 
sort of radiation was coming from them. He had a stimulating 
effect on people. I probably have the strongest impression of 
Igor Vasilyevich at that time. 
  Gubarev: You met and worked with very many 
outstanding people. Tell me, for example, about Kirill Ivanovich 
Shchelkin. Unfortunately, little is known about him. 
  Tsyrkov: He was a thorough researcher. Not only 
was he involved in theoretical research on gas dynamics and 
nuclear physics; he also knew how to ``build bridges'' to 
practical work. He was a magnificent experimenter and organizer. 
He was Yuliy Borisovich Khariton's first assistant for nuclear 
weapons development. Unfortunately, he fell ill, left our work, 
and died shortly thereafter. It is said that he ``burnt out in 
his work,'' and this fully applies to Kirill Ivanovich Shchelkin. 
  Gubarev: What happened to you after the first bomb 
test? 
  Tsyrkov: I left Zakharenkov's group and was 
offered a position in the research department as a deputy to 
Yekaterina Alekseyevna Feoktistova. She was a very famous 
scientist and demolitions specialist. In that period I was 
engaged in the first research on magnetic commulation 
[kommulyatsia], which had been proposed by Andrey Dmitriyevich 
Sakharov. This refers to the direct conversion of the energy of 
a blast into magnetic energy. We conducted the first experiment. 
There were no instruments, and we wanted to convince ourselves 
that we were on the right path. Was it really possible to 
convert blast energy directly into magnetic energy? I proposed 
that we set up simple neon lamps. The first experiment was 
conducted in April 1952, and it was very successful--the lamps 
turned on. Sakharov's idea was confirmed. Back then this was all 
new; today this field has been developed and new experiments are 
under way. And only recent the two nuclear centers of Arzamas-16 
and Los Alamos began working together. 
  Gubarev: I can confirm that the experiment was 
successful--I was there! 
  Tsyrkov: Back then we were just getting started, 
taking the first steps. We continue to lead in this field, just 
ahead of the Americans. 
  Gubarev: And after that? 
  Tsyrkov: A new ``facility'' was being set up in 
the Urals. 
  Gubarev: Hold on! You mean you were involved in 
developing the hydrogen bomb? 
  Tsyrkov: You have good information. Indeed, I was 
also involved in developing the first hydrogen bomb and took 
part in the tests. 
  Gubarev: Was the detonation frightening? 
  Tsyrkov: No. I was in an emplacement from which 
the detonation was controlled. It was 10 kilometers from the 
epicenter. All the effects were known, and we felt them. Still, 
my main impression is of when we emerged after the shock wave 
passed, and we saw an enormous red cloud over us. It hung over 
us, frightening and unusual. We got in the cars and left, you 
couldn't stay there. 
  Gubarev: Did you take part in essentially all the 
tests? 
  Tsyrkov: I once tried to count them, but I 
couldn't. One hundred or 150, maybe 300--I don't remember. I 
need to take a look at the lists of participants in each 
experiment some time--they have certainly been preserved. 
  Gubarev: What took you to the Urals, to 
Chelyabinsk-70? 
  Tsyrkov: An accident, you could say. I went to 
Moscow, dropped in at the ministry, where we were working on a 
new piece of equipment, and I ran into Kirill Ivanovich 
Shchelkin. He immediately said that he wanted to offer me a 
position as his first deputy. ``Agreed?'' he asked. ``I would 
follow you to the edge of the earth!'' I answered. And that is 
how I was first transferred to the Urals. 
  Gubarev: Why was it necessary to create a second 
nuclear center? 
  Tsyrkov: Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev was Central 
Committee First Secretary at that time. And he felt that a 
backup for Arzamas-16 was needed. You will recall that not 
everything was calm in the world at that time. It was 1955, the 
height of the cold war, and there was a real danger that it 
would become a hot war. It that event, the ``facility''--that 
is, Arzamas-16--could be destroyed, and the country would lose 
its nuclear weapons developers, there wouldn't be anyone to 
service the weapons or designers to supervise their maintenance, 
and so forth. I think that is why the decision was made to 
establish Chelyabinsk-70. Secondly, any monopoly is harmful; 
without competition, a field can become stalled. And both 
research and design work go far more slowly in the absence of 
competition, as we said at the time. And indeed, once we had two 
institutes, there began a constructive competition of ideas, 
methods, and ways of solving various design problems. I think 
the appearance of the center in the Urals was of enormous 
benefit to the development of the nuclear weapons complex. 
  Gubarev: I would now like to ask you, as director 
of the chief administration in charge of both federal centers, 
what are the virtues of each one? And naturally, what 
shortcomings at Arzamas-16 and Chelyabinsk-70 do you see today? 
  Tsyrkov: Of course, Arzamas-16 has more 
traditions, its physical sector is more developed, and it is 
better equipped. The two centers probably have equal 
capabilities with respect to gas dynamics. Experimental 
production--that is, plants--is more advanced at Chelyabinsk-70, 
simply because it was established later, and hence the equipment 
is better. The theoreticians are close in terms of skills and 
talent. However, there is one difference: Chelyabinsk-70 has a 
younger staff, and so in the early years one sensed fervor, 
vigor, a search for unusual solutions. A certain conservatism at 
Arzamas-16 began to affect its work, while in the Urals, as is 
characteristic of youth, bolder decisions were sought and found. 
I don't want to talk about shortcomings, because it is my job to 
rectify them! Moreover, in my view, we ourselves can sort our 
problems out better and faster, excuse me, ``without the help of 
the public.'' 
  Gubarev: So secrecy plays a role? 
  Tsyrkov: How could it be otherwise?! We're not 
accustomed to giving interviews. 
  Gubarev: Georgiy Aleksandrovich, in what way do 
modern nuclear weapons differ from the ones you developed in the 
early 1950's? 
  Tsyrkov: The difference is enormous, very great 
progress has been made! I won't go into any design features. I 
will only say that given equal yields, weights and volumes 
differ by a factor of tens. The automatic equipment that 
controls detonation has changed sharply and unrecognizably! For 
example, the automatic equipment that sends signals to the 
warhead used to weigh 300 kilograms, while today it weighs 150. 
That's the kind of progress that has been made! The element base 
has changed, and our scientists and designers have made an 
enormous contribution to the development of this field of 
science and technology. Not just in nuclear hardware, but in the 
field as a whole. So the differences are very great. Not to 
mention the wide assortment of ``products'' that perform 
strictly defined functions. The progress is apparent not only in 
figures; one only need visit the Nuclear Weapons Museum at 
Arzamas and Chelyabinsk and then compare what you see with the 
weapons that are sometimes shown on television. You don't have 
to be a specialist. 
  Gubarev: Why so many weapons? I understand that 
the politicians demanded new projects from you, but you should 
have understood that such numbers of nuclear weapons were 
unnecessary. 
  Tsyrkov: I didn't have that problem, since we had 
little information. But there was real competition with a 
certain adversary across the ocean, to which we did not have a 
right to fall behind in technical terms. For example, we learned 
that the Americans were developing some sort of antimissile 
defense weapons. Were we not obliged to take appropriate steps? 
We understood that if we did nothing, our missiles wouldn't 
reach them, and hence they would acquire military superiority. 
The same applies to naval weapons and other types. That concerns 
types. As for the numbers of warheads, I honestly admit that I 
didn't even know; nothing was said of this to us the developers, 
everything was decided ``at the top.'' So nuclear weapons 
developers are not to blame for ``nuclear excesses.'' 
  Gubarev: The following question is logical: What 
is nuclear disarmament, in your view? 
  Tsyrkov: If it is to be carried out properly, we 
have to not only dismantle the nuclear warhead, but also convert 
the plutonium and uranium to a state in which they cannot be 
reused in weapons. Then you can talk about complete disarmament. 
But I don't think we can do that as yet, since the situation in 
the world is complex and dangerous. There are many so-called 
``threshold countries'' that could start testing and developing 
nuclear weapons. They are well known. They may not be able to 
develop sophisticated ``products,'' but they are fully capable 
of ``primitive'' ones. 
  Gubarev: What is a ``safe'' nuclear weapon? 
  Tsyrkov: To talk about it, I would have to reveal 
the design, and I don't want to do that. So I will confine 
myself only to some general aspects. A ``safe'' nuclear weapon 
rules out the possibility of nuclear detonation in any accident, 
by any operator error, in a fire, or when being transported. 
That was the first stage. The next one is to develop designs 
that cannot disperse plutonium. It is very dangerous, and 
everything possible is being done to make sure this never 
happens under any conditions. 
  Gubarev: I saw how a train car holding a container 
built up speed and then smashed into a concrete wall. But no 
scattering occurred? 
  Tsyrkov: That was just one of many tests. We are 
trying to ensure the full safety of our ``products''--it's one 
of our main tasks today. Fortunately, we have many years of 
positive experience--we have had no Chernobyl-type accidents 
with weapons. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the 
Americans. 
  Gubarev: When will there be real nuclear 
disarmament? 
  Tsyrkov: You're asking a bad question. 
  Gubarev: Why? 
  Tsyrkov: I think that nuclear weapons should 
exist. And they will. By treaty, we and the Americans will both 
have 3,500 warheads in the early 21st century. So nuclear 
weapons are going to stay. And 3,500 is a lot. The country's 
self-defense system requires that we retain a certain number of 
``products.'' 
  Gubarev: Have you ever thought that nuclear 
weapons would be used sometime? 
  Tsyrkov: We have always felt that our country's 
weapons are intended only for a counterstrike. No one in our 
country has ever thought that we are the sort of ``aggressors'' 
and ``nuclear monsters'' capable of launching a first strike. 
Nothing of the kind! And we worked as hard as we did, forgoing a 
lot of things in life, only because we knew that the defense of 
this country and our motherland was in our hands. We understood 
that policy. 
  Gubarev: If you had to start life over again, 
would you go into this field? 
  Tsyrkov: Absolutely! I am still happy that I was 
able to enter this branch of science. I have always been an 
``arms-maker,'' I found it interesting, and, finally, each of us 
should regard himself as a defender of the fatherland. That is 
real patriotism, if you please. As a youth I dreamed about 
becoming an officer, I wanted to enroll in a tank academy. But 
they didn't take me right out of school, and then I developed 
vision difficulties. And so I wound up in the military 
department at the Moscow Higher Technical School, at least close 
to the army. I became a munitions specialist. Life was hard for 
our generation, but we spared nothing--not even ourselves!--for 
the country, for the motherland. If you don't know that, if you 
don't feel it, it is impossible to understand why and how we 
developed nuclear weapons in such a short time.

<F P=106> [Article by Valeriy Yarynich, candidate of military </F>
sciences: ``Nuclear Strategies and the Control Factor''] 
  [Text] It is gratifying when from time to time our press 
publishes articles like that of V. Belous on the nuclear 
strategy of Russia (SEGODNYA, 9 February 1994). It is not even a 
matter of the content of the article, with some of the positions 
of which I do not totally agree. It is something else that is 
gratifying--our public is getting a greater opportunity to know 
and consequently, perhaps, to influence the resolution of 
vitally important and costly tasks. The time is receding into 
the past when fundamental decisions on questions of nuclear 
strategy and national security were the responsibility only of a 
closed military-political elite. 
  There is no need to fear that the involvement of independent 
experts and simply interested persons in this process will 
accidentally open up something that is truly forbidden--this can 
always be avoided. Moreover, in this connection the area of 
nuclear arms has a unique nature dictated by the absurdity of 
the unleashing of a nuclear war. In my view, this permits and 
even demands much greater openness than in the area of 
conventional arms. 
  In the mentioned article, V. Belous covered the strategies 
for the use of nuclear forces rather broadly and showed their 
dependence on the structure of the triad and the basic technical 
parameters of the weapons. But such an important factor as 
control plays an extremely important role precisely in the 
question of strategies for use. The possibility of 
implementation in the event of the necessity of a launch on 
warning [otvetno-vstrechnyy udar] or launch under attack 
[otvetnyy udar] (OVU and OU, respectively) depends to a decisive 
degree on the structure and characteristics of the control 
system. The author is correct when he speaks of significant 
inertia in the process of the development of strategic nuclear 
forces. This also applies fully to the control system--grouping 
of command posts of all levels, communications network, and 
complex with the corresponding computer facilities. The 
expenditures for them are commensurate with the outlays for the 
weapons themselves, and hence there must be close coordination 
of questions involving control, the combat capabilities of the 
weapons, and the means of using them as a unified whole. 
  If one analyzes the strategy for the use of the strategic 
nuclear forces from the position of control, then the following 
may be noted: It is obvious that there are no and in the future 
will not be any particular difficulties with the command and 
control of a first nuclear strike if, of course, we are forced 
into it. I share the point of view of V. Belous about the 
theoretical admissibility of such actions on our part under 
extraordinary circumstances, although the determination of the 
conditions under which the use of nuclear weapons may somehow be 
justified is a very complex and delicate problem. In any event, 
in this point the new Russian military doctrine (with all of its 
other shortcomings in a number of other questions) appears more 
logical than the previous declaration that we would not be the 
first to use nuclear weapons. In my view, that declaration did 
not have any practical value for one simple reason: Any 
``right-thinking'' potential aggressor cannot in his plans for 
attack bet on such promises by the potential victim; he is 
obliged to count on the worst for himself. My only objection to 
the author in this matter from the position of command and 
control is that submarines and mobile ground complexes are no 
less suitable for a first strike than are missiles in silos. 
  As for the concept of a launch on warning, here everything 
appears substantially more complex. Yes, today and in the 
foreseeable future the United States may rely on it along with 
other versions of the use of its nuclear forces. For Russia, 
such a strategy appears quite doubtful even now and all the more 
so in the future. The reasons are well known: The disintegration 
of the unified network of the missile attack warning system 
(half of the ground radar is now in the near abroad); our 
leadership has less time than does that of the Americans to make 
a decision (actually no more than 2-3 minutes) in the event of a 
strike from submarines in the Norwegian or Mediterranean Seas; 
the obligation of the president of Russia to coordinate his 
actions in an extreme situation with the leadership of Ukraine, 
Kazakhstan, and Belorussia, etc. But besides the ``perforated'' 
missile attack warning system and the rigid time limits, there 
are several other reasons that put into doubt the correctness of 
nuclear strategy relying on the concept of a launch on warning. 
  In the first place, the tendency in the reorganization of 
the 
Russian strategic nuclear forces in accordance with the START II 
Treaty is such that by the beginning of the next millenium the 
predominant role (in terms of the number of warheads) in their 
structure will begin to be played by the most survivable 
components--submarines and mobile land-based missiles. Such a 
structure of forces will be less able than today's structure to 
justify the need for haste in retaliatory actions. In other 
words, the calculated capacities of launch on warning and launch 
under attack will tend to converge. 
  Secondly, as V. Belous justifiably notes, the realization of 
the agreement on the mutual nonaiming of missiles leads in 
practically any version to abandonment of the strategy of launch 
on warning. The deeper is the reciprocal lowering of the 
readiness of the nuclear forces of the sides, the more time will 
be required for its prompt restoration in a crisis situation. It 
is difficult to expect the participants in such a sprint to 
reach the finish line simultaneously. And since the time limit 
for reflection is already used up today, delay by one side of 
even a few minutes will automatically put it in the category of 
a launch under attack. To be specific, as a result of all that 
has been said, today Russia essentially already finds itself in 
this framework and the concept of launch on warning is becoming 
more and more theoretical, although it does maintain its 
previous deterrent influence. 
  Such an objectively existing reorientation of the axes of 
nuclear strategy does not appear to be accidental. It is 
possible that in our time the general change in strategic 
thinking, the agreement with respect to a common scale of human 
values, and the development of ties dictate a renunciation of 
equilibrium on the razor's edge. In principle, the very idea of 
an immediate and impulsive nuclear reaction to the information 
from technical means of warning (even if they are ``absolutely'' 
reliable) seems absurd. What is needed is a second, insuring 
basis that in a hypothetical crisis situation would give the 
right to make a mistake to those people who are responsible for 
the decision. The strategy of launch under attack is such an 
insuring support. 
  But here is what is interesting. Following simple logic, we 
will immediately come to this question: If the grouping of 
nuclear forces and the system for its control, being oriented 
toward the concept of launch under attack, guarantee reliable 
deterrence, then why does one need enormous expenditures to 
support even the possibility of a launch on warning? Of course 
it is impossible to separate these things completely, and it is 
not necessary. Even under the concept of a launch under attack, 
for example, the role of the missile attack warning system will 
remain important, in particular, for the issue of warning 
information and identification of the aggressor country. Nor 
does the task of making decisions and sanctioning disappear. But 
there is a question, as they say, and one must seek to answer 
it. In any case, the problem of the changeover to a strategy of 
launch under attack as the primary basis for deterrence appears 
pressing today. This change cannot be accomplished immediately. 
Ideological and technical studies will be required on a national 
scale as well as at the international level, because by its very 
essence nuclear deterrence has a bilateral (multilateral) 
nature. Let us briefly examine the main difficulties and tasks 
on this path. 
  The concept of launch under attack was always criticized and 
is being criticized now under two main criteria: The low 
retaliatory power (especially later on with deep cuts in 
strategic offensive weapons) and the large probability of the 
complete failure of retaliation because of the preventive 
decapitation of the command and control sytem. The scope of a 
newspaper article does not allow a full illumination of this 
aspect and therefore we will limit ourselves to a conclusion. 
The whole essence of the question is how in the case at hand to 
deal with the notions of ``little'' and ``much.'' Formerly, each 
side made such an assessment independently, although from a 
mathematical point of view it is a matter of the risk of the 
partner and it would not be a bad thing to consider what he 
thinks about this. I personally assume that if the American 
``partner'' were suddenly to plan a surprise nuclear strike 
against Russia, he would be deterred by the possibility of the 
retaliation, let us say, of 10-15 warheads with a probability of 
0.1-0.2. Of course, these figures are taken as an example, but 
they make one think. Just recently, closed as well as open 
scientific investigations demonstrated the necessity of a launch 
under attack using several hundred warheads with a 
``guaranteed'' probability. (One must assume 100 percent!?) 
  Such considerations could appear scholastic if behind all of 
this were not specific structures and levels of nuclear forces, 
groupings of command posts, and automated systems for control 
and communications, that is, a great deal of public money. I 
think that it is practically impossible to achieve a calculated 
probability of retaliation at a level higher than 90 percent: We 
lack the means to create such a system of command and control. 
Fortunately, it is not necessary to do this. Magnitudes of 
0.6-0.7 will be more than adequate for deterrence, which appears 
more realistic even under the possibilities that we have today 
and gives a certain amount of confidence in the reasonableness 
of the switch to the concept of launch under attack. 
  Besides the indicated general assessment, a change to the 
concept of launch under attack will also require an analysis of 
the controllability of each component of the prospective 
structure of the Russian nuclear forces. And here a very 
voluminous and complex task comes on the agenda. By 2003 half of 
all nuclear warheads will be on board submarines. But the naval 
component of the Russian strategic nuclear forces is 
significantly harder to control than the Strategic Missile 
Forces. It turns out that we are undertaking a drastic reduction 
of those forces that have the most survivable and operative 
commmand and control system, and at the same time we are 
increasing our reliance on submarines, although it is well known 
what a complicated technical problem it is today reliably to 
deliver an order to a great depth under combat conditions. Our 
unprotected transmitting radio communications centers in the 
superlong-wave band are essentially the only means that we have 
to resolve this task but they substantially more vulnerable to 
conventional weapons than are analogous systems in the United 
States. All of this means that after the realization of the 
START II Treaty, with apparent external parity of forces, 
actually the power of our strategic nuclear forces will be 
substantially less. 
  There can be only two ways out: Either do not reduce the 
Strategic Missiles Forces or resolve the problem of dependable 
control of the naval component. Since it is impossible to stop 
the process of nuclear disarmament, the second choice remains. 
The fact of the existence of the problem of the control of 
submarines is the result of many years of underestimating this 
component, whereas primary attention was always given to the 
development of the missile forces. For this reason, as of today 
the Strategic Missile Forces have been most successful in 
resolving questions in the guaranteeing of control under the 
conditions of launch under attack. The technical work that the 
missile forces have done in several projects could also be 
utilized to resolve the problem of getting commands to deep 
submarines. This would make it possible to accelerate the 
establishment of a unified command of the Russian strategic 
nuclear forces, which appears expedient to ensure more nearly 
optimum use of nuclear weapons under the conditions of deep cuts 
in them. 
  The changeover to the concept of launch under attack is not 
limited to military-technical and economic aspects. Also 
required will be the continuous joint work of the ``potential 
enemies'' to support mutual confidence in the preservation of 
the deterrence factor from both sides. The deep cuts in arms 
will dictate such unusual cooperation. And here it is 
insufficient merely to demonstrate the weapons themselves, but 
it is also necessary to show the possibility of their use in the 
event of the need to do so. This applies in particular to the 
version in which both sides consider the strategy of launch 
under attack to be the main support of deterrence. 
  Showing our deterrent capability to the opposing side 
presupposes a certain degree of openness not only in nuclear 
arms themselves (which to a considerable degree has already been 
achieved today) but also in systems for their command and 
control. It is obvious that two extremes are unacceptable in 
this process: On the one hand, one cannot totally reveal the 
structure and characteristics of the control system, for this 
can increase the provoking aspect and threaten national 
security; but, on the other hand, it is also inadmissible to 
close this area completely, because lack of knowledge can 
gradually give other countries the illusion of Russian nuclear 
impotence, which is fraught with unpredictable consequences in a 
crisis. Apparently, the optimum solution is somewhere in the 
middle. 
  It appears that in the interest of supporting strategic 
stability it would be reasonable, along with the exchange of 
information on nuclear missiles between the sides, to begin a 
dialogue in the area of their command and control. The objective 
of such a conversation is to support confidence in the mutual 
capability of providing for nuclear deterrence under the 
conditions of sharp cuts in arms and taking into account the 
other big changes taking place in the world. This will be 
particularly pressing in the transition to the strategy of 
launch under attack. In the final analysis, such an exchange 
must lead to the development of a methodology for a joint 
quantitative assessment of the minimum necessary level of 
reciprocal deterrence. This would make it possible to reach an 
agreement on deeper reductions of nuclear arsenals and to save 
substantial resources. 
  In the light of everything that has been said above, it 
appears logical for both nuclear superpowers to put their main 
emphasis on the concept of launch under attack as the most 
``humane'' concept that corresponds to today's way of thinking 
and to simple logic. It is possible that launch on warning and 
launch under attack could even exchange places in the combat 
documentation at the command posts of the strategic nuclear 
forces. That is, launch under attack would become the basic 
concept and launch on warning an insuring concept. 
  In conclusion, I would like to say that the singularity of 
the problem of nuclear strategies lies in the fact that all of 
their variants will continue to coexist, and this connection I 
agree with the arguments of my respected colleague Vladimir 
Belous.

<F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Technical Sciences Gennadiy Ivanov, </F>
chief of a separate laboratory at the All-Union Scientific 
Research Institute of Experimental Physics, under the 
``Reaction'' rubric: ``Listen to a `Three-Star' 
Hero-Academician''] 
  [Text] The choice of ways to build defenses has always 
numbered among the particularly crucial tasks of state 
management. Therefore the interest of political scientists and 
experts in the recently adopted decision on structural changes 
to the composition of the national nuclear triad is 
understandable. For, under the treaty signed a year ago on 
reducing and limiting strategic nuclear arms (START II), our 
primarily ``land-based'' triad could turn into a ``sea-based'' 
one. 
  Since the polemic over this part of the treaty is 
continuing, 
it would be interesting to know the opinion on this score of 
Academician Yu. Khariton, one of the creators of the Russian 
``nuclear shield.'' Although the well known scientist has left 
the immediate leadership of the All-Union Scientific Research 
Institute of Experimental Physics (city of Arzamas-16), he 
continues to work in this ``field.'' After asking him to 
familiarize himself with the rubric ``Disarm, But Sensibly'' in 
PRAVDA 16 February this year, we learned his opinion of the 
questions touched upon there. Two points stood out particularly 
clearly. 
  First point. Yuliy Borisovich showed concern at the 
reorientation of our nuclear triad from ``land'' to ``sea'' -- 
as prescribed by START II. He is unable to find a proper 
explanation for such a decision and is not in possession of 
proper arguments in favor of that decision. 
  Second point. In his opinion, under the changed conditions 
of trust between the nuclear partners questions of the security 
of nuclear weapons must evidently take priority. Precisely this 
must be taken into consideration when choosing the carriers of 
such weapons and their basing modes. 
  Broadly speaking, security means, above all, protecting the 
environment and man from excessively dangerous technologies. In 
this connection the academician touched on the danger of an 
accident involving a nuclear-powered submarine stuffed with 
dozens of dangerously explosive solid-fuel missiles carrying 
hundreds of nuclear warheads. He emphasized the catastrophic 
nature of the consequences for nature of such an incident. The 
use of solid-propellant rockets with the U.S. space shuttles is 
also, in his opinion, a risky technical decision. The deaths of 
several U.S. astronauts have already confirmed this. 
  Festivities marking the academician's 90th birthday took 
place recently at the All-Union Scientific Research Institute of 
Experimental Physics. He is now honorary director of this 
institute. His opinion on the future of the national nuclear 
forces should be heeded, for it has already repeatedly been of 
tremendous benefit. But, so we understand, this time he is not, 
for some reason, being involved in resolving the problem of 
nuclear disarmament. And yet, of our scientists who developed 
nuclear weapons, Yuliy Borisovich is now the only ``three-star'' 
hero-academician.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian 
at 0400 GMT on 24 April carries a 2-minute report by Mayak 
correspondent Andrey Murashev from Tomsk region on the situation 
at the Siberian chemical combine, which ``is fraught with 
catastrophic consequences.'' 
  He says: ``This is how the staff of the enterprise has 
described the situation. In a letter addressed to Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Atomic Energy Minister Viktor 
Mikhaylov, it has stated that work on a defense order and 
production of electric power and heat bring only losses to the 
enterprise. On 1 April, the debt for weapon-grade plutonium was 
22 billion rubles, and for energy sources produced, 11 billion 
rubles. The enterprise developed a conversion program, which is 
being implemented at present and which includes, for example, 
the production of low-grade uranium for nuclear power 
engineering. But the payment for these orders will be made only 
at the end of the year.'' 
  Murashev says that due to the shortage of money, the combine 
cannot buy raw materials or pay wages to its staff, which 
demands that the Russian Government clear its debts and provide 
the long-promised credits. He points out that Russia's 
international commitments with regard to nuclear disarmament 
could be affected if the combine were to grind to a halt. 
  The correspondent went on to recall that the Siberian 
chemical combine was a major enterprise of nuclear production. 
``Two out of three nuclear reactors in the country that work for 
defense are situated here, in the closed town of Seversk, 
formerly known as Tomsk-7.''

  [Text] The second international conference ``Moskon' 94'' 
on the problems of chemical weapons has opened in Moscow. It is 
being held by the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Russian 
Committee for Conventional Problems. (Sergey Bogdanov), 
chairman of an international commission for preparing the 
implementation of the convention, told journalists that 
recruiting personnel and providing special equipment will cost 
Russia $18 million. 
  According to experts, within 10 years over 110,000 tonnes of 
toxic substances are to be destroyed in the world, including 
40,000 tonnes belonging to Russia and 30,000 to the United 
States.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 22 TASS -- ``Russia has absolutely 
unique technologies for the complex reprocessing of chemical 
warfare agents and nuclear wastes, which have no match in the 
world,'' member of the Engineering Academy Mikhail Sviderskiy 
said on Thursday, addressing a plenary meeting of the second 
international conference for chemical disarmament--``Moskon' 
94.'' 
  According to Sviderskiy, Russian scientists have developed 
and experimentally tested several production cycles for the 
complex reprocessing of chemical warfare agents and nuclear 
wastes. This allowed them to obtain new materials with quite 
unusual characteristics which, in the opinion of the expert, may 
be used in 21st-century technologies. 
  Sviderskiy said that the simultaneous reprocessing of 
chemical warfare agents and nuclear wastes would allow 
scientists not only to obtain materials with unique properties, 
but also to utilise huge quantities of depleted uranium 
accumulating on the planet. In order to process it into 
valuable products, Sviderskiy believes, ``we need an 
international programme involving all the advanced countries. 
Excessive amounts of nuclear wastes have been accumulated in the 
United States, France, Britain, Germany, and also Russia. They 
are just as dangerous for the planet's ecology as the existing 
stockpiles of chemical warfare agents.'' 
  ITAR-TASS was told by Academician Valentin Fedorov, who is 
also attending the conference, that chemical disarmament should 
not only make up for the spendings made on the production of 
chemical warfare agents, but should also yield profits to the 
Russian treasury. In his opinion, only the reprocessing of 
lewisite into extra-pure arsenic will yield Russia profits 
running into many billions and will provide top-quality raw 
materials for new technologies in the most advanced sectors of 
industry. ``We must not forget,'' the scientist stressed, ``that 
Georgia, our traditional supplier of arsenic, has stopped 
selling it to Russia. In the meantime, the need for pure 
materials of this group is growing. For instance, the United 
States will need more than 100 tonnes of extra-pure arsenic by 
the end of this century only for its electronic industry. Other 
countries are also badly in need of arsenic.'' 
  Chemical disarmament, based on technologies proposed by 
Russian scientists, Fedorov believes, meet the national 
interests of Russia. ``We must rely on our own forces, and we 
have no right to wait for somebody else to resolve our Russian 
problems,'' he stated.

<F P=106> [Andrey Vaganov report under the Forum rubric: ``Chemical </F>
Arms Should be Destroyed. The Whole Question Is How, Where, 
When?''] 
  [Text] The International Conference on Chemical Disarmament 
is winding up its work in Moscow today. Its organizers are the 
Committee for Conventional Problems of Chemical and Biological 
Weapons under the Russian Federation president, and the Russian 
Academy of Sciences. This is the second such international 
meeting since Russia signed the convention banning chemical 
weapons in Paris a little more than a year ago. As of today the 
convention has been ratified by five states--Sweden, Norway, 
Fiji, Mauritius, and the Seychelles. In order to go into effect 
the convention should be ratified by at least 65 states (this is 
expected to happen this summer). 
  In the words of Academician Anatoliy Kuntsevich, who spoke 
at 
the conference and who until recently chaired the Committee for 
Conventional Problems, it was clear right from the start that 
implementation of the convention posed Russia a number of 
difficulties, primarily economic ones. Russia, nevertheless, 
intends precisely to act on its obligations. Our country's 
withdrawal from the convention would in fact mean scrapping the 
convention, with tragic consequences for all humanity. 
  Academician Kuntsevich also stated for the first time that 
Russia, without waiting for the convention to go into force, had 
already started unilaterally converting to other uses the 
available technical potential for the production of chemical 
weapons (this in particular true about the facilities in 
Volgograd Oblast). The equipment has been partially destroyed 
and scrapped at factories producing the saman and sorin toxic 
agents. 
  The keynote of many reports at the conference was the need 
to 
reach a public and federal accord on the destruction of chemical 
weapons in Russia.

<F P=106> [Oleg Zolotov report: ``No Reduction in Secrecy''] </F>
  [Text] ``Moskon' 94,'' the Second International Conference 
on Chemical Disarmament, ended yesterday in Moscow. It had been 
opened by Academician Anatoliy Kuntsevich, who only two weeks 
ago headed the Russian president's Committee for the 
Conventional Problems of Chemical and Biological Weapons. 
  As expected, the organizers did everything possible to 
exclude critics of official chemical disarmament programs from 
the forum. However, three dissident scientists--namely Lev 
Fedorov, Vladimir Uglev, and Vladimir Petrenko--managed to get 
in, in the capacity of unofficial guests. But only 
representatives of the press were able to discover their point 
of view: All three were refused a place on the rostrum. 
Vladimir Uglev said in conversation with TRUD's correspondent 
that this was dictated by the Russian authorities' wish to dodge 
a decision on fundamental questions. In his words, whereas our 
American partners are attentively monitoring the quantitative 
indicators of the destruction of toxic substances, the methods 
of destroying these substances, which themselves present a 
serious threat to human beings, are still being kept secret and 
are monitored by no one. 
  The reasons for Kuntsevich's dismissal from the chairmanship 
of the president's committee are still unknown. Many link it to 
the fact that the academician's stance on chemical disarmament 
questions had started to encroach on Defense Ministry interests. 
His approaches required additional expenditure, and this 
displeased many people. As for Kuntsevich himself, he said in 
conversation with TRUD's correspondent: 
  ``I do not know why I was fired. As an ex-military man, I 
refuse to comment on the fact.''

    [Editorial Report] London ITV Television Network in English 
at 2000 GMT on 13 April in its ``Dispatches'' program carries a 
45-minute report entitled ``Pocket Neutron,'' in which 
correspondent Gwyn Roberts reviews the findings of an 18-month 
investigation he conducted into red mercury, a chemical compound 
allegedly used by the Russians to develop a smaller, more 
efficient nuclear warhead. 
  The program opens with various shots of a border crossing in 
Como, northern Italy, and goes on to include a brief interview 
with Italian Magistrate Romano Dolce on the smuggling of red 
mercury through Italy. Asked about its final destination, 
Dolce, speaking in Italian with English subtitles, says: 
``Israel, Iraq, Iran, South Africa, and the rest of the world. 
Even Western countries like the United States seem interested 
in red mercury. Why should it be top secret? Why this silence? 
Why this fear of talking about it?'' 
  Brief clips are then shown of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy during 
his visit to Serbia in February this year, followed by various 
street scenes in Moscow. Roberts then introduces a recording 
of an interview he conducted with an unidentified Kremlin 
official who, he says, has access to full government 
intelligence. 
  Roberts asks: ``What proof do you have that there is such a 
substance?'' The official replies: ``The hardest evidence is 
the report prepared by the first chief directorate of the KGB. 
This report was prepared especially for Boris Yeltsin. The 
conclusion of this report is that there is no doubt that red 
mercury exists.'' 
  Roberts asks: ``What military applications of red mercury 
are 
listed in the KGB report?'' 
  The official states: ``The production of fuses of high 
precision for conventional bombs. The production of fuses for 
nuclear bombs. The production of military equipment coating to 
avoid radar detection, production of warheads for self-guided 
missiles of high precision.'' 
  Asked whether red mercury represents new technology, the 
official replies: ``I think it does.'' He goes on to say that 
Iraq, Libya, Israel, and South Africa all wish to purchase red 
mercury because they all want nuclear weapons. 
  Roberts is then seen at the Moscow metro where he meets an 
unidentified former nuclear chemist who worked at a secret plant 
in the Urals. They are then seen in an apartment where the 
chemist is interviewed. Roberts asks why everyone denies that 
red mercury exists. The chemist replies: ``Because of reasons 
of secrecy.'' Roberts asks: ``Why should they want to keep it 
secret?'' The chemist says: ``Because it is the latest 
technology. If it is available to the Third World it may be a 
serious danger to existing order.'' 
  Still photographs are then shown of containers labeled RM 
2020, followed by clips of diagrams of how red mercury can be 
used and a government document on the existence of the 
substance. A person described as the head of the Promocology 
company exhibits what purports to be the raw material for RM 
2020. Scenes of the Moscow White House siege of 1993 are then 
shown. 
  Roberts then interviews an unidentified military scientist 
in 
Moscow, who he says worked as a nuclear physicist producing RM 
2020 for five years. 
  Roberts asks: ``Why is red mercury such a mystery?'' 
  The scientist replies: ``The fact is that it is the latest 
technology which allows an atom bomb to be made very simply.'' 
  Roberts asks: ``So you are saying that with red mercury and 
nuclear materials an atom bomb could be easily assembled by 
Third World countries?'' 
  The scientist replies: ``Yes, that could happen.'' 
  Asked how red mercury would be used, the scientist states: 
``It can reduce the critical mass and increase the power of the 
explosion.'' 
  The program continues by showing extensive shots of the 
nuclear research center at Dubna, including close-up clips of 
the accelerator and other equipment, followed by footage of the 
military scientist meeting with British nuclear expert Frank 
Barnaby. The program then shows U.S. nuclear expert Dr. Ted 
Taylor videotaping questions to be put to the Russian military 
scientist, cutting to shots of Russian elections. 
  The program then shows street scenes in Ekaterinburg and a 
meeting with former nuclear physicist Yevgeniy Korolov, who 
replies to Dr. Taylor's questions. 
  Korolov says: ``This technoloy is one of the most complex 
and 
one of the most dangerous. It enables you to create 
micro-nuclear charges. This means it can be used for nuclear 
terrorism.'' 
  The program continues with more shots of Ekaterinburg, 
followed by a meeting with another nuclear scientist willing to 
talk about red mercury who is shown Dr. Taylor's videotape 
questions. The scientist is then seen driving Roberts into the 
Urals to a plant where red mercury powder is said to be 
manufactured, showing medium and long shots of the plant against 
a snow-covered backdrop, followed by footage of a covert meeting 
with a weapons designer willing to answer Dr. Taylor's 
questions. His typewritten answers are shown to maintain his 
anonymity. 
  The program concludes with a visit by Roberts to a security 
company near Bonn, which trades with Russia and has business 
links with secret military plants producing radioactive 
isotopes. A document acquired in Ekaterinburg is shown which 
demonstrates that this company wishes to purchase 1,000 kg of RM 
2020, cutting to what is described as a list of the chemical 
properties of RM 2020.

  [Text] Some very interesting facts were made public today 
in Moscow's Artillery and Missile Forces Academy. A film crew 
from the Segodnya program were the only journalists present. 
  Correspondent Ivliyev: The nuclear strategic 
missiles based in Kazakhstan belong to Russia -- this is the 
sensational news reported today by the Colonel General Igor 
Sergeyev, commander in chief of strategic missile forces, at a 
briefing for foreign military attaches which took place in the 
Dzerzhinskiy Military Academy. 
  [Begin Sergeyev recording] A month ago, on 28 
March, an agreement was reached during the Russian-Kazakhstan 
talks on giving Russian status to the formations and units of 
strategic missile forces stationed temporarily on Kazakhstan 
territory. A timescale was also agreed for the withdrawal of 
nuclear warheads to Russian territory. [end recording] 
  Ivliyev: The agreement reached means that the 
personnel of the missile forces receive Russian citizenship. 
After the stage by stage withdrawal of missile force units from 
Kazakhstan is completed, the launch shafts will be dismantled, 
apparently by Russian specialists. Thus all three CIS states -- 
Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan -- on whose territory nuclear 
weaponry remained after the collapse of the USSR, now have a 
treaty with Russia on its removal. In a few years, if these 
countries fulfill their obligations, Igor Sergeyev stressed, 
they will become non-nuclear states.

<F P=106> [From the ``Itogi'' newscast: Video report from Kazakhstan </F>
by Aleksandr Gerasimov, identified by caption] 
  [Text] [Gerasimov over aerial view from 
helicopter] ``Zone of consequences of the politics of the 
absurd'' -- this is probably the most apt description of the 
stationing locations of Strategic Missile Forces units in 
Kazakhstan. This is the fourth year since the disintegration of 
the Soviet Union, and the leaders of the nuclear republics have 
still not reached agreement on the division of nuclear weapons. 
These weapons, used as a deterrent until recently, are being 
turned into an instrument of political blackmail. Those who 
stand to lose from this are our own security, and the thousands 
of servicemen serving in the missile forces. [video shows 
aerial view from helicopter, truck-mounted missiles on the move, 
extensive closeups of missile silo interior, two servicemen in a 
missile control room, more closeups of missiles] 
  Formally, anything located on Kazakhstani territory belongs 
to Kazakhstan. At the same time, Alma-Ata [Almaty] has acceded 
to the offensive arms reduction treaty and does not regard 
itself as the owner of nuclear missiles. However, as a result 
of the cooling of relations between Kazakhstan and Russia, which 
followed the rejection of Nazarbayev's concept of the ruble 
zone, nobody is currently able to clearly define the nuclear 
weapons' status. [video shows more closeups of giant 
missiles] 
  [Gerasimov to camera and over video of missiles above 
ground] The nuclear weapons concerned are 104 of the 
world's most powerful strategic missiles -- the SS-18 -- 
deployed in two divisions on the territory of Kazakhstan. The 
prevailing view is that these are Russian divisions. However, 
unlike in other armies, no state flag is flying above the 
headquarters. Admittedly, the main orders and the wages come 
from Moscow. Both the officers who have sworn allegiance to 
Russia, and the men who have taken the Kazakhstani oath and 
whose knowledge of Russian is poor, but who serve under Russian 
service regulations, are being paid in Russian rubles. 
  [Unidentified Russian officer addressing 
servicemen] No. 12 Platoon don gas masks! [video 
shows lineup of servicemen donning gas masks] 
  [Gerasimov over video of gas mask exercise] At the 
same time, Alma-Ata is also issuing menacing orders. Their 
implementation has resulted in the accumulation at nuclear bases 
of an impermissibly large number of warheads which have come to 
the end of their guaranteed service life. 
  [Akhmet Khashchegulgov, missile division commander, 
identified by caption] The accumulation of nuclear warheads 
in the missile division is in excess of the set norms. This is 
primarily the result of a decision by the leadership of the 
Republic of Kazakhstan banning the removal of nuclear warheads, 
missiles, missile fuel components, and other types of hardware 
from the territory of Kazakhstan. 
  [Gerasimov over more video of missile silo and control 
room scenes] According to our information from the Russian 
Government, the explanation for this stance adopted by Alma-Ata 
is President Nazarbayev's intention during his upcoming visit to 
Moscow to demand compensation for the highly enriched uranium 
contained in nuclear charges. In addition, strategic missiles 
offer a good bargaining chip in the political horse-trading 
between the two states whose relations are far from 
straightforward. 
  Officers here take the view that nuclear safety can be 
guaranteed only if their divisions are given the status of 
Russian military bases. For some reason, they believe here that 
this will be resolved during the upcoming meeting between 
Yeltsin and Nazarbayev. 
  Perhaps when this meeting has taken place, the local 
Kazakhstani authorities will stop cutting off the electricity 
and water supply to the military garrisons. In that case 
officers' children will no longer have to freeze in schools and 
kindergartens, and the officers on duty will no longer have to 
struggle to maintain the survivability of the nuclear missiles. 
Commanders will be able to find the money needed to repair heat 
supply networks, and the pipes for this work will no longer have 
to be flown in from Moscow. [video shows everyday life 
scenes, children] 
  To Senior Lieutenant Mikhail Kryukov and Major Vasiliy 
Salashnov, who are on alert duty deep down under ground, empty 
shelves in the garrison's stores are nothing new. Just like 
their comrades, they are constantly ready to implement orders. 
Nonetheless, most of the officers are dreaming about returning 
to Russia where conditions of service are more comfortable. 
Many of them remain in Kazakhstan only because of speedier 
promotion and because 12 months of service counts for 18 months 
here. [video shows more missile installations, store 
scenes] 
  Meanwhile, certain circumstances seem to indicate that 
Kazakhstan's leadership is not really seeking to improve 
relations with Russia. So for example, a strategic installation 
-- a Kazakhstani air defense unit located near the missile 
division at Derzhavinsk -- is completely snowed under. When the 
Kazakhstani air defense troops were still Soviet troops they 
protected the nuclear missiles from air attacks. Now the 
station is deserted. 
  A Kazakhstani-U.S. joint venture for extracting high-grade 
metals from missile silos which are being taken out of service 
is being set up in Alma-Ata. It appears that the Kazakhstanis 
trust Moscow less and less. The Russian authorities, in turn, 
are taking no steps toward a rapprochement with Kazakhstan. 
[video shows extensive, detailed views of nuclear missile 
installations in Kazakhstan]

  [Text] Ukraine has deactivated forty-six SS-24 missiles 
(removed nuclear warheads from them), Deputy Premier Valeriy 
Shmarov, who is responsible for the military-industrial complex, 
told Interfax-Ukraine. According to him, in the future 
``Ukraine hopes to get Western aid for the process of 
dismantling strategic nuclear missiles deployed on its soil.'' 
  As Shmarov maintains, ``by signing the trilateral statement 
concerning nuclear arms Ukraine undertook to dismantle missiles, 
and it is fulfilling its pledge without any aid from other 
countries.'' 
  He spoke about this with members of the American delegation 
visiting Ukraine now, the deputy premier said. 
  According to him, top priority will be given to removing 
from 
Ukraine nuclear warheads, whose safety guarantees will soon 
expire. 
  There are 176 strategic nuclear missiles on Ukrainian soil. 
Since the Russian, Ukrainian and American Presidents signed 
their statement concerning Ukraine's nuclear disarmament forty 
nuclear warheads have been removed from Ukraine in exchange for 
Russian fuel to be used by Ukraine's nuclear-power plants.

  [Text] At the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, multilateral 
consultations devoted to the magnitude and direction of 
assistance to Ukraine in dismantling its nuclear weapons began 
today, with the participation of representatives of 14 leading 
countries of the world. At the opening ceremony, Deputy Prime 
Minister Valeriy Shmarov delivered an introductory speech. 
  Western countries and international organizations are to 
examine a whole range of programs and projects in areas vital 
for Ukraine. Special attention has been paid to projects for 
converting defense industry enterprises, transforming their 
production into civil purposes, resolving social problems, and 
building housing for servicemen released from duty. 
  The multifarious consultations are aimed at establishing 
specific cooperation between Ukraine and leading countries of 
the world in resolving one of the most painful issues facing 
Ukraine -- the safe elimination of nuclear weapons inherited 
from the former Soviet Union.

  [Text] Kiev April 20 TASS -- Ukrainian Vice-Premier Valeri 
Shmarov said at multilateral consultations in the Ukrainian 
Foreign Ministry on Tuesday that several projects and programms 
on liquidating nuclear weapons and conversion are of top 
priority for Ukraine. 
  They were offered for consideration to several Western 
countries which expressed a desire to give aid to Ukraine in 
this sphere. 
  The main attention was given to projects concerning the 
conversion of munitions factories, their reorientation on the 
output of civil products, solution of social problems, 
construction of housing for retiring servicemen and their 
retraining to learn civil professions and trades. 
  Asked by journalists to comment on this important event, 
Shmarov said: ``It is very pleasant that many states as well as 
influential international organisations responded to our 
problems of liquidating nuclear weapons. 
  This is a great political support for us. As for real 
economic aid, we hope for receiving what they can give.''

<F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk by </F>
unidentified correspondent at ceremony to open a new children's 
clinic in Kiev on 19 April; no video available -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] 
  Correspondent: Leonid Makarovych, the paradoxes in 
life today are endless, are they not? Today, the Russian press 
publishes materials on the intention of Ukraine to capture Kuban 
and develop new types of mass destruction weapons, while the 
Ukrainian president is opening a clinic for children. 
  Kravchuk, laughing: You said it yourself and this 
is paradoxical indeed. Paradoxes in the press--in this case in 
some of the Russian newspapers--are, unfortunately, paradoxical 
indeed. I have read this publication today and I am under the 
impression that this is a kind of myth. Somebody thought: Why 
not create a myth? So this myth is being passed off as some 
reality. 
  I can tell you right out that nobody has issued any 
instructions for missiles to be retargeted, neither the 
president nor the Defense Council nor other state structures of 
ours. It has not even crossed our minds. As they say, it is 
only imaginative writing presenting it as reality. 
  Nor is there, was there, can there be, or will there be any 
development of any mass destruction weapons, because in general 
we as a state have been against mass destruction weapons right 
from the outset. We have no chemical or bacteriological 
weapons, and we as a state have determined our position with 
regard to eliminating nuclear weapons. 
  The impression is, you know, that this is some kind of 
unhealthy perception of Ukraine and I can say no more. I would 
just like to say that this is simply a myth. [passage omitted; 
on opening the clinic]

<F P=106> [Article from Vybir Independent Information Agency special </F>
for NARODNA ARMIYA: ``A Non-Nuclear Ukraine. Too Cheaply?''] 
  [Text] Should Ukraine be a non-nuclear state? That is 
the general question that includes thousands of other questions 
that have been officially resolved today. One step in that 
direction was the signing of the trilateral agreement in Moscow 
and the ratification of the START-1 Treaty by the Ukrainian 
parliament. But it cannot be considered closed, not only because 
Ukraine has still not yet joined the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty, but also because the official stance does not always 
coincide with the views of the leaders of the existing political 
forces. 
<H5>  The Right </H5>
  The head of the Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party, 
Stepan Khmara, feels that the signing of the trilateral 
agreement is a violation of the Constitution and a political 
stunt. The stance of UNSO is based on the postulate that Ukraine 
should be a nuclear power, since it has an age-old enemy right 
next door. By turning over the nuclear weapons of the former 
Soviet Union, Ukraine should without doubt simultaneously think 
about creating ``its own nuclear bomb'' today. 
  The head of the KUN, Slava Stetsko, had a negative opinion 
of 
the signing of the ``trilateral agreement'': ``...KUN feels that 
this statement could not be signed, since after all it was not 
the only way out of the situation; quite a few influential 
politicians and commentators have stated that they understand 
why Ukraine is not rushing to disarm--it is afraid of Russia. 
The more so considering the recent evidence of aggressiveness... 
Russia is trying to return the former republics to its lap 
somehow, announcing its claims to the right to carry out 
`peacekeeping operations' on that terrain. They are maintaining 
their troops in the Central Asian republics and arranging 
provocations in the Caucasus and the Transcaucasus, as a result 
of which blood is being spilled. So returning to the problem of 
nuclear weapons, I would point out once again that the 
trilateral declaration is a mistake. We are not against 
disarmament in general. We are for a non-nuclear Ukraine. But in 
a non-nuclear world.'' 
  Unequivocal support for the idea of a strong nation state is 
characteristic of the representatives of the right wing; such a 
state is impossible today without nuclear weapons as a factor in 
restraining instability in its foreign-policy priorities with 
Russia, from their point of view. 
<H5>  National Democrats </H5>
  The convictions of some representatives of the 
national-democratic bloc are close to the positions of the 
right-wing parties. And although they advocate the idea of a 
non-nuclear Ukraine, they also would accept nuclear weapons as 
one of the determining factors in the security of the state and 
property, and which should be sold as dearly as possible. 
  Mykhaylo Horyn, the chairman of the Ukrainian Republican 
Party, feels that the trilateral agreement is an exceptionally 
important document that requires profound analysis, but ``to 
accept it as is, as it is now, would signify a serious blow to 
Ukraine.'' 
  Rukh leadership member Ivan Zayets holds a similar 
viewpoint. 
He asserts that ``there is no document today that discusses 
weapons, as well as strategic nuclear weapons, in full. We have 
no document of what the concrete guarantees of the national 
security of Ukraine will be. We have no document today that 
revokes the territorial claims of Russia against Ukraine.'' Ivan 
Zayets feels that as a consequence of the incarnation of this 
document, Ukraine will be destroying not only the nuclear 
warheads, but will also have to destroy the entire 
infrastructure--the aircraft, the ships, the missiles, the silos. 
  Larysa Skoryk expresses complete support and understanding 
of 
the actions of the president. She considers the transfer of the 
nuclear weapons to Russia the first step toward getting out of 
the economic crisis that Ukraine is experiencing today. ``The 
resolution of the nuclear problem, this hopeless nuclear 
`kindling' that lies on our territory and which an outside hand 
could always ignite, from which we have gotten nothing but worry 
and a negative attitude toward ourselves, would open up a new 
way for Ukraine to receive urgent credits, of which, I am 
convinced, the very first portion should go to resolving the 
issues of food and power resources.'' 
<H5>  The Centrists </H5>
  The political parties on this portion of the spectrum have 
indicated clearly that Ukraine should be a non-nuclear state, 
and should accept nuclear disarmament as a contract from which 
the greatest profit should be obtained. Leonid Kuchma, who today 
holds a position close to that of the PDVU, for example, sees 
this contract as unsuccessful: ``They already have us wrapped 
around their finger, whatever may be said now.'' 
  Volodymyr Filenko, the leader of the Party for the 
Democratic 
Resurrection of Ukraine [PDVU], says that ``the trilateral 
agreement pertaining to START-1 signed in Moscow could be 
considered positive as a whole, but the details could be 
disputed: How much of a security guarantee there is, whether the 
nuclear fuel be returned to Ukraine, and guarantees of 
compensation to Ukraine.'' 
  ``One of the basic program principles of the Green Party is 
to fight for a non-nuclear Ukraine. We are succeeding in this, 
but there are certain reservations. While entirely supporting 
nuclear disarmament, for example, we have reservations that in 
the case of our use of nuclear fuel, we will once again be 
energy-dependent. Because the nuclear fuel will be processed 
abroad, and we will have to buy it...,'' says Volodymyr Kononov, 
the head of the Green Party of Ukraine. 
  The social democrats hold a similar, clear-cut position. 
Yuriy Zbitnev, the head of the Social-Democratic Party of 
Ukraine: ``Ukraine should, of course, be a non-nuclear state in 
the process that has started today as a whole.'' But in 
evaluating the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine, he 
said pointed out that ``in any case the signing of the agreement 
on nuclear disarmament will be an extraordinarily great step for 
Ukraine. The evaluation of that step should come in the next two 
or three years. The compensation will provide us with electric 
power, power resources and the possibility of creating a 
stabilization fund for the hryvnya. If the agreement really does 
provide an impetus for the world disarmament process, then it 
will be a substantial result. But if this process puts us once 
again on our knees before neighboring states and threatens the 
security of Ukraine with regard to the Near East, where the 
processes of nuclear disarmament are still only being planned 
(and it is doubtful that they will be developed in the near 
future), then the evaluation will of course be quite different.'' 
<H5>  The Left </H5>
  Sympathy with the idea of the nuclear status of Ukraine is 
felt to be lost among the socialist camp. This question is being 
considered within the context of a system of collective 
security, which cannot be created today without tensions in 
mutual relations with Russia. Oleksandr Moroz, the head of the 
Socialist Party of Ukraine: ``We have taken on the resolution of 
a great many issues that have not permitted us to be occupied 
with the economy or strengthening the independence of our 
nation. National security is not guaranteed anywhere in the 
world through one's own forces alone. The mechanism of 
collective security operates all the time to this or that 
extent. We, in our jingoistic patriotism and ignorance, have 
rejected that. What has the state gained in that regard? 
Nothing. We have only lost the status of a nuclear power, a high 
technical level of production, and scientific and technical 
potential.'' 
  It is obvious from all of the aforementioned that the 
leaders 
of the leading political forces, independently of their 
positions with regard to the nuclear status of Ukraine, for the 
most part do not accept the form in which the withdrawal of 
nuclear missiles from the territory of Ukraine has been 
proposed. Most of them approve of the idea that this step was a 
mistake in the foreign policy of Ukraine. It is becoming more 
and more comprehensible that the question of nuclear status has 
no easy solution.

<F P=106> [Viktor Krokhmalyuk commentary: ``Beware: </F>
Disinformation!''] 
  [Text] KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA published an article by its 
correspondent Olga Musafirova under the title ``The Hetman 
[Bohdan Khmelnytskyy] With a Nuclear Mace; There Is No Strength 
To Hold It, and It Is Terrifying To Drop It.... Khmelnytskyy Is 
Agitated by Rumors.'' Here is a quotation from that 
publication: ``At the site near Bohdanivtsi, 20 liquid-fuel 
SS-18 missiles seem to have been disabled and dismantled. There 
arose some problems with the storage of the `liquid,' and 
heptyl, a poison of group `S' that is extremely toxic for all 
living organisms, is already poisoning the surrounding woods.'' 
  In this connection, a news conference was held at Ukraine's 
Security Service Administration in Khmelnytskyy Oblast. 
  What actually happened? Missile specialist Ye. Arkhypov has 
this to say: 
  ``Today, about 90 launchers have been taken off the alert -- 
one regiment here and one -- in Pervomaysk. The technology for 
pouring out the liquid fuel is such that no environmental damage 
may occur as a result. It is carried out by the method 
involving high pressure, and, therefore, not a single drop of 
heptyl may get either into the soil or onto the people servicing 
these operations.'' 
  Colonel Ye. Arkhypov also said that the system of control 
over the course of dangerous operations has a triple and, in 
some cases, fivefold guarantee. Work on servicing missile sites 
is conducted, as usual, according to plan and systematically, 
and specialists from all countries arrive there, so that it 
would hardly be possible to conceal any problems from them. 
  In the near future, Khmelnytskyy missile specialists are 
expecting U.S. ecological safety inspectors; they will see what 
they themselves want to see and not what the Ukrainian side will 
recommend. Therefore, it is unlikely that our missile 
specialists may conceal anything even if they wanted to. 
  As emphasized at the news conference, nuclear fuel is too 
valuable a commodity to export or to sell at a very cheap price 
to CIS countries, in particular, to Russia, as some people are 
suggesting. The fuel remains on site, and then some of it is 
sent to special arsenals for storage and some -- for processing 
at chemical plants. Such a component of propellant fuel as the 
oxidizing agent is a very important product for manufacturing 
mineral fertilizers. Today, we must also think about Ukraine's 
space future. 
  Recently, an accord was signed with Kazakhstan on the joint 
use of Baykonur. We will be able to operate Ukrainian missiles 
with our own fuel instead of paying thousands and millions of 
dollars for this. 
  I will add my personal remark: Even following the 
KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA material under the provocative title 
``Khmelnytskyy Is Agitated by Rumors,'' the situation in the 
town is calm, and I did not see any signs of fear, panic, or 
complaints against the missile specialists stationed here.

  [Text] Twenty-four hours ago, the cabinet approved a law 
setting out the military plans for the next six years. Defense 
Minister Francois Leotard has now given more details on the 
French Army's equipment. The priority will be the modernization 
of weapons, nuclear and nonnuclear weapons. Francois Leotard 
was interviewed by Frederique Barrere: 
  [Begin Leotard recording] Modernizing our forces 
means, of course, keeping our nuclear dissuasion for ever. The 
law provides 130 billion francs to preserve and renew our 
nuclear capacity. So, we have decided to continue our efforts 
as far as the M5 missile is concerned. It will start to be used 
in the year 2010, not in 2005. We will continue the program 
concerning four SSBNs of the new generation. The basic weapons 
we need are taken in due consideration: Leclerc tanks, the Tigre 
helicopter, the nuclear aircraft carrier Charles De Gaulle -- 
which will be operational by mid-1999 with its flotilla of naval 
version Rafale interceptor- planes . The Air Force will also 
have Mirage 2000D; as you know the first planes of this kind are 
being used in Bosnia-Herzegovina now. Lastly, in line with our 
crisis-management strategy, we will start a program for 
long-range precision weapons which should be completed by 2001.

<F P=106> [Interview with General Gallois by Dominique Garraud; place </F>
and date not given: ``General Gallois: `We Must Not Be the 
Mercenaries of Europe''' -- first paragraph is LIBERATION 
introduction] 
  [Text] In 1956, General Pierre-Marie Gallois was one of the 
founders of France's nuclear deterrence doctrine. Now aged 82, 
he is still a leading expert in military strategy. He will 
stand in the European elections for a non-electable place on the 
voting list headed by [former Socialist Defense Minister] 
Jean-Pierre Chevenement. In the wake of the government's White 
Paper on Defense presented last month, General Gallois is soon 
to publish his own version: ``Black Paper on Defense'' 
(Footnote) (Payot Essays, 85 French francs) 
  Garraud: France is today the only Western European 
country actually increasing its military spending. Is this a 
worthy priority? 
  Gallois: I would have preferred the spending to be 
devoted to improving and perfecting military technology for the 
essential task of keeping France out of war situations through a 
policy of intimidation. The White Paper proposed a 
``long-distance interventions force'' taken from a stock of 
130,000 men capable of intervening 7,000 km from France. Even 
with the assistance of our allies, that would require 
considerable resources. It is an excessive ambition, unless we 
accept to become the mercenary force of the Europe under 
construction, a role that I would not like at all. 
  In the past 12 years, France has mounted or participated in 
25 military expeditions. During this time, our European 
partners have invested in vocational training, scientific 
research, economic and industrial development, the environment, 
and improving living conditions. The question is whether we 
have the resources to continue in this way. 
  Garraud: What, in your opinion, should France's 
military priorities be? 
  Gallois: Today, public opinion will no longer 
tolerate military expeditions in which the country suffers 
losses, which would quickly be considered excessive. That is 
why the only policy I can envisage is one of intimidation. 
France should strive to develop long-distance weapons, which 
can be operated without endangering the lifes of the people who 
serve them. 
  With so-called ``intelligent'' weapons, the combatant 
becomes 
more of a director than an actor. I do not think this change 
has been understood. 
  Garraud: What implications should such a change 
have for the military programming law? 
  Gallois: In absolute terms, all major programs 
designed for the Cold War should be downscaled so as to open up 
new avenues of research. For example, when you compare the 
Rafale with the American F117 bomber, it is clear that the 
latter is stealthy, whereas the former is not. The airplane 
should now be viewed more as a way of getting weapons airborne 
than as an actual combat machine in its own right. It is the 
intelligent missile that should do all the long-distance 
destruction, the plane having turned tail for home a long time 
before. To date, we have not taken this view. We invest money 
in the plane rather than the missile. That is a conceptional 
error. The Leclerc tank is a traditional land army tank, but it 
is not suited to the current circumstances. What good is a 
maneuver force today? We have to take new directions. 
  Garraud: Your priority remains the nuclear 
deterrent. How do you see this evolving? 
  Gallois: We have to keep the strategic oceanic 
force, which is almost invulnerable. I would add several 
submarines with much more accurate, very-low-power ballistic 
missiles. In this way, we could intervene at great distances 
from France without having to massively deploy conventional 
forces, as the United States did for the Gulf war. 
  Another component, although not absolutely essential, is a 
mobile weapons system based in France and consisting of 
double-capacity ballistic missiles, such as the Pershing 2's. 
These would be accurate and could take nuclear or conventional 
warheads. In this way, we could confine the belt of instability 
which is taking shape from Japan, across North Africa, to 
Argentina and Brazil. Many of the countries in this belt have 
ballistic missiles and we must have the means of deterring 
anyone from using the slightest element of blackmail against us. 
These countries must say to themselves: ``If we use these 
weapons, we run the risk being replied to in kind.'' 
  Garraud: To modernize the deterrent, do we still 
need to carry out nuclear tests? 
  Gallois: Nuclear testing should be restarted. If 
we decide to stop testing definitively, as the president of the 
Republic has said, we will be taking a tremendous risk. The 
American experts themselves say that these tests must be 
continued, if only to check the quality of weapons as they get 
older. This cannot be done by simulation. A limited amount of 
testing will always be needed. 
  Garraud: You also recommend that we acquire an 
extremely expensive antimissile defense system. How can we do 
this in the current context of budget constraint? 
  Gallois: I would put it in a collective European 
context. Certain things that ensure our security and reinforce 
our scientific capabilities can be done at the national level, 
but there are technologies that we cannot acquire because they 
are out of range of our resources. Similarly, if the Europeans 
decide on long-distance interventions, clearly the corresponding 
fleets of cargo and transport planes can only be put together 
collectively. 
  This should be included as a conditional section in the 
military programming law. What I do not like about the White 
Paper is that it assumes that other countries will agree with 
our scenarios.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: ``CIS Disarmament: With Bonn's Money </F>
and High Technology''] 
  [Text] With German ``know-how'' and 20 million German marks 
[DM] (for 1993-94) for the time being, the FRG Government wants 
to accelerate the abolition of chemical and nuclear means of 
mass destruction in Russia and Ukraine. At the moment, the 
Russians can destroy only about 2,000 nuclear warheads per year. 
On the territory of the former Soviet Union there are 30,000 
nuclear warheads and, in Russia alone, 40,000 tonnes of chemical 
weapons. It would take 15 to 20 years to destroy these stocks. 
  An internal paper of the Foreign Ministry says that, in 
October 1993, an agreement was concluded with the Defense 
Ministry in Moscow on the construction of a pilot plant for the 
destruction of the chemical combat agents lewisite and yperite 
in the area of Saratov (final price DM62 million). A mobile 
laboratory for the analysis of combat agents was handed over to 
the Russians already in December 1993. The costs for the 
``disarmament aid for chemical weapons'' in 1993: about DM5 
million. For the accelerated disarmament of their nuclear 
weapons Russia and Ukraine have asked the Federal Government 
this year for equipment as well as control and safety systems at 
a value of about DM17 million.

  [Text] The UN Commission on Disarmament opens for a session 
in New York on 1he 18th. In this context the Russian spokesman 
in the commission, Igor Sherbov, said that the Disarmament 
Commission of the United Nations is a major body in the system 
of multilateral talks in this sphere. Nearly all the states, 
members of the world community, work in it. At its coming 
session the commission will consider recommendations for the 
process of nuclear disarmament within the framework of 
international peace and security. The agenda also includes the 
drafting of recommendations to regulate international shipments 
of conventional armaments and the prevention of illegal trade in 
arms. This primarily concerns the so-called crisis regions and 
prevention of the delivery of arms to international terrorism. 
  What objectives will the Russian delegation pursue at the 
session of the UN Disarmament Commission? Igor Sherbov notes 
that first of all one should try and call the attention of the 
commission to the priorities of the country in the field of 
multilateral disarmament. What is meant is ensuring a consistent 
fulfillment of agreements already reached, raising the 
effectiveness of the mechanism of talks on disarmament. The 
delegation will see to it that the session approve documents 
reflecting such a key issue as a complete and comprehensive ban 
on nuclear tests. It is important to consolidate the progress 
already made in this sphere by the Geneva conference. The 
commission should also call attention to the need of increasing 
the effectiveness of the Nonproliferation Treaty, which expires 
in the year 1995. 
  Russia is interested in having all achievements in science 
and technology used first of all for peaceful purposes. 
Interest is shown in making universal regimes in the system of 
export control of dual-purpose technology and preventing an arms 
race in qualitatively new systems of weapons. Achievements in 
science and technology should be used for a collective 
development of control instruments and for technical assistance 
in the realization of agreements on disarmament. This would 
make it possible to reduce expenditure on international control 
of action on agreements on the limitation of arms and 
disarmament, said Igor Sherbov.

<F P=106> ["(km)"-signed report: "An Order Was Issued To Destroy the </F>
Smallpox Virus; However, It Was Probably Never Carried Out"] 
  [Text] Prague -- Despite the fact that Vladimir Kotlar, 
the former senior employee at the research laboratory where the 
smallpox virus was tested in the 1970's, claims that he issued 
instructions that it be destroyed, another employee at the same 
institute has cast doubts on its destruction. According to this 
source, who does not wish to be named because he fears a 
negative reaction from the public, the virus was not destroyed 
out of the sheer indolence of the staff involved in the 
research. "The scientific recommendation from the World Health 
Organization that supplies of the smallpox virus be destroyed 
were ignored by us out of laziness, not out of any evil 
intentions," he declared. 
  The ministerial commission that is now looking into the fate 
of the dangerous virus has -- to date -- only Kotlar's statement 
at its disposal. He has admitted that, although he ordered the 
virus's destruction, he was not personally present for it. 
Moreover, according to the findings so far, there are no 
records of this. 
  Meanwhile, the Defense Ministry rejects the possibility that 
the smallpox virus was unknowingly preserved in the Czech 
Republic until this February, that is, until the entire bank of 
viral strains was completely destroyed. 
  According to some employees from the military institute, a 
test tube with this virus could -- of course -- have been 
deposited along with the other viruses in a special container 
with liquid nitrogen and did not have to be registered in the 
official record of the bank of viral strains. 
  Doctors recorded the last case of smallpox in Czechoslovakia 
in 1976 when a Czechoslovak Airlines pilot was diagnosed as 
having the disease after he returned from Bombay, India. The 
Czechoslovak Health Service stopped inoculating the population 
against smallpox in 1980 after the World Health Organization had 
ascertained that mankind was no longer at risk from a smallpox 
epidemic.

<F P=106> [Report by Jaroslav Kmenta: "The Army Is Getting Ready for </F>
Permitted Reconnaissance Flights Over Foreign Countries"] 
  [Text] Prague -- Military experts are putting the 
finishing touches on the special reconnaissance aircraft that 
will be able, based on the so-called Open Skies convention, to 
carry out inspection flights over foreign countries. The 
convention, which has been signed by 27 countries so far, will 
at the end of the year open up the airspace over most of the 
North American continent, Europe, and the territory of the 
former Soviet Union. 
  The Czech Army will be using for reconnaissance a modified 
AN-30 transport aircraft, manufactured in the former Soviet 
Union, that will be equipped with the prescribed navigational 
instruments and the permitted types of sensors. The machine 
will be equipped so as to be able to carry, in addition to the 
crew and the inspection team, representatives of the country 
being inspected. 
  "The convention makes possible the control of whether some 
country builds new military facilities or concentrates its units 
near a neighbor's border. Such extensive measures or movement 
of troops cannot be concealed from modern instruments," one of 
the representatives of the Defense Ministry Foreign Relations 
Section said. 
  According to the convention, the inspection teams must 
report 
their flights in advance, and they may enter the airspace of any 
country only once a year. 
  Bilateral treaties permitting reconnaissance flights over 
the 
territory of another state have existed so far between Germany 
and the United States, for instance, and between Romania and 
Hungary. 
  Of the other international conventions that are to reinforce 
mutual trust among European countries, the Czech Republic joined 
the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe earlier, and 
signed the Vienna Documents on limiting convention arms. 
According to these treaties, the Czech Army should destroy 
another 417 tanks, 43 armed combat vehicles, 52 artillery 
pieces, and 38 fighter aircraft by 15 November.

carriers, and artillery pieces. 
  In keeping with the tradition of CFE verifications, the 
Hungarian team includes a foreigner, a Romanian observer. 
  Hungary has informed the European states concerned that 
under 
the CFE agreement it would destroy 15 artillery weapons with a 
caliber of over 100 millimeters at Tapioszecso, near Budapest, 
between April 19 and May 23. To verify the action, a British 
team of observers, including a German and an Italian, arrived in 
Hungary on April 18. The observers are escorted by a Hungarian 
team.

<F P=106> [Article by Igor Ryabov under the rubric "Scandal": </F>
"Academician Transfers to Reserves"] 
  [Text] The president has relieved Anatoliy Kuntsevich 
of his duties as chairman of the Committee on Convention-Related 
Problems of Chemical and Biological Weapons. Is he the last 
victim of the "chemical war" in the Moscow City Court? 
  It is still not known who personally initiated the trial of 
Vil Mirzayanov. The collective authorship is more or less clear: 
the State Security Committee and the military-industrial 
complex. But there is a live soul behind every departmental 
initiative. Somebody has to give an order, after all. 
  Jurists believe that the Mirzayanov case came about as a 
result of the absurd legal arrangement which allows people to be 
charged with disclosure of state secrets, the list of which 
itself constitutes a secret. It is absurd, they say, but what 
can one do--such is the law. But even this assumption prompts a 
question: Well, who initiated the charges, who is the champion 
of complying with laws that violate human rights? 
<H5>  Death Transported Through the City </H5>
  Both during the trial and after it, the greatest suspicions 
as to who was behind the prosecution initiative centered on the 
Committee on Convention-Related Problems of Chemical and 
Biological Weapons and its chairman, Lieutenant General and 
Academician Anatoliy Kuntsevich. 
  Many scientists who took Vil Mirzayanov's side believed that 
Anatoliy Kuntsevich played the role of watchdog of the 
military-industrial complex in the "chemical-bacteriological" 
sphere. And did everything from his high position to keep the 
shroud over the process of chemical disarmament and destruction 
of the chemical warfare stockpile as tight as possible. The 
lieutenant-general, on the other hand, categorically denies any 
involvement in this matter. 
  There will be no investigation of the topic "find the 
author." The problem does not encroach on state interests. The 
rights and interests of citizen Vil Mirzayanov have been 
restored--he has been released from the Sailor's Rest prison. 
What else could one want? So all that is left for us to do is 
sound out private opinions and follow the fate of the 
"suspects." And the latter depends to a large extent on those 
who are in a position to conduct a secret (internal) 
investigation. 
  Yuriy Baturin, the president's national security adviser, 
promised during his meeting with chemist-scientist Vladimir 
Uglev at the time Vil Mirzayanov was on trial that justice would 
prevail. And the case was indeed dismissed. Should we take 
Anatoliy Kuntsevich's dismissal on 7 April as a triumphal march 
of justice "a la Baturin"? 
  The official wording for Anatoliy Kuntsevich's dismissal is 
a 
"one-time gross violation of duties." The military had 
transported a large consignment of chemical waste through the 
streets of a major city, which is categorically forbidden. 
Anatoliy Kuntsevich had given the go-ahead on the transport. 
Cause for dismissal even without Mirzayanov's case. Except not 
in our country. Usually such flaps are ignored. 
  Would Anatoliy Kuntsevich have been dismissed had it not 
been 
for the public outcry during the Mirzayanov trial? Why was it 
not done before the court hearing, when many scientists talked 
unceasingly about violations in the destruction of chemical 
weapons and about much greater quantities of chemical substances 
in military warehouses than the convention committee's data 
implied? 
<H5>  No Revenge, Please! </H5>
  Vil Mirzayanov has the most subjective opinion of Anatoliy 
Kuntsevich. Cannot be any more subjective: Vil Mirzayanov was 
spending time with criminals while Anatoliy Kuntsevich continued 
to occupy the chair of chairman of the convention committee--the 
main plaintiff. 
  "Kuntsevich's dismissal is a result of the fact that there 
comes a time when the truth comes out," said Vil Mirzayanov in 
an interview to NOVOYE VREMYA. "Kuntsevich is not a 
scientist--he is a nomenklatura general. He probably has not set 
foot in a laboratory for the past 40 years." 
  In the chemist's opinion, the convention, which the 
committee 
had signed, does not ban the development of chemical weapons. 
And this development had been going on, says Vil Mirzayanov, 
even before criminal charges were brought against him. In the 
opinion of Mirzayanov's colleague Vladimir Uglev, many types of 
chemical warfare substances are being hidden in Russia under the 
guise of training and reserve toxic substances. 
  "The convention has already been submitted to the Duma for 
discussion, and destruction of chemical weapons must commence 
within a year after ratification. Russia is not ready for it," 
maintains Vil Mirzayanov. "As long as Anatoliy Kuntsevich was in 
charge of the convention committee, nothing was done in this 
respect in the sphere of chemical disarmament. Kuntsevich only 
fooled everyone, announcing new plans and acquisition of new 
credits." 
  A quantity of 40 tonnes had been officially stated for 
convention purposes, but Vil Mirzayanov says there are 70 tonnes: 
  "The generals decided to destroy the `extra' 30 tonnes their 
own way, to which evidence in Shikhany points. That is precisely 
why the recent secret move of chemical substances had taken 
place--those, from the undeclared category." 
  If this is so, Lieutenant General Anatoliy Kuntsevich is 
completely in the right place, and Vil Mirzayanov is being 
unfair to him: Kuntsevich's doctorate thesis was on the topic of 
decontamination of combat equipment contaminated with soman. 
Academician Kuntsevich does know how to destroy toxic substances. 
<H5>  Out of Sight </H5>
  How Anatoliy Kuntsevich is viewed abroad is a special topic. 
Vil Mirzayanov contends that "in the West, Kuntsevich is 
considered a trickster, not an authority--as an IZVESTIYA item 
said." 
  Mirzayanov is supported by THE WASHINGTON POST's Jeffrey 
Smith--on the subject of bacteriological weapons, however, which 
were also under Anatoliy Kuntsevich's jurisdiction: 
  "Inspections by American and British specialists confirmed 
that a considerable part of the biological infrastructure 
associated with the Russian military remained largely intact." 
  That Russia continues to develop bacteriological weapons was 
reported in 1993 by a defector--a high-ranking scientist who 
participated in bacteriological weapons development. 
  "In Washington's opinion," writes Smith, "Kuntsevich's 
activities stood in the way of progress in resolving the 
biological weapons problem." 
  It is obvious that one of the reasons for Anatoliy 
Kuntsevich's dismissal was the hostile attitude toward him on 
the part of the American White House. One of the birds Boris 
Yeltsin aimed to kill by signing the order to fire the 
academician was the desire to remove an obvious irritant from 
the Americans' sight. 
<H5>  Authoritative Person Needed </H5>
  According to MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI, before signing the order 
the president offered to let Anatoliy Kuntsevich resign on his 
own. The committee chairman procrastinated, and when he did 
write a letter of resignation, it was too late. 
  Member of the convention committee Igor Vlasov refused to 
say 
anything about the chairman's dismissal: 
  "The president's press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov has 
made 
all the comments. I am not going to comment on rumors and 
conjectures." 
  Aleksandr Ivanov is currently handling the duties of 
convention committee chairman. According to Igor Vlasov, on 7 
April Anatoliy Kuntsevich became ill and issued an order 
temporarily naming Ivanov acting chairman. After that, the 
president's edict came out. Anatoliy Kuntsevich is still ill, 
and visiting a polyclinic. 
  "He has all the proper medical certificates," says Igor 
Vlasov. 
  Igor Vlasov maintains that he is not aware of the 
president's 
offer to allow Anatoliy Kuntsevich to resign voluntarily. Also, 
"it is not for us to decide who will head the convention 
committee." 
  "If an authoritative scientist rather than a military man 
like Kuntsevich heads the committee, the resignation will make 
sense," suggests Vil Mirzayanov. He named as potential 
candidates Aleksey Yablokov and Vitaliy Goldanskiy.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow NTV in Russian at 1800 GMT on 22 
April on the Vesti newscast carries a report on the Plesetsk 
missile test center in the town of (Mirnyy) in Arkhangelsk 
oblast. The correspondent says the site is not shown on maps 
because it is where military missiles have been tested since 
1957. He says the country knew nothing of these tests for 
decades, including the successes or failures. 
  A film shows an aerial view of the town, a convoy of 
unidentified missiles on the road, and a missile transporter 
erector launcher [TEL] driving down a forest road. 
  The correspondent says these scenes are being shown for the 
first time, adding that disasters during missile launches in 
1973 and 1980 resulted in the deaths of more than 50 people. 
Video clips then show an explosion, with two soldiers dragging a 
third past flames. 
  The correspondent then interviews an unidentified lieutenant 
colonel in front of a memorial. The lieutenant says: "I took 
part in organizing the funerals. Of course, it left a big 
impression. When I come here, I can see that moment." 
  The correspondent continues: "The Plesetsk range was not 
only a testing center. Events connected with the Cuban missile 
crisis in the 1960's form a special page in its history. Soviet 
missiles had been delivered to Cuba. The United States decided 
to destroy them from the air." 
  A video recording shows TELs manoeuvring and being driven 
out 
of hangars and along a road. The video then shows Major General 
Nikolay Moroz, assistant commander in chief of the Missile 
Forces, identified by caption, who says. "When it became known 
that the Soviet Union had 12 missiles with the range to reach 
America, this fact had a great influence on the politicians." 
  The correspondent says: "Some of these missiles were aimed 
at the United States from Plesetsk. Today there is a different 
atmosphere at the range. This is the secret computer center. 
Here they follow American missile testing. Moscow and 
Washington have agreed to exchange information on these kinds 
tests, and in accordance with the agreements the Americans have 
installed this equipment in PLesetsk. The Russian specialists 
have installed their own control instruments in the United 
State. Today the soldiers at Plesetsk are not only studying 
launches of other people's missiles; they are also developing 
Russian military missiles for the 21st Century. The Plesetsk 
state missile testing range. The fourth-generation Topol 
[SS-25] missile is being developed here [as heard]. The video 
shows the correspondent standing in front of an SS-25 road unit.

  [Text] [Announcer Tatyana Komarova] We would now like to 
show you for the first time footage our correspondent managed to 
film. Missiles brought out of Belarus under an agreement are 
being placed on alert duty in Russia. 
  Mikhail Zotov: In the village of Manan-Muchash, 
which means -- short end -- in the Mari language, not far from 
Yoshkar-Ola, a regiment equipped with missiles brought out of 
Belarus under the trilateral agreement has been placed on alert 
duty. You can see the missiles behind me. They are the newest 
strategic missiles, codenamed Topol, SS-25. 
  The military says these strategic mobile missile complexes 
have no computer program devised to eliminate targets in any 
country that might be a potential adversary. However, the 
on-board electronic systems are capable of retargeting the 
complex within a few seconds. Radar-proof warheads can reach any 
point in the opposite hemisphere. 
  Despite the fact that the army is troubled by many problems, 
the missile troops are relatively well-off, and in the words of 
Maj Gen (Nikolay Moroz), are capable of maintaining a guaranteed 
minimum of security and independence for Russia. 
  Meanwhile, the West is keeping an close watch on the Topols 
in Mari territory. Radar stations have registered the fact that 
our neighbors' satellites were monitoring the redeployment of 
the missiles. Space, however, remains the only place from where 
an outsider can watch Russian strategic missiles being placed on 
alert duty. On the ground it is only reporters from Ostankino's 
First Channel who can do it. [Video shows a truck-mounted 
missile, an electrified wire fence with wasteland and a small 
building in the background; missile complexes on trucks being 
transported along a road] 
<H5>  Note From The Editor: </H5>
  FBIS is trying to get this footage. If you are 
interested in getting a videotape of this program, please call

<F P=106> [Report by Jochen Piest: "`Superplague' for the Enemy"] </F>
  [Text] According to the London SUNDAY TIMES, Moscow has 
developed a fatal biological weapon and is continuing work on 
it. The denial by the Russian defense ministry sounded like the 
old stuff from the times of the Cold War: "It is all a 
never-ending campaign by the West, with the obvious aim of 
diverting attention from its own biological armament programs." 
  The report says that there is no remedy for the Russian 
"Super Plague": Spread with bombs and missiles, the newly-bred 
bacteria causes a terrible death, with blood spitting, 
poisoning, and decomposition of the lungs. Within a few days, 
entire areas can be "cleansed" of enemies, while cities, 
factories, and transport routes fall into the victors' hands 
intact. Russian laboratories can breed 200 kilograms of the 
deadly bacteria in a week -- enough to kill half a million 
people. 
  The Soviet Union was among the countries that signed the 
convention banning biological weapons in 1972. Today, the 
Moscow defense ministry does not deny that the bacterial bomb 
was developed in spite of this agreement. 
  In the 1980's, 25,000 people, including top biologists, in 
18 
research institutes and six factories worked for the "Bio 
Remedy" program. Meanwhile, former President Gorbachev was 
touring the West, denying the existence of any biological 
weapons programs, and being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 
his disarmament initiative. His successor Yeltsin admitted 
possession of the banned weapon and stopped the program by 
presidential resolution no. 390 in April 1992. 
  Even Yeltsin's environment adviser, Aleksey Yablokov, doubts 
that the generals are observing the resolution: "The field of 
biological and chemical weapons is extremely difficult to 
control. Heaven knows what is going on in the individual 
laboratories." 
  If anyone from these secret laboratories dares speak about 
their work, they are not safe from persecution in modern Russia 
-- as experienced by Vil Mirzayanov, a professor of chemistry. 
From 1965 to 1992 he conducted research into chemical weapons; 
and in 1992 he disclosed that the Russian Army, contrary to 
Yeltsin's assurances, is having a new generation of chemical 
weapons developed -- the signing of the Paris convention on 
banning these weapons in early 1993 did not make any difference 
to that program. 
  Publishing these details in the MOSCOW NEWS put him straight 
into prison, from where he was released only after massive 
public protests. He was not charged with spreading false 
statements, but with betrayal of state secrets. 
  As evidence, chemists from the army stated in a secrete 
document that Mirzayanov's claims were both true and secret. 
  This document, which has been made available to STERN, 
proves: Russia is developing a new binary chemical weapon. Its 
vicious effect only develops on hitting its target, when two 
chemicals combine to a deathly poison. Since each of the two 
substances is harmless on its own, they easily circumvent the 
Paris Convention. "Our army does not want to disarm. They only 
want to get rid of their old garbage," Mirzayanov said. 
  With disposing the inherited weapons alone, the generals 
would be more than busy: According to official statements, 
40,000 tonnes of chemical weapons are stored in Russian arsenals 
-- the Americans have some 30,000 tonnes. 
  Meanwhile, the Russian Army is keeping its "chemical troops" 
in shape. Sixty kilometers east of Moscow, soldiers are 
exercising a chemical weapons attack on an old model: They are 
attacking half-timbered houses, a country guest house and a 
church -- of a small German town.

Viktor Tkachenko, Gennadiy Makarychev, and Nikolay Zhukov, 
identified by caption; figures in brackets denote broadcast time 
in GMT in hours, minutes, and seconds] 
  [Text] [131416] Tkachenko over aerial view of 
truck-mounted SS-25 missiles on the move: The Strategic 
Missile Forces are Russia's main deterrent. In accordance with 
Army reform, they will be allowed to comprise only 1,300 
lauchers, all with single warheads, by the year 2005. At 
present fourth-generation strategic missiles are used for alert 
duty in the Russian Army. Will there be fifth-generation 
missiles? What will the missile of the 21st century be like? 
  Our country's military scientists have carried out a study 
of 
possible scenarios of strategic nuclear forces' operations and 
came to the conclusion that the missile of the 21st century will 
be the RS-12M Topol ballistic missile, or SS-25 as it is known 
in the West. It is produced in Votkinsk [Udmurtia]. The 
autonomous launcher weighs 80 tonnes, the weight of the nose 
section is one tonne. The Topol has been used for alert duty 
since 1985. 
  Yu. Fedin, commander of autonomous launch installation, 
identified by caption, against the backdrop of an SS-25 
missile: Tests of this hardware have been carried out. I 
have been involved in testing this hardware since 1983. It is 
very, very reliable. 
  Krondo: Since 1984 600 combat training launches 
have been carried out at the Plesetsk test range. In recent 
years tests have become much more infrequent in the absence of 
funds. 
  A. Polukhin, deputy commander of the division's duty 
forces, identified by caption: It hurts, of course. 
Elsewhere people are working flat out, so to speak, and they 
are being fully funded. Meanwhile we have been put on starvation 
rations. There is no doubt about it, it hurts. 
  Krondo: How will this reflect on Russia's combat 
readiness? 
  Polukhin: Very badly, there is no other way. 
  Krondo: Since Russia and its allies in the CIS 
have always had and always will have their own regional and 
global interests to look after, only the nuclear missile status 
can ensure the Russian Federation equitable participation in the 
solution of worldwide and regional problems. [131601] [video

  [Text] Moscow May 17 TASS -- Ukraine is ready to sell 42 
strategic bombers which it inherited from the former Soviet 
Union to Russia, but claims eight billion U.S. dollars for them 
(15 trillion roubles), while Russia believes 217 billion roubles 
are enough. 
  Although Russia needs the planes it will not pay such a 
price 
for them. "If Ukraine does not agree to our terms the planes 
will remain on its territory," Liutenant-General Yuriy Merkulov 
from the Defence Ministry told TASS. 
  Military experts told TASS on Tuesday that Russia needs the 
bombers as they are not liable to reduction under the START I 
Treaty. They will be decommissioned only after their service 
time expires. 
  At present the Russian Air Force has 77 heavy bombers and it 
is hard to build new ones because of financial difficulties. No 
changes are planned by the Defence Ministry regarding the number 
of bombers. 
  Defence Ministry sources also told TASS that Russian 
estimates were made in 1993 prices and took into account 
ammortization costs, but Ukraine objected to such an approach. 
  At the same time Kiev has no money and technical 
possibilities to maintain the bombers in proper order by itself.

<F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Historical Sciences Irina Zhinkina, </F>
member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of the 
United States of America and Canada: "The Aim of the 
Maneuvering over the ABM Treaty"] 
  [Text] The Clinton administration is making increasingly 
strenuous efforts to have the provisions of the 1972 ABM Treaty 
reviewed. The intensive hearings on this problem that are being 
held in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee provide evidence 
of the fact. Recently, for example, it examined once more the 
White House's proposals to lift the restrictions on the number 
of ABM systems capable of destroying missiles with an 
operational range of up to 2,000 miles. 
  In this connection it should be noted that a law on ABM 
defense went into force in the United States back in December 
1991. It incorporated the old approaches of strategic nuclear 
deterrence and new ones which reflect the trend toward the 
regionalization of U.S. military policy. The law obliged the 
defense secretary to step up the development of theater ABM 
systems with a view to the subsequent selection of the most 
promising options for deployment in the mid-nineties, using cost 
and efficiency as the criteria. 
  The law also talks about the creation of ABM systems to 
protect the country's territory against limited ICBM strikes, 
including those resulting from accidental and unauthorized 
launches, as well as missile attacks from Third World countries. 
It should be noted in this context that under the 1972 ABM 
Treaty both the USSR and the United States are allowed to have 
only one ABM complex each -- around Moscow and at the Grand 
Forks air base respectively. Nevertheless, the U.S. ABM law 
envisages the modernization of the complex at that air base as 
an initial step in the deployment of an all-embracing ABM system 
for the continental United States in the near future. But that 
is nothing less than a clear departure from the 1972 Treaty. 
The Clinton administration has not only confirmed its readiness 
to implement these amended Reagan plans but even, by all 
accounts, intends going further in that direction. 
  Thus the law leads one to conclude that the United States is 
trying to split ABM defense into two parts and "separate" 
strategic ABM defense from theater ABM defense. It is doing 
this, on the one hand, to retain greater freedom in case Russia 
insists on the precise observance of the 1972 Treaty and returns 
to the old principle of the comprehensive examination of 
offensive and defensive arms. On the other hand, some of the 
strategic tasks formerly assigned to strategic nuclear arms are 
being "reassigned" to nonnuclear systems, which will then be 
dispersed and stationed where possible outside U.S. territory. 
And finally, while continuing the program of creating an ABM 
defense system in this new interpretation, the United States 
retains the lead in the sphere of the latest military 
technologies. 
  But why did the idea of ABM deployment not disappear into 
the 
past along with the end of the Cold War? The threat of 
communism seemed to have been "dispelled." Russia and China are 
taking the path of market reforms and the democratization of 
society, and the main U.S. adversary -- the USSR -- has 
disintegrated. Treaties on unprecedented reductions of 
strategic offensive arms have been signed. The 1994 accord on 
the mutual non-targeting of nuclear weapons against 
installations in the United States, Britain, and the CIS is 
being implemented. The nuclear weapons remaining outside 
Russia's territory are gradually being dismantled and there are 
prospects of further progress in this direction. Thus the issue 
is not solely one of communism and the "Soviet threat." 
For the United States one problem now is how to maintain and 
expand its sphere of influence in the world and how to ensure 
the further promotion of U.S. interests and capital in the 
absence of the old consolidating factor -- the threat to the 
West from the communist camp. It is no coincidence that, with 
the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact and the USSR, U.S. experts 
began trying to foist on world public opinion a new "scare" to 
the effect that Moscow could not control its own missiles and 
nuclear weapons and that they would now be sold off and 
proliferate around the world. 
  Of course, it may be conceded that these fears are to a 
certain extent justified. But that problem could have been 
settled in the process of bilateral relations without a 
clamorous worldwide propaganda campaign. You cannot help 
suspecting that this campaign has been undertaken for the 
purpose of preparing public opinion for the possible deployment 
of new U.S. arms systems, including theater ABM defense. In any 
event the Pentagon is already modernizing the ground-launched 
Patriot missile and the sea-launched Aegis missile right now for 
use against short-range missiles. Work is also in progress to 
create an ABM complex to destroy high-altitude targets or THAAD, 
as it is known. 
  A quite specific question arises here: In that event, what 
is Russia supposed to do? It must be stressed here that, 
whereas previously the USSR was still able to link the ABM 
problem to the question of reducing strategic offensive arms, 
Russia no longer has that ability now. In 1989, first E. 
Shevardnadze at the meeting in Wyoming and then M. Gorbachev in 
Malta agreed, under pressure from the Americans, to abandon the 
comprehensive examination of the problem of strategic offensive 
weapons and ABM defense. Admittedly, in the event of a 
full-scale American deployment of a strategic ABM defense system 
we can announce our withdrawal from the START treaties. But 
from the military viewpoint that will probably be too late, and 
from the political viewpoint it will not be very productive. 
  It may also be assumed that the United States will try to 
share the blame for breaching the ABM Treaty with Russia by 
offering it some participation in its own program, with 
appropriate rewards. Such attempts are already being made. 
However, let us not flatter ourselves about the results. 
Suffice it to recall how the United States treated the British 
at the dawn of the nuclear era: The Americans made use of their 
interim achievements in the creation of nuclear arms and then 
broke their promise to share the end results of that work. 
  Nevertheless, it would be wrong to think that Russian policy 
is ready to let the ABM question slide. Our country is 
conducting a fairly intensive negotiation process with the 
United States in which it is upholding the inviolability of the 
1972 ABM Treaty. Its position is also based on the opinion of 
those American politicians and specialists who believe that the 
revision of that treaty's provisions could undermine the 
international efforts to ensure the nonproliferation of 
especially dangerous types of armaments. 
  As for theater ABM defense, this problem must be resolved in 
two areas, in my view. One is to work with the United States to 
define the criteria for this type of armament and formulate them 
in, for instance, an additional protocol to the ABM Treaty. The 
other is to discuss at international level the possible 
consequences of the deployment of new U.S. regional weapons 
systems, including theater ABM defense. It probably makes sense 
to propose holding talks on these problems with those countries 
on whose territory they might appear first. Efforts must be 
made to prevent the emergence of new ABM systems -- which would 
undoubtedly provoke countries to create arms capable of 
overcoming them. In practice this will lead to a new round of 
the arms race.

<F P=106> [Concluding part of two-part article by Vasiliy Krivokhizha, </F>
deputy director of the Russian Institute for Strategic Research: 
"Future of the Russian Nuclear Potential"] 
  [Text] When it comes to discussing the necessary number of 
nuclear munitions in the strategic force structure, most Russian 
military specialists (and this is confirmed, incidentally, by 
very numerous research models of the new strategic situation) 
agree that the number of 3,000-3,500 warheads set by the START 
II Treaty is enough for Russia to deter any aggressor with a 
retaliatory strike, even more so with a counterstrike. As for 
the counterforce potential of Russia's strategic nuclear forces, 
at 3,000-3,500 warheads, as previously at 10,000-13,000 warheads 
(initial level) or 5,000-6,000 warheads (START I Treaty), it is 
indeed far less than that of the U.S. strategic nuclear forces. 
  The change in the structure of Russia's strategic nuclear 
"triad" is a most important aspect of the START II Treaty and 
has far-reaching consequences. At a time of strategic offensive 
arms cuts, the question of shaping the optimum structure for the 
nuclear "triad" that Russia will have at its disposal in the 
early 21st century acquires particular significance. 
  Approximately 60 percent of Russia's nuclear might (number 
of 
warheads) is currently concentrated in silo-based 
ground-launched or road- and rail-mobile ICBM's, 30 percent is 
on missile-carrying submarines, and 10 percent is carried by 
strategic aviation. The U.S. nuclear "triad" currently looks as 
follows: 25 percent ground-launched ICBM's (silos only), 55 
percent submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and 20 percent 
free-fall bombs and all types of cruise missiles. In accordance 
with the average figures laid down by the START II Treaty, by 
the year 2003 both sides will have approximately the following 
structure in their strategic nuclear forces -- 15-30 percent 
ground-launched ICBM's, 50-55 percent on submarines, and 15-35 
percent on aircraft. As, for instance, Academician R.A. Golosov 
of the Russian Federation Academy of Natural Sciences and 
certain other specialists claim, the United States will in 
practice retain the existing correlation of strategic nuclear 
forces within the "triad" framework, whereas Russia will be 
forced to sharply alter the structure of its nuclear "triad," 
weakening its main component -- ground-launched strategic 
weapons. In R.A. Golosov's opinion, implementation of the 
treaty will damage the country's interests from both the 
military-strategic and economic viewpoints. From these 
standpoints the START II Treaty can be seen as inequitable and 
as failing to ensure equality in counterforce potential, thereby 
not promoting the maintenance of strategic stability in 
relations between Russia and the United States. 
  It is no secret that implementation of the START II Treaty 
will indeed leave the U.S. side with a number of advantages -- 
specifically in counterforce potential. But this situation also 
existed in the past, and has not been eliminated by any of the 
previous treaties, including START I. A positive aspect of the 
new treaty is that it creates conditions under which the U.S. 
interest in building up its counterforce potential is 
significantly diminished both by reducing the number of U.S. 
warheads capable of hitting defended precision targets, and by 
Russia's reducing the number of targets on its territory which 
would have been most attractive to a counterforce strike -- 
primarily, heavy ICBM's. The Russian side is also reducing its 
counterforce potential, since it too will pledge to eliminate a 
certain number of missiles with the ability to strike defended 
targets and with the possible ability, in the U.S. side's 
opinion, to be used in a first strike. 
From the standpoint of the prospects for the nuclear 
disarmament process there is a clear possibility in the very 
near future for a further change to the structure of the nuclear 
"triad" which could be initiated -- for various reasons -- by 
both the U.S. and Russian sides. Leading Russian specialists in 
the strategic stability sphere and experienced military 
diplomats are, in particular, not ruling out the emergence of a 
U.S. proposal for a further stage of disarmament, comprising 
further cuts in or the total elimination of ground-launched 
missiles. This proposal has some attractive reasoning behind 
it. We understand, for instance, that first counterstrike 
missiles would be targeted exclusively on naval and air bases 
and other important military installations and would pose less 
of a threat (by excluding the Strategic Rocket Forces) of 
destroying civilians and land ecosystems. But this step is 
unacceptable to Russia because of the qualitative superiority of 
the U.S. naval component over the Russian naval component (as 
already mentioned above). Consequently, Russia needs to retain 
its land-based component -- that is, the Strategic Rocket 
Forces. With a view to equalizing the combat survivability 
[ustoychivost] of Russian and U.S. strategic submarines -- which 
would enhance overall strategic stability -- it would be 
expedient for Russia to propose to conclude an agreement with 
the United States to restrict ASW systems along the lines of the 
ABM Treaty. 
  In connection with a number of articles in recent months it 
would be a good idea to talk separately about the need to 
preserve such a component of the Strategic Rocket Forces' 
ground-based grouping as mobile missile systems. Since Russia 
is allowed to increase the number of these installations under 
the START II Treaty, these are the systems that have been 
particularly "under fire" from the media. 
  The concern felt by the people writing these critical 
articles for the fate of Russia's strategic nuclear arms is 
entirely understandable. Nonetheless, I would like to object to 
many of the points raised in these articles. 
  The usual argument cited in disputes by supporters of the 
complete retention of silo-based ICBM's is the claim that a 
missile in a silo that can be prepared for firing in the space 
of one minute and has protection up to 100 kg per square 
centimeter is a more reliable weapon than a mobile missile that 
takes on average around an hour to prepare for firing and is 
protected up to 1 kg per square centimeter. 
  We should dwell on these figures. The accuracy of modern 
missile systems is such that a silo-based missile with a 
protection level of 100 kg per square centimeter (the silo's 
coordinates will be known) is guaranteed (with a probability of 
close to 100 percent) to be hit by a single megaton-class 
nuclear munition. According to the research done by relevant 
Russian Federation Defense Ministry organizations (arguments in 
the newspapers never usually worry about checking if their 
results were correct or their methodology appropriate), in order 
to hit a single road-mobile missile system an enemy would have 
to use more than 10 such nuclear munitions to cover the entire 
potential deployment region (position area). A mobile system's 
survivability is ensured not only by the size of the position 
area, but also by choosing terrain with the requisite camouflage 
and protective qualities, and by camouflaging the system itself 
-- something that people often forget to take into account. 
Modern mobile systems can travel over roadless terrain and not 
merely, as is often claimed, on metaled roads -- in other words, 
they are not just "road"-mobile. Road-mobile systems are only 
"vulnerable" to a surprise "nuclear strike" by U.S. submarines 
when the mobile systems are at their garrisons, as U.S. 
President George Bush insisted during the negotiations. But 
even in this instance, if there were a rise in tension in the 
world -- and much more so if there were a threat of nuclear 
attack -- road-mobile systems could be moved out of their 
garrisons into their combat position areas. Consequently, the 
survivability of mobile systems is not lower but actually 
considerably higher than that of silo-based systems. 
  In this connection it would seem logical to give up 
silo-based missiles. But if the launch command (for a 
counterstrike on our part) were given in good time, the 
silo-based missiles would escape an enemy strike thanks to their 
high level of combat readiness -- in other words, the missiles 
would leave the silos before the impact of the nuclear explosion 
of enemy warheads came into play. This, needless to say, is if 
it proved possible to carry out a counterstrike. If not, then 
this is yet another argument in favor of mobile systems. 
Moreover, mobile systems allow for different basing modes 
[formiruyut mnogovariantnost], which strengthens deterrence. 
Admittedly, silo-based missiles require less expenditure than 
mobile missiles -- they are more resistant to sabotage and to 
the use of precision nonnuclear weapons. But why do we need to 
view one basing mode as an alternative to another? The optimum 
structure for the Strategic Rocket Forces, ensuring reliable 
deterrence under different strategic situations with different 
amounts of economic and material expenditure, is to combine 
silo-based and road-mobile missile systems, which it is planned 
to preserve within the Strategic Rocket Forces after 2003 -- 
provided, of course, that financial considerations do not alter 
the situation. 
The view that "it is not difficult to knock out a mobile 
system" and that it would take overpressure of only 4-5 
kilopascals to topple one over is known to be incorrect. 
Overpressure of 4-5 kilopascals (0.04-0.05 kg per square 
centimeter) in a nuclear shock wave propagated through the air 
merely corresponds to a mass airflow velocity of around 40 
km/hour. Such a small level of overpressure poses a threat only 
to glass windows. Overpressure an order of magnitude (more than 
10 times) greater would be needed in the nuclear shock wave 
propagated through the air in order to topple a road-mobile 
transporter-erector-launcher and its missile, and then only if 
the nuclear munition exploded precisely at right-angles to the 
launcher, rather than at an acute target angle [tochno na 
traverze ustanovki, a ne na ostrykh kursovykh uglakh]. This 
pressure in the shock wave corresponds to a gas flow velocity of 
more than 300 km/hour. 
  It is interesting to note that in the late eighties the 
official U.S. position at the START talks boiled down to a 
bilateral ban on the deployment of mobile land-based strategic 
missile systems. This was due to the U.S. side's doubts about 
the ability of national means of verification to detect the 
deployment of these missiles and by the special approach taken 
by Congress -- for a whole host of reasons -- toward approval of 
the program for the development [sozdaniye] of mobile missile 
systems in the United States. But, first and foremost, the U.S. 
position was due to the U.S. reluctance to see an overall 
improvement in the combat survivability of the USSR's strategic 
nuclear forces (this was not a major problem for the United 
States itself because of the existence of a powerful and, to all 
intents and purposes, equally "mobile" sea-based component in 
its strategic nuclear forces). 
  Ultimately, the U.S. position shifted in favor of an 
agreement to the deployment of single-warhead road-mobile 
missile systems, on condition that measures were implemented to 
verify the number of deployed missiles in this class and, by 
agreement, the number of such missiles by type -- which was to 
all intents and purposes carried out under the START II Treaty. 
  Here we can note that criticism and a continual desire to 
argue have become part and parcel of our political life. This 
is natural for our life today, but we need -- at least in some 
measure -- to retain our consistency and objectivity. Otherwise 
we will find ourselves in a situation where a U.S. agreement to 
mobile systems will cause justifiable suspicion about their 
motives from some of our experts, while a failure to agree on 
their part will produce no less justifiable doubts from other 
experts as regards the competence of the Russian delegation to 
the talks. We can also note the contradictory nature of the 
approaches taken by the Americans. When the official U.S. 
position was to ban road-mobile missile systems, a group of U.S. 
experts drew up some very noteworthy recommendations for their 
delegation members: 
  -- since mobility is the most effective means of enhancing 
the survivability of strategic missiles during a nuclear first 
strike, the negotiations with the Russians should not raise the 
question of a total ban on them, leaving open the possibility of 
the United States' developing this component for the land-based 
grouping of its strategic nuclear forces; 
  -- under no circumstances should a situation be created in 
which the combat survivability of road-mobile missile systems is 
even slightly diminished as a result of demands to allow the 
sides access to accurate information on their deployment and on 
the observance of the treaty restrictions on the number of 
land-based mobile missiles. It was thought sufficient to 
stipulate merely the term, acceptable to both sides, of 
"cautious" on-site inspections and the utilization of national 
means of verification, provided that the side undergoing 
inspection retains all the advantages relating to the difficulty 
of determining the precise location of the missiles at any 
specific time. 
  In conclusion, I would like to note that we can already make 
a confident forecast about the existence of different approaches 
to the way in which the treaty will be seen by deputies, 
different factions, Defense Ministry representatives, and so 
forth. Obviously, there is a desire on the part of many military 
experts as a whole to assess the treaty as a relatively isolated 
phenomenon in international life and to look only at its 
military-strategic and military-political aspects. At the same 
time, the attitude taken by the corps of deputies to the START 
II Treaty will reveal a closer linkage with Russia's domestic 
life and with the voters' direct interests -- and this attitude, 
despite the extensive discussion of the treaty's provisions in 
the press, has not yet been finally formulated. It is likely 
that in the course of preparations for the START II ratification 
hearings, the corps of deputies will demand that the problems 
relating to the multifaceted and, perhaps, contradictory impact 
of the START II Treaty's implementation on the development of 
the political, economic, and social processes under way in 
Russia be clarified. 
  Attention will most probably be fixed on issues such as the 
reasons for the positive assessment of the treaty (and even, in 
a number of cases, the lobbying for it) by representatives of 
the military-industrial complex and the professional military; 
the correlation between the treaty's provisions and the emergent 
system of new state policy and our sphere of national interests; 
the treaty's impact on the pace and direction of scientific and 
technical progress in Russia, on the elaboration of new advanced 
technology, on the implementation of our national space program, 
and on the closure or adaptation [rasformirovaniye ili 
pereprofilirovaniye] of existing military educational 
establishments; the economic and environmental consequences for 
specific regions, the cost of implementation, and so forth. The 
corps of deputies will only take an objective view of the 
ratification of the START II Treaty if issues of interest to a 
wide range of the Russian population -- rather than just those 
to which military specialists and diplomats are trying to 
restrict themselves -- are discussed. Thus, the range of 
problems which it will be necessary and sufficient to resolve in 
order to reach a decision on the treaty remains very vague and 
is tending to expand. 
  The emergent situation and the increased distrust of 
"departmental" views which the new Duma may follow the Supreme 
Soviet in expressing are in line with the realities of political 
life in Russia, will be transient (as the experience of other 
countries shows), and will focus attention yet again on the need 
to improve expert assessment of the decisionmaking process 
within the framework of the formation of our new democratic 
institutions. 
  At the same time, in purely military terms it is clear that, 
in order to reliably deter any aggressor, it will be necessary 
to preserve the triad in the structure of Russia's strategic 
nuclear forces (the Strategic Rocket Forces plus sea-launched 
and air-launched strategic nuclear systems) and a rational 
structure for the Strategic Rocket Forces -- silo-based and 
road-mobile missile systems. Only this kind of structure will 
be able to have the requisite combat readiness, survivability, 
and military flexibility with the optimum financial expenditure 
in the foreseeable future. The expenditure point is of no 
little importance to Russia. The switch to a dyad (Strategic 
Rocket Forces plus sea-launched strategic nuclear forces or some 
other combination) is for Russia -- and this cannot be said of 
the United States -- unjustifiable for economic and efficiency 
reasons. Moreover, statements about a dyad are, as a rule, 
restricted to the most general arguments and are not backed up 
by any kind of serious calculations. 
  Russia's main task in the context of strategic offensive 
arms 
reduction is to further improve its strategic nuclear forces, 
not least as regards enhancing the operational safety of 
aviation missile systems. If the START II Treaty is ratified 
and the structure and components of our strategic nuclear forces 
are improved, Russia will have a sufficient deterrent potential 
and will not be left "defenseless in the face of the threat of 
nuclear blackmail." A necessary condition for this is the 
implementation of an armaments and military hardware development 
program that meets the demands of Russia's military doctrine, 
the present-day political and strategic situation in the world, 
and the real level of military danger to our country. Only in 
this event will the Russian eagle be able to hang on to its 
nuclear sword, which plays a key role in protecting Russia's 
national interests and actual integrity -- at least until such 
time as the economy and domestic stability become effective 
components in our national might.

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "Russia Implements START-1 Accord and </F>
Helps Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belorussia to Become Non-Nuclear"] 
  [Text] From the moment the START I accord on the reduction 
of offensive weapons went into effect, Russia "has destroyed 350 
missiles and 300 launchers," Colonel General Igor Sergeyev, 
commander in chief of the Strategic Rocket Forces, told a press 
conference. He reminded the audience that Ukraine, Kazakhstan, 
and Belorussia [Belarus] became parties to this accord in June 
1992, and this put a fresh obligation upon Russia. 
  For example, according to Gen. Sergeyev, 180 nuclear weapons 
have been shipped from Ukraine to the Russian Federation to be 
destroyed at Russian plants under agreements between both 
countries and the United States. Besides, as the commander in 
chief intimated, as of last year Ukraine removed from alert 
status RS-18 missile systems with expired guarantee dates; the 
shipping of nuclear weapons to the Russian Federation and the 
radiological decontamination of SS-24 missiles began this year. 
  Gen. Sergeyev also recalled that, in line with an agreement 
signed with Minsk, the Strategic Rocket Forces group has been 
placed under Moscow's jurisdiction: A scheduled withdrawal of 
missile regiments to Russian territory is in progress. 
  An agreement also was reached this March with Kazakhstan on 
lending a "Russian status" to the missile subunits deployed in 
the republic, and on the dates for their pullout. Now an 
agreement is in the works of the elimination of the missile 
systems. 
  Col. Gen. Sergeyev underscored that the implementation of 
the 
disarmament process depends not only on the United States and 
the Russian Federation but also on all former Soviet republics 
on whose territories strategic arms are deployed.

<F P=106> [KOMMERSANT correspondent Mikhail Kirtser report: "Russian </F>
Cosmodrome: Plesetsk Will Take on Baykonur's Programs, if Money 
Is Forthcoming"] 
  [Text] Yesterday KOMMERSANT correspondent Mikhail 
Kirtser returned from Arkhangelsk province, where the Russia's 
Plesetsk cosmodrome, which has for 30 years fulfilled 
exclusively military functions and which is officially known as 
a state test site, is located amidst the forests. For the first 
time, the command of the Strategic Misile Forces permitted 
Russian journalists to come here, showing them the latest Topol 
(SS-25) strategic missiles as well as an excercise by a missile 
regiment. 
  During the excercise the photojournalists simply implored 
the 
missile officers to erect an ICBM into the vertical position. 
But the soldiers explained that such a procedure is 
irreversible: A missile can assume combat position only with a 
"launch" command. The press decided not to insist. They were 
able to observe the movement of a column of missiles and support 
vehicles and the concealment of a launcher at its combat site in 
the forest. Then the KOMMERSANT correspondent visited the 
training center, where noncoms and officers are trained as 
service personnel. 
  The Plestesk cosmodrome is an entire complex of the most 
various buildings and installations. The strategic mobile 
missile regiment, whose excercise the representatives of the 
press observed, is only a part of the whole. There are also 
launch sites, which are inevitably associated with Baykonur, 
which is now in a foreign country. True, they were not able to 
look into missile silos--their hatches can be opened only by 
means of a special mechanism (whose work would be "noticed" both 
by the press and by orbital spy satellites), but they were 
nonetheless able to touch a rail-based missile complex 
(KOMMERSANT wrote about this adventure in February). 
  The true purpose of the invitation to the journalists became 
clear at the concluding press conference, which was conducted at 
the secret town of Mirnyy, next to the cosmodrome. The test 
site commander, Lieutenant General Yuriy Zhuralev, declared that 
he thought it was incorrect to divide the country's missile 
forces into Strategic Missile Forces, military-space forces, and 
ABM defense forces. In his opinion, such a division only 
complicates command and control and increases upkeep expenses. 
The lieutenant general also declared that the test site's 
capabilities enable it, without no need for new equipment, not 
only to support the Strategic Missile Forces' combat readiness, 
but also to take on the civilian space programs from the 
Baykonur cosmodrome (the more so, in that Mirnyy has scientific 
establishments and intellectual potential which would permit 
Russian space technology to attain a high level of efficiency 
and reliablity). There is only one problem--too little money.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel General Stanislav Kochemasov by </F>
Aleksandr Dolinin under "Topical Theme" rubric; date and place 
not stated: "The World Is Changing, But the Need for Alert Duty 
Remains" -- first paragraph is introduction] 
  [Text] Articles have been appearing in the press of late 
expressing concern over the status of Russia's Strategic Nuclear 
Forces [SNF]. Some publications are bluntly trying to convince 
the reader that ICBM's are unnecessary. Our correspondent 
turned for clarification to Colonel General Stanislav 
Kochemasov, chief of the Strategic Missile Forces Main Staff. 
  Dolinin: Stanislav Grigoryevich, what is meant by 
Russia's Strategic Nuclear Forces today? 
  Kochemasov: The term signifies first and foremost 
the Strategic Missile Forces, the basis of Russia's nuclear 
might, strategic ballistic missile submarine task forces, and 
strategic aviation. We have always been in favor of preserving 
this triad -- only the balanced development of all its 
components can provide the guarantee of high combat 
effectiveness and the capability to execute designated tasks. 
You know, each component of the SNF has its own advantages and 
the qualities attributable to it alone. But given the financial 
and manpower constraints, it will evidently be necessary to 
grant priority to the development of weaponry and troops alike, 
and to integrate offensive and support systems. There was a 
discussion of these questions in the General Staff in April. 
  Dolinin: How do you envisage integration? 
  Kochemasov: In order to centralize SNF command and 
control and to determine responsibilty, it would be expedient to 
set up an operations command authority [operativnoye 
komandovaniye]. Administrative leadership, however, would remain 
with the commanders in chief of the various branches of the 
Armed Forces. The preconditions for this already exist, as does 
the possibility of creating a unified system of military command 
and control. But you have to look before you leap.... 
  Dolinin: What is the place of the Missile Forces 
in the structure of Russia's SNF? 
  Kochemasov: The Strategic Missile Forces remain 
their basic component -- both in terms of quantity of warheads 
and in terms of a number of other characteristics. This is the 
objective situation now, and it will persist in fact until 
2003-2005 -- something which is determined not by someone's wish 
but by the building and development of the SNF in previous years. 
  Dolinin: It seems that in the future, too, the 
Strategic Missile Forces will remain the basis of the SNF. But 
already, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA readers are getting the impression that 
the troops are all but completely disarming. Which nuclear 
missile weapons will Russia still have in the years to come? Is 
it not the case that we have been bled dry by the well-known 
Russian-American treaties? 
  Kochemasov: Several hundred launchers have been 
withdrawn from the effective strength of the Strategic Missile 
Forces. Basically, these are missile complexes [kompleksy] which 
have been in service for twice the warrantied service life. Not 
a single launcher has been removed from alert duty if its 
warrantied service life has not been exhausted. We have kept 
intact the grouping [gruppirovka] of modern missiles. We are 
continuing with the planned commissioning, albeit in a lesser 
quantity, of the Topol mobile missile complexes, which your 
newspaper has already written about. In order to preserve the 
armament and hardware of the two combined units from Belorussia 
[Belarus] we plan to redeploy them to Russia intact. We are 
including an RS 12M complex in the grouping. This complex will 
be the first created exclusively by the cooperation of Russian 
design bureau and plants. Preparations for testing it are 
progressing as planned. An experimental and test base has been 
set up at the Mirnyy test site. The first missile for testing 
systems and power units [sistemy i agregaty] was delivered to 
the test site at the end of 1993. In accordance with an edict 
by the president, the Missile Forces and industrial 
organizations have set about testing the complex. 
  The system of military command and control is being improved 
and modernized. All this is being done so that combat potential 
is maintained at a level guaranteeing deterrence of any 
aggressor. 
  Dolinin: Are the cutbacks affecting the combat 
readiness of troops? With the elimination of old complexes and 
the transfer to new ones the need for officers does not lessen 
but, on the contrary, increases.... 
  Kochemasov: First, within the framework of the 
impending modernization of the grouping we plan to retain the 
existing position areas and their attendant infrastructure, 
accommodations, and social and cultural facilities, in order to 
ensure normal living conditions. Second, upon withdrawing 
missile complexes from the effective strength we are leaving 
some of the officer personnel in the newly formed units [chasti] 
or else relocating them to other combined units [soyedineniya]. 
The main problems concern a lack of accommodations, although we 
have steadfastly fulfilled the plan for housing construction 
over the past three or four years. 
  Cutbacks may affect combat readiness to some extent if 
measures are not taken. But the main thing is that we preserve 
a system of centralized military command and control. This 
allows us to maintain the attained level of combat readiness. 
  Dolinin: The program for developing the weaponry 
of Russia's SNF through the year 2005 stipulates that the basis 
of the Missile Forces will be the Topol single-warhead 
solid-propellant missile for the mobile off-road complex, and 
the Topol M for silo basing. How far does the missile meet this 
purpose, and how reliable is it? How are preparations for 
testing the Topol M progressing? 
  Kochemasov: The future lies with single-warhead 
missiles. MIRVed missiles will be withdrawn from effective 
strength as their operational life expires, as envisaged by the 
START II Treaty on condition of its ratification. Moreover, 105 
MIRVed RS-18 (SS-19) missiles will be reequipped with 
single-warhead nose sections and retained until their 
operational life expires. And 90 launch silos for the RS-20 
(SS-18) heavy missiles will be converted to accommodate the 
Topol M fixed-site version. 
  The composition of the SNF and the number of delivery 
vehicles must be brought to a level which guarantees the 
solution of the task of strategic deterrence, and it must be 
commensurate with the actual military threat. For the Strategic 
Missile Forces, this level has been set at between 900 and 1,000 
missile launchers by the year 2003. START II allows for their 
number to be increased to between 1,000 and 1,200 missile 
launchers. 
  Dolinin: Stanislav Grigoryevich, the continued 
development of missile technology is impossible without a solid 
testing base. In this connection, what is the fate of the Kapyar 
test site, and what are its functions today? Is the proposed 
reassigning of the rocket test site at Plesetsk (Mirnyy) to the 
military-space units an appropriate move? 
  Kochemasov: Extensive and comprehensive 
ground-based test site trials cut the cost of the development 
[sozdaniye] of any complex, inasmuch as they drastically reduce 
the number of missiles required for actual launches. When the 
capacity of a test site is based on the number of missile 
launches, this has to be seen not as an advantage but as a 
serious shortcoming in the methodology of ground-based testing. 
  At the Kapustin Yar test site, individual elements of a 
complexes are tested by firing over short distances using 
inexpensive series-produced carriers [seriyno otrabotannyye i 
deshevyye nositeli]. The main tests of systems and power units, 
the complex as a whole and the missiles, incorporating launches, 
are carried out at the Mirnyy test site. The methodology for 
developing a complex is such that up to 70 percent of the tests 
are conducted on the ground. 
  The question of reassigning the test site is raised from 
time 
to time by the command of the Military-Space Forces. It would 
be an appropriate move if the existing structure and system of 
subordination disrupted or seriously hindered the execution of 
tasks in the new conditions. But it does neither. The problem 
has been studied in depth, and the president of Russia has been 
made aware of the situation. It was deemed advisable to 
preserve the existing system of subordination. The test site's 
30-year history, and the last few years in particular, confirm 
the possibility of resolving all tasks in precisely this 
organizational-regulation structure [organizatsionno-shtatnaya 
struktura]. 
  Dolinin: In May this year, missile launchers will 
no longer have any targets. There will take place the so-called 
zero targeting agreed with the Americans. Their missiles will 
be targeted on desert regions of the earth insofar as the system 
of military command and control of American ICBM's is somewhat 
different. What will this mean in practice? 
Kochemasov: In line with the accords reached and a 
directive from the Russian president, by 31 May the missiles 
will be on alert duty with "zero" mission assignments. Put 
simply, they will not have specific targets. 
  The practical implementation of the nontargeting regime 
depends on the design characteristics of the missile complexes, 
and this will be determined specifically by us and by the 
American side for each type of missile. The common element for 
all, however, is the clear lowering of the sudden-strike 
threshold, inasmuch as a number of operational and technical 
measures will have to be conducted in order to reestablish each 
side's combat plans. This will take time, which the politicians 
can make additional use of to find a peaceful solution to 
problems if they emerge. 
  However the circumstances take shape, the Strategic Missile 
Forces will perform their alert duty. Around 20,000 missilemen 
are at their combat posts around the clock. As they have been 
for virtually the past 35 years. The world is changing, but the 
need for alert duty has not disappeared.

  [Text] All nuclear warheads will be pulled out of Ukraine 
within three-four years, Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy 
Radetskyy told journalists in Kiev on Monday. 
  He said the arrangements for one train with warheads takes 
about one month. As of today, Radetskyy said, three trains with 
180 nuclear warheads have been sent from Ukraine to Russia. 
"Everything is going according to schedule," Radetskyy assured 
journalists. According to information available, at the end of 
1993 Ukraine had approximately 2,000 nuclear warheads. 
  Radetskyy also said that Ukraine will be controlling the 
process of re-targeting American strategic missiles earlier 
targeted against Ukraine. With this purpose a Ukrainian 
delegation is due to visit the USA soon. 
  By May 30 the USA is to change the flight program of its 
missiles so that they are not aimed against Ukraine any more.

Semipalatinsk test site] Russia is prepared to extend the 
moratorium on nuclear tests. In connection with this it is 
envisaged that all Russian scientists will have left the nuclear 
test site in Semipalatinsk by the beginning of July. 
Incidentally, right now only 20 percent of the original number 
of servicing personnel remain at the site. This is insufficient 
to maintain the site properly and to ensure its security. 
[video shows dilapidated buildings, followed by extensive 
aerial views of test site captioned "Video material supplied by

Force, helicopter flights over the nuclear facilities without a 
special permit are banned. The last authorized flight took 
place 13 February this year. 
  Despite the high level of radioactivity at the test site, 
the 
facilities are not being guarded. Furthermore, the local 
authorities are seriously considering setting up a livestock 
farm on the territory of the site. The military also fear that 
abandoned equipment and cables, which could constitute a 
radioactive hazard, may be removed by pilferers. An unexploded 
nuclear charge which remains in one of the galleries also 
presents a threat. It cannot be defused because there are no 
specialists, and it cannot be exploded. [161146] [video shows

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 17 TASS -- Kazakhstan wants to invite 
U.S. experts to dismantle Russian-made nuclear missiles which it 
had inherited from the former Soviet Union and the decision 
causes concern among the Russian military. 
  "The access of experts of third countries to Russian missile 
complexes for their dismantling contradicts the Russian-Kazakh 
agreement on strategic nuclear forces and the treaty on military 
cooperation", Aleksandr Volkov, first deputy commander-in-chief 
of the Russian Strategic Missile Forces, told TASS on Tuesday. 
  Russian experts are currently removing nuclear warheads from 
the missiles, extracting them from silos and preparing for 
transportation, according to Volkov who added that Russia had 
pledged to transfer to its territory all nuclear components for 
elimination by May 1, 1995. He stressed that financial aspects 
of dismantling and elimination have been fixed in a separate 
Russian- Kazakh agreement. 
  In the meantime, three U.S. companies want to eliminate the 
SS-18 missiles in Kazakhstan and are planning to request the 
U.S. Congress to appropriate 75 million dollars for that, 
according to Kazakh mass media which reported that the main bulk 
of the missiles is to be destroyed, while ten of them are to be 
used as spacecraft carriers. The Kazakh-U.S. cooperation idea in 
the sphere has emerged after the visit of President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev to the United States. 
  The invitation to U.S. experts to dismantle Russian missiles 
affects not only the Russian interests, but also of missile 
constructors in other CIS countries. According to Aleksandr 
Piskunov, deputy chairman of the Russian State Duma committee on 
defence, the Kazakh decision ignores the right to intellectual 
property and thus contradicts international norms.

  [Text] Kazakh and American government delegations failed to 
reach mutually acceptable agreements on ways to dismantle 
missile- launching installations in Kazakhstan, First Deputy 
Defence Minister Alikbek Kasymov told Interfax on Tuesday. 
  According to him, a major issue at their talks concluded in 
Almaty on Saturday was the fixing of terms on a tender for the 
work of dismantling the silos, and the participation of Kazakh 
firms in the tender. However, a mutually acceptable solution 
failed to be reached. 
  Kazakhstan believes that though the tender submitted by the 
U.S. Government is "open, because of its stringent conditions 
the participation of Kazakh firms in it is problematic," Kasymov 
said. 
  Those who intend to take part in the tender are the 
joint-stock company Katep (Kazakh nuclear energy industry), and 
two holding companies -- Special Installations and 
Construction. The talks are to be continued, Kasymov said.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valentin Pavlov] </F>
  [Text] Barnaul May 13 TASS -- Residents in the Altay 
territory were subjected to radiation from 58 explosions between 
1949 and 1990, including the first thermonuclear weapon test in 
August 1953, said speakers at the three-day session of the 
Scientific Council in Barnaul on the appraisal of Semipalatinsk 
explosions aftermaths on the Altay territory population. 
  Results of investigations confirm that the radioactive 
fallout of nuclear detonations at the Semipalatinsk proving 
ground covered nearly the entire Altay territory. People 
received doses on the verge of radiation injury in some areas. 
  Over a third of population living in fallout areas died in 
the first five-seven years after the 1949 explosion. A new wave 
of oncological diseases, hemopathies, diseases of hematogenetic 
organs and genetic mutations is now observed when the third 
generation of radiated people has become child-bearing. 
  These and other facts from the history of Soviet nuclear 
testing were revealed at the above-mentioned session which ended 
its work on Friday. It was attended by scientists from nearly 
60 research institutions. 
  Physicists, chemists, biologists, doctors and sociologists 
discussed the results of last year's research work and progress 
in implementing the "Polygon" comprehensive programme in the 
Altay territory, providing for urgent measures to overcome 
aftermaths of nuclear explosions, to improve the ecological 
situation and people's health as well as to give a boost to 
social and economic development of afflicted villages. 
  The session mapped out guidelines for further research. 
Valentin Koptyug, president of the Siberian branch of the 
Russian Academy of Sciences, pointed to the great importance for 
the international scientific community of massive medical 
checkup of irradiated people, which was carried in the Altay 
territory for the first time in the world. 
  According to scientists, this session of "the programme on 
distant radiation aftereffects of nuclear tests at the 
Semipalatinsk proving ground on the Altay territory population" 
(official name of the session) has also become an important 
stage in preparations for an international conference on the 
"radtest" (radiation test) programme to be held in the Altay 
territory next September.

<F P=106> [Vadim Prokopenko report under the "Topic of the Day" </F>
rubric: "Ownerless Atomic Bomb Waiting for Its Fate To Be 
Decided for Over Three Years"] 
  [Text] "Following the breakup of the Soviet Union the 
Belovezhskaya agreement, the Almaty declaration, and agreements 
among the CIS heads of state say that everything that is on the 
territory of each state is its property. The Baykonur 
cosmodrome and the Semipalatinsk test site are the property of 
Kazakhstan.... So Russia has nothing to do with them," Nursultan 
Nazarbayev said in a speech at UN headquarters in New York in 
1994. 
  But it does. Russia very directly has something to do with 
the Semipalatinsk test site. No matter how Nursultan Nazarbayev 
wanted to stun the whole world community in the golden hall at 
UN headquarters with his presidential authority, he has to give 
Russia's atomic specialists their due. 
  Back in May 1991 a physical irradiation experiment was 
prepared at installation 108-k in the granite Degelen mountain 
"in order to improve military equipment." This means that a 
tunnel 592 meters long was driven through a mass of granite 
around 20 km in diameter at a depth of at least 126 meters from 
the surface. A small (by present-day standards) atomic bomb 
with a yield of 0.4 kilotonnes, equivalent to 400 tonnes of TNT, 
was set up at one end of this tunnel 108-k, and specially 
designed objects were set up at the other end. When the bomb 
was detonated, the articles would receive the full impact. 
Scientists would bring them to the surface, study the damage, 
and refine the latest achievements of the Soviet Union's 
military thought. On whose territory, I would remind you, both 
Russians and Kazakhs lived until the end of 1991.... 
  In August 1991 the Kazakhstani president closed the 
Semipalatinsk test site, but the atomic bomb remained deep 
within Degelen mountain. It could in principle have been 
detonated long since. But in big-league politics Kazakhstan had 
employed the tactic of a state which had voluntarily renounced 
nuclear arms, and an underground explosion with that kind of 
yield would have been noticed by satellites all around the 
world.... 
  A decision was made to remove the atomic charge and the 
military equipment back in 1992. Since then talks have been 
under way at the highest state level. Kazakhstan has even 
recruited U.S. specialists. They have insistently recommended 
that this problem be entrusted to Russia. 
  "We have experience of unearthing atomic charges. Through 
the history of the test site there have been several known cases 
of buried charges' suffering technical failure," according to 
Anatoliy Matushchenko, a specialist from the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Atomic Energy. "A joint Russian-Kazakhstani group 
is now starting work and is to implement a project formulated by 
the All-Union Scientific Research and Planning Institute of 
Industrial Technology (Moscow) and draw up an estimate of 
expenditure. The whole job could take more than six months, but 
it must be done before winter sets in. The Russian side will 
cover all the expenditure. By all accounts this will amount to 
in excess of 1 billion rubles...." 
  Everything that is removed from under the ground will be the 
property of the Russian Federation. Corresponding agreements 
have already been signed to this effect. No one, not even 
Kazakhstan representatives, will be able to see the irradiation 
facilities or touch the bomb that has spent over three years 
underground. Incidentally, nuclear charges have never been 
stored for so long out of storage facilities. So in this 
respect the Semipalatinsk experiment will prove unique in its 
own way.

Embassy in Ukraine that out of the $100 million allocated by the 
Japanese Government to dismantling the nuclear weapons of 
Kazakhstan, Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, our country will 
receive $16 million, with Japan expecting specific projects [to 
be implemented] by Ukraine using this money. 
  Ukraine's Foreign Affairs Ministry says that both countries 
are in the process of drafting a joint declaration on the 
principles of cooperation between Ukraine and Japan, a 
memorandum of understanding between the two states' foreign 
political departments, and an intergovernmental agreement on the 
mutual encouragement and protection of investments, as well as 
working to settle the issue of Ukraine's legal succession with 
regard to the contractual and legal basis that was formed in 
relations between Japan and the former USSR.

<F P=106> [Report from roundup of UKRINFORM and TASS reports: </F>
"Defense Industry Open to Businessmen"] 
  [Text] An exchange of opinions on the fulfillment of the 
agreements reached in Moscow between the Ukrainian, U.S., and 
Russian presidents on the elimination of the nuclear weapons on 
Ukrainian soil took place between Ukrainian Vice Premier Valeriy 
Shmarov and Nicholas Burns, head of the U.S. economic delegation 
and senior director of the National Security Council. The guest 
was also familiarized with the programs for the conversion of 
Ukraine's defense industry which propose close cooperation with 
U.S. firms. Conversion processes could be considerably 
accelerated by the involvement of small-scale business as the 
most mobile form of entrepreneurship. The U.S. side's attention 
was drawn also to problems of Ukraine's space complex, where 
there is extensive scope for cooperation.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko, </F>
Mikhail Melnik] 
  [Text] Kiev May 13 TASS -- The process of dismantling and 
pullout of nuclear warheads from Ukraine into Russia is under 
full control and goes ahead as scheduled. A total of 180 
warheads had been removed from Ukraine to the Russian Federation 
by now, said Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk in an interview 
with ITAR-TASS at an opening ceremony of the Kiev spring fair on 
Friday. 
  "It is no secret for anyone that combat nuclear missiles 
stationed on the Ukrainian territory were not under Ukraine's 
control since the `nuclear button' was in Moscow. Besides, 
Ukraine never sought to take possession of such dangerous 
weapons," the Ukrainian president said. He confirmed Ukraine's 
intention to implement in full a tripartite agreement signed by 
the Russian, Ukrainian and the U.S. presidents at the beginning 
of 1994. 
  "We signed the agreement, hoping that other nuclear 
countries 
would take adequate measures and begin disarmament," Kravchuk 
said. He pointed out that according to information at his 
disposal the United States intends to make large-scale cuts of 
their nuclear arsenals, fulfilling agreements reached during the 
Moscow meeting. 
  He went on to say that by the end of May all American 
missiles targeted at Ukraine would be re-coded. "The time comes 
when our countries will really switch over from words of 
friendship and cooperation to concrete deeds," he said.

  [Text] Kiev [no dateline as received] -- Members of 
Ukraine's working delegation to Washington attended a briefing 
at Ukraine's Foreign Ministry on 17 May. Ukraine's Deputy Prime 
Minister Valeriy Shmarov, who led the delegation, believes the 
signing of the memorandum on mutual understanding between the 
governments of Ukraine and the United States on the transfer of 
missile equipment and technology has become an important step in 
Ukraine's accession to the world distribution of labor in the 
implementation of space programs, since no country owns a 
complete production cycle in this area. The document also 
illustrates the fact that "Ukraine has joined the group of 
civilized countries, instead of falling to the level of Iraq or 
North Korea." 
  In the course of negotiations, the Ukrainian side managed to 
persuade the United States to lift the clause in the agreement 
on space cooperation between the United States and Russia that 
concerns the countries of the former Soviet Union as one which 
infringes upon the rights of the third party. 
  Giving a generally favorable assessment of the trip's 
results, Valeriy Kazakov, deputy minister of machine-building, 
military- industrial complex, and conversion, said that despite 
U.S. assurances of a fine state of relations between the United 
States and Ukraine, economic cooperation and work in the sphere 
of conversion is proceeding slowly. A great deal of attention 
during the visit was paid to the intensification of conversion 
programs. For example, it was possible to agree to a list of 35 
enterprises subject to immediate restructuring. The U.S. side 
has allocated 20 million dollars to this end. 
  Asked by UNIAN to comment on the breakthrough in the U.S. 
attitude to Ukraine, Deputy Foreign Minister Borys Tarasyuk said 
it reflected international reality and our country's consistent 
policy stance. Tarasyuk emphasized that this change began after 
the signing of the trilateral statement by Ukraine, Russia, and 
the United States.

  [Text] Kiev [no date as received] -- The People's Movement 
of Ukraine [RUKh] circulated an appeal to the Council for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe and the UN Security Council 
  "Events that have recently taken place in the Crimean 
autonomous republic, which is an inalienable and constituent 
part of the Ukrainian state, are testimony of the real 
possibility of the region turning into a zone of permanent 
threat to peace and stability in Europe", the document says. 
The authors of the appeal note that "flagrant violations of 
Ukraine's constitution based on including on the agenda for a 
session of the Supreme Council of Crimea issues on the creation 
of Crimea's own armed forces, the introduction of dual 
citizenship, completely ignoring the interests of the indigenous 
Crimean Tatar and the Ukrainian population, and the redeployment 
of military formations from the territory of Russia to the 
Crimean peninsula, are acts aimed at violating civic peace on 
the territory of Crimea thus creating the grounds for the 
emergence of an armed conflict." 
  In RUKh's view, the situation arose as a result of direct 
and 
permanent interference by state officials of the Russian 
Federation in the affairs of a neighboring state. The Black Sea 
Fleet is being used by Russia as an instrument of forced 
pressure. 
  Vyacheslav Chornovil, who signed the appeal, stressed that 
under these conditions the "process of the further withdrawal of 
nuclear warheads from Ukraine in accordance with the trilateral 
agreement should be suspended". 
  RUKh appeals to the Council for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe and the UN Security Council since, in RUKh's view, "only 
the intervention of institutions that are called on to maintain 
security in Europe can defend peace in the region and prevent 
the creation of a new zone of international tension."

<F P=106> [Article signed TP: "Security Policy -- European </F>
Cooperation: 200 Scientists Meet in Zurich"] 
  [Text] A total of 200 European scientists and experts are 
meeting in Zurich until Thursday [28 April] to promote 
scientific cooperation in matters of security policy. An 
information exchange association is expected to be set up. The 
organizers of the meeting are the Federal Military Department 
and the Federal Department for Foreign Affairs. 
  The objective of this international conference is to promote 
the creation of research institutes with democratic objectives 
in Central and Eastern Europe. 
  The research institute on security policy matters and on 
analyzing conflicts of Zurich's Federal Polytechnic School and 
the UN Research Institute on Disarmament are participating in 
this conference as are approximately 100 research institutes on 
security policy issues. 
  Despite tight budgets, international cooperation is 
essential, Federal Counselor Kaspar Villiger said at the opening 
of the conference. International criminal organizations, 
uncontrolled migration flows, rising numbers of mass destruction 
weapons, and increased nationalist feelings are all serious 
problems for security policy, he added.

<F P=106> [Article by Dominique Garraud: "Mitterrand: `After Me, No </F>
More Nuclear Tests'"] 
  [Excerpts] Yesterday, the head of state reaffirmed his 
primacy regarding defense matters by issuing a statement 
opposing any resumption of nuclear tests. In his opinion, the 
next president of the Republic will have to maintain the 
moratorium, for "France will not want to offend the world." 
  Francois Mitterrand has an acute sense of provocation. 
Yesterday, in an unprecedented move, the head of state gathered 
in the banqueting hall of the Elysee [presidential palace] 200 
people directly concerned with the nuclear deterrent, including 
army commanders, industrialists, scientists, members of 
Parliament, and ministers. With the exception of Jean-Pierre 
Chevenement, all his former defense ministers were there, as 
well as current Defense Minister Francois Leotard. However, 
there was no Edouard Balladur, who was elsewhere, officially for 
obscure reasons regarding the use of time. [passage omitted] 
  As the guardian of a De Gaullian dogma regarding deterrence, 
Francois Mitterrand reaffirmed the pillars thereof: "The key 
aim of deterrence is to avoid war by safeguarding the integrity 
of national territory and ensuring the defense of our vital 
interests," he professed. As for the notion of the "final 
warning" which emerged in the sixties, it is a "terminal 
warning" which must not be led astray and become some kind of 
"nuclear artillery." 
  Looking at Francois Leotard, the head of state proved 
menacing on the subject of the government's majority. "Mr. 
Defense Minister, you intend to tell the National Assembly that 
it should provide itself with the means of response or attack 
against the weak or crazy. Should we use nuclear weapons 
outside our territory or apart from our vital interests? Must 
we rally to the adherents of the surgical, or even decapitating, 
nuclear strike? And why not a nuclear gun? To me that would 
seem to be a major heresy. There is no way I will accept it. 
And if an amendment in this sense came to be adopted, it would 
lead to a major conflict which the French people would have to 
decide on." Clearly, he was threatening to dissolve the 
Assembly. 
  The paradox is that this risk would appear to be 
infinitesmal. While Edouard Balladur remains very discreet on 
these issues, Francois Leotard will mark his opposition to any 
measure that would result in nuclear weapons becoming an 
everyday feature. And in the Assembly, the committed proponents 
of decapitating nuclear strikes, led by RPR [Rally for the 
Republic] member Jacques Baumel, can be counted on the fingers 
of one hand. 
  By stating his views ceremoniously, Francois Mitterrand 
reiterated that nothing concerning the policy of nuclear 
deterrence can be done without him. In passing, he will 
certainly trigger several skirmishes within the government's 
majority against the excessive lenience supposedly shown by 
Edouard Balladur toward the president. 
  The provocative aspect of Francois Mitterrand's speech is 
not 
insignificant just before the parliamentary debate on defense 
issues. However, yesterday's exercise will go much further than 
the end of the upcoming parliamentary debate. "The movement 
calling for nuclear disarmament is healthy," said Francois 
Mitterrand, voicing his support for a renewal of the nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and a "universal, verifiable" 
treaty banning tests. And that will not necessarily be the 
vision of the next president of the Republic, especially if his 
name is Jacques Chirac.

  [Text] On Tuesday, Edouard Balladur did not rule out "a 
possible resumption of nuclear testing." 
  "France never accepted linking the suspension of nuclear 
testing to the negotiations" on a treaty which would ban testing 
forever. 
  The prime minister has thus signalled that he has a 
different 
position from that of Mitterrand. 
  The president said on Thursday that those who succeed him 
will not resume nuclear testing.

  [Text] On Tuesday [10 May], Arthur Paecht, the rapporteur 
of the military programming law, declared that, "according to a 
unanimous recommendation of all experts consulted, the 
resumption of nuclear tests is indispensable." As to the Palen 
test simulation program, it "would not suffice to ensure the 
development of new nuclear charges." The deputy also pointed to 
two other "controversial" issues: "The decision by the 
president of the Republic to keep active the ballistic missiles 
on the Albion plateau" and "the five-year delay in the M5 
strategic ballistic missile program."

  [Text] Paris, May 17 (AFP) -- French Defense Minister 
Francois Leotard said Tuesday that the scientific community 
believed additional nuclear tests were essential in order to 
develop the capacity to simulate tests in the laboratory. 
  Leotard, speaking on French radio, said that "the scientific 
community tells us that we need a few more tests," and added 
that he had not met a single scientist who believes otherwise. 
  "France must acquire as quickly as possible -- perhaps in 
seven, eight or 10 years -- the capacity to simulate tests that 
would allow us to test the effects of a nuclear explosion," 
Leotard said. "That is essential for our country if we are to 
remain a major power." 
  He said those opposed to nuclear testing are generally 
"politicians," an apparent reference to President Francois 
Mitterrand who is against France resuming nuclear [sentence as 
received]. 
  Mitterrand, who has exclusive powers to order tests, wants 
to 
stand by a moratorium observed by all the United Nations 
Security Council members except China.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Mr. Monory Agrees With Mr. </F>
Mitterrand on Nuclear Test Moratorium"] 
  [Excerpts] Senate Speaker Rene Monory (UDF-CDS [Union for 
French Democracy-Social Democratic Center]) thinks that the idea 
of a referendum on employment launched by Philippe Seguin (RPR 
[Rally for the Republic]), his National Assembly counterpart, is 
"too simple." Mr. Monory, who was the guest on the Radio-J 
"Forum" program on Sunday, 15 May, said: "Employment deserves 
more than passing comments. It requires a series of measures. 
We must stop indulging in demagoguery and controversy.... I 
think that the majority and opposition should not taunt each 
other with each other's failures." The Senate speaker hopes 
that the presidential election will provide the opportunity "for 
a great debate" on this employment question. "Otherwise, we 
will be heading for decline," he said. [passage omitted] 
  Questioned on the disagreement between the prime minister 
and 
the president of the Republic on the question of the moratorium 
on nuclear tests, Mr. Monory expressed the view that this 
controversy is "rather pointless" because "our decision," he 
said, "is determined more than ever by the attitude of our big 
partners." Taking up the argument used by Francois Mitterrand 
during his 10 May television speech, he added: "It is true that 
if the others do not resume the tests, we will not resume them, 
and if the others do resume them, we will resume them." 
  On the question of the European elections, the Senate 
speaker, who had supported Dominique Baudis as candidate to head 
the UDF-RPR [Rally for the Republic] list, thinks that "35 
percent" would be "a good score."

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Rudolf Scharping, the SPD [Social 
Democratic Party] leader and candidate for the chancellorship, 
has described the dispute, now resolved, about the farewell 
ceremony for the Russian troops as "incomprehensible and 
harmful." Following a talk with Yeltsin in Bonn today, 
Scharping said the German Government bears sole responsibility 
for the unncessary irritations which have arisen. The SPD has 
from the beginning insisted on a "worthy" farewell for the 
troops in Berlin. The talk at the Petersberg near Bonn was also 
attended by North-Rhine Westphalia Premier Johannes Rau (SPD), 
and SPD Bundestag group Leader Hans- Ulrich Klose. 
  Scharping accepted an invitation from Yeltsin to visit 
Russia. An appropriate date for the visit still has to be 
discussed. 
  Scharping said that in his talk with Yeltsin he referred to 
the special importance of the "good" German-Russian relations. 
It is important for other Western states to become as strongly 
involved in Russia as the Federal Republic in order to lend 
support to Yeltsin's policy of political and economic reform. 
The SPD leader described economic relations between the two 
countries as "capable of being developed." He cited as examples 
the scientific, research, and technology spheres. Yeltsin 
stressed that his country wants to be a partner with equal 
rights in international organizations. 
  Yeltsin will also meet this morning with Theo Waigel, CSU 
[Christian Social Union] chairman and federal finance minister. 
Afterward, Yeltsin and Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl will set 
off on a tour of the Palatinate district. The two politciains 
are to visit Speyer Cathedral this afternoon. Yeltsin has also 
been invited to Kohl's home in Ludwigshafen-Oggersheim. 
  Yeltsin will go to Baden-Wuerttemberg tomorrow, the third 
and 
final day of his visit to Germany.

  [Text] Bern, 20 Apr (ATSA) -- Switzerland should ratify the 
international convention banning chemical weapons and calling 
for their destruction. The Federal Council made this proposal 
to the Assembly in a message that was adopted on Wednesday [13 
April]. The convention is the first disarmament treaty for an 
entire category of mass-destruction weapons. Switzerland has no 
chemical weapons. 
  In January 1993, Switzerland signed the convention that bans 
the design, manufacture, storage, and use of chemical weapons. 
The participating states also pledged never to help anyone 
undertake activities breaking this convention. Besides, all 
existing stocks of chemical weapons must be destroyed, as well 
as the plants innvolved in the making of such weapons and the 
weapons left by a state on foreign territory. 
  An exhaustive monitoring system -- extended to the civilian 
chemic -- will be set up to ensure that the convention is 
complied with. An international organization on banning 
chemical weapons will be established in The Hague to carry out 
this monitoring function. Over 150 states have signed the 
convention up till now, including Switzerland in January 1993. 
<H5>  No Problem for Switzerland </H5>
  In its message, the Federal Council stressed that 
Switzerland 
itself does not have any mass-destruction weapons. It considers 
that the convention on chemical weapons is, together with the 
nonproliferation treaty, the most important multilateral treaty 
in the security field. The elimination of chemical weapons will 
reduce the risk of a serious military threat. The government 
further says that the destruction of such weapons will have to 
respect the environment. 
  The government underlines that the Swiss chemical industry 
unreservedly adheres to the objectives of the convention. 
Implementing this convention does not require creating new 
institutions or laws, but nevertheless implies considerable 
monitoring activities.

  [Excerpts] Athens, 12 May (ITAR-TASS) -- "All initiatives 
concerning the fundamental interests of stability and security 
in Europe are best to be implemented within the CSCE framework." 
Such is the position taken by the Russian diplomacy on the pact 
for stability in Europe which is planned to be signed on 26-27 
May in Paris, as members of the Russian delegation that took 
part in a preparatory meeting of senior officials held in Athens 
on Thursday told an ITAR-TASS correspondent today. 
  The meeting was attended by delegations from almost all 
European countries, the United States and Canada, as well as 
seven international organizations including the United Nations, 
CSCE, the European Commission, WEU [Western European Union] and 
NATO. The CIS countries were represented by delegations from 
Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova. Armenia and Azerbaijan 
were present as observers. [passage omitted: initiative of the 
pact was originally proposed by French Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur, and later became an EC project] 
  As ITAR-TASS correspondent learned, Russian diplomatic 
circles are especially concerned about the question of borders. 
Russia believes that this question should be considered only on 
the basis of such fundamental principles of the CSCE as 
inviolability of the borders, respect for territorial integrity 
of the states and their sovereignty. [passage omitted: general 
topics under consideration at the conference included questions 
of national minorities and setting up regional negotiation 
tables for the Baltic and Central European regions]

  [Text] Vienna, May 17 (AFP) -- German Foreign Minister 
Klaus Kinkel insisted Tuesday [17 May] that Russia must not be 
granted an official veto over whether Eastern and Central 
European countries join NATO. 
  He said this rule also should apply to membership of the 
Western European Union, effectively the military wing of the 
European Union. 
  Kinkel was in Vienna with his Dutch counterpart, Pieter 
Kooijmans, to present a joint initiative on strengthening the 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) in the 
area of conflict prevention. 
  Speaking at a press conference, they expressed hope that the 
plan would be approved at a CSCE summit in December in Budapest. 
  Kinkel said that in the wake of the Cold War, Eastern and 
Central European countries needed to avoid "new divisions" and 
that this was why NATO's Partnership for Peace [PFP] plan was 
open to both Russia and them. 
  The Russians, he noted, want to join the partnership but 
"are 
seeking certain specific rules in their negotiations with the 
alliance." 
  The plan offers military cooperation in a number of areas 
between NATO and mainly the former Warsaw Pact countries but 
stops short of offering full membership any time soon. 
  It was conceived in January by the United States as a way to 
respond to Eastern European countries' pleas for greater 
security at a time of political volatility and growing 
nationalism in Russia without alienating Russia itself. 
  On the CSCE, Kooijmans said one of the main goals of the 
German-Dutch initiative was to boost the CSCE as a regional 
organization to help the United Nations.

  [Summary] Australia has ratified the Chemical Weapons 
Convention. The ratification deposited with the United Nations 
in New York means Australia is the sixth country to ratify the 
convention. Since the convention opened in January last year, 
157 countries [word indistinct]. The convention banning 
chemical weapons will take effect after it is ratified by 65 
countries. Australia's foreign minister, Gareth Evans, said 
Australia's ratification ensured it would continue to play a 
leading role in efforts to get a global ban on chemical weapons.

  [Text] It was revealed on 23 April that the U.S. 
Department of Defense [DOD] has briefed the Japanese defense 
industry about the development costs concerning the Theater 
Missile Defense (TMD) project, which will amount to $30 billion 
(approximately 3 trillion yen). According to a source concerned 
with the industry, the DOD has asked the Japanese industry "to 
participate in the development of the TMD, or provide advanced 
technology equivalent to the amount of the development costs." 
  Under the TMD system, reconnaissance satellites and other 
devices confirm the launching of missiles by an enemy, then 
multi-stage pursuit missiles shoot them down. Taking into 
consideration that the DPRK (North Korea) has succeeded in test 
launching a ballistic missile the range of which can reach 
Japan, the United States has indicated its proposal to the 
Defense Agency for joint development of the TMD system between 
Japan and the United States. The two countries are now holding 
working-level discussions on the proposal. 
  The Japanese defense industry has suffered from a decrease 
in 
business due to restraints on defense expenses. As stated by an 
executive of a major missile-related company, for this reason 
each defense-related company is considering whether it is 
possible to make good use of its technology, stating that "the 
TMD is an attractive project because it will lead to new 
business projects." 
  However, it is not easy for them to provide the United 
States 
with technology equivalent to development costs totaling $30 
billion. A person concerned with the industry said: "It is 
feared that cooperation may not be limited to technology of 
liquid crystals and compound materials, which the United States 
has originally demanded." Moreover, it is expected the United 
States will divert Japan's technology to other purposes, such as 
civilian production. 
  According to an executive of a defense-related company, 
because it is reportedly "difficult for both the Japanese 
Government and private sector" to share a considerable amount of 
the development costs due to the financial conditions and 
management environment of private companies, Japan will likely 
face difficulties in dealing with the U.S. proposal.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
concluded a secret agreement in 1969 under which the U.S. can 
redeploy and transport nuclear weapons in Okinawa Prefecture in 
case of emergency, according to a book to be published Thursday 
[12 May]. 
  Kei Wakaizumi, a former professor of international politics 
at Kyoto Industrial University, said in his new book that the 
two countries concluded the secret deal during summit talks 
between then Prime Minister Eisaku Sato and President Richard 
Nixon in November 1969. 
  According to the book, a draft of agreed minutes to the 
Japan-U.S. Joint Communique Nov. 21, 1969, stated in part, "In 
times of great emergency the United States government will 
require the reentry of nuclear weapons and transit rights in 
Okinawa with prior consultation with the Government of Japan." 
  The agreed minutes also said, "The Government of Japan, 
appreciating the United States Government's requirements in 
times of great emergency as stated above by the President, will 
meet these requirements without delay when such prior 
consultation takes place." 
  As Sato's special envoy, Wakaizumi at the time was 
negotiating the reversion of Okinawa to Japanese control with 
Henry Kissinger, Nixon's national security adviser. 
  The U.S. had maintained a presence of nuclear weapons in 
Okinawa before the territory was returned to Japan by the Nixon 
administration in 1972. 
  Prime Minister Sato had insisted then that Japan would 
reject 
the reentry of nuclear weapons into Okinawa even if there were 
prior consultations.

  [Text] Sofia, April 26 (BTA) -- Mr. Ian Kenyon, executive 
secretary of the preparatory commission to set up an 
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), 
told a news conference at the Foreign Ministry here today that 
Bulgaria has the political will to ratify within the coming 
weeks the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, 
Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their 
Destruction. 
  He was referring to the assurances he received this morning 
at a meeting with ranking members of the National Assembly 
Committee on National Security. 
  Mr. Kenyon said that at a meeting with military leaders of 
the General Staff he had discussed the question of Bulgaria's 
protection against a possible use of chemical weapons and the 
measures which the Bulgarian Army will take in the event of a 
threat of use of such weapons of mass destruction in a possible 
military conflict. 
  Asked by BTA whether the commission has information that any 
of the warring parties in the Yugoconflict has used chemical 
weapons, Mr. Kenyon said that he only had an information 
bulletin, according to which primitive warfare chemical agents 
like chlorine had been used in the former Yugoslavia but did not 
have evidence of the use of nerve gases. 
  These are just a couple of bulletins and not evidence, he 
emphasized. Of course, when the convention enters into force, 
inspectors will be sent there to verify the truth.

<F P=106> ["Bulgaria Keeps Neither Its Own Nor Somebody Else's </F>
Chemical Weapons, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Says" -- BTA 
headline] 
  [Text] Sofia, April 25 (BTA) -- "Bulgaria keeps neither 
its own nor somebody else's chemical weapons. We are absolutely 
clean in this respect," Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav 
Daskalov today told Mr. Ian Kenyon, Executive Secretary of the 
Steering Committee for the setting up of an organization seeking 
a ban on chemical weapons, who is now visiting Bulgaria. BTA 
learned this from a Foreign Ministry spokesman. 
  Mr. Daskalov reportedly briefed the guest on an April 11 
cabinet decisions providing for the introduction at parliament 
of a bill on the ratification of the chemical weapons 
convention. The convention was signed by the foreign ministers 
of 126 countries, Bulgaria including, at a 1992 Paris meeting, 
to introduce a ban on the development, production, piling and 
use of chemical weapons and provide for their destruction. 
  Foreign Minister Daskalov stressed that the forthcoming 
ratification of this convention is consistent with Bulgaria's 
interests. Joining the European structures, which is this 
country's major aspiration, entails accession to all 
international accords pertaining to the arms control and 
particularly the control on mass annihilations arms, Mr. 
Daskalov also said. 
  The talks stressed that Bulgaria has an advanced chemical 
industry and is therefore a potential producer of chemical 
weapons, this Foreign Ministry spokesman also said. For this 
reason, and under the clauses of the effective international 
agreements, this country is liable to international control. 
The committee will undertake the training of Bulgarian experts 
in this sphere. 
  Asked whether the talks touched upon the possible use of 
chemical weapons by any of the sides involved in the 
Yugoconflict, this spokesman answered in the negative. However, 
Mr. Daskalov reportedly expressed Bulgaria's stance, that "being 
situated in a highly neuralgic area, it is interested in finding 
a complex solution to the problem pertaining to the ban and 
destruction of mass annihilation arms".

    [Editorial report] The following is a compilation of 
fileworthy reports on antinarcotics operations in countries 
monitored by FBIS London Bureau from 22-28 April. Sources are 
given in parentheses at the end of each report. 
<H5>  France </H5>
  Customs officers in Brest made a record seizure of 9.5 
tonnes 
of cannabis resin from Morocco on 23 April. The drugs have a 
street value of 380 million francs. The cannabis resin was 
hidden on the B. Vandamme, a tugboat inspected on 21 April at 
the entry of the driving guide rail of Ouessant (Finistere). 
This is believed to be the third biggest seizure in France on a 
ship. (Paris France-2 Teletext in French 1741 GMT 23 Apr 94) 
<H5>  Belgium </H5>
  There has been a huge drugs seizure in the North Sea: the 
gendarmerie, navy, and air force joined efforts to nab 12 
criminals. Result: 10 tonnes of hashish seized, worth 1 billion 
Belgian francs. It was a veritable armada that pursued the 
smugglers: 165 gendarmes and 200 troops. For several months, 
the Brugge gendarmerie had known that a Belgian criminal 
organization was transporting drugs by sea. They learned 
recently that there was hashish on board the Berceuse, a Belgian 
ship coming from Morocco. They also learned that the drugs 
would be transshipped at sea onto the Orca, a small fishing 
vessel from Zeebrugge. On the night of 23 April, the two ships 
were intercepted at sea as the transshipment was taking place. 
The crew was caught red-handed, and the cargo and vessels were 
seized. (Brussels La Une Radio Network in French 1600 GMT 24 Apr 
94) 
  In Antwerp, the police have seized more than a kilo of 
cocaine in the port. Seven people have been arrested, including 
four Dutch nationals. The drug seized would have fetched six 
million francs for the traffickers. (Brussels La Une Radio 
Network in French 1400 GMT 28 Apr 94) 
<H5>  Iran </H5>
  A total of 8,296 kgs of narcotics were seized over the last 
Iranian month (March 21-April 21), which shows an increase of 
25.83 percent as compared with the same period last year. A 
report by the anti-drug campaign hq. at the presidential bureau 
here said on 25 April that the haul included 7,327 kgs of opium, 
674 kgs of hashish, 243 kgs of morphine, 49.5 kgs of heroine, 
and 2.5 kgs of other drugs. It said 2,134 drug traffickers were 
arrested the same period, adding that 63.6 percent of the 
narcotics were seized in Sistan-Baluchestan, 10.6 percent in 
Kerman, and 8.5 percent in Khorasan provinces. (Tehran IRNA in 
English 1457 GMT 25 Apr 94) 
<H5>  Sweden </H5>
  Customs at Arlanda (Stockholm airport) arrested a suspected 
drugs courier carrying 360 grams of heroin. The man, coming 
from Gambia, has been detained suspected of gross smuggling of 
goods and an aggravated drug offense. The street value of the 
confiscated heroin is about 900,000 crowns. (Stockholm Radio 
Sweden in Swedish 2000 GMT 24 Apr 94) 
<H5>  United Kingdom </H5>
  Detectives who seized 20 kilos of "exceptionally pure" 
heroin 
worth up to 6 million British pounds charged five men -- three 
Turks and two Britons -- with conspiracy to supply heroin.. 
They were arrested in raids in east London on 22 April. (London 
PRESS ASSOCIATION 2141 GMT 23 Apr 94) 
  British police in the port of Liverpool seized a huge 
shipment of cocaine being smuggled from Venezuela to Poland. 
Nearly 1.5 tonnes of the drug was shipped aboard the Polish 
vessel Jurata from the Venezuelan port of La Guaira. The 
developments took place four months ago, but the British customs 
authorities chief broke the news here on 26 April. (Warsaw PAP 
in English 1848 GMT 26 Apr 94) 
  Customs officers at Gatwick Airport have been sickened by a 
sleazy new tactic adopted by cocaine smugglers. A kilo of the 
drug -- worth 72,000 British pounds -- was discovered hidden in 
excrement, packed among foodstuffs, apparently brought into 
Britain by a Nigerian woman. The find was made after a flight 
from Nigeria landed. David Chesters, assistant collector for 
Her Majesty's Customs, said: "There was an appalling smell and 
the Customs Hall had to be fumigated. This is the first time I 
have come across such a tactic. Clearly, they were trying to 
fool the sniffer dogs." 
  Officers at the airport said: "The stench was appalling. 
We're used to people swallowing condoms full of cocaine and 
waiting for them to pass it through, but this was disgusting."

<F P=106> [Jason Bennetto article: "Customs Seize Drugs Worth Record </F>
250 Million Pounds] 
  [Text] Customs officers seized Britain's most valuable 
haul of narcotics-cocaine worth 250 million pounds -- in an 
operation to block the South American drug barons' backdoor 
route into western Europe, it was revealed yesterday. The 1,300 
kg -- about 1.3 tons of high-purity cocaine was discovered in 
January, hidden in a consignment of 48 drums of bitumen on a 
cargo vessel docked at Birkenhead, Merseyside, en route to 
Poland. The seizure provides further evidence that South 
American drug barons are using eastern Europe as a backdoor to 
the West for huge quantities of narcotics. 
  Information from British Customs officers also helped the 
Polish authorities snatch a second consignment of cocaine in 
January, this time 520 kg, from a similar route, it was revealed 
yesterday. Drugs from the two seizures have a street value of 
about 400 million pounds. 
  In the Birkenhead operation, Customs officers removed the 
cocaine barrels and substituted "dummy" drums on board the ship 
which had sailed from Venezuela. It was then tracked to a 
warehouse on the outskirts of Warsaw in Poland. Customs 
officers, however, could not identify the western European and 
Polish figures behind the deal and there have been no arrests. 
  Drug enforcement officers believe the cocaine was destined 
for western Europe and some would almost certainly have been 
sold on the streets of Britain. 
  Douglas Tweddle, the chief investigations officer, said: 
"This massive seizure confirms intelligence reports that the 
South American `narco barons' are targeting cocaine shipments on 
western Europe and are seeking to use east European countries as 
a back door. We are delighted to have been able to work with 
the Polish authorities to inflict this major blow on these 
traffickers." 
  Forty officers were involved in Operation Ayala, after 
intelligence sources based in South America alerted them to the 
bitumen shipment on board the Polish-American ship, the MV 
gurta. The cocaine was probably grown in Bolivia or Peru and 
then processed in Colombia before being sent to the port of La 
Guaira in northern Venezuela. On its arrival on 24 January in 
Birkenhead, the 48 drums were removed, 47 had inner metal 
containers each packed with up to 30 kilos of cocaine. They had 
been insulated to protect the drugs from the heat of the 
bitumen. Replacement barrels of bitumen were put back onto the 
ship. The vessel made a further stop, in Hamburg, Germany, to 
unload cargo before completing its journey to Gdynia in Poland 
on 3 February. 
  The Polish authorities followed the consignment, but have 
failed to catch any of the drug dealers. One man is being 
interviewed by Polish police. 
  The Birkenhead seizure was the largest haul of hard drugs, 
not only in the United Kingdom, but also in central and eastern 
Europe. There have been bigger hauls of cocaine in Spain, the 
Netherlands and Belgium, but the previous biggest UK find -- 932 
kg -- was discovered two years hidden inside lead ingots. 
  The quantity of cocaine seized in Britain is rapidly rising. 
From 611 kg in 1990, to 1,078 kg in 1991, and 2,248 kg in 1992. 
Cocaine shipments to western Europe from South America, 
particularly involving Colombian drug cartels, have surged over 
the past 12 months. Drugs brought in via Spain and eastern 
Europe have been distributed in co-operation with European 
organised crime syndicates, according to drug intelligence 
officers on the Continent. 
  The Balkan route for heroin, which passes from Turkey to 
Western Europe, is still the major global conduit.

<F P=106> [Article by Teuvo Arolainen: "German Police Kept Silent </F>
About Container of Cocaine in Kotka Because They Feared 
Information Leak"] 
  [Text] Wiesbaden -- The police of many countries followed 
the shipment's progress to Russia. Finnish and Swedish officials 
were not informed about it. 
  The narcotics police of several different countries followed 
the arrival of a cocaine shipment weighing more than 1,000 kg in 
Russia from Colombia via Finland over a year ago. The shipment, 
which made a stop in Viipuri, came via Goteborg and Kotka, but 
the Finnish and Swedish police were not informed about it. 
  The Germans, who headed the joint international police 
action, decided right from the start of the operation that the 
Nordic police would not be advised of the shipment beforehand. 
  "We wanted to know whether the shipment was actually going 
to 
St. Petersburg and whether the smuggling route was established 
from Colombia to Germany or elsewhere in West Europe," Chief 
Inspector of Criminal Investigation Juergen Maurer of the German 
central criminal police, the Federal Office of Criminal 
Investigation (BKA), said. "And secondly, we wanted to find out 
whether cooperation between the police of the West and East 
European countries would be successful." 
  "In cases like this -- especially when East European 
criminals are involved -- there is always the danger of 
information leaks. This is why we wanted to keep the tip-off 
within as small as possible a group of people," Maurer said. 
  "It was no indication of any sort of mistrust of the Finnish 
or Swedish police. Sensitive information simply must not be 
given to those who don't need it. I apply the same rule to my 
colleagues," Maurer assured us. 
  In keeping silent about it, the Germans took the risk that 
the shipment that was on its way to St. Petersburg might be 
prematurely revealed. According to Maurer, not even the German 
police knew the exact route. 
  "It was not as though we were letting it get through in a 
controlled way. We only heard about Goteborg and Kotka after the 
fact." 
<H5>  Israeli Contact Man Received Tip </H5>
  At the end of February of last year Viipuri customs agents 
seized the 1,092 kg of cocaine. The foundation for the seizure 
was laid in the Netherlands in late 1992 and early 1993 when an 
Israeli drug contact man stationed in The Hague received a tip: 
A big shipment of cocaine was coming from Colombia to St. 
Petersburg. 
  The tip did not supply the exact timetable or the name of 
the 
ship. However, there was enough information to find the 
shipment. According to the tip, St. Petersburg was to be only an 
intermediate stop. The final destinations of the cocaine were 
supposed to be Belgium and the Netherlands. 
  The contact man got in touch with the local narcotics police 
to get the German BKA to get the Russians to join in in tracking 
down the cocaine. After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, 
contacts were built up between the BKA and the Russian Interior 
Ministry and police. 
  The criminal investigation department organized by the BKA 
reported the shipment to the Russians and offered to cooperate 
with them. They agreed to do so and also agreed that the BKA 
would be the international communication coordinator. 
  Packed into cans of meat, the drugs left Colombia in a 
container in January 1993. An Israeli living in Bogota made the 
arrangements for the shipment. In early February the container 
arrived in Goteborg. It was soon loaded aboard the Finnish 
vessel, Bore Sea, which brought the container to Kotka on 15 
February. 
  The container left Kotka by truck for St. Petersburg via 
Vaalimaa. The contents of the container were spot-checked at 
both Kotka and Vaalimaa, but the Finns did not find the drugs. 
<H5>  Drugs Moved Through Nordic Countries </H5>
  The Russian receivers of the shipment in St. Petersburg were 
named in the tip obtained from the Israeli drug contact man. The 
Russian police arrested them when they came to pick up the 
shipment. Members of the same bunch were arrested later in 
Israel, Colombia, Belgium, and the Netherlands. So there were 
Israelis and Russians, among others, in the group. 
  Afterward, it also became clear to the police how the 
cocaine 
was to be sent back to West Europe. The drugs were supposed to 
be unpacked from the original container in Russia, repacked, and 
sent by truck to Antwerp. They planned to use joint ventures 
operating in St. Petersburg and Moscow as fronts for the 
arrangements. 
  There were probably no ready buyers for the cocaine in the 
West, that is, it was not brought in to meet a ready demand. 
"Smugglers often just bring the drugs into Europe first and only 
later look for markets for them," Chief Inspector Maurer said. 
  Cases of smuggling like the St. Petersburg cocaine shipment 
have come to light in East Europe before, but they usually 
involve smaller amounts. Maurer said that he was sure that drugs 
are moved to Central Europe through the Nordic countries and 
Russia. 
  "We have positive proof that the ports of the Baltic 
countries are used to bring in drugs. It's just that no one can 
say how much." 
  According to him, the St. Petersburg case was not the 
biggest 
cocaine seizure from the Germans' standpoint. "The case proved 
that cooperation with the Russians works very well. There were 
no information leaks and everything that was agreed on was 
adhered to."

  [Excerpt] Lima, 25 Apr (EFE) -- Colombian Foreign Minister 
Noemi Sanin de Rubio announced in Lima today that Colombia and 
Peru will step up the joint struggle against drug trafficking. 
  The Colombian minister, who is paying an official visit to 
Peru, said cooperation between the two countries in this field 
will be increased through the signature of new agreements. 
  In comments to the media, she said there is "great 
cooperation" between Colombia and Peru in the anti-drug field. 
  Sanin de Rubio commented that cooperation in the struggle 
against drug trafficking also includes the legal aspects, and 
disclosed that she had made a proposal in this regard to her 
Peruvian counterpart that will be assessed. 
  The visiting minister said Peru and Colombia are engaged in 
the struggle against drug trafficking and that they need each 
other, as well as the international community's cooperation 
because this problem cannot be fought alone. 
  Sanin arrived in Lima on 23 April. On 24 April, she visited 
Cusco, where an indigenous Inca empire's capital is located, and 
the Inca citadel of Machupicchu. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] La Paz, 27 Apr (EFE) -- Bolivian President 
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada has stated that Bolivia is running the 
risk of becoming the target of "narco-guerrilla" actions. 
  In a statement published by the La Paz newspaper ULTIMA HORA 
today, Sanchez de Lozada explained that in Chapare, a region in 
the central part of Cochabamba Department, "the atmosphere is 
ripe for the establishment of drug cartels or the operations of 
narco- guerrilla groups." [passage omitted] 
  Sanchez de Lozada stated that "all coca leaves produced" in 
the Chapare region are used to manufacture cocaine, not for the 
traditional and legal uses of this leaf. [passage omitted] 
  Sanchez de Lozada also announced that his administration 
wants to draft a new drug enforcement policy in coordination 
with the United States Government. 
  "This is very important for them (the North Americans), 
because even though they have acknowledged after many years that 
the responsibility for this situation should be shared, we must 
come up with a proposal capable of truly resolving this 
problem," the Bolivian president said. 
  Sanchez de Lozada agreed that drug trafficking is one of 
Bolivia's most serious problems, and stressed that it 
jeopardizes Bolivia's relations with the rest of the world.

  [Text] La Paz, 28 Apr (EFE) -- Bolivian President Gonzalo 
Sanchez de Lozada has ordered military troops to the streets and 
national highways to control public order and guarantee free 
transit, in view of possible road blockades by peasants. 
  The Bolivian Labor Federation (COB) has urged peasants to 
block roads, highways, and railroad tracks as of today to 
increase pressure on the government to yield to their salary 
demands. 
  Bolivian main cities were today under military control, 
while 
several military units were patrolling highways to stop peasants 
from complying with the COB appeal. 
  Although the government has expressed its willingness to 
negotiate with union leaders, it has warned that it is very 
difficult to amend the budget law which provides for an 8 
percent salary increase because "there is no flexibility in the 
allotment of resources." 
  Military and police officials have reported that all roads 
were cleared during the first 12 hours of the day; but they 
admitted that several roadblocks were set up at different 
locations. 
  However, Radio Fides in La Paz reported that peasants have 
complied with the COB instructions to block roads and railroad 
tracks. 
  Peasant Leader Juan de La Curz Villca asserted that about 
30,000 members of the coca leaf farmers union in the El Chapare 
region have set up roadblocks on the main highway linking 
Cochabamba and Santa Cruz. 
  Villca warned that the producers of coca leaves, a 
traditional product for Bolivian indigenous groups that is also 
the basic ingredient for manufacturing cocaine, have reported 
"they will not lift the roadblocks, not even under machine gun 
fire." 
  Union leader David Herrada asked the members of the Armed 
Forces and the police to join the blockade in Cochabamba. He 
said: "If we take another piece out of this neoliberal 
government it will also benefit the police and the Armed Forces, 
who also have low salaries, like the workers." 
  The prefect (governor) of Chuquisaca, Omar Montalvo, 
confirmed that the military unit patrolling Sucre and the access 
roads will break up any demonstration and prevent any road 
blockade. 
  A Sucre radio station reported that about 3,000 peasants 
closed roads in five of the 10 districts of Chuquisaca. 
  In addition some buses going to Potosi had problems in 
arriving in that city due to the blockades set up by the 
peasants. 
  Several military units have been deployed to other regions 
of 
the southern part of the country, where roads and railroad 
tracks were closed. 
  The FIDES news agency reported that in Camargo, in the 
southern part of the country, about 500 peasants prevented about 
100 cargo and passenger vehicles from passing, and that because 
of this a two-year-old girl "died from the very cold weather 
early this morning." 
  Some cargo and bus companies have suspended services while 
the strike ordered by the COB continues. 
  Despite the tense situation created by the presence of 
military troops on the streets and the road blockades, 
government officials and COB leaders are holding talks behind 
closed doors in an effort to find a solution to the crisis. 
  The appeal made by the COB to the Catholic Church to mediate 
in the conflict was rejected by Apostolic Nuncio Giovanni 
Tonnucci, who said that the church cannot mediate "among people 
who turn a deaf ear to dialogue."

<F P=106> [Interview with Cochabamba tropical region peasant leader </F>
Evo Morales by Jaime Murillo in El Chapare -- live] 
  [Text] Murillo: We are talking with peasant 
leader Evo Morales. Can you tell us what is going on in Villa 
Tunari? We heard that a lot of people are worried because 
traffic to Santa Cruz has been interrupted. 
  Morales: Yes, since 0200 yesterday all national 
roads have been blocked. It is true that traffic to many 
places, that is to Santa Cruz or San Pedro de Cochabamba, has 
been interrupted. Within this framework, I heard that the [word 
indistinct] passengers are holding Villa Tunari mayor, who 
belongs to the MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement] hostage 
in demand for a solution to this problem, that is, they are 
helping him find a solution. [as heard] 
  Evidently other people, including women and children, are 
worried about this. We are seeking a solution to the problem of 
people who must urgently travel to Santa Cruz and Cochabamba. 
  Murillo: We have heard that some pregnant women 
are not receiving medical attention in the Villa Tunari health 
units. 
  Morales: This is totally false. We are the ones 
who are making the medical attention possible. Fortunately, the 
doctor of Villa Tunari is my friend. He attended me after I was 
attacked by Umopar [Mobile Police Unit for Rural Areas] agents 
in 1989. He is a great friend of mine and therefore he is 
giving medical attention in the most direct and practical manner 
in the area. 
  Murillo: Will traffic be opened for people who 
have an emergency? 
  Morales: We are authorizing transshipments to 
Santa Cruz and Cochabamba, but nothing more can be done. 
Yesterday it was still possible to travel because the 
Cochabamba-Villa Tunari road was not blocked. Blockades began 
last night. [words indistinct] There are some drivers who want 
to continue with their personal business rather than to protect 
the lives of women and children and they are trying to discredit 
and force the lifting of road blockades. 
  Murillo: What is the situation now in tropical 
Cochabamba region? We understand there are 20 injured 
individuals as consequence of a clash that took place yesterday. 
  }Morales: I have heard nothing from Bulu Bulu and 
Ivirgarzama. However, there was a clash in Sinaota at about 1700 
or 1800 yesterday when the Sole Federation of United Centrals 
and the Sinaota people began blocking the roads. Two U.S. DEA 
vehicles were stopped. They were carrying DEA members, that is, 
gringos. They asked for reinforcements to recover their 
freedom. Umopar agents came to help them and the DEA agents 
recovered their freedom. The road blockade was later reinstated 
in Sinaota. I have no information about injured people. In 
Villa Tunari, the Federation of Tropical Region Peasants is 
totally optimistic regarding the road blockades. They are proud 
and have stamina to continue imposing the road blockade. We 
will meet at 0800 to plan and organize many more actions. We 
will establish shifts to guarantee the road blockade. [end

  [Text] The narcotics trade in Rio de Janeiro has not 
changed since the home of numbers game kingpin Castor de Andrade 
was raided on 30 March. Marijuana and cocaine continue to be 
sold at a rapid pace despite state attorneys' revelations that 
numbers game people are linked to drug trafficking. Last week a 
truck coming from Bolivia ensured a 30-day supply of cocaine to 
all the southern districts of Rio de Janeiro and to some of the 
northern districts. The truck, which carried hardwood, brought 
100 kg of the drug from the Chapare Region, where there are 
large coca leaf plantations. 
  Drug trafficker Joao Matuto -- a narcotics trade leader in 
the Rocinha slum -- was responsible for this shipment. Matuto 
sent a message to the state attorneys: "This business about 
Castor de Andrade has political roots; it will end up as 
nothing." 
  Half of the cargo that arrived in Rocinha is enough to 
supply 
the slum for one month. The other half will be stored or resold 
to drug traffickers linked to Joao Matuto. The drugs were 
purchased for $1,500 per kg in Bolivia, but will reach 
consumer's hands at a price almost seven times higher. It will 
be sold for an average of $10 per gram. 
  A drug trafficker linked to Matuto asserted: "If there are 
indeed links with the numbers game people, it must be in 
relation to international drug trafficking. It has nothing to 
do with us." Without worrying about defending the numbers game 
people, the drug traffickers explain that the retail sale of the 
drugs does not require financing to reach the streets. "Those 
who are trusted can simply take the drugs and pay for them 
later. The sales profits guarantee that those who sold the 
drugs will pay for them," he added. 
  Drug traffickers Joao Matuto, Jorge Luis of the Acari slum, 
and Miltinho da Ilha are considered the Rio de Janeiro State 
drug trafficking barons. One step below are drug traffickers 
Orlando Jogador from Leopoldina District and Pedrinho Maluco of 
the so-called Western Zone of the city. They are the only ones 
capable of ensuring the arrival of large shipments of drugs, 
similar to that which arrived in the Rocinha slum last week. 
  The rest of the drug arrives in the country thanks to mules 
(or matutos) who travel to Bolivia or Colombia, which are drug 
producing countries, and then bring the drugs to the slums in 
their backpacks. There are nearly 300 of these small drug 
traffickers in Rio de Janeiro. They always carry drugs, but 
never more than 5 kg of marijuana or cocaine. 
  According to arms traffickers, the weapons market functions 
in a slightly different manner. Most of the arms reach the 
country through the airport, and depend on federal police 
cooperation. Arms circulation -- an illegal weapon can change 
hands between policemen and drug traffickers several times -- 
makes it less necessary to import arms than drugs. Policemen 
seize AR-15 rifles, HK submachine guns, and 9 mm pistols from 
criminals. Policemen then sell these arms, and they end up in 
the hands of the criminals again. Currently an AR-15 rifle is 
worth $4,000, an HK submachine gun $3,500, and a pistol $1,500. 
  The arms that do not arrive on planes are brought to the 
country by the mules (or matutos) and follow routes similar to 
those followed by the drugs. They can come from Paraguay, 
Bolivia, or Colombia. The number of arms mules is much smaller 
than that of drug mules. In the Rocinha slum, for example, 
there are only four or five arms mules. 
  To reach the slums with marijuana or cocaine, the drug 
traffickers must duck policemen at the control posts along the 
highways connecting Rio de Janeiro to foreign borders, and count 
on the policemen's cooperation to do so. Today the highways 
that are used most often to bring drugs or arms into the country 
begin at the Bolivian, Colombian, and Paraguayan borders and 
cross the states of Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Parana, and 
Sao Paulo. 
  Bolivian cocaine crosses to the Brazilian side through the 
town of San Matias. From there on, the trucks follow a dirt 
road up to the city of Caceres, 180 km from Cuiaba (Mato Grosso 
State). There they find the first obstacle: a Federal Highway 
Police control post that has to be eluded with the help of the 
local farmers, who allow the mules to cross their land. 
  The route then crosses Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul 
State, along the BR-163 highway. The route then follows along 
BR-262 highway up to Tres Lagoas on the Sao Paulo State border, 
and reaches Rio de Janeiro through the Presidente Dutra Highway. 
The strategic points in the most used highway arms route are 
Pedro Juan Caballero, Paraguay, and its neighboring Brazilian 
town of Ponta Pora. To reach Rio de Janeiro, the arms cross 
Dourados and Nova Alvorada (Mato Grosso do Sul State), and 
Presidente Epitacio (Sao Paulo State). 
  Other drugs and arms shipments arrive in small planes that 
fly from Colombia to Sao Paulo and then land in small 
clandestine airports at the town of Angra dos Reis on the 
so-called Green Coast. The shipments then reach Rio de Janeiro 
through the Rio-Santos highway. The shipments are obtained from 
the producers through a trust system: The drug is paid for only 
after it is sold to consumers.

  [Text] Doctor Elisaldo de Araujo Carlini is the first 
Brazilian to occupy a seat on the famous INCB [International 
Narcotics Control Board]. This organization, which controls 
narcotics and psychotropic drugs worldwide, is linked to the 
United Nations. Carlini was chosen on 19 April during the third 
round of elections and was appointed World Health Organization 
representative at the INCB. He disputed the position with 
representatives of the PRC and the Philippines. He will be 
installed in Vienna during the second half of the year. 
  Carlini has a well-defined line of action and wants to urge 
Brazil to comply with the international treaty terms that force 
countries to report on their production, import, and consumption 
of drugs that affect the brain and create addiction, such as 
morphine byproducts and psychotropic substances. Carlini 
criticized: "For three years Brazil has been sending incomplete 
reports to the INCB or not sending reports at all." Brazil has 
never before been represented on the INCB (which comprises 13 
members with 5-year mandates), but has signed the 1961 and 1971 
conventions that establish rules to control drug circulation 
worldwide. 
  Carlini said: "I will press the Board to adopt a firmer 
position regarding Brazil." Carlini is a psycho-pharmacist and 
a professor at the Sao Paulo Medical School. He founded the 
Brazilian Center for Information on Psychotropic Drugs [Centro 
Brasileiro de Informacoes Sobre Drogas Psicotropicas--Cebrid] 
and has published nearly 200 papers on controlled drugs.

<F P=106> [Article by Renato Garcia] </F>
  [Excerpts] According to information obtained by the Federal 
Police [PF] Maritime, Air, and Border Police Department [DPMAF], 
Livio Cecchini Bruni Junior, who in 1984 had attempted to ship 
cocaine to the United States in sardine cans, returned to Rio de 
Janeiro early last year. The trafficker is still at large, 
somewhere in the state, despite the incessant pursuit conducted 
by federal agents. During December, the Rio Civil Police sought 
fame, attempting to achieve it by capturing Chico Mendes's 
killers, the rancher Darli Alves da Silva and his son, Darci 
Alves Pereira, who were hiding at a site on the outskirts of 
Nova Iguacu. However, the information was "leaked," and the pair 
escaped. 
  For over 10 years, the American trafficker, William Reed 
Elswick, aka "Captain America," has been living with impunity in 
Brazil (despite the consecutive requests from the U.S. 
Government for his extradition), thanks to a fortune estimated 
at $20 million. 
  "Livinho" or "Dom Xereta," Darli, Darci, and "Captain 
America" are the main characters in the stories that the 
Federal, Civil, and Military Police prefer not to tell. They are 
serial accounts of the secret operations conducted by them that 
have not attained the desired success. Lack of good fortune or 
resources, "leaks" of information, incompetence, the Brazilian 
legislation itself, the slowness of the justice system, or 
police corruption explain the failures of those searches. In the 
Polinter-Rio [Rio Interstate Police] agency alone, there are 
over 300,000 arrest warrants against criminals in the state or 
in other units of the Federation that the police have failed to 
implement. 
  Currently, in Rio de Janeiro, the three forces' major 
concern 
is to abort the embryonic drug cartel organized by the Red 
Command [CV] traffickers, Orlando da Conceicao, aka "Orlando 
Jogador," and Ernaldo Pinto Medeiros, aka "Garoto." According to 
the Civil Police top echelon, the concept of the most dangerous 
outlaws in the state changed after the charges made by X-9 (a 
pimp), Ivan Custodio de Lima, the principal witness of the 
Vigario Geral massacre. The publicity concerning police 
extortion also has been cited as a prime factor in the failures 
of operations planned for capturing dangerous outlaws. 
  Among the three forces' rank and file, however, the view is 
that the limits imposed by the Brizola government on the police 
are making the criminals' lives easy. 
  The Federal Police superintendent in Rio, officer Edson 
Antonio de Oliveira, now claims that the weakness in the 
Brazilian legislation and the lack of an international agreement 
that would hasten the issuance of arrest warrants are 
obstructing police action. Interpol maintains that the Mafia has 
a base of operations in South America, with ramifications in 
Brazil, notably in Rio. However, to capture a "Mafioso," the PF 
must wait for an arrest warrant from an Italian judge. The 
warrant takes up to a year to arrive. 
<H5>  `Captain America' Still At Large </H5>
  Capturing William Reed Elswick, "Captain America," became 
such a great obsession for the PF superintendent in Rio, Edson 
Antonio de Oliveira, that it caused him to confuse the 
"mega-trafficker" with his accomplice, the American businessman 
Donald Anthony Kohel. In April of last year, Kohel was arrested 
in Sao Conrado with marijuana, weapons, and photos of nude minor 
girls. The federal agents rejoiced, thinking that they had 
actually captured Elswick. The confusion was dispelled when the 
PF received "Captain America's" fingerprints from the FBI. 
  It was a disappointment for Edson Antonio de Oliveira, who 
had managed to capture Elswick in Rio during January 1985. The 
American trafficker was released 11 days later by virtue of a 
habeas corpus signed by the then president of the Federal 
Supreme Court [STF], Joao Batista Cordeiro Guerra, now deceased. 
Ten days after Elswick's release, the STF unanimously revoked 
Cordeiro Guerra's decision. It was too late: "Captain America" 
had already escaped. To Oliveiro's even greater disappointment, 
the trafficker's double and accomplice, Donald Kohel, also 
obtained a habeas corpus, was released two days after his 
arrest, and fled. The Federal Police were left with the 
consolation of having arrested another accomplice of "Captain 
America," the trafficker Terry Mike Lee, aged 40. [passage 
omitted] 
<H5>  `Orlando Jogador' Has Special Protection </H5>
  If the police have, for six months, been unable to find the 
one in charge of the embryonic Rio drug cartel, trafficker 
Orlando da Conceicao, aka "Orlando Jogador," it is because there 
are policemen implicated with the outlaw. The suspicion on the 
part of the new Civil Police secretary, Jorge Mario Gomes, was 
confirmed by the arrest of detective Cesar Pereira da Silva in 
December. Identified as "Orlando Jogador's" security chief, the 
policeman was arrested with the trafficker Miguel Silveira de 
Miranda and two women in an apartment on Jose Bonifacio Street 
in Meier. 
  The Civil Police Narcotics Repression Division [DRE] has had 
the same difficulty in arresting Ernaldo Pinto Medeiros, known 
as "Ue" or "Garoto," who supplies cocaine to "Orlando Jogador" 
and other Rio traffickers. According to the DRE detectives, 
"Ue's" security force consists of Civil and Military Police 
members as well as prison agents. The two outlaws have always 
been informed of the operations mounted to capture them long 
before they were due to be carried out. The police action 
against them is doomed to failure. Like "Ue" and "Jogador," 
nearly 300,000 outlaws sought by the Brazilian justice system 
are living peacefully in Rio de Janeiro. 
<H5>  Trafficker Livio Bruni Had Plastic Surgery, Returned to Rio </H5>
  The target of various Federal Police operations during the 
past 12 months, the trafficker Livio Cecchini Bruni Junior, 
called "Livinho," and also known as "Dom Xereta," "Padrinho," or 
"Snake," is, like the rancher, Darli Alves dos Santos and his 
son, Darci, also located in Rio de Janeiro. Even Civil Police 
members were involved in the search for Livio Bruni Junior, but 
they have been unsuccessful thus far. The agents are hampered by 
the lack of a recent photo of the Brazilian "Mafioso." According 
to the agents, Bruni Junior altered his appearance completely by 
undergoing minor plastic surgery on his face. 
  "Livinho" arrived in Rio with three other Italian 
traffickers 
linked to the Sicilian Mafia, whose identities the Federal 
Police prefer to keep secret. It was not until after the four 
fugitives from Italian justice (Bruni Junio is a fugitive from 
Brazilian justice as well) had entered Brazil and changed their 
identities that the Federal Police traced their entry into the 
country through Rio International Airport. According to the 
police, "Dom Xereta" returned to resume an old plan: that of 
being the "Mafia's man" in Brazil. The PF have already tracked 
"Livinho's" passage through Buzios and Angra dos Reis, where 
they attempted to corner him. Livio Bruni Junior has been 
charged in Rio, Niteroi, and Teresopolis with drug trafficking, 
murders, and kidnappings.

  [Text] The Federal Police [PF] are tightening the cordon 
around the cocaine traffic in the Amazon Region, but the country 
still lacks an effective policy for preventing drug use and 
treating addicts. 
  Wednesday, 23 March. It is nearly midnight in Jutica, a 
settlement on the Amazon shore inhabited by no more than 50 
persons, and a two-hour boat trip from Tefe. Here, the river 
records one of its narrowest widths: approximately 6 km from one 
side to the other, until it reaches over 90 km at its mouth, 
many traveling days ahead. At this deserted site, surrounded by 
the forest, a natural habitat for cashew pickers, no one can 
complain of monotony. On the horizon visible to the naked eye, 
one can now discern the outline of an immense ship, all lit up, 
suggesting the appearance of a large Christmas tree floating on 
the Amazon. It is the Rio Guama, arriving from Tabatinga, on the 
Colombian border, and promptly forced to anchor by seven men 
armed with machine guns, FAL rifles, and heavy caliber shotguns. 
Subjected to a scrupulous search by Federal Police agents, with 
the aid of drug-sniffing dogs, the ship, with 300 passengers and 
200 tons of cargo, is released three hours later, to continue 
sailing to Manaus. The target of all that searching is cocaine. 
  Anchored in the silence and murkiness of the Amazon jungle, 
the PF's floating headquarters in Jutica is the embryo of an 
ambitious plan intended to track the Colombian cocaine powder 
route. It also includes the monitoring of fuel supply stations 
for private aircraft. The reason for so much concern is simple: 
Last year, the police seized over half a ton of pure cocaine 
transported by planes or boats in the Amazon Region. It is 
through there that the Colombian cocaine is entering the 
national territory, to reach the large consuming centers in 
Southern and West Central Brazil and, in particular, the U.S. 
and European markets. Officer Jairo Cacenote, commander of the 
riparian operation, comments: "The goal is to gradually corner 
the outlaws." 
  The PJ's plan to establish floating headquarters in the 
Amazon Basin has revived the controversy in the country over the 
most effective means of combating drug consumption. On the one 
hand, there are those preaching the notion that drugs must be 
prevented from reaching the user at all costs. On the other, 
there are those considering it a priority to treat addicts and 
to discourage the use of narcotics. "We are working hard to 
prevent a continued flow of the powder on the Amazon. The 
possibility of a direct confrontation between the traffickers 
and the forces of repression hasn't been ruled out." This 
assertion is made by the PF superintendent on the Amazon, Mauro 
Sposito. However, in the opinion of other police members, such 
as the director of the State Narcotics Department (Denarc), 
George Millard, it is unrealistic to expect that repression 
alone will suffice to curb the cocaine market. Millard makes the 
comparison: "It is like drawing water from the sea with a 
perforated bucket." The perforated bucket is certainly 
represented by the unequipped Brazilian police. The problem is 
that, even if the bucket were sound, without spilling a single 
drop, the ocean would still remain to be collected. Millard 
claims: "We must rely on prevention." 
  Cited as the newest cocaine paste producer in a report from 
the UN three weeks ago, Brazil is, in fact, a passageway for 
drugs heading for Europe and the United States. To patrol the 
Northern Region, the police are facing not only internal 
difficulties, but also insecurity regarding their weapons and 
equipment. They are confronted with a powerful enemy (it is 
estimated that the drug traffic turns over $500 billion per year 
worldwide). For the traffickers crossing the Amazon, possible 
disadvantages are largely offset by the profits accrued later. 
On the other side of the border, in the producing countries, a 
kilo of cocaine is worth $1,500. On the Rio-Sao Paulo axis, it 
costs $5,000; and, when unloaded on the European market, it is 
priced at $50,000. That is the explanation for the drug 
traffic's daring, creative behavior. To cross the ocean, drugs 
travel in clothing, packages, or beer cans, if not swallowed by 
the trafficker. The powder has even been discovered inside a 
head of Jesus Christ made of wood. In more sophisticated 
operations, it is concealed in tractor wheel hubs, or inserted 
in blocks of granite. 
  Not even the change of command prompted by the death of 
Pablo 
Escobar, the chief of the Medellin Cartel killed by security 
forces last year, has upset the profitability of the cocaine 
powder business. True, the Medellin Cartel has been crushed, but 
the drug traffic has come under the control of the Cali Cartel, 
Escobar's arch-rival, headed by the Guzman Ramos Gracia family. 
To enter Brazilian territory, the Colombian cocaine goes through 
the hands of a Brazilian, Antonio Mota Graca, aka "Curica," a 
prominent man in the Mafia chain of command. A fugitive since 
1992, when he bribed jail guards in a Sao Paulo prison with 
$300,000, "Curica" set up his headquarters in southern Colombia, 
from which he directs the operation shipping the powder to 
Brazil. Another recent change in the traffic's behavior is its 
association with Colombian guerrillas from the ELN [Army of 
National Liberation] and FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia], as the PF's superintendent on the Amazon points out. 
"We are facing a new phase of the drug traffic on the 
continent," maintains Sposito, who also believes that the 
traffickers are connected with SL [Shining Path], a guerrilla 
group of Maoist orientation in Peru. According to Sposito, the 
drug traffic decided on a "three-way system" for the production 
and storage of cocaine, by joining the guerrillas. 
  Hence, it is not fortuitous that the cleverness and 
refinement of the methods used by the outlaws have forced 
governments of various countries to reconsider their policy for 
fighting the traffic. During the last decade, the United States 
spent $6 billion annually to prevent drugs from reaching its 
territory. The results proved unconvincing: only 20 percent of 
the shipments were seized. Last September, the White House's 
Justice Department chief, Janet Reno, admitted that her 
government had lost the war against the traffickers, who are 
changing routes, circumventing barriers, and modernizing their 
equipment. What is even worse: the American taxpayer has 
realized that he is the one paying for the losses. Internally, 
the costs of maintaining and constructing prisons increased by 
$21 billion during the 1980's, at the height of the hard-line 
policy dictated by the Republican Party. Of every 100,000 
American citizens, 455 were jailed for drug-related crimes, 
including the son of Joyce Elders, the surgeon general, with a 
post equivalent to that of the health minister in Brazil. 
Elders' son attempted to sell a gram of cocaine powder to a 
policeman infiltrated among users. 
  In February of this year, President Bill Clinton announced a 
drastic change in the policy of repression developed during the 
so-called Reagan era. With the end of communism, during that 
period the drug problem had been raised to the category of 
public enemy number one for Americans. "Drugs came to represent 
the source of everything bad in the culture," judges the 
psychiatrist Dartiu Xavier da Silveira, director of the Proad, a 
program of guidance and treatment for drug addicts at the Sao 
Paulo School of Medicine. Clinton envisions saving funds and 
increasing the effectiveness of the battle against trafficking 
with action giving priority to the treatment of addicts. The 
reasoning of the American president, who has already admitted 
experimenting with marijuana in his youth, is quite simple: If 
the number of addicts is reduced, the drug market will tend to 
shrink. It is a long way from theory to practice, but the voices 
opposed to a policy based only on repression are multiplying in 
the United States. Six months ago, the Colombian writer, Gabriel 
Garcia Marquez, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 
1982, defended decriminalization of drug use, in an article 
published in THE NEW YORK TIMES. 
  The turnabout in the U.S. Government's program to combat 
drugs is not an isolated event. Officer Millard, from the 
Denarc, comments: "A city of 17 million inhabitants like Sao 
Paulo has a trafficker in every school, dance-hall, or shopping 
center. When we catch one, another arrives to take his place." 
However, there is no policy for rehabilitating addicts in 
Brazil. Evidence of this is the fact that Deputy Elias Murad's 
(PSDB-MG [Brazilian Social Democracy Party-Minas Gerais]) 
narcotics bill has been stalled on the National Congress voting 
agenda. "The bill was pushed aside by the CPI [Congressional 
Investigating Committee] for the budget and by the 
constitutional revision," complains Deputy Moroni Torgan 
(PSDB-CE [Ceara]), the CPI's reporter on the drug traffic. Among 
other points, Murad's proposal creates clearer distinctions 
between the user and trafficker, imposing more lenient penalties 
on the former and more severe ones on the latter. The 
legislation on drugs currently in force in the country was 
created in 1976. As if the lack of laws geared to reality were 
not enough, the rehabilitation clinics charge prices 
inaccessible to the middle class, whose drug problem is serious. 
This claim is made by Dr. Sabino Farias, director of the Maxwell 
Clinic, in Atibaia, 50 km from Sao Paulo, where the monthly fee 
ranges from $3,000 to $7,000. Farias paid for five minutes on a 
national television network, in prime time, to demand that 
health insurance pay the costs of rehabilitating addicts. "They 
must comply with the resolution of the Federal Council on 
Medicine that requires them to cover all illnesses." 
  With the lack of an effective policy to help the addict, the 
rehabilitation programs have been carried out on the basis of 
good will and improvisation. The Denarc set up a prevention 
service that treats nearly 500 drug users per year, with the aid 
of volunteer psychologists. Oddly enough, the prevention sector 
operates on the floor above the narcotics headquarters on the 
Police Palace premises in downtown Sao Paulo. "The eighth floor 
must act before the seventh is forced to take to the streets for 
repression," notes the prevention sector chief, clerk Sonia 
Depieri. It is on the eighth floor of the Sao Paulo police 
building that the street child, A.L., aged 16, has appeared 
religiously once a week for the past 10 months. There, he talks 
with the psychologist Suzi de Moraes, performing a ritual that 
has helped him to remain far away from "crack." "I would put my 
hand into the fire for him," claims the psychologist. However, 
Suzi complains of the lack of agreements between the government 
and private enterprise that would make it possible to reinstate 
ex-addicts in society. "There are no work-study grants that 
would teach them a trade," she remarks. According to the 
psychologist, an extremely limited number of addicts have a real 
chance to give up the vice. A.L. is not one of them. He will 
soon reach age 18, and will no longer be able to live in public 
boarding-houses, as he is doing now. So, the kid's fate will be 
sealed: a return to the streets. "Helping the addict doesn't 
produce money or notoriety, and doesn't even elect anyone," 
charges Suzi. 
  Furthermore, prejudice is a trademark where drugs are 
concerned. A Denarc investigation of the Sao Paulo trafficker's 
profile dispelled some historical misconceptions, such as the 
notion that most of the outlaws consist of blacks or mulattoes. 
On the contrary: 65 percent of the traffickers arrested in Sao 
Paulo are white. Another simplistic view is that the artisans 
selling trinkets in the squares of Brazilian capitals, direct 
descendants of the "hippies" of the 1960's, comprise the bulk of 
the addicts. The Denarc investigation showed that industrial and 
commercial employees are the leading consumers of narcotics, 
followed by liberal business owners and professionals. The 
Denarc director explains: "There is a great deal of myth 
regarding the subject." 
  However, certain signs indicate a change in mentality with 
respect to the drug problem. For the first time, the Health 
Ministry has authorized the implementation of an AIDS prevention 
plan that would propose "safety" to the user, instead of merely 
repressing drug consumption. A team of 120 "street multipliers," 
as the addicts or ex-addicts serving as contacts with the 
addicted population are called, was recruited by the Sao Paulo 
School of Medicine's Proad. The Proad director, Dartiu Xavier da 
Silveira, reveals: "We are going to teach the user to clean the 
needle and prevent infection with the AIDS virus." The 
psychiatrist adds: "Repression only alienates the addict, 
contributing to the ever-increasing spread of AIDS." 
  Silveira cites the former Soviet Union as an example of a 
country that lost time in the battle against the disease because 
of its prejudice toward the drug user. "Since communism was 
perfect by definition, the Soviet authorities didn't even admit 
the existence of drug addicts." Silveira upholds the idea that 
absolute abstinence is a "utopia without scientific grounds," 
and goes even further: In his view, the addict who gives up 
drugs and becomes a religious fanatic, for example, remains as 
sick as he was before. To be sure, this position is indefensible 
to a large part of the population. Be that as it may, there is 
now consensus among police and physicians regarding the need to 
accelerate the prevention programs, while simultaneously 
fighting the traffic. After all, it seems unlikely that mankind 
will ever be capable of permanently dispensing with the use of 
artificial paradises, as the British writer, Aldous Huxley, 
reasoned. In his view, "The majority of men and women lead lives 
that are so painful, or so monotonous, poor, and limited, that 
the temptation to transcend themselves, even if only for a few 
moments, is and always has been one of the soul's principal 
appetites." 
<H5>  [Boxes, pp 62-64] </H5>
  W.P.O., aged 17: "I began stealing to buy cocaine. My hand 
was shaking when I aimed the weapon and grabbed the guy's bag. 
With the money, I had enough to get 4 grams of the drug. I 
sniffed it all in an hour." 
  W.T.C., aged 26: "Suddenly, my life became complicated. I 
couldn't relate to anyone any longer. My brain seemed to be 
disconnected. I hadn't sniffed cocaine for three days. My time 
clock was slowed down." 
  A.P.S., aged 15: "I began using heroin eight months ago in 
Spain, where my mother lives. She was the one who offered it to 
me. One day, I felt ill, and she sent me back. I want to stop 
now. I'm going to be confined for six months, and study ballet 
again." 
  R.S.D., aged 21: "I have always been open to new 
experiences. 
On a lysergic acid trip I had a vision of a rose. I decided to 
have the image of the flower tattooed on my right arm. Now I 
prefer to smoke marijuana." 
<H5>  [Boxes, pp 62-63] </H5>
  Marijuana: The marijuana cigarette causes relaxation or 
anxiety, with altered memory. Physical effect: red eyes and 
tachycardia. The "packet," with 15 grams, sells for 10,000 
cruzeiros. 
  Cocaine: Injected in the vein or sniffed, it produces 
euphoria with loss of sleep and appetite, causing respiratory 
problems and cardiac arrest. The "envelope" with one gram goes 
for 10,000 cruzeiros. 
  Crack: A mixture of sodium bicarbonate and cocaine paste, 
the 
"acid" is smoked in a pipe; rapid addiction, with serious lung 
damage. One gram of the "acid" costs 5,000 cruzeiros. 
  LSD: Derived from a mushroom, lysergic acid causes visual 
and 
hearing losses, as well as a sensation of pleasure or panic. A 
microdot (LSD dripped on blotting paper) goes for 35,000 
cruzeiros. 
  Ecstasy: The "drug of love" was invented in a laboratory to 
heighten sexual pleasure, but there is a risk of cardiac arrest 
and brain lesions. Rare in Brazil, the capsule costs $50 abroad. 
  Skunk: A kind of super-marijuana grown in hot-houses in the 
Netherlands, with an effect 20 times stronger than that of 
marijuana. It was fashionable during the summer of 1993 in Rio 
de Janeiro. Price: 250,000 cruzeiros (10 grams). 
  Heroin: Derived from opium, when breathed or injected into 
the vein it creates a happy sensation; causing addiction with 
fewer than 10 doses, it leads to loss of consciousness, coma, 
and death. It is virtually nonexistent in the country. 
  Solvents: Shoemaker's glue, enamel, paint, and gasoline are 
sniffed. They produce euphoria, dizziness, nausea, and lowered 
blood pressure. Continuous use causes lesions on the medula 
ossea, lungs, kidneys, and liver.

  [Text] Federal Police [PF] agents discovered six kg of pure 
cocaine in a clothes washing machine shipped on a Varig flight 
that took off from Asuncion, Paraguay, heading for Rio. The 
washing machine was seized on Monday night, in the cargo storage 
facility of the international airport's blue section. The police 
are investigating the records of Juan Carlos Gutierrez, who 
shipped the drugs, and Antonia Gutierrez, who was supposed to 
receive them in Rio. 
  According to the Federal Police, the final destination of 
the 
cocaine was Nigeria. The policemen claimed that it was typical 
of the "Nigerian connection" to transport drugs concealed in 
household electrical appliances. Last year, the PF confiscated 
nearly 400 kg of cocaine in fans, air circulators, freezers, and 
compressors. This time, the traffickers had put six tablets of 
the narcotic (each containing one kg), attached to a layer of 
fiberglass, in the washing machine, which was of the Lavy Mak 
brand. 
  On the same day, the police agents captured two Nigerians 
who 
were attempting to board Varig flight 794 for Lagos, Nigeria, 
with 1.5 kg of cocaine. The traffickers had concealed the drugs 
under their clothing in two transparent plastic bags attached to 
their bodies with an elastic tape. They admitted that they were 
to receive $800 for carrying the cocaine to Nigeria.

<F P=106> [Article from the "Seven O'Clock Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff arrived in 
Santa Fe de Bogota and immediately the hornets' nest went wild. 
His strong statements against President Cesar Gaviria and other 
government officials forced the president to reply to the 
controversial judicial official's criticism. Gaviria spoke in 
terms stronger than the ones Colombians are used to hearing from 
him. [begin recording] 
  Reporter: What is happening with Prosecutor 
General Gustavo de Greiff? 
  Gaviria: In terms of our relationship, we have 
differences of a juridical nature, and we believe some of his 
decisions have been inappropriate. That is all. 
  Reporter: Mr. President, is your government 
servile? 
  Gaviria: Yes, the prosecutor's portrayal of the 
president was a bit offensive. I regret his use of such brazen 
language. I will not answer him in similar terms at any time. 
Colombia is starting to experience difficulties in the United 
States for statements that, as the prosecutor himself has noted, 
the president had warned him about. 
  Reporter: Skeptically, it has been said that you 
did not give the prosecutor your full support because you were 
safeguarding your election to the OAS post. 
  Gaviria: I believe the prosecutor has secretly 
managed to spread this rumor. I believe it is extremely unfair. 
Ours is a balanced, reasonable position. Our doubts are based 
on the law, or simply based on what is appropriate. We are not 
going to abandon our position simply because this type of 
argument is being raised. In this specific case, I believe we 
are doing great harm to the country by exploiting these 
sentiments instead of explaining our decisions. 
  Reporter: Has the prosecutor's statement upset you? 
  Gaviria: I believe it is in Colombia's best 
interests that we present a clear and consistent policy on drug 
trafficking to the international community. This would be good 
for the country. We want to incorporate the country into the 
world economy and into world markets. It is highly desirable 
that this country have a good image abroad. It is very 
desirable for Colombians that Colombia have a good image abroad. 
You can be sure that, despite all the ruckus and confrontation, 
the country's interests, in the long run, are rooted in this. 
[end recording] 
  Prosecutor Gustavo de Greiff stated in a communique issued 
today, that, during his stay in the United States he denied to 
the media that he had offered pardons to drug traffickers. 
Prosecutor General de Greiff also said judicial cooperation 
could not be accepted if it was conditioned on having to hold 
prior consultations on the decision to use certain evidence with 
a country that supplied such evidence--in this case, the United 
States. The prosecutor also urged U.S. authorities to stop 
their unjustified attacks on Colombian officials, especially 
him. He called on the U.S. Government to continue cooperating 
by exchanging evidence to further the struggle to end the 
worldwide scourge of drug trafficking.

<F P=106> [Report from the "Midday Television Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] The controversy between the government and 
Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff continues. Justice 
Minister Andres Gonzalez also rejected the prosecutor general's 
actions today. The government's discontent over statements by 
Gustavo de Greiff, who has accused several state officials of 
being subservient, continues. After President Cesar Gaviria's 
statement demanding respect from the prosecutor general, de 
Greiff seemed to have turned his back on the controversy today. 
Meanwhile, his position still generates controversy. 
  Begin Gonzalez recording: No Colombian is 
subservient. We are independent and honorable people, and the 
first to be so is our president. [end recording] 
  The issue of the study of drugs legalization, which the 
prosecutor general has defended on several occasions, is not 
viewed favorably by the government. The gap between the 
government and the prosecutor seems to widen. 
  Begin Gabriel de Vega, National Drug Directorate 
director, recording: Legalization would increase 
consumption due to the availability. It is definitely an option 
the Colombian Government is not considering. [end recording] 
  It has been learned that a meeting of rapprochement between 
the president and the prosecutor general, with government 
officials and judicial branch representatives present, might be 
held within the next few hours to iron out any differences.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 29 Apr (AFP) -- Gustavo de 
Greiff, Colombian prosecutor general, has stated in a letter 
sent to Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin the Colombian Government 
should protest to his U.S. counterpart for meddling in his 
justice decisions. 
  Thus, de Greiff has responded to a note by the U.S. 
Government protesting several of his actions, which are 
considered as too lenient regarding the drug-trafficking issue. 
  "I find as unacceptable, personally or officially, a 
government's attempts to influence in any way the sovereign 
decisions that should be made by Colombian judicial officials," 
the prosecutor general has stated in the letter to the Foreign 
Ministry. 
  The Colombian Government is studying the reply to the U.S. 
protest note, which, according to the Foreign Ministry, will 
take some time, given the legal complexity of the issue. 
  The Colombian prosecutor general has been the target of an 
avalanche of criticism this past month stemming from his 
statements that the best way to combat drug trafficking would be 
to legalize drugs. 
  Subsequently, he had contacted a U.S. judge who is 
processing 
Dandenys Munoz (a Medellin cartel member suspected of planting a 
bomb in 1989 in a commercial plane causing 107 victims) saying 
he has no evidence against Munoz. 
  U.S. authorities say de Greiff had requested on nine 
occasions to meet with another member of the cartel, Carlos 
Alzate, detained in a Santa Fe de Bogota jail, a request the 
prosecutor general has denied.

<F P=106> ["Text" of communique issued by the Colombian Embassy in </F>
Washington on 21 April] 
  [Text] In response to a deposition made today to the 
Subcommittee for Terrorism, Narcotics, and International 
Operations of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, Colombian 
Ambassador to the Washington Gabriel Silva Lujan expressed his 
deep concern that these hearings have undermined the war against 
drugs. Gabriel Taboada, a drug trafficker sentenced to 12 years 
in prison in the United States, testified that drug cartels in 
Colombia have "infiltrated all levels of the government, from 
the Presidency on down." Taboada said that only one of the 
candidates participating in the current electoral campaign is 
not corrupt. 
  Ambassador Silva said: "This convict's accusations are 
inadmissible and an insult to the families of thousands of brave 
Colombians who have lost their lives in this war against drugs. 
The mere use of this so-called witness, a man who has been in a 
U.S. prison for the past five years, is a clear shift from the 
Congress' process of surveillance and one that will hinder our 
capacity to understand the truth of the war against drugs. 
  "Apparently, the only first-hand knowledge this drug 
trafficker has dates back to the mid-eighties, and yet he is 
allowed to contest the integrity of a country that is recognized 
the world over as a leader in the struggle against drugs. 
Today, as on any other day, thousands of Colombian Government 
officials, judges, journalists, candidates, policemen, and 
soldiers are risking their lives. But this witness was 
encouraged to make false statements that question the integrity 
of our people and our political system," Ambassador Silva said. 
  "Colombia, the oldest democracy in Latin America, will 
neither remain indifferent nor allow these absurd accusations to 
go unanswered. Senator Kerry knew very well that these hearings 
were being held during our presidential campaign. During 
previous elections three presidential candidates were 
assassinated. One of them, Luis Carlos Galan, was assassinated 
by hired assassins of Pablo Escobar's Medellin Cartel, precisely 
because Galan had the courage to publicly confront 
narcoterrorism. Authorizing a groundless deposition such as 
this during a critical election is not only irresponsible 
interference in the Colombian electoral process; it will also 
serve to erode the strong cooperation between the United States 
and Colombia essential to dismantling the drug cartels." 
  "There is undoubtedly corruption in Colombia, just as there 
is in the United States. We are struggling against the most 
powerful and merciless criminal organization in history. The 
achievements of President Cesar Gaviria's government in the 
struggle against corruption have no parallel. The forces of 
order and the judicial system have been completely reorganized 
in an attempt to fight corruption. The investigations of 
officials charged with corruption have been firm and yielded 
good results." 
  "One asks how Senator Kerry would react if the Colombian 
Congress were to conduct hearings on the big scandal this week 
in Massachusetts, where the mayor of Middlesex County has been 
charged with doing favors for and giving special treatment to 
important Mafia personalities in the area? Can you imagine the 
indignation of the people of Massachusetts if this scandal led 
to charges that the state government, from the governor on down, 
is corrupt? [no closing quotation mark as published] 
  The ambassador added: "Senator Kerry can rest assured after 
these hearings because his so-called witness repeated some of 
the groundless accusations the senator made against Colombia in 
his recent article in THE WASHINGTON POST. This is a small 
personal victory compared to the huge damage that this mistaken 
use of surveillance will do to the real war being waged in my 
country." 
  "A week ago Senator Kerry told Colombian reporters: `I 
believe the Colombian people have fought with extraordinary 
courage. There is no doubt in my mind about President Gaviria's 
and his government's courage and efforts. Many people are 
fighting without respite.' If we are to believe the senator, 
how could he allow Colombia's image to be so wronged through 
this distorted process? [no closing quotation mark as published]

<F P=106> [Report from the "Seven O'Clock Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] The case of Dandenys Munoz Mosquera, a.k.a. La 
Quica, could take an abrupt turn in the United States. Only a 
few days before the trial against him begins in New York, 
Colombia obtained an important statement directly implicating La 
Quica in the case of the Avianca aircraft, contrary to what El 
Arete [Carlos Alzate Urquijo] had stated in a report that caused 
a scandal a few days ago. The Prosecutor General's office has 
the statement and is expected to turn it over to the United 
States within the next few hours. This is an exclusive report. 
  By a strange boomerang effect, the letter from Prosecutor de 
Greiff to the U.S. judge who is examining the participation of 
La Quica in the attack on the Avianca aircraft prompted a very 
credible informant to confess all he knew about the sinister 
attack. According to the confession, given to an appointed 
prosecutor, the informant, whose identity is being maintained in 
strict secrecy, confessed that the Avianca aircraft explosion 
was carried out directly by Dandenys Munoz a.k.a. La Quica, with 
the participation of other accomplices. In other words, La Quica 
was the one who staged the attack. 
  Even more surprising, the informant confirmed that La Quica 
had staged the attack as ordered by Carlos Mario Alzate Urquijo, 
a.k.a. El Arete, who was the one that stated before Prosecutor 
de Greiff that La Quica had nothing to do with the sinister 
incident. In other words, El Arete blatenly lied to Prosecutor 
de Greiff regarding La Quica. The informant, who contradicted 
the statement by El Arete, and who has puzzled the 
investigators, has a great deal of credibility with the judicial 
and security organizations, because he alerted the authorities 
about an attack on the U.S. Embassy and about other planned 
attacks, even against Prosecutor de Greiff.

  [Text] Medellin -- Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela and Jose 
Santacruz Londono, presumed "capos" of the Cali Cartel, have 
three court days to appear for questioning before the Office of 
the Regional Prosecutor of Antioquia. This action is connected 
with the investigation of the explosion of a car bomb in front 
of the Monaco Building, owned by the late Pablo Escobar Gaviria. 
  Through a citation order posted at 0800 yesterday, in the 
prosecutors' common secretariat, the Prosecutor's Office 
summoned Rodriguez and Santacruz to submit to questioning as 
presumed intellectual perpetrators of the car bomb. Its 
explosion occurred at dawn on 13 January 1988, in front of the 
building in which the "capo" was residing with his family. 
  The citation order was posted in Medellin, Cali, and 
Mariquita, and its terms will run from the time that the 
document is posted in the two latter cities. According to 
official spokesmen, if, within the next three days, the pair 
accused of this terrorist act fail to appear for questioning, 
implementing their submission to justice, the process will 
follow its normal course and court-appointed attorneys will be 
named. 
  Killed in the attack on the Monaco Building were Miguel 
Angel 
Espinoza and Javier de Jesus Tamayo Perez, guards of the 
property. After the explosion, the authorities discovered inside 
the building a valuable art collection containing such works as 
paintings by Botero, Dali, Grau, Obregon, and Dario Morales. It 
also included one of the seven copies of Rodin's "The Thinker" 
existing in the world, Chinese vases of the Ming Dynasty, and 
pre-Columbian works. 
  Moreover, they found in the Monaco Building's basement eight 
antique vehicles, a collection of motorcycles, and a completely 
armored Mercedes-Benz limousine. 
  The explosion destroyed three nearby houses and seriously 
damaged several adjacent buildings, causing losses in the 
millions. 
  Furthermore, yesterday the authorities extended the 
questioning in the Antioquia Regional Prosecutor's Office of 
Valentin de Jesus Taborda, one of Pablo Escobar's aides, 
arrested in Itagui, and Luis Eduardo Fernandez Bedoya, alias 
"Lucho," ringleader of the people's militias in Valle de Aburra.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota -- In a crackdown on the drug 
traffic, the Antinarcotics Police conducted a series of 
operations resulting in the seizure, in several of the country's 
cities, of a total of 1,754 chemical substances and elements 
used for processing cocaine and other hallucinogens. 
  The operation, called "Volatil Uno," was carried out in the 
Cundinamarca locality of Mosquera, and in the cities of 
Medellin, Barranquilla, Cali, Pereira, Bucaramanga, Ibague, and 
Cartagena. 
  The largest confiscation took place in the Atlantico 
capital, 
where over 1,014 tons of those products were seized. 
  It was reported from Bucaramanga that thousands of gallons 
of 
acids and hundreds of kg of other substances were confiscated 
from a factory apparently being operated illegally. In 
connection with it, however, the amounts of components stored 
were found not to coincide with those registered by the supplier 
firm. 
  Included among the components seized were butyl acetate, 
ethyl acetate, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, ammonia, 
butanol, both dense and light sodium carbonate, hexane, N.E.K. 
[expansion not given], methanol, toluene, and different types of 
solvents. 
  The police attached particular significance to the 
confiscation of these types of precursors, because their control 
is one of the fundamental points in the strategy devised by the 
national government to battle the drug trafficking Mafias.

  [Excerpt] While the controversy between U.S. authorities 
and the Office of the Prosecutor General over the battle being 
waged in the country against drug traffickers is still on-going, 
the Antinarcotics Police launched a heavy offensive that 
resulted in captures of individuals and drug seizures in Valle, 
Santander, Meta, Guaviare, Vichada, and Caqueta Departments. 
  Initially, in Valle Department, the police, cooperating with 
the Air Force, achieved the immobilization of a Turbo Commander 
twin-engine plane containing a shipment of 1,020 kg of cocaine 
base. Carefully camouflaged in 20 packages, each weighing 51 kg, 
it apparently was intended to be transferred to a Chevrolet 
truck. The official report notes that, about 2100, during the 
course of inspection and control operations at the Alfonso 
Bonilla Aragon International Airport, the authorities detected 
on the taxi platform of the aircraft, registration HK 3275, the 
1,020 kg of cocaine base and the truck with license plates 
CAG-660, to which the drugs were to be transferred. Three 
persons were captured. 
  According to preliminary investigations by the Antinarcotics 
Police, the white Turbo Commander twin-engine plane with red and 
gray trim belonged to Hector Fabio Gonzalez Martinez. However, 
the stake-body type Chevrolet truck with a tarp was owned by 
Fernando Isaza Uribe, a native of the municipality of Tulua. The 
Office of the Prosecutor General is probing the possible 
connection of these individuals with the shipment seized. 
  As for the identities of those captured, the official report 
stated that they were Julio Hernando Campo, a native of Cali; 
Isaac Munoz Londono, from the Valle capital; and Ovidio Giraldo 
Giraldo, from the municipality of Cartago. The items confiscated 
and the persons detained in the operation were left at the 
disposal of the Valle Regional Prosecutor's Office.

  Furthermore, as a supplement to the authorities' offensive 
against the drug traffickers, it was confirmed that, during 
various operations in the eastern part of the country, four 
small planes carrying approximately 900 kg of cocaine were 
intercepted. Six persons were captured and subsequently placed 
under the orders of the prosecutor's office. 
  Specifically, it was established that the immobilization of 
the airplanes took place in Meta, Guaviare, Vichada, and Caqueta 
Departments, and that the confiscated drugs apparently came from 
Peru, although the planes carried Bolivian registration. It was 
reported that the operations would continue, with backing from 
artillery-equipped helicopters. 
  Similarly, in Santander Department, more precisely, in 
Bucaramanga, the police arrested three individuals who were 
transporting 100 kg of cocaine, possibly to Venezuela. According 
to preliminary reports, the drugs were to be taken to Europe, 
using the Caracas International Airport as a bridge. The 
Santander Regional Prosecutor's Office is attempting to 
investigate further connections in this case. 
  Spokesmen for the Antinarcotics Police confirmed that they 
would pursue the operations throughout the country, especially 
in areas invaded by guerrilla groups. They claimed that it has 
become obvious that the drug traffickers in some regions are 
being aided by the subversives in their tasks of collecting, 
transporting, and distributing alkaloids. [passage omitted]

  [Text] San Jose, 26 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- Hundreds of kilograms 
of cocaine reach the United States every month in which Central 
America is used as a "bridge." Most of the drug is hidden in 
trailer trucks or in ships, as certain police operations in the 
last few years have shown. 
  Costa Rican Security Minister Luis Fishman told ACAN-EFE 
that, contrary to what everyone thinks, the maritime route is 
not the primary transportation means for the drug going from 
South America to North America, but rather the land route is. 
According to the minister, the drug generally reaches Panama 
from Colombia by sea. There it is loaded on to trailer trucks 
with different types of merchandise on its way north until it 
reaches the United States, the largest market in the world. 
  The strongest blows against drug trafficking activities, 
however, have been dealt when the drug is being transported on 
ships, in high speed boats, on its way to the United States. 
The most recent blow took place last week in a joint operation 
between Nicaragua and Costa Rica. 
  In this operation, the authorities arrested five Colombians 
and a Guatemalan citizen after being alerted by the DEA. The 
drug traffickers were caught by Nicaraguan authorities in Costa 
Rican waters. According to media reports, the group belongs to 
the Pereira Cartel in Colombia and will be returned to Costa 
Rica, where they will be prosecuted for drug trafficking. In a 
high speed boat, which left the Colombian port of Buenaventura, 
this group was carrying 650 kg of drugs, which would supposedly 
be unloaded somewhere in Guatemala from where it was to be 
transported to the United States by land, according to police 
sources. 
  In the last four years, more than 3,000 kg of cocaine have 
been confiscated in Costa Rica alone, according to official 
reports. Most of the drug was transported in ships on the 
Pacific Ocean and were detected by radars operated by the DEA in 
northern Costa Rica and Panama. Fishman noted his government's 
firm commitment to fight drug trafficking activities with all 
its resources, but said the police lack the means for more 
effective action. 
  In a report released earlier this month, the U.S. State 
Department praised the efforts made by the Central American 
Governments, with the exception of Costa Rica and Nicaragua, in 
their fight against drug trafficking and money laundering 
activities. 
  Nicaraguan Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta said in 
Costa 
Rica on Monday that this joint operation, which resulted in the 
arrest of six drug traffickers on Friday and the confiscation of 
the drug is a demonstration of his country's willingness to 
fight drug trafficking activities. "It has been proven that the 
fight against drug trafficking activities is not the 
responsibility of a country, but of the international community. 
The success of the operation conducted by Nicaragua and Costa 
Rica is proof of that," he pointed out. 
  According to the State Department, the scarce resources of 
the Costa Rican authorities and the lack of professionalism of 
the security services preclude greater progress in the fight 
against drug trafficking activities in Costa Rica. It pointed 
out that the port of Limon, the largest Costa Rican port, has 
become the primary drug trafficking point between the Colombian 
island of San Andres and the Nicaraguan Caribbean coast with the 
United States. 
  Fishman has repeatedly talked about the need for greater 
cooperation by the consumer nations for a more effective action 
against drug trafficking in Central America.

  [Text] We talked about the testimony of a former drug 
dealer who had been questioned by the U.S. Senate, and who had 
implicated members of Haiti's military in the drug trafficking, 
including the chief of Police. Following is a defense from 
Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Michel Francois to those accusations. 
We read: 
  On 28 October 1993, I publicly challenged Father Aristide or 
any of his supporters, foreign or national, to bring just one 
proof of the existence of any link between myself and illicit 
drug traffic. The allegations of drug dealer Gabriel Taboada, in 
prison for five years now and a witness in the service of U.S. 
agencies, reveal only two things: a blatant lack of imagination 
from the silent partners to this accususation which is, 
according to Beaumarchais, the last resort of cowards. Second 
point: the unbearable thoughtlessness with which the Haitian 
case is being treated in the United States. So far as I am 
concerned, the challenge remains complete. 
  This was a note from Lt. Col. Michel Francois in reaction to 
accusations of drug trafficking.

  [Text] A source close to the Haitian Army denies the 
accusations brought against the Haitian police chief, Lieutenant 
Colonel Joseph Michel Francois. According to the charges, the 
police chief has allegedly supported a lucrative drug trade 
between Colombia and the United States, through Haiti. Gabriel 
Taboada, a former Colombian drug trafficker, asserted before the 
[U.S. Senate] Drug Trafficking and Terrorism Subcommission that 
he met Michel Francois during a meeting with Pablo Escobar in 
(Colombia). Former Haitian President Prosper Avril also 
participated in that meeting. 
  The source, who wishes to remain anonymous, has pointed out 
that Col. Francois' last trip took place in 1981 before 
[corrects himself] after he was commissioned. He went to the 
United States for proficiency courses in security. Since then, 
he has never gone abroad. How can Taboada assert that he met 
Col. Francois in 1984, our source wonders. 
  Let us recall that upon the return of Col. Francois, he was 
appointed to the Corps of Heavy Vehicles [as heard] of the 
presidential guard at the National Palace.

  [Text] The spokesman for President Aristide, Jean-Claude 
Martineau, has reacted to the antidrug operation led by the 
Haitian military authorities. The initiative has come too late, 
according to the president's spokesman. Martineau has reaffirmed 
that the Haitian military authorities are involved in drug 
trafficking, up to the hilt. [begin recording, in Creole] 
  Martineau: A big drug dealer made a series of 
statements before the U.S. Senate, perhaps one week ago. He 
stated before a U.S. Senate committee that [Lieutenant Colonel] 
Michel Francois [Port-au-Prince police chief] is involved in 
drug trafficking, up to the hilt. Obviously, it was not 
necessary for anyone to come tell us about that to know it. 
Besides, this is something that President Aristide has been 
denouncing for some times. We have heard that there is an 
operation aimed at arresting drug dealers in Haiti. Why are they 
trying to arrest those involved in drug trafficking (only) after 
this accusation, when they knew about it previously? [end 
recording] 
  This was the spokesman for President Aristide, Jean-Claude 
Martineau.

  [Text] The Haitian Antidrug Brigade announced on 28 April 
that on 26 and 27 April it carried out an important search 
operation that resulted in the arrest of seven traffickers 
wanted by the police and the questioning of 27 other persons. 
The operation led by this brigade, with the help of tracker dogs 
trained in the United States and mixed units of the capital 
police, resulted in the recovery of arms and ammunition and the 
seizure of an unassessed amount of marijuana. Among those 
arrested are two Colombians holding false Dominican passports 
and one Dominican. The three will very soon be extradited to 
their countries of origin. 
  The Haitian antidrug services have pointed out that 
Colombian 
citizen Orlando De Jesus Arena Alvarez, 44, who was extradited 
to Bogota on 20 April after he had been arrested following a 
four-year stay in Haiti under a false Venezuelan identity, had 
been sought by the Colombian Justice Department as one of the 
leaders of the Medellin Cartel.

  [Text] A drug trafficking group that transports marijuana 
and cocaine from southern Mexico to cities bordering Texas has 
extended its Mafia execution arm to Nuevo Leon, where five 
people have been murdered. 
  Of the six apparent narcotrafficker murders in 1993, five 
occurred in municipalities located close to highways and places 
where Federal Judicial Police [PJF] had previously discovered 
shipments of tons of marijuana. 
  The bodies of the murdered men were found in the towns of 
China, General Bravo, Cadereyta, and Santiago. Another murder 
took place in Mina, and according to investigations by the State 
Judicial Police, the suspects in that crime are linked to the 
murders in China and Cadereyta. 
  The Monterrey-Reynosa Highway is toll-free, and the PGR 
[Attorney General's Office] has seized tons of marijuana there. 
It is also a place where drug traffickers have "settled 
accounts" several times. Drugs coming from Oaxaca and Michoacan 
States usually go to Reynosa, Matamoros, or Ciudad Mier. 
  The PJF got involved in drug trafficking activities in 1993 
when Commander Jorge Guzman Torres, aided by "godmothers" 
["madrinas"], kidnapped Lauro Gonzalez Garcia. Police 
identified the kidnapped man as a drug trafficker, and he paid 
federal agents 200,000 new pesos for his release. 
  The PGR has confiscated shipments of tons of marijuana on 
the 
highway between China and General Bravo and in country houses in 
Cadereyta and Ciudad Benito Juarez. 
  The PGR actions, which led to the confiscation of almost 5 
tons of marijuana, have taken place a few days before or after 
the body of a murdered man has been found. 
  Merchants Gaspar de Jesus Sandoval Rodriguez and Martin 
Garcia Rodriguez, alias El Guero Martin, were executed in 
January. The following month, the PGR seized 2.376 tons of 
marijuana in two actions. 
  On 9 February, just seven days after finding the body of 
Garcia Rodriguez, alias El Guero Martin, the PJF seized a ton of 
marijuana in a tractor-trailer operated by two people. The PJF 
also found 1.376 tons of marijuana in a house on the San Isidro 
de Cadereyta estate on 20 February. They also arrested two men 
who were loading the drugs into a Suburban. 
  On 28 February, Lauro Gonzalez Garcia, suspected of 
executing 
Sandoval Rodriguez, was kidnapped by PJF Commander Guzman Torres 
with the complicity of "godmother" Cuauhtemoc Labastida Salazar. 
The association between the PJF and the drug traffickers ended 
when Gonzalez Garcia paid 200,000 new pesos for his release. 
  Lawyer Octavio Leal Moncada and physician Javier Salinas 
Perez are said to be suspects in the death of Garcia Rodriguez, 
alias El Guero Martin, for alleged joint business transactions. 
However, Leal Moncada told a Prosecutor's Office investigator 
that Garcia Rodriguez was his friend, and the physician asserted 
that the murdered man owed him 700,000 new pesos. During a 
special operation, the PJF unsuccessfully attempted to arrest 
Labastida Salazar, who was accompanied by Leal Moncada at the 
time, in his house in Colonia Las Brisas. The "godmother" and 
the lawyer are currently fugitives. 
  Although the PGR arrested in January 1994 two alleged 
members 
of a drug trafficking band in General Bravo, they were 
investigated as members of a marijuana and gunrunning group in 
June 1993. 
  This month, Francisco Garcia Martinez, an employee of Angel 
Avila Neri, came to EL NORTE to personally report that the PGR 
is persecuting his boss and three other people. 
  The PGR established that Avila Neri was a ringleader whose 
accomplices included Jose Santos Rodriguez Cantu, alias La 
Pinina; brothers Martin and Jorge Arizpe Gonzalez; Jesus Antonio 
Gutierrez Gonzalez, alias El Zurdo; Juan Aguilar Gonzalez; and 
"Lalo" Solis. 
  On 9 August, Margarito Hernandez was murdered in Cadereyta, 
allegedly by Horacio Montelongo Salinas, during a discussion 
over drug debts. The alleged killer is the brother of Jose Luis 
Montelongo Salinas, a suspected drug trafficker who was later 
murdered in Matamoros, Tamaulipas. Jose Luis Montelongo was 
also a suspect in the murder of Gaspar de Jesus Sandoval 
Rodriguez. 
  Almost a month after Margarita Hernandez's murder, the PGR 
confiscated half a ton of marijuana that they found buried in a 
trench in a Colonia Monte Bello house in Ciudad Benito Juarez. 
  Two other important actions carried out between 6 and 9 
November resulted in the seizure of 2.565 tons of marijuana; the 
first in Ciudad Benito Juarez and the other on a train heading 
for Matamoros. 
  Five days later there were two murders; one in General Bravo 
and another in Santiago. 
  The PJF found 396 kg of marijuana in the cellar of a house 
in 
Colonia Lomas del Solo in Ciudad Benito Juarez on 6 November. 
The PJF went to the house because two women reported the 
presence of the drug when they were arrested with a shipment of 
168 kg of marijuana in their vehicle. 
  On 9 November, the PJF seized two tons of marijuana in a 
train boxcar. 
  Those confiscations presaged the murder of Abel Salazar 
Martinez, who was found in General Bravo on 14 November. He had 
disappeared from his home in Weslaco, Texas on 8 November. 
  Fifteen days later, the body of Jaime Enrique Lopez Castillo 
was found at the 13-km marker of Santiago-Juarez Highway near 
the La Boca Dam. Lopes Castillo had also been murdered. 
  The year 1993 ended with a "war" among alleged drug 
traffickers and a "settling of accounts" in General Bravo. 
  The homes of Jose Santos Rodriguez Cantu, alias La Pinina, 
and Martin Arizpe Gonzalez were strafed by AK-47 rifle fire. 
The Caballito de Mar Restaurant, owned by Angel Avila Neri, is 
also bullet riddled. 
  Fourteen days after the attacks in General Bravo, the PJF 
arrested two alleged members of the Avila Neri band that had 
been under investigation since June 1993. 
  Juan Jose Cantu Gonzalez and Raul Gutierrez Gonzalez were 
presented as members of the "Jabali guerrilla commando, which 
was planning terrorist actions in Nuevo Leon. 
  Later the PGR retracted and said they were only drug 
traffickers and gunrunners. 
  The Sixth District Judge ordered Gutierrez Gonzalez' release 
as he believed him innocent of storing weapons and cartridges 
and of illegally possessing and transporting marijuana with the 
intent to take it out of the country. 
<H5>  Houses searched </H5>
  The PGR continued its investigations in the state to 
discover 
the drug network headed by Matamoros Cartel chief Juan Garcia 
Abrego. 
  A special PJF group has searched several houses and country 
homes in Monterrey in the past months to find evidence against 
the partners of the so-called drug capo. 
  The state PGR delegation also wants to identify the safe 
houses and the marijuana and cocaine distribution centers. 
  So far, the searches have not resulted in the arrest of any 
of the alleged drug traffickers. Several people whose houses 
where searched assert that they have no ties with Garcia Abrego.

  [Text] The National Defense Secretariat [SEDENA] announced 
that the Mexican Army and Air Force, besides discharging their 
constitutional duties in the Chiapas conflict, are pursuing 
activities to combat the constant threat of the drug traffic. He 
indicated that this demands the expenditure of major human and 
material resources. 
  The department submitted a final report on the action taken 
by 9,700 troops in Regional Operation I-94 against the drug 
traffic during the past 25 days. It was conducted on the Pacific 
strip, where the areas with the greatest incidence of drug 
growing are situated. 
  The report notes that over 19,000 poppy and marijuana plant 
crops were destroyed, commenting: "It should be explained that 
the SEDENA is keeping a permanent campaign in effect against the 
drug traffic. Known as the `Canador [marijuana-poppies] Plan,' 
it includes all the operations being carried out by Army units 
activated by the military zonal and regional commanders, 
depending on the local problems. In other words, they are based 
on growing cycles and the available information, which determine 
the need for an operation at any given time. 
  "In addition, the Mexican Army and Air Force are conducting 
periodic special operations against the drug traffic, called 
`National Operations' and `Regional Operations.' 
  "As part of this, the regional operation now concluding was 
begun on 10 March, when the National Defense Secretariat 
deployed troops comprising a force of 1,700 men in Sonora, 
Chihuahua, Sinaloa, Durango, Nayarit, Jalisco, Michoacan, 
Guerrero, and Oaxaca. These states contain the areas with the 
highest incidence of drug trafficking in the Mexican Republic." 
  It adds that the participating forces were backed with 250 
vehicles, 17 helicopters, and seven small planes from the 
Mexican Air Force. 
  The document concludes by stating: "The Mexican Army and Air 
Force, besides performing their constitutional duties, including 
the deployment of troops garrisoned in the vicinity of the 
principal towns affected by the armed conflict in Altos de 
Chiapas, are still participating in activities aimed at 
combating the constant threat of the drug traffic. This demands 
the expenditure of major human and material resources on the 
part of this office."

  [Text] Federal Judicial Police agents, backed by search 
warrants issued by Nuevo Leon State's Sixth District Court of 
Criminal Proceedings, discovered a clandestine arms and 
explosives factory in the town of Villa de Juarez. There, they 
seized rifles, 2,000 useful cartridges, caps, exploders, a 
cartridge reloading machine, and explosive and detonating 
substances, among other items. 
  According to reports submitted to the Office of the 
Assistant 
Attorney for Local Offices and Inspection, headed by Alfonso 
Cabrera Morales, the authorities confiscated the following 
equipment on a ranch in the municipality of San Pedro Garza 
Garcia, also in Nuevo Leon: 200 useful cartridges of 9, 223, 76, 
and 380 mm caliber; eight loaders for an Uzi submachinegun, 
squad pistols, a 38 caliber special revolver, and a 380 mm 
caliber squad revolver; as well as nearly half a kg of marijuana. 
  The Attorney General's Office noted that, in the first case, 
four rifles, a squad pistol, two professional bows, and 
precision accessories for arming steel-tipped arrows, all 
apparently owned by persons associated with the drug traffic, 
were also placed at the disposal of the Federal Public 
Prosecutor's Office. 
  It reported that the arms and explosives factory was located 
on the ranch known as San Roque, in the municipality of Villa de 
Juarez, where the public poisoners presumably were hiding. Since 
arrest warrants had been issued for them, the ranch was searched 
on the basis of a court order from the aforementioned district 
court. No arrests were made. 
  As for the confiscation in San Pedro Garza Garcia, the 
investigative agents specified that the weapons were discovered 
at No. 122 Versalles Street, in the Colonia Del Valle. It is 
presumed that members of a group engaged in drug purchases and 
sales gather there. The traces of marijuana found inside the 
domicile prompted the assumption that its occupants intended to 
meet soon with other public poisoners to close a deal involving 
that drug. 
  It was learned that officials from the local branch of the 
Attorney General's Office in Nuevo Leon have requested 
information from U.S. authorities regarding the origin of the 
seized weapons and other items, as well as the cartridges. It is 
thought that their owners are connected with arms trafficking 
groups operating on the southern United States border, and are 
very likely trading that equipment for drugs. 
  It was stressed that the investigation is being continued, 
and that information is now available on the property owners. 
  Arrest warrants have already been issued for two of them, 
who 
are expected to be placed at the court's disposal within the 
next few days. Wanted for crimes against health, they are now 
charged with other crimes specified and penalized in the Federal 
Law on Firearms and Explosives, as well as the Criminal Code.

  [Text] Over 200 million new pesos' worth of cocaine base, 
packaged marijuana, methamphetamine, and heroin (the latter 
shipped to Mexico from Thailand) were incinerated yesterday in 
Baja California and Sonora States by authorities from the 
Attorney General's Office [PGR], the National Defense 
Secretariat, various State Human Rights Commissions, and the 
health sector. 
  Jose Antonio Ochoa Palacios, the PGR's representative in 
Baja 
California, reported the burning of the following drugs in the 
Fifth Infantry Battalion's facilities located in the town of 
Tijuana's settlement of El Aguaje de la Tuna: approximately 8.5 
tons of cannabis indica, 4,237 grams of Thai heroin, 15.5 kg of 
methamphetamine, and 38 kg and 585 grams of pure cocaine. The 
drugs presumably were intended to be smuggled into the United 
States for sale and consumption. 
  According to reports submitted to the PGR's assistant 
attorney for local offices and inspection, Alfonso Cabrera 
Morales, the drugs in question, with a market value totaling 
several tens of millions of new pesos, were seized by Federal 
Judicial Police [PJF] agents assigned to both Tijuana and 
Tecate. The PJF's deputy commissioner, Raul Loza Parra, 
remarked: "The drugs burned were confiscated within the past two 
months." 
  The event was attended by Ruben Dario Castillo Ferrara, the 
district garrison commander; Ricardo M. Legario Z., commander of 
the Fifth Infantry Battalion; Jorge Avelaez Palacio, director of 
the SSA [Secretariat of Health and Assistance] Health Center in 
Tijuana; and Eduardo Garcia Alcaynes, from the PGR's Internal 
Comptroller's Office, among others. Representative Ochoa 
Palacios underscored the resolute participation of all the 
state's social and institutional sectors in the battle against 
the drug traffic. 
  Carlos Jaime Pratt Straffon, the PGR's representative in 
Sonora, for his part, reported that approximately nine tons of 
compressed marijuana were destroyed at the Hermosillo Hunt Club 
and Firing Range facilities located at km 26 of the Bahia de 
Quino highway. These drugs also were presumably intended for 
shipment to the northern part of the country and, subsequently, 
to the United States. 
  Like Ochoa Palacios, Pratt Straffon addressed that state's 
attorney general, Wenceslao Cota Monteya, the State Human Rights 
Commission inspectors, Hector Contreras Perez and Jesus Arturo 
Pena; as well as the Foreign Relations Secretariat's regional 
representative, Alejandro [surname missing]. Straffon emphasized 
the valuable, determined participation of the civilian society 
and the military, state, and municipal authorities in the daily 
battle being waged against the grave, increasing drug 
trafficking problem, afflicting everyone alike. He added that 
the nearly nine tons of cannabis indica incinerated had been 
seized during the past 60 days by federal agents under orders 
from the force's assistant representative, Julio Cesar Moralla 
Amador.

  [Text] Managua, 26 Apr (AFP) -- Although political violence 
decreased after the war ended four years ago, Nicaragua has 
registered an increase in common crimes to the point that even 
policemen are assaulted by criminals, National Police Chief 
Fernando Caldera admitted today. "Violent crimes" are what 
worry the police most because although there has been a decrease 
in the political violence generated by the war, the crime rate 
is swelling, Caldera stressed to AFP. 
  According to the officer, the growing crime rate is a result 
of "political violence, economic crisis, and the culture of 
violence" so entrenched in this country, which was at war 
throughout the entire past decade. The war between the contras 
and Sandinists left more than 50,000 victims, including dead, 
injured, crippled, as well as material losses amounting to the 
millions across the entire country. 
  According to a study carried out by the National Police, the 
public order situation changed "substantially" in 1990, both in 
magnitude and type, to include takeover of lands and 
institutions and public demonstrations and protests over 
government policies. 
  In 1990, when Violeta de Chamorro assumed control of the 
government, replacing the Sandinists and ending the war, there 
were 28,005 crimes. That number increased to 30,896 in 1991, 
35,924 in 1992, and 42,394 in 1993. In 1990, the police 
dismantled 125 criminal bands. However, in 1991 they dismantled 
189; in 1992, 288; and in 1993, 363. In addition to the 
criminals in the cities, there are 500 armed men in the 
mountains who ravage the peasant population. In the first three 
months of 1994, the police have reported dismantling 98 bands; a 
rate 31 percent higher than last year. During those four years, 
authorities solved 3,320 crimes and arrested a total of 3,946 
criminals, many who are repeat offenders. 
  Furthermore, in 1990, among other reasons because controls 
were reduced, drug crimes increased a substantial 120 percent, 
according to the National Police. In 1991, authorities seized 
730 kg of cocaine, 155 kg in 1992, 97 kg in 1993, and up to now 
in 1994, 1,100 kg of the drug have been seized. 
  Murders have also increased since 1990 when 202 people were 
slain. In 1991, the number was 259; in 1992, 325; and in 1993, 
331.

  [Text] If Panama does not take a tough stand against drug 
traffickers operating along the Colombian border, in the future 
they will not only grow coca, but also poppy, Government 
Minister Jacobo Salas told LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA. 
  "Panama is not only a place where drug trafficking occurs, 
but also a place where coca plants are grown, and, in the 
future, if not given the proper attention, poppy fields will 
also be planted," Minister Salas said after reporting that in 
the Darien region 200 hectares of coca plants were destroyed 
with herbicides in the latest police operation in March. 
  The official added that every citizen must become aware of 
the necessity of taking financial steps to equip police with new 
helicopters to patrol Darien to detect coca plantations. 
  "The number of police units in Darien must be increased. At 
the same time, they must be adequately equipped to combat the 
drug traffickers who use the Darien jungle to grow and process 
the drug," Salas added. 
  The government and justice minister believes the 
Colombian-Panamanian Treaty that is being advanced by both 
countries not only will define the borders and outline special 
services for immigration, customs, and drug trafficking, but 
that it also will help keep Colombian rebels from using Darien 
as a base. 
  "I think the danger is alarming, and I hope that with the 
conclusion of this treaty, which should reach the Legislative 
Assembly soon, agreements will be formalized that will allow the 
two countries to join forces to prevent these crimes," Salas 
added. 
  He also asked the deputies of the National Assembly's Drug 
Commission to approve the anti-drug bill as soon as possible. 
  "This bill should be approved because there is not one 
family 
in Panama that is exempt from the possibility that one of its 
members, especially a son or daughter, could have a drug 
problem," Salas said.

  [Text] Paraguayan Central Bank [BCP] President Jacinto 
Estigarribia and members of the BCP board of directors have met 
with members of the Senate's Constitutional Affairs and Foreign 
Relations Committees to examine the text of the agreement on the 
laundering of drug trafficking money which was signed by our 
government and the U.S. Government. 
  The agreement reflects the BCP position establishing that 
the 
parties directly involved are the U.S. Treasury Department, the 
BCP, and the Paraguayan Finance Ministry. 
  The agreement also establishes that the BCP will be 
responsible for providing information whenever required on 
foreign exchange operations, either because there is suspicion 
something irregular has occurred or because the case is under 
investigation in both countries. 
  The president of the BCP said the bank is already 
implementing controls on foreign exchange operations. 
"Commercial banks and foreign exchange companies regularly 
provide information on all operations over $10,000 to the Banks 
Superintendency. The list includes the name of the person 
purchasing or selling those dollars, his address, and his 
identity card number. That information is currently available 
at the Banks Superintendency," Estigarribia explained. 
  The agreement says this is precisely the type of information 
the parties are committed to provide if there is a concrete 
request or if there are doubts on certain operations.

  [Text] Antidrug forces have concluded that the most 
powerful drug trafficking organizations operate at least 50 
illegal airstrips located in strategic spots in the nine 
Peruvian coca producing areas, which Interior Ministry analysts 
consider critical narcoterrorist areas. 
  Despite the arrest of Demetrio Limonier Chavez Penaherrera, 
aka "Vaticano," drug trafficking in the Maranon River basin has 
not only remained active, but has also expanded because of the 
few antidrug operations and little infrastructure in the region, 
particularly in the departments of Cajamarca and Amazonas, which 
produce coca and poppies. 
  In recent operations, however, antidrug agents have seized 
large shipments of basic cocaine paste. The largest seizures 
were made in Piura Department, while 53 people involved with 
drug trafficking have been arrested. 
  Twenty illegal airstrips were spotted in the Huarmey sandy 
zone; in the Quiches, Chingalpo, and Siguas (Ancash) tablelands; 
in Imaga, Santa Maria de Nieva, Bagua, Rodriguez de Mendoza, and 
Chachapoyas (Amazonas); and in the valleys of Balbas, Celendin, 
Encanada, Chilete, and Tembladera (Cajamarca). 
  Analysts have said that because of the geographical features 
of the region in which the airstrips are located in the 
Cajamarca zone, only expert pilots flying planes fitted with 
sophisticated equipment can successfully land in the Chilete, 
Tembladera, and Encanada ravines. 
<H5>  In Alto Mayo Valley </H5>
  During the last couple of weeks, antidrug forces have also 
discovered that basic cocaine paste trafficking feeds mainly on 
the drugs coming from Alto Mayo Valley and going to Chiclayo, 
Trujillo, Piura, and Tumbes, especially by land and through the 
highway joining Moyobamba and the capital of Lambayeque. 
  According to the sources, the drugs are taken from Moyobamba 
to Rioja and from here to Bagua, where they are rearranged for 
continuing on their course to Jaen, Olmos, and finally Chiclayo. 
This way drug traffickers make sure that their merchandise 
cannot be easily discovered. 
  The sources explained that part of the basic cocaine paste 
is 
sold in small amounts in Chiclayo and Trujillo, and the rest is 
refined in laboratories operating in those places. The drugs 
are then taken to Ecuador. 
  On the other hand, an antidrug brigade has over the past two 
weeks been searching the region of Celendin (Cajamarca) and Luya 
(Amazonas), following an increase in the number of flights of 
small planes, presumably of Colombian origin. There is evidence 
that the drugs that are being sent abroad are produced by the 
organization of Elias Chavez Penaherrera, aka "Cristo" -- one of 
"Vaticano's" brothers. 
  During the last operation in the zone, the police seized 
105.579 kg of basic cocaine paste. The larger seizures were 
made in Cajamarca and Lambayeque, where drug traffickers were 
found to be in possession of 20 automatic arms, three vehicles, 
and two houses where they were keeping 300 kg of coca leaves 
that were about to be processed. The traffickers also had other 
substances and plastic bags, which are used for their criminal 
activities. 
  Interior Ministry sources have said that drug trafficking in 
northern Peru continues to supply Ecuador, and that to this end 
it uses public passenger transportation vehicles and private 
vehicles as well.

  [Text] People got the impression that the mafias had 
reduced their activities in mid-February, after personnel from 
Dinandro [Antidrug Division], the FAP [Peruvian Air Force], and 
the DEA seized 3.5 tonnes of cocaine paste in Boca Manu (Madre 
de Dios). 
  However, recent intelligence reports state that drug 
trafficking organizations are using new drug gathering centers 
in border districts, and have managed to get many miners who had 
been working on the banks of the Tambopata River to swap gold 
prospecting for the drug trade. 
  During operations carried out over the past few weeks, it 
became clear that drug traffickers have established their drug 
trade centers in the border districts of Inapari (Tahuamanu) and 
Santa Maria de Fatima (Tambopata), located 15 km from the 
Chiringayoc checkpoint. Army and police agents arrested 27 
traffickers here, among them Peruvians, Colombians, and 
Brazilians, and seized 1,051 kg of basic cocaine paste and 150 
kg of washed cocaine paste ready to be shipped to Brazil, from 
where the drug would be shipped to Colombia and the United 
States. 
  The arrested traffickers confessed that after the operation 
at Boca Manu airport they had received orders from the bosses in 
the Colombian firms to move to the town of Diamante, and were 
using the landing strip located near the old "Lagarto" naval 
base to ship the drugs abroad. Interior Ministry experts 
explained that the drug cartels, in their attempt to disperse 
and dodge the Army, Dinandro, and DEA operations, have decided 
to vary the centers to gather and ship drugs abroad and to seek 
new ones, thus dodging the authorities' surveillance and turning 
Madre de Dios into a key point for trafficking in cocaine paste 
and cocaine hydrochloride. 
  Moreover, drug enforcement forces continue to confiscate 
coca 
leaves in Cusco and Puno Departments. Traffickers have been 
transporting coca leaves in small quantities by train, truck, 
and bus from the growing centers in La Convencion, Amgaraes, 
Lares, Quispicanchis, and Inambari to the higher Puno provinces 
(Carabaya, Juliaca, and Sandia) where there are clandestine 
laboratories for manufacturing cocaine paste and cocaine. 
  Part of these drugs are smuggled out of the country through 
the Bolivian and Brazilian borders, while the rest is sent to 
Arequipa, Moquegua, and Tacna for domestic consumption and to be 
sold in Chile and Argentina. The cocaine hydrochloride is 
transported by "mules" travelling in public transportation 
facilities disguised as tourists going to Arica. 
  Some days ago Cusco and Puno drug enforcement forces seized 
one tonne of coca leaves being transported in regional buses, 
concealed under staple foods. 
  A similar quantity (900 kg) of cocaine paste, manufactured 
in 
inaccessible areas in Juliaca according to Interior Ministry 
sources, was seized in Arequipa and Tacna. 
  Intelligence agents agree that Arica has become one of the 
most important centers of the region for the "laundering" of 
narcodollars. There is proof that "mules" are paid to transport 
the drugs to Chile with modern vehicles, pickups, and other 
types of vehicles. 
  The organizations involved in illegal drug trafficking thus 
attract those who wish to become the owners of modern 
transportation means overnight, which they then give to third 
parties to run, as it is a fact that whoever engages in drug 
trafficking ends up dead.

  [Text] Despite the progress made thus far this year 
compared to 1993, the amount of precursors confiscated during 
the first four months of 1994 accounts for only 3.5 percent of 
the total amount used by drug traffickers to process cocaine 
paste and cocaine. 
  Drug enforcement personnel have already confiscated 37,646 
kg 
of chemical precursors from several trafficking organizations in 
just four months this year. By contrast, Interior Ministry 
figures show that during 1993, only 74,200 kg of chemicals -- 
including sulfuric acid, acetone, hydrochloric acid, sodium 
carbonate, potassium permanganate, and ether -- were confiscated. 
  Drug analysts and DEA experts noted that 13 clandestine 
airfields have been destroyed in the Upper Huallaga region, as 
well as a 2,000-meter strip in Quempiri (near Satipo) and 
another near Tarapoto. 
  They have also destroyed 10 pits and 11 maceration labs that 
were equipped with microwave ovens and other sophisticated 
equipment. 
  Intelligence agents have concluded that the geographical 
location of the Apurimac-Ene basin is the reason why it has 
become in recent months the main route for chemicals for the 
Peruvian-Colombian mafia organization laboratories. 
  Drug enforcement forces have noted, however, that no major 
seizures have been made yet owing to the complicity of the local 
residents and coca growers, who in some cases have been forced 
by former Shining Path members -- who now work for the drug 
mafia -- to remain silent to protect the traffickers. 
  The analysts believe the traffickers have conscripted 
residents and peasants in the jungle of Satipo, Oxapampa, Ciudad 
Constitucion, Puerto Bermudez, Icozaxin, Huanta, La Mar, San 
Francisco, Palmapampa, Santa Rosa, La Convencion, and Palestina 
in the illegal drug trade. 
  A few weeks ago, police confiscated chemical supplies in the 
townships of San Pedro (Villa Rica-Oxapampa) and Palestina, 
where a CB-1420 aircraft crashed and its passengers managed to 
escape with the help of local residents. 
  The chemicals are also being transported in small boats 
along 
the Pichis, Palcazu, Ene, Perene, and Apurimac rivers. 
  The township of Palmapampa (La Mar-Ayacucho), which is on 
the 
Apurimac River, continues to be the transaction center for the 
"firms," which are guarded by mercenaries armed with modern 
weapons. 
  The commander of drug enforcement operations is reinforcing 
his personnel with specialized personnel in the region, where 
until recently there were just 12 policemen and a small Air 
Force base, which tried to detect the small planes used by 
traffickers. 
  Some of those "firms" have moved their operations toward the 
Tambopata basin where, protected by the intricate wilderness, 
they set up laboratories to produce the drugs that are sent to 
Brazil.

<F P=106> ["Newsletter" by Wu Guoqing (0702 0948 3237): "Ningxia Curbs </F>
Drug Trafficking"] 
  [Text] Yinchuan, 8 Apr (XINHUA) -- International drug 
trafficking rings have gone all out in recent years in an 
attempt to open up a so-called "China passageway." Drug 
traffickers who ply their trade from their provinces emerged 
even in remote, outlying places in the north. These drug 
trafficking activities were quickly held back. 
<H5>  Beacon-Fire Rose in the North </H5>
  In the late 1980's, some self-employed traders from Ningxia 
region who transported goods to Yunnan and Guangzhou or dealt in 
native and special products there became addicted to drugs. 
Lured by the promises of gain from international drug 
trafficking rings, they gradually joined the business of drug 
trafficking. With money raised in Ningxia, they went to Yunnan 
to buy narcotics from the "Golden Triangle" and took them to 
Guangzhou for sale, playing the role of "mazai" [ma zai 7456 
0098 -- drug runner] for the international drug trafficking 
rings. Thanks to the extraordinary profits of drug trafficking, 
some of these lawbreakers became very rich overnight. More and 
more people from Tongxin County and neighboring mountainous 
areas in southern Ningxia joined the drug trade. 
  For many, trading in drugs outside Ningxia became a 
"shortcut" to wealth. They either provided capital, services, 
or both, and sometimes hired help to traffic in narcotics. 
People with no money joined in the action with borrowed capital 
or worked as a "mazai" for others. Also emerged were big-time 
drug kingpins like Ma Shixin, Zhou Yanji, and Hai Zongru whose 
drug-trafficking activities even had some nationwide impact. 
  They had well-organized, clandestine drug-trafficking 
set-ups 
to handle everything from purchasing, transportation, to 
marketing, and they organized frequent transregional drug 
trafficking. 
  These outbound drug traffickers also brought narcotics back 
to Ningxia, resulting in drug taking in many parts of Ningxia. 
  All circles of society -- including the broad mass of Hui 
and 
Han nationalities -- called for cracking down on outbound drug 
trafficking and strictly enforcing the ban on narcotics to make 
the north clean again. 
<H5>  The Capture of Drug Kingpins </H5>
  As the saying goes: To catch bandits, first catch the 
ringleader. Ningxia's public security departments launched an 
aggressive crackdown to hold in check the evil trend of outbound 
drug trafficking. Their first targets were the ringleaders. 
  Target No. 1 was drug kingpin Zhou Yanji. A native of 
Weizhou Town in Tongxin County, he goes by the nickname of "Zhou 
Da," as he is the first child of the family. Weizhou is the 
birth place of outbound drug trafficking. For a time, Zhou was 
the ringleader of outbound drug trafficking in Ningxia and the 
northwest. Daring and cunning, the 30-year-old Zhou Yanji 
established a drug trafficking ring with over 100 people that 
carried out its dirty trade over half of China. He was wanted 
by public security organs in Yunnan, Guangdong, Sichuan, and 
Ningxia, and the Ministry of Public Security. Many times he was 
able to successfully escape the net that was cast to catch him. 
During one narcotics transaction in Yunnan, drug-enforcement 
policemen suddenly forced open the door and Zhou jumped out of 
the window and ran away injured, leaving behind 15.9 kg of 
heroin and 450,000 yuan in cash. 
  The cloven hoof eventually gave the devil away. In early 
December 1991, Ningxia's public security departments got 
information that Zhou had sneaked back and was hiding out in his 
home town with his armed bodyguards. After careful 
investigation and planning, the Ningxia Autonomous Regional 
Public Security Department issued an order to the Yinnan 
Prefectural Public Security Department for the drug kingpin's 
arrest. 
  In the early hours of 14 December, a special motorcade with 
scores of public security and armed policemen in full battle 
array quietly left Wuzhong City and headed directly for Weizhou 
Town in Tongxin County. Policemen assigned to the assault, road 
checks, or encircling the site quickly took their positions and 
began to quietly close in on their target. 
  After taking their combat positions, the assault squad, at 
the sound of the command, sprang toward the target and forced 
open the door. They didn't find Zhou in his house or at three 
of his hideouts. As the assault squad was about to enlarge the 
scope of search, a window of Zhou's neighbor's house suddenly 
opened and a dark shadow jumped out. Policemen who were lying 
in ambush close by quickly released a police dog to chase him. 
With a guileful dodge, the dark shadow tricked the police dog 
to fall into a deep pit nearby. As he started to run, two 
policemen jumped out and sprang on the dark shadow and subdued 
him in no time at all. At this time, search lights from all 
directions converged on the dark shadow to reveal what it was: 
What they saw is the sorry sight of the big-time drug kingpin 
Zhou Yanji, barefoot and wearing only a vest and pants, 
shivering in the cold winds. Zhou's bodyguards were also 
captured in the operation. According to Zhou's confessions, he 
took part in the transaction of as much as 200 kg of heroin. 
  The second target was Ma Shixin, known as "the top drug 
kingpin in Ningxia." He was a big-time ringleader from Ningxia 
who was engaged in the drug trade the longest -- hiding out 
mostly in Yunnan -- and had a big "herd" of followers and 
hangers-on. Confident that Yunnan's public security organs did 
not have anything on him because his activities were so well 
concealed and that he was also beyond the reach of Ningxia's 
public security organs, he married again in Dali, Yunnan, and 
was seen blatently swaggering through the streets of Dali city 
from time to time. On 2 April, as he was again swaggering 
leisurely in the streets of Dali, several police officers from 
Ningxia suddenly emerged in front of his face. Before he knew 
what happened, shiny handcuffs were already on his wrists. It 
turned out that the police officers were part of an antidrug 
brigade set up by Ningxia's public security department who had 
travelled thousands of kilometers to Yunnan to arrest Ma and 
bring him to justice. 
  Hai Zongru and many other drug ringleaders were also 
captured 
one after another, thereby frightening Ningxia drug dealers and 
restraining their criminals activities. 
<H5>  Block the Sources of Narcotics and Deal With Both the </H5>
Symptoms and the Root Cause of Drug Trafficking 
  In mid-August 1992, the State Antinarcotics Office and the 
Ministry of Public Security, summoned Ningxia's relevant 
personnel to Beijing for an exclusive briefing on antinarcotics 
efforts and to work out plans for a special crackdown on 
Ningxia's drug dealers operating out of the region. 
  Pursuant to the policy of "blocking the sources of 
narcotics, 
enforcing the ban of growing, taking, and selling of narcotics, 
and dealing with both the symptoms and the root cause," the 
regional CPC committee and government have spread a mammoth 
dragnet to enforce the drug ban all over the land of the north. 
  In late October, task forces made up of dozens of Ningxia 
public security police left for Yunnan, Sichuan, and Guangdong 
to capture drug dealers and take into custody drug suspects. 
With help from public security departments in the three 
provinces, in two months the expedition forces cracked six 
exceptionally large cases involving Ningxia dealers, arrested 59 
Ningxia drug dealers, confiscated over 40 kg of heroin, and sent 
back to Ningxia a large number of drug suspects. 
  Meanwhile, in cooperation with public security units, 
government at all levels in Ningxia also cracked down on the 
offensive launched by drug traffickers operating outside the 
region. They sent work teams to counties and villages with 
serious drug problems to publicize the drug ban, and to educate 
and mobilize the masses to combat drug trafficking. 
  According to the regional antinacortics office, Ningxia has 
made great headway in its war on drug trafficking. As of the 
end of 1993, the region had smashed 55 drug rings, arrested 776 
drug criminals, and confiscated a large amount of narcotics, and 
destroyed a number of underground opium dens. Under the impact 
of the severe crackdown of public security departments and the 
influence of the party's lenient policy, many drug dealers 
returned home to surrender themselves. Ningxia's outbound drug 
trafficking has been restrained somewhat.

  [Text] Mae Hong Son -- A major battle between the Muang Tai 
Army [MTA] and Burmese forces is looming on the Thai-Burmese 
border. Khun Sa sent more troops to reinforce MTA fighters 
confronting Burmese soldiers on the banks of the Salween River 
earlier this week. 
  The Burmese army has mobilised troops near the area occupied 
by Khun Sa since last month. The opium warlord said the battle 
was expected in the second week of May. 
  "The confrontation is at Ban Namchang, Namtu, Hsenwi, 
Namhkam, Mong Tang and Mong Gne which are located on the eastern 
side of the Salween," he said after a blessing ceremony for the 
reinforcements. 
  About 3,200 fighters from the army's 12 infantries attended 
the ceremony which lasted three hours on Tuesday. 
  He said they were the well-trained. 
  "The Shan State has been encircled by the Burmese forces for 
four months. There was occasional fighting with 300 soldiers 
killed and a large number of injuries on both sides and we have 
to send more troops." 
  Khun Sa acknowledged that he had a 20,000 strong army. 
  "The MTA has no other choice but to fight till the end. If 
we don't defend ourselves, the Burmese forces will intrude on 
our territory. We have to push them back." 
  An American dressed in a military uniform was seen during 
the 
ceremony. Peter Bond, as identified by Khun Sa, was a former 
consultant of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) who 
retired from the service. 
  "At one time, he treated me as drug kingpin. Now he just 
comes and has some meals with me," Khun Sa said. He refused to 
elaborate. 
  [One of four photographs accompanying article shows a 
Western 
man in military uniform. Caption reads: "An American 
identified as Peter Bond, in MTA uniform, is present at the 
ceremony to see off MTA soldiers. Drug warlord Khun Sa said 
Bond, 60, was formerly an adviser on narcotics affairs to the 
U.S. Government under President Jimmy Carter."]

  [Excerpt] A KRUNGTHEP THURAKIT correspondent filed a 
report on his recent visit to Shan State, the territory under 
control of Khun Sa, a world-renowned heroin producer. He said 
he could hear the sounds of gunfire from the fighting between 
the Burmese and ethnic minority forces along the Thai-Burmese 
border in Mae Hong Son Province. He also reported that many 
young men aged between 10 and 15 are receiving military 
training. Boys are drafted into the Shan Army when they reach 
15 years of age. 
  From Saengchai Saengchu, the Khan Sa group's assistant 
coordinator for civilian affairs, he learned that in early 1994 
the Burmese Government spent $1 billion to buy 14 Mirage 
aircraft from China. The Chinese Mirage is a copy of the 
Russian version. 
  Saengchai said: "We have information that the Burmese 
Government paid 40 percent of the cost of the Mirage in cash. 
The aircraft will be used to suppress antigovernment minority 
groups. The Burmese Government obtained money from signing away 
fishing, gem mining, and logging concessions. The remaining 60 
percent could be paid to China by allowing it to build a highway 
from Mandalay to Rangoon and a large seaport to give China a new 
access to the sea." 
  Saengchai said his information is that not all the planes 
will be used against Khun Sa forces. Most of them will be 
targetted against the Karen rebel group who controls the area 
opposite Thailand's Mae Sariang District and Tak Province. Two 
of the planes have already been shot down by Karen rebels. 
  Shan State leader Khun Sa, however, said he was not 
frightened by Burmese Government's purchase of Chinese planes to 
suppress rebellious minority groups. His forces have 
antiaircraft guns and SAM-7 rockets to deal with these planes. 
His men have also been instructed to build protective shelters. 
  Khun Sa said: "We have hired foreign technicians. We are now 
able to produce RPG's. Although their quality is not that good, 
they will be able to shoot down Burmese planes because the 
planes are an older model and have low capabilities. They also 
have a short flying period because of their small fuel tanks." 
Moreover, Khun Sa said he now has 47,000 soldiers after the 
training of the 27th batch in early 1994. Another batch of 
4,000 have already started the 28th training cycle. Another 
7,000 is expected to be trained in the 29th cycle and another 
8,000 in the 30th cycle. He expects that by the end of this 
year his forces will grow by another 20,000 men. This size will 
be sufficient to fight the Burmese Government soldiers. [passage

  [Text] Homong, Burma -- Opium warlord Khun Sa said over the 
weekend he hoped to be able to declare the Shan State's 
independence from Burma in three years, and called for European 
support for his movement. 
  His associate, Chao Saengdeun Saengkham, also expressed hope 
that the group and its supporting Mong Tai Arny (MTA) would be 
able to extend its authority over a larger portion of Burma's 
northeastern Shan State within one to two years. He said they 
hope by then to be able to declare a govemment with the 
participation of seven other ethnic groups -- Akha, Lahu, 
Palaung, Pa-O, Tai, Tashin, and Wa. 
  Khun Sa was being interviewed by THE NATION at his 
headquarters in Homong. At the time he was seeing off about 
3,000 newly trained troops who were leaving for the frontlines 
to counter advancing Burmese forces approaching from the westem 
side of the Salween River. A few days earlier the MTA had 
dispatched other fighters to join about 2,000 MTA forces already 
operating on the other side of the river. An aide said the 
fresh troops would be sent to the Sino- Burmese border to 
encircle Burmese forces.

<F P=106> [Report by Chong Hui-sang] </F>
  [Text] The Sisa Journal news team's infiltration 
and coverage of the scene of Southeast Asian drug production and 
supply began at the Mekong River, where Thailand, Burma and Laos 
meet. If from the mountainous city of Chiang Mai in northern 
Thailand one travels to the northeast about four hours by car, 
one comes to a small border city called Chiang Saeri. Getting on 
a boat at the river ferry crossing of this city located on the 
banks of the Mekong River, the news team asked the Thai ferryman 
to go in the direction of the Golden Triangle. Rushing down over 
2,000 km from the Tibetan Plateau, the Mekong River's current, 
with its majestic, muddy-yellow waves lapping against the boat 
as if to swallow it, divides the jungles of Laos from the lofty 
mountains of Thailand and Burma. Having traveled about 30 
minutes, the boat dropped off the news team in the Golden 
Triangle, the place's original name. As the name implies, it is 
the drug production center of Southeast Asia and the point were 
Thailand, Laos and Burma meet. 
  The Golden Triangle is said to produce 70 percent of the 
entire world's heroin supply. Going to the actual site, however, 
the team could find no trace of drugs. The people said to come 
from all nations of the world with their eyes on the gold mine 
of drug distribution were nowhere to be seen and there were no 
opium fields. Instead, there were two blocks of large-scale, 
gambling casino buildings, the construction of which was about 
70 percent complete. The work of building two large sight-seeing 
ships, which following the Mekong River would navigate all the 
way to China proper, was at its height. 
  Bunsit (44), a native of Burma who claims to have been born 
and to have lived his whole life in the Golden Triangle, 
explains it this way. "Up through the 1970's, big ships would 
anchor right at this place, and a worldwide drug market was held 
inside. Opium fields were spread out endlessly in the jungle you 
see before you, and in the foothills of the mountains behind. 
But now the places for doing business and the fields have all 
been moved to secret locations in the Thai-Burmese border region 
and inside Laos." 
  To infiltrate into the relocated Golden Triangle, the news 
team turned their steps toward Mae Sai, a city on Thailand's 
northernmost border. The closer they drew to the Burma, the more 
serious and strict were the Thai military checkpoints. Because 
the militaries of the Burmese government and Southeast Asian 
drug lord Khun Sa had been waging war in the vicinity of the 
Thai-Burmese border beginning a month before, the Thai side was 
suddenly controlling travelers' access to the border. 
  Departing from Mae Sai on 13 January, the news team arrived 
at a Burmese border checkpoint and, giving an official 500 baht 
[Bt] in Thai money, obtained permission to enter Burma without a 
visa. 
  Passing the Burmese border city of Tachilek and driving tens 
of kilometers in the direction of Keng Tung, here the news team 
entered the small village of an ethnic minority ruled by Khun 
Sa. This was to meet with an intelligence official belonging to 
the Khun Sa military, Mong Tai Army (MTA) [Chinese name, Chang 
Chi-fu], with whom they had secretly been connected since 
Thailand's Chiang Mai. This village is situated behind the Shan 
Plateau, an MTA stronghold. Beginning last 10 December, the 
Burmese Government's crack 88th division surrounded the Shan 
Plateau, fighting against Khun Sa's declaration of an 
independent Shan state. Thus, it was the very front line, 
covered by the clouds of war. 
  This intelligence official, introducing himself as Sai Chan 
(48), has for the last 25 years been active as a soldier in the 
Khun Sa organization, a drug-trade agent, and an intelligence 
agent of the MTA. In an approximately two-hour interview, he 
revealed the state of drug production and supply within the 
Golden Triangle, and even disclosed the existence of a few 
Koreans within the Khun Sa organization. 
  Having already come this far, their plan had been to go deep 
into Burma to officially cover Khun Sa's camp. They had to 
change this after meeting with the Khun Sa intelligence agent. 
This was because three Burmese divisions were mounting a 
full-scale attack on key points of Khun Sa's camp and Khun Sa's 
side too, fully mobilizing 40,000 troops, were putting up a 
desperate resistance. The news team ultimately decided to 
secretly go as far as the Salween River basin, 1 thousand km to 
the west, following the Thai-Burmese border, as a method of 
approaching the scene of opium production and supply. 
  When they had crossed back over the border and returned to 
Mae Sai, they discovered that this small town with a population 
of just over 15,000 had an unusually large number of banks. 
Counting the banks lined up along a big road, there were no less 
than 12. The news team's guide, who had experience in smuggling 
jewels, bear gall bladders, etc., in the border zone, explains 
that these banks are the distribution channels of drug-trade 
money. "Any significant commercial power in Thailand and Burma 
is controlled by the Chinese. As for the drug-trade money going 
into the Khun Sa region, banks support it with a secret currency 
called Baeng Durong. The Thai Government is also having problems 
because of this currency. Because of the tremendous assets of 
the Khun Sa camp, it is impossible for them to eradicate it. 
Even apart from the Baeng Durong, drug money is accepted by 
Chinese herbal and jeweler's chain stores spread throughout the 
world." According to him, the herb and jeweler's stores operated 
by Chinese are trusted by the drug organization much more than 
banks. When heroin arrives safely in Singapore, Hong Kong, New 
York, etc., payment is settled using these stores. When the 
payment is made to a jeweler, an encrypted receipt and resident 
registration (passport) number is immediately sent by facsimile 
to a jeweler in the recipient's area. Thus, the money is easily 
moved. In this situation, no matter how large the amount of drug 
money, in only a few minutes it is moved from all regions of the 
world into the Khun Sa region, according to the guide. 
  Renting a jeep and departing Mae Sai, the news team headed 
toward the border city Mae Sa Rong, know as one of the first 
"gateways" within Thailand by which heroin refined in the Khun 
Sa region goes out to the world market. An unpaved road along a 
ridge was the border line dividing Burma and Thailand. Above the 
Shan Plateau stretching endlessly before them was fighter in 
low-altitude flight, adding to the tension. 
  Located deep in the mountains, Mae Salong is the area to 
which some Kuomintang officials and military (93d and 96th 
Divisions) fled and settled after their defeat by the Chinese 
Communist Party in 1949. They cleared land between the villages 
of native mountain people's, the Akha and Lisu, forming Chinese 
villages. 
  One Chinese man, selling snake liquor in front of a house 
located in the center of the village and displaying a portrait 
and relics of the Kuomintang 93d Division commander who fled 
here, boasted of the fact that they were wealthy. "We are always 
ahead of other peoples because we as a people are good at 
business and stick together wherever we are. When a person born 
here reaches the age of 15, the Taiwanese Government sends 
someone to take that person back and give them a job. Our two 
children also are now working in Taiwan." This was to say that 
the Taiwanese government takes the descendants of the 93d and 
96th Divisions living in the Khun Sa region and uses them for an 
industrial work force. According to him, the place where drugs 
were handed over to middlemen was the 1,500-m-high Doi Mae 
Salong (Mae Salong Mountain) behind the village. There, Khun Sa 
soldiers are stationed to protect the drug trade. Recently, 
being in the middle of a war, outside traders do not want to 
come this far, so the drug economy is in a slump, he says. 
  On 14 January, the news team arrived at a Shan village close 
to the border north of Fang. The mood of the Shan village was 
extremely threatening toward the news team. About one month 
before, a nearby heroin-refining factory operated by Khun Sa was 
bombed in a large-scale attack by the Burmese military. With the 
beginning of the all-out war, all men in the village 18 years 
and older entered the MTA and left for the front lines on the 
Salween River. To these people, all strangers were the objects 
of suspicion and all necessary preparations had been made to 
kill if needed. When the news team arrived at the home of 
village chief Sairakun (46), the villagers, with suspicion in 
their eyes, crowded into the courtyard of the chief's house. 
Here and there could be seen people holding guns. It was only 
when the chief heard the explanation of the news team's guide, 
with whom he was familiar, that he softened the suspicions of 
the villagers and put there minds at ease. 
  Introduced as photojournalists, the news team listened late 
into the night to the chief's explanation of the situation they 
faced and their posture toward the war. 
  They had no choice but to cultivate opium in order to 
survive, he explained. Made up of over 140 households and over 
500 persons, the villagers cultivate about 30 lai (one lai is 
about 485 pyong [30 lai equals about 57,530.7 sq. yards]) per 
household. However, with that they are only able to make about 
B1 thousand per year in Thai money. There is no way they can 
live off of this, he says. If they cultivate opium, 1 lai of 
well-planted land can produce about 3 kg of poppy latex. Since 
Khun Sa's representatives calculate 1 kg at about B5 thousand, 
they say that opium is their life and Khun Sa, their benefactor. 
  The chief refused the news team's request to photograph the 
village's opium fields. When the team offered $300 (about 
Bt7,500), he consented on the condition they go with armed men 
from the village. Just in case, the news team demanded that they 
be accompanied by five young Shan women, including the chief's 
daughter. He accepted this. After staying the night at the 
chief's house, they headed for the opium fields the next morning. 
  Four Shan residents armed with pistols and rifles escorted 
the news team and the women. Crossing the 2,000-meter-high 
border mountains, the party was able to reach the opium fields 
only after five hours had passed since its departure. Passing 
through jungle three times, forests of scrub brush twice, and a 
swamp once, the opium field stretching before the eyes of the 
news team was about 7,500 pyong [about 29,655 sq. yards] and 
situated in an area of flat hills. As it was the harvest 
seasons, three villagers had arrived three days before, had put 
up a mud hut beside the field, and were collecting latex among 
the fully-bloomed poppy flowers. They said the soil of a place 
where opium has been planted for three years goes bad and cannot 
be planted again, so they have to clear a new location every 
year. 
  Arriving at the village at about 2000, 12 hours after 
completing their coverage of the opium field and setting out on 
the return trip, the news team refused the kindness of the 
chief, who said they should stay there another night, an 
hurriedly slipped out of the village. This was because they 
witnessed a Khun Sa opium-collection agent come to the village, 
gather the villagers together, and press them hard for answers 
on the appearance of suspicious "foreigners." 
  Coming out that night as far as the Thai border city, Fang, 
the news team met another Chinese drug middleman there. They 
were able to learn from him how refined heroin was being 
distributed recently. Saying that he absolutely would not reveal 
his name, he introduced the main heroin-transportation method 
being used in Thailand also. "Heroin refined by Khun Sa 
generally slips across the Thai-Burmese border in cars to be 
transported overseas through Thailand. Korean-made cars, which 
have been growing in popularity in Thailand of late, have the 
advantage of being less suspect than Japanese-made cars. They 
can safely cross the border if bags of heroin are packed in the 
car wheels. The problem is avoiding the attention of anti-drug 
units chasing them all the way to Bangkok. Once they have 
crossed the border, they park in front of an automobile repair 
shop in a small town and intentionally puncture the tire on the 
opposite side. At this time, someone from the repair-shop will 
come up as prearranged and say, `It will be difficult to repair 
this today. Please leave your car with us.' This is the relay 
code. The driver's job ends here. The next day, while the 
heroin is going to Bangkok, having been moved to the wheel of 
another car, the car which crossed the border the previous night 
draws the vehicular inquiries of the anti-drug unit and slowly 
disappears down a different road." 
  This relay organization is interlinked like a net from the 
Khun Sa region to Bangkok, and other methods not using cars are 
all done similarly, he said. 
  In Fang, alarming news on the battle between the Khun Sa and 
Burmese militaries was circulating. Hundreds had died in the 
Salween-River combat between the two sides, grown fierce 
beginning in early January. It was rumored that Burmese troops 
would soon cross the Salween River. With a grasp of the combat 
situation and intending to change their route, the team stopped 
by a mountain village of the Chinese Chinho people, the border 
village Ampo Pai (Pai-up) in Mae Hong Son Province. This was 
because they had acquired information that a regional commander 
of the MTA was staying at this place. For safety, they first 
hired as a guide a young person of the Lisu people who lived in 
Pai-up and had a deep relationship with the regional commander. 
  Although midday, the Chinese village was deathly quiet. The 
house at the very top of the village was the regional 
commander's. In view of the fact that it was equipped with a 
satellite antenna in this out-of-the-way mountainous area, they 
got the feeling that this was not a normal Shan village. The 
Lisu guide had gone to bring the MTA regional commander, but 
returned some time later deathly pale. "Let's get out of here 
quick. They say an order has been given in the village to kill 
all foreigners entering it. After picking out seven young 
villagers and sending them to the front yesterday, the commander 
left for the other side of the mountain because of a meeting 
this morning. He's not here." 
  Making it passed a critical moment, the news team hurriedly 
slipped out of the mountain village, and hid in Pai-up, about 10 
km away. As luck would have it, in Pai-up they were able to meet 
their Lisu guide's brother-in-law (a Thai), who was just 
returning from transporting rice to an MTA supply depot. He said 
that every day he transported rice and medicine to an MTA supply 
depot located about an hour by truck from Pai, and that for this 
he received B1,500 per day from the Khun Sa side. He 
occasionally transported weapons too. In such cases, MTA people 
made sure he absolutely could not see the weapons, so he was 
unable to identify what nation's products they were, he said. 
  The 25-year-old Lisu youth acting as the news team's guide 
asked the route they had traveled to gather information for 
their story. When they explained it to him, he told them to 
quickly get out of Mae Hong Song Province. He said that the road 
traveled by the news team was known by the intelligence network 
of the Khun Sa camp and that they could not know when they might 
suffer some accident. In a friendly way, he advised them that 
Khun Sa actually controlled the road from Fang to the city of 
Mae Hong Son, and that gunfire was often directed against 
vehicles at night, so they should only move during the day. 
  Arriving at Mae Hong Son on 17 January, the news team, after 
inquiring into rumors, were able to discover the whereabouts of 
the Korean within the Khun Sa camp, about whom the Khun Sa 
intelligence official had provided information on the Shan 
Plateau in Burma. It was revealed that the Korean Khun Sa agent 
living in a village called Naiso in the Khun Sa region, which 
goes over to the state of Shan from Mae Hong Son, was Mun 
Chung-il (56). It was impossible to meet with him, however. He 
knew ahead of time when the news team was entering the village 
to see him, so he sent his wife down to the village entrance. 
  Mun's wife, looking like a typical woman from a Korean 
farming village with her permed hair, only repeated the words, 
"We're in danger," her face pale with fear. A teacher at a 
Chinese school in the Khun Sa region, Mun Chung-il has a wife, a 
son and a daughter. It was confirmed that all, including the 
children, live in the village. 
  The request of the news team to meet Mun was buried in the 
screams of his wife, who said that the night before seven people 
were publicly killed on the charge of contacting foreigners 
(disclosing intelligence). She said that if the news team were 
to enter, the Mun family and the team would all be in danger. 
The last thing she said was that the war had temporarily been 
interrupted and that in the fierce Salween-River battle, which 
took place around January 10th, over 100 Burmese and 20 MTA 
soldiers had died. 
  The news team, which had been frequenting the Khun Sa camp 
-- 
an area stretching more than 1 thousand km, beginning on the 
Shan Plateau and reaching the border at Mae Hong Son -- decided 
to again cross the border to cover the fighting at the Salween 
River. Because the circumstances made it impossible for them to 
go to the battle front through the Khun Sa region (the state of 
Shan), they set up a plan to make use of the self-governing 
state of Karen. Touching the southwest end of the state of Shan, 
which Khun Sa had declared independent, is the state of Karen. 
The Karens also demand their independence and have been fighting 
an undeclared war with Burmese troops for the last 30 years. 
  Meeting with Vice President Taebupe (55), who leads the 
provisional government from the village of Naiso on the border 
north of Mae Hong Son, the news team asked him to let them 
approach the Salween River through the state of Karen. He said 
that he would gladly help, but the problem was the Thai border 
guards. The Thai border guards here strongly maintained that 
they could not send foreign reporters into the war zone. They 
said that in early January over ten Western reporters had 
gathered at this place, intending to enter the Salween River 
combat area, but that they had turned them away. Ultimately, the 
news team had to end here the first attempt ever made to cover 
the drug war and the scene of drug production and supply in the 
Khun Sa region.

  [Text] Breaking through front lines covered by the 
clouds of war... 
  Sisa Journal held an interview with Sai Chan 
(alias), an MTA intelligence official in charge of over 300 
reserve troops who was seeking to ascertain the movements of the 
Burmese Army's 88th Division from behind the Shan Plateau in 
Burma. The meeting with him was brought about, on the condition 
that no pictures would be taken, through a Thai of Chinese 
ancestry who had long engaged in the border smuggling of this 
area. Of course, additional conditions were that the magazine 
would objectively present the Khun Sa camp's justifications for 
the independence of the state of Shan and that a considerable 
amount be provided in dollars as payment for the interview. The 
interview was conducted through the Thai and English 
interpreting of the Chinese guide. 
  Interviewer: To us, Khun Sa is known as the "Drug 
King." Why is Khun Sa risking the criticism of the world press 
to continue to supply drugs to the outside world? 
  Chan: Khun Sa did not get involved in drugs from 
the beginning to come on the stage as [the head of] an evil 
gang, as you understand it. When the army of Chang Kai Shek was 
push out of China by that of Mao Tse-tung in 1949, its main 
force fled to Taiwan, but the 93rd and 96th Divisions, unable to 
make the crossing, came into the Burma region. Afterwards, the 
Chinese Communist Party dispatched Communist troops to Burma. At 
that time, Khun Sa started taking up arms full-scale against the 
Burmese government. There are many ethnic minorities in Burma, 
such as the Karen, Lahu, Wa, Taiyai, and Kachin. Khun Sa came to 
align himself with these peoples as the Burmese government 
withdrew its original promise of independence for ethnic 
minorities. The outside world having isolated us, and in a 
situation without freedom, we had no choice but to trade in 
heroin to get the money to defend ourselves. 
  Interviewer: It is our understanding that from the 
very beginning Khun Sa abused the ethnic minorities of this 
region with the goal of engaging in the drug trade. 
  Chan: That is wrong. In no way did Khun Sa conquer 
or rule ethnic minorities. I'm Lisu, not Taiyai, but I'm not 
doing this because I was conquered by him. I was able to work in 
Khun Sa's shadow for the last 25 years, even though I belong to 
a minority, because I judged Khun Sa to really be the one to 
bring us independence, our cherished wish. When Khun Sa would 
stop by the village of an ethnic minority, he always gave pigs, 
chickens, rice, and such to the people of that village suffering 
from hunger, providing a way for them to live without going 
hungry. Because of this, when in the past Khun Sa went into 
northern Thailand, chased by the Burmese military, the numerous 
ethnic minorities of the border region started maintaining a 
cooperative relationship with him. At that time, Khun Sa stayed 
in Thailand using the name Tongko. Even now, his unit name is 
Tongko and we still call Khun Sa, Tongko, among ourselves. We 
wanted to survive, cultivating opium and buying the weapons Khun 
Sa needs to protect us. As long as the Burmese government sealed 
us off and attacked us, opium was our sustenance and our 
strength. 
  Interviewer: If the residents of this place 
cultivate opium, how much profit goes to them? 
  Chan: Farmers trade poppy latex using units of 
one jyoi (1.2 kg). One jyoi is about B10 thousand in Thai 
currency. Two - three jyoi of poppy latex are produced from one 
lai. 
  Interviewer:[Interviewer] How does the Khun Sa 
organization process poppy latex collected in this way? 
  Chan: Refining it into heroin, we have been 
raising funds for providing food, clothing, and medicines to the 
farmers producing it. We have refining factories in several 
locations. You have to process 8 jyoi of poppy latex to make one 
jyoi of heroin. If leaves and stems are mixed in the latex, you 
can get one jyoi of heroin from 12 jyoi of latex. One jyoi of 
heroin made in this way sells in Bangkok for about $12 thousand. 
It is my understanding that if this goes over to Americans, 
people from Hong Kong, Koreans, etc., the transaction is made 
for about $20 thousand. 
  Interviewer: We want to visit and cover a 
heroin-processing factory. Can you give us a location and make 
connections for us? 
  Chan: We are now in the middle of a war. The 
facilities of a few factories have already been closed because 
of bombing. If I were to introduce you, we would all be in 
danger. Even if you approach that place through some other, 
high-level route, now chances are 90 percent that you would be 
shot. If you want to go despite this, I will show you a few 
places on a map, because the precise position is a 
closely-guarded secret. Passing through Thailand, cross over 
following the northern border in straight lines from the Mae Sa 
Rong and Naiso areas. Then you will come the closest. 
  Interviewer: It is my understanding that 
high-level technology is needed for refining heroin. Are there 
many such technicians in the Khun Sa region? 
  Chan: Asian chemists, whose names I cannot reveal, 
helped us. After putting a fine-mesh metal net over a very 
large, jar-shaped tank and filling it with chemicals secretly 
obtained in Bangkok, poppy latex is put on top of it and heat is 
applied. Then foam like tallow floats up in the tank. This is 
collected and dried, producing heroin. 
  Interviewer: The governments of Thailand, Burma, 
Laos, and China, and even the American CIA are keeping watch on 
the drug trade of the Khun Sa organization. How is trade 
possible under such circumstances? 
  Chan: I'm not going to give you details. This is 
because if I were to disclose this, the fact would become known 
in a concrete way that almost all the surrounding nations have 
taken payment for allowing the drug trade. Just know that the 
surrounding countries have helped us unofficially. About a month 
ago, an article came out in an American newspaper saying that a 
three-star Thai general delivered drugs in the U.S. and used the 
money to garrison Thailand's border. We know people who can work 
on both sides of the fence among the officials of all the 
nations of the world. At one time, I was sent to China for a 
heroin deal. When I got there, I was only an errand boy; 
government officials of surrounding nations were decisive in 
making sure that the deal was successful. 
  Interviewer: Are there also Korean government 
officials among those secretly helping Khun Sa? 
  Chan: I can't know that. But it is a fact that 
several Koreans work with us here. 
  Interviewer: Are they from North Korea or South 
Korea? 
  Chan: They are South Koreans. 
  Interviewer: Please tell us their names and 
concrete details of their activity. 
  Chan: That is a closely-guarded secret. But as 
long as the subject has come up, I'll give you the examples of 
three people only. In our organization, there are people 
responsible for the affairs of each country, the U.S., Taiwan, 
Japan, Korea, etc. Each of them a native of the country for 
which they are responsible, they have mastery of that country's 
language. However, I cannot reveal their names. Another one of 
the Koreans frequently visits our area and is ranked fifth among 
international merchants dealing in heroin. He was staying in a 
hotel in Bangkok sometime early last year, about to make a hefty 
transaction, when intelligence of it leaked out to the Thai 
police. But there was someone with whom we have connections in 
the Bangkok police, so he was able to escape 20-30 minutes 
before the police raided the hotel. At that time, the Korean 
merchant, connected with a high-level route, made use of a 
helicopter and safely crossed over into Burma. Another Korean is 
an intellectual who had been living in Manchuria when he came 
over to our organization. He is helping improve our region's 
backward education. 
  Interviewer: We really want to meet these Koreans. 
We will provide you with everything you need, no matter what it 
is, so please enable use to meet with these people. 
  Chan: If we meet the Koreans in the present 
circumstances, me, you, and the Koreans will all be in danger. I 
don't need anything. If you really want to meet the Koreans, 
then do it yourselves. 
  Interviewer: Please give us information on at 
least one person that would make approach possible. 
  Chan: Okay. I'm not going to get directly 
involved, so you meet him on your own. There is one Korean in a 
Chinese village in the region of Thailand's Mae Hong Son 
Province and the Burmese border, about 1 thousand km to the 
southwest from here. 
  Interviewer: What does he do there? 
  Chan: As a person within our organization who is 
fluent in Korean, he writes for the media of Thailand's northern 
region. Khun-Sa-related information reported in Korea also goes 
though this. He began the work of preparing to buy Thai 
citizenship about three months ago. He plans to visit Korea as a 
Thai citizen in a little while. 
  Interviewer: Does this mean that if he visits 
Korea, someone will be waiting for him? 
  Chan: Yes. He is presently supported with money 
from Korea. 
  Interviewer: Do you mean the Korean government is 
supporting him? 
  Chan: No. He is given private support. One other 
Korean is presently working with him in his office. In Korea, 
this person is known to be a foreign news correspondent. 
  Finishing this statement, with a tense expression on his 
face, he suddenly stopped the interview and spoke for some time 
with the news team's Chinese guide, whispering in Thai. Later on 
they learned that the intelligence official thought he had 
disclosed something which might bring danger on himself and that 
he requested that no more questions be asked concerning the 
Koreans within the Khun Sa organization. In consideration for 
the safety of all, the news team decided to stop asking those 
questions. As for the information he provided concerning the 
Korean in the Khun Sa organization, the news team was able to 
establish its accuracy by infiltrating into the western Khun Sa 
region, 1 thousand km away, four days later, meeting his family 
and actually confirming his name. 
  Interviewer: You said the Khun Sa organization 
carries on the drug trade in order to struggle for independence. 
How are drugs and weapons exchanged. 
  Chan: Major weapons are brought in from the U.S. 
Americans supply us with weapons as payment for drug deals. And 
there are American weapons specialists in our area. They set up 
a munitions factory and are supplying us with ammunition. 
  Interviewer: Does this mean that the U.S., which 
has a warrant out for Khun Sa on drug offenses, is cultivating 
Khun Sa's military power? 
  Chan: They have no relationship with the U.S. 
government. They are men who participated in the Vietnam War, 
but were unable to leave Vietnam after the fall of Saigon. In 
the U.S. they were probably listed as missing, but they fled 
communized Vietnam, moving north through the jungle until they 
met with us. The have helped us for the 20 years since then, 
manufacturing weapons. They receive the very best special 
treatment. 
  Interviewer: How many of these Americans are there? 
  Chan: That is a secret. Let's just say there is a 
considerable number of them. During the Vietnam War, U.S. 
Military Headquarters was located in Thailand and U.S. military 
recreation centers were concentrated there. Some American 
soldiers married Thai women and settled down at that time, but 
later moved north to make money. There were many such cases. 
  Interviewer: Is this fact also know in the 
American government? 
  Chan: Of course. From a certain point of view, it 
can be said that the U.S. too has helped us with this problem up 
to now. Even social workers living in Thailand behave in the 
public eye as though they have no connection at all with Khun 
Sa, but in actuality they have helped us a great deal. I can't 
say anything more. 
  Interviewer: Korean soldiers also participated in 
the Vietnam War. Are there also Korean soldiers listed as 
missing who live in the Khun Sa region. 
  Chan: It is my understanding that there are some. 
Don't ask anything else about Koreans. 
  Interviewer: We want to meet Khun Sa directly. 
Will you connect us? 
  Chan: We are now in the middle of a large-scale 
war. It is impossible. 
  Interviewer: It has come out in foreign news 
reports that Khun Sa lives in a one-story concrete house in 
urban Homong. Will it work out if we go there? 
  Chan: Major figures of our independent country, 
including Khun Sa, have already moved to the combat 
headquarters. He is directing the war from a large, subterranean 
cavern, even equipped with an airfield. Nobody can approach him. 
  Interviewer: The world is calling this war the 
"Drug War" and carefully watching its outcome. The general 
offensive of the Burmese military is continuing. Are you certain 
of victory. 
  Chan: If Burma is attacking us to stop the 
production of heroin, and all the nations of the world give it 
their support, then this war is a mistake. Our leader now 
directing the war from an underground bunker is not the Khun Sa 
of whom you speak. Many drug-lord Khun Sas such as you are 
talking about exist in northern Burma, Bangkok, Hong Kong, and 
Macao. Unable to be free, we traded in drugs for independence 
and survival. But if the world were to recognize our freedom and 
independence, and give us economic support, all the opium fields 
of northern Burma would change into land for cultivating new, 
highly-realizable crops. The government of our independent 
nation is truly hoping that you rich Asian nations like Korea 
and Japan will help banish drugs. In return for this, our 
government has already revealed that it would offer the 
limitless minerals and jewels within our region.

<F P=106> [Article: "Taiwan Antinarcotics Police Cast a Wide Net, </F>
Opening and Searching Coffins To No Avail, with the Owner of the 
Cargo Admitting That Hong Kong Drug Offenders Had Tried To 
Persuade Him To Cooperate in Shipping Drugs"] 
  [Text] When the Taiwan police received intelligence 
indicating that a drug-dealing ring had colluded with a Hong 
Kong gang of drug dealers, to secretly ship 500 kg of heroin and 
guns to Taiwan on the pretext of importing mainland coffins, 
they opened and searched at night a container holding 67 
coffins, finding that the coffins certainly held no drugs or 
guns. The importer of these coffins openly admitted that while 
he had been solicited to cooperate in drug smuggling, the plan 
had failed because he had not agreed. 
  A Taiwan police source claims that antinarcotics police and 
prosecutors had been investigating this case of drugs concealed 
in imported coffins for two months, and that their intelligence 
was very accurate. This had included the substance of the plans 
and fundraising by the goods owners, and even shadowing and 
monitoring of meetings at the Taipei World Trade Hotel by a 
Taiwan goods owner, a Mr. Chiang [3068], with Hong Kong and 
Singaporean drug dealers. The antinarcotics officers even had 
hard information that a goods owner, a Mr. Wang [3769], had used 
a certain Miss Chang [1728] to send the money to Hong Kong. 
  In the operation to shadow the truck carrying the container 
the other morning, the antinarcotics officers had acted to catch 
the offenders by arranging more than 10 shadowing vehicles on 
the highway, discovering that the drug ring had also sent out a 
"road-sweeping vehicle." The driver of a porsche running in the 
vicinity of the container truck had a long history of drug 
dealing, making the antinarcotics officers even more certain of 
his involvement. 
  Who would have guessed that this whole drug shipment 
planning 
and coordination was a strategic operation by the drug dealing 
ring, using a live-troop drill to probe police strength, and to 
force the police to expose their shadowing operation. The 
Criminal Police Bureau cooperated with the Coastal Defense 
Command on 12 March 1994 to seize the container of coffins 
suspected of holding 500 kg of heroin smuggled from the mainland 
through Hong Kong to Taiwan. They went to Yungk'ang City to 
"open the coffins to find the drugs," but after six hours of 
intensive searching of 67 coffins, found no drugs. But the 
police had information provided by the merchant in charge of the 
imported container trade, Chiang X-chen [3068 X 3791], that a 
Hong Kong merchant had discussed with him the smuggling of drugs 
in coffins and farm products. 
  Chiang X-chen indicated that while more than six months 
before, two Hong Kong traders, a Mr. Huang [7806] and a Mr. 
Chang [1728], had repeatedly discussed with him the smuggling of 
heroin through an import pipeline of coffins and farm products, 
he had not agreed.

<F P=106> [Article by Chuang Jung-yen (8369 2837 1750): "Police and </F>
Prosecutors Jointly Crack a Huge Drug Dealing Ring, Arresting 33 
Drug Smugglers"] 
  [Text] The Shilin prosecutor's office and police department 
and the Taipei Central No 1 police department, after five months 
of sustained investigation, cracked a huge drug smuggling and 
dealing ring yesterday [28 March 1994], arresting 33 drug 
smugglers and their connections involved in the case in places, 
such as Taipei City and County, Chilung, Hsinchu, Nantou, 
Taoyuan, and Pingtung. While the seized drugs weighed only 15.6 
kg, the whole case involved a group effort by prosecutors, 
police, and the military, with an unflagging and persistent 
pursuit of up-, mid-, and down-stream drug smugglers. Since the 
government declared its "war on drugs," to bring all of its 
forces into play, this was a successful campaign in the spirit 
of "doing all possible to wipe out drugs." 
  Since launching this concerted anti-drug action in October 
1993, those engaged in the examination of the case, after 
scoring successes in both the north and south, yesterday 
arrested drug smuggler Kuan Ho-yuan [4619 0735 3293] in 
Pingtung. At the time of his arrest, as his wife tried to 
interfere in her capacity as vice president of the Chaochouchen 
representative assembly, a close-range gunfight broke out. 
While the suspect and Officer Kuo Tsung-chih [6753 1350 2535] 
of the Central No 1 police department were both wounded, neither 
wounds were life-threatening. 
  The police reported that the 33 arrested were Yang Si-ch'i 
[2799 1835 7871], Yang Kuo-lung [2799 0948 7127], Ch'en Shu-chen 
(f) [7115 3219 6297], Huang Kuo-pao 7806 0948 1405], Ch'en 
Kuang-hsien [7115 0342 6343], Ts'ai Ch'i-yu [5591 7496 1342], 
Lin Mei-yi [2651 5019 1355], Liu Lien-fang [0491 6647 5364], 
Kang Ming-p'ing [? 2494 1627], Wang Hsiu-chen (f) [3076 4423 
6297], Chung P'eng-t'eng [6945 7720 7506], Liu T'ai-shun [0491 
0669 7311], Lin Chung-hung [2651 1813 1738], Ch'en Shih-huang 
[7115 0013 3552], Kuo Chien-chih [6753 6015 1807], Liu 
Yung-ch'in [0491 3057 2953], Ch'en Ming-yueh [7115 2494 2588], 
Ch'en Chin-lung [7115 6855 7893], P'an Hsiu-wen [3382 4423 
7186], Chang Ch'ing-yu [1728 1987 5940], Yao Ying-han [1202 5391 
3352], Ch'en Chih-ming [7115 1807 2494], Chang Chien-neng [1728 
0494 5174], Chiang Jui-ch'ing [3068 3843 3237], Liu Yung-k'un 
[0491 3057 0981], Wu Lai-wang [0702 0171 2489], Wu Shih-t'ing 
[0702 4258 0080], Ch'en T'ien-sung 7115 1131 6623], Su Yung-chi 
[5685 0516 0679], Sun Fu-shou [1327 4395 1108], Lin Jui-hsiung 
[2651 3843 7160], Kuan Ho-yuan, and Kuan Wen-ling (f) [4619 7186 
5376]. 
  After the police cracked a street drug-dealing case in 
October 1993, they acted strictly in accordance with the 
anti-drug determination to declare a war on drugs of Executive 
Yuan President (Premier) Lien Chan, by actively developing its 
clues. As they acted boldly with strong will, as well as 
obtaining the full support of prosecutors, they were able to 
develop the case, expanding a minor drug case into a huge 
drug-dealing ring with connections in both the north and south. 
This was not only a brilliant strike by a combination of police 
and prosecutors, but also was a redeclaration of the 
government's determination to wipe out drugs. 
  It is understood that the Police Administration Bureau is 
pointing the banner of "anti-crime among public representatives" 
at public representatives at all levels involved in "drugs." It 
is expected that the police will increase their oversight and 
searches of public representatives at all levels who have drug 
histories and are suspected of using or dealing drugs, in order 
to put a stop to this "drug wave" that has been going on under 
the protection of public representatives.

  [Text] Coordinating Minister for Police and Security 
Soesilo Soedarman said that the State Intelligence Coordinating 
Board (BAKIN) must take a more serious view of the dangers posed 
by narcotics because Indonesia is no longer just a transit point 
for the international drug trade but it has become a target for 
drug dealers. 
  For that reason BAKIN must reexamine the organization, 
authority, tasks and procedures of the Executive Coordinating 
Board (BAKOLAK) set up by Presidential Instruction Number 6 of 
1971 concerning narcotics, controlled substances and alcoholic 
beverages, he added. 
  "This is important because things are developing so rapidly 
and some of its regulations are no longer relevant," Soesilo 
said yesterday after delivering a report to president Suharto at 
his residence on Cendana Street. 
  "Regulations which were a product of 1971 conditions can no 
longer keep up with the present speed of changing conditions." 
  He said that PJPT II [Stage II Long-Term Development] plans 
to pay close attention to the creation of Indonesians who are 
reliable both physically and spiritually so that the country can 
compete with more advanced nations. 
  "But we have been concerned recently because trafficking in 
alcoholic beverages and controlled substances has upset our 
efforts to build up dependable human resources, both physically 
and spiritually, who are skilled, broad-minded and intelligent," 
he said. 
  Indications are that Indonesia has changed from a mere 
transit point to a target country, said Soesilo, and there is a 
lot of evidence that drugs are being introduced and are ready to 
be marketed in Indonesia. 
  "Just look at the case of the 12 kg of heroin uncovered in 
Medan; was it going to be distributed there or was it in 
transit?," he asked. 
  In addition, there have been several similar cases of large 
amounts of drugs smuggled into Indonesia as their final 
destination. "Previously, Indonesia was only a transit point; we 
didn't like that and we like it even less when Indonesia is the 
target zone, so the only option is to work even harder." 
  Asked whether there was any political intent behind 
targeting 
young people, Soesilo said, "It's not that simple; the world is 
undergoing large-scale changes in direction and this affects 
everything, including the narcotics problem, and this is what 
makes us nervous," he said. 
  The Coordinating Minister for Police and Security is not 
willing to allow Indonesia to become a paradise for drug 
trafficking because the sentences handed out are too lenient. 
"When I was PANGKOWILHAN I [Commander of Defense Region Command 
I] in Medan, I once carried out an operation. We worked so hard 
to capture somebody and then the sentence was insufficient. We 
have to straighten this problem out," he said.

  [Text] This morning, Souban Salitthilat, chairman of the 
Lao National Committee for Narcotics Control and deputy minister 
of foreign affairs, held a press conference at the Foreign 
Affairs Ministry in Vientiane to publicize a comprehensive plan 
on narcotics control in the Lao People's Democratic Republic 
[LPDR] for the period from now to the year 2000. The press 
conference was attended by foreign diplomats along with 
representatives of the United Nations and nongovernmental 
organizations to the LPDR. Director generals of various 
departments under the Foreign Affairs Ministry were also present. 
  On this occasion, Souban Salitthilat explained the line and 
policy of the party and state on the settlement of the narcotics 
problem in the LPDR for the period from now to 2000. He also 
reported the achievements in investigating narcotics problems 
throughout the country, especially in northern provinces, where 
there are some 19,000 hectares of land for poppy plantation. He 
noted that in the northern provinces in 1992-1993, a total of 
some 125 to 150 metric tons of opium were produced and some 
42,000 people became addicted to the drug. 
  In view of the aforementioned problem, the chairman of the 
Lao National Committee for Narcotics Control proposed as many as 
16 infrastructural projects requiring as much as $35 million. 
He said: In implementing the various projects, an emphasis will 
be put on restricting and reducing drug production. Regarding 
this, more rural development projects will be set up in Phong 
Saly and Oudomsai provinces and in Saisomboun District, 
Vientiane Province. Existing projects now being implemented 
include the rural development projects in Xieng Khouang 
Province, the Lao-American Cooperation Project for Integrated 
Rural Development in Houa Phan Province, and the drug reduction 
projects in Bokeo and Luang Namtha provinces. 
  In the recent past, the Lao National Committee for 
Narcotics Control has received technical and financial support 
in the form of loans and gratis aid from many organizations, 
such as the (?Christian) Organization of Norway, the United 
Nations Drug Control Program, the International Fund for 
Agricultural Development, and the Lao-American project in Houa 
Phan Province.

  [Text] The Philippine Embassy in Kuala Lumpur is asking 
the government to formally ask Malaysia to grant executive 
clemency for humanitarian reasons to three Filipinos who were 
meted death sentences for drug trafficking in Sabah two weeks 
ago. 
  Officials at the Department of Foreign Affairs yesterday 
said 
the recommendation sent by Ambassador to Malaysia Alberto 
Encomienda will be submitted to President Ramos who will decide 
whether formal representations will be made regarding the issue. 
  The plea hangs in the balance, this early though, as Ramos 
yesterday issued a statement that drug traffickers should not 
expect any pardon from him. 
  At the fifth ASEAN workshop for nongovernment organizations 
for the prevention of drug and substance abuse held in 
Malacanang [presidential office], Ramos said, "Let me clearly 
indicate that I will interpose no objection if any person, so 
convicted, is sent to the electric chair or gas chamber." 
  Last 14 April, the Malaysian Supreme Court ordered the 
hanging of Japlin Jimlok, Benny Saman, and Gan Muslimin, all 
based in Kota Kinabalu, after they were convicted of drug 
trafficking by the High Courts in Sabah. The three Filipinos 
are now awaiting their execution at the Kapaya State Prison in 
Sabah. 
  On the same day, nine other Filipinos, including a woman, 
had 
their death sentences reduced to life imprisonment for the same 
offense. 
  Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Roberto Romulo said Ramos has 
ordered Philippine officials in Kuala Lumpur to look into 
reports that a number of imprisoned Filipinos in Sandakan, Sabah 
were tortured by police and prison authorities. 
  Last 21 April, 11 Filipinos who were deported and imprisoned 
in Sandakan complained that other Filipinos currently serving 
jail terms in Sabah are also subjected to various forms of 
torture like having their heads banged on walls and dunked in 
toilet bowls, and their skin carved off the soles of their feet.

  [Text] "Do you know that today, the world refers to 
Thailand as `Thai Switzerland?'" said Khanin Bunsuwan, a 
Solidarity Party MP [member of parliament] from Chonburi 
Province, to a reporter the other day. He also said that "the 
reason why they call us that is that banks in Thailand accept 
deposits freely with no questions asked. Thus, money is flowing 
into the banks from all corners of the world and from within the 
country. Some of this money may come from illegal activities 
such as heroin, marijuana, and cocaine trafficking, trafficking 
in war weapons, activities carried on by international gangs, 
corruption, numbers rackets, embezzlement, fraud, and smuggling. 
Even though this money comes from illegal activities, once it 
enters the banking system, it becomes `clean money.' It has in 
effect been `laundered.' In the end, that money will be used to 
buy land, build hotels, buy stock shares, build huge 
entertainment establishments, or invest in major business 
activities. The result is that those people become millionaires. 
Wherever they go, people praise them. They engage in 
merit-making activities as a front or donate huge sums of 
money," said Mr. Khanin. 
  "If we know that people are laundering money like this, why 
hasn't something been done about this?" asked the reporter? 
  The MP from Chonburi took a deep breath before replying. 
"It's because our banks do not impose any conditions on making 
deposits or transferring money into an account. And they have 
never had to check to see where that money comes from. Instead, 
they view money like a god. The more the better. In effect, they 
are helping to promote the illegal activities of those people. 
Because regardless of how tainted the money is, it can be 
laundered in a second," said MP Khanin. 
  He then talked about what other countries are doing about 
this problem. "In other countries, they conduct an investigation 
if large sums of money are deposited or if there are unusual 
deposits. If it cannot be proven that the money was earned 
legally, the money is seized. They have laws to control the 
laundering of money obtained illegally. But Thailand still 
doesn't have such a law. I think that the ministries of finance 
and interior should push for the promulgation of such a law. We 
must take quick action on this. Otherwise, Thailand will become 
the money-laundering center of the world," said MP Khanin about 
what will happen. 
  Yes, if we continue to ignore this, some people may think 
that the government itself is laundering money.

  [Text] Saraburi: More than ten thousand Hmong hilltribes 
will remain in the Tham Kabok Buddhist sanctuary until they are 
cured of their drug addiction and the Thai government decides to 
resettle them, said Phra Chamrun Phanchandra, the abbot of Tham 
Kabok. 
  The abbot said his duty is to cure those addicts and provide 
them with vocational training. Many members of the Hmong 
hilltribes, who lived in the highland areas of Laos before being 
driven out by political turbulence, are addicted to smoking 
opium. 
  "If the government is concerned about any negative impact to 
its security, it can let me know and I will stop treating them 
and do whatever the government wishes me to," said Phra Chamrun. 
  The abbot is known for his dedication to the treatment of 
drug addicts at his Buddhist center. So far, a large number of 
Hmong people have come to him for treatment, bringing along 
their family members and dependents. 
  These people came from the northern Thai-Lao border area 
which was used as a springboard by Hmong rebels for fighting 
against the communist Laotian government. The anti-Lao Hmong 
were trained by the CIA during the Indochina War to fight for 
the right-wing Lao faction against the communist Pathet Lao. 
  After the fall of Laos in 1975 to the communist Pathet Lao, 
the Hmong were driven to the border area near northern Thailand 
where they staged their resistance. The Vientiane government 
has tried to wipe out the Hmong resistance, but these people 
sought refuge in Thailand, thus creating a sore point in 
Thai-Lao relations. 
  The Laotian government wants Thailand to stop providing 
refuge to the rebels. However Thailand feels that they are 
providing the refugees with humanitarian aid. 
  Some Laotian officials have accused Thailand of helping the 
Hmong resistance but these charges were countered by the Thai 
military's challenge that Laos provide evidence to back up its 
claims. Abbot Chamrun said: "We have some contacts with the 
Laotian (government) side ... but we have yet to arrange a 
formal meeting." 
  The dedicated Thai monk, who won a Magsaysay award for his 
contribution to the treatment of drug addicts, now wants to 
resettle the Hmong: "They need to be cured first. After they 
are cured, I would like to see them resettled in a lowland area 
so that they won't go back to drugs again. 
  Right now, another batch of about 2,000 Hmongs want to come 
and receive treatment here, but there's no place for them.

<F P=106> [Article by Nguyen Huu Kiem: "Drug Addiction in the </F>
Northern Mountain Region: Facts and Solutions"] 
  [Text] The "brown fairy" [opium] has been clinging to the 
lives of the six northern mountain provinces for generations. 
In almost every province in the region there are areas where 
poppies are being cultivated at very high yields. In Ha Tuyen 
Province [name of province as published] alone poppy plants are 
being grown in five districts, producing high yields at low 
capital and labor costs. These are the districts of Hoang Su 
Phi, Quan Ba, Yen Minh, Dong Van, and Meo Vac. This region is 
also part of the Brown Triangle -- better known as the Golden 
Triangle -- the well-known poppy planting region in Southeast 
Asia. Lao Cai Province has poppy cultivation areas in Bac Ha, 
Muong Khuong, Bat Sat, and Sa Pa. Yen Bai Province has 
intensive experience in poppy cultivation, with acreage of up to 
1,484 hectares in Mu Cang Chai and Tram Tau districts. 
  Poppy plants are usually hard to grow, but not in high 
mountain regions where the climate is cool and dry. The plant 
does not require much labor or care. The current price in these 
planting areas is one tael of gold for 3 kg of opium. The 
further the opium is transported and the more control posts it 
gets through, the higher the price. 
  The "brown fairy" has always been with the multi-ethnic 
compatriots at funerals and wedding parties, spring festivals, 
harvest festivals, and parties to congratulate people on their 
job promotions or new houses. In recent years opium has become 
so popular that people treat each other to opium the same way 
they do with cigarettes. It has become a popular habit; in all 
gatherings, there is usually a pipe and opium provided by the 
host. In localities where poppies are grown, among every 10 
local people -- regardless of age or gender --there are three or 
four opium addicts, and one of them is heavily addicted. We do 
not thus far have official records on the number of families and 
individuals addicted to opium in the six northern mountain 
provinces. Records in the former Hoang Lien Son Province three 
years ago showed there were some 70,000 addicts, including 
12,000 who were seriously addicted. Yen Bai Province's records 
in 1993 showed 6,000 serious cases among 32,000 addicts. These 
numbers were drawn solely from voluntary statements by the 
addicts. We are unsure about the number of people who did not 
declare. Among the addicts, more than 35 percent were young 
people. They are usually heavily addicted and are the main 
concern for society. 
  Prior to 1975, poppy planting was virtually eliminated and 
the number of addicts was negligible. During the 1980's, the 
poppy plant was imported and grown as a medicinal plant. Since 
then, localities that have the appropriate soil conditions have 
rushed to grow poppy plants and have neglected food crops. Poppy 
plants have become a garden plant, and people smoke opium openly 
just like cigarettes. There were times when opium was collected 
in lieu of taxes because poppy growers did not pay taxes in cash 
or food grains. In some years in the past, some district 
authorities had to store several hundred kg of opium and put 
them up for sale. The lawful buyers of this medicinal substance 
are cigarette companies and the pharmaceutical general company. 
Buyers were few but sellers were many, so naturally they could 
not agree on prices. This paved the way to the development of 
smuggling activities. 
  In poppy cultivation areas, each smoker uses about 3-4 kg of 
opium a year. A family would spend many millions [currency not 
specified] on it; could the amount a province would offer to the 
"brown fairy" be hundreds of billions? There were times when 
cadres and state employees used their savings to buy and store 
opium at harvest time, and then sell it when the price was high. 
Mountain regions have been haunted by the poppy plant again and 
again; addiction has become ever more serious, people's health 
has deteriorated, and poor regions have become even poorer 
because poppy cultivation has prevented the development of food 
crops. 
  After the successful August Revolution, we carried out a 
movement to substitute food crops for poppy plants in parallel 
with the campaign to control addiction. We also carried out 
measures to prevent opium and other drugs from being imported 
into Vietnam. Thanks to the universal movement to suppress 
addiction, we basically eradicated drug addiction in the 
fifties, sixties, and seventies. In the eighties, with poppy 
plants being grown in the mountain provinces, drug addiction has 
made a comeback. 
  To deal with the situation, we have motivated all people to 
participate in movements to control and prevent drug addiction, 
substitute food crops or other medicinal plants for poppy 
plants, and punish offenders through strict administrative 
measures. 
  In addition to imposing harsh punishment on drug procurers 
and rehabilitating drug addicts over the last few years, the 
authorities in Yen Bai Province have arranged to collect opium 
and destroy it on the spot. Mu Cang Chai District, for example, 
has burned 292 kg of opium. The province provided the local 
H'Mong people with 80 tonnes of rice to help them during the 
planting season for food crops. The province also invested over 
4.1 billion dong in capital lending to local people to help them 
grow corn, fruit trees, and wheat on lands that used to grow 
poppy plants. Lao Cai, Lang Son, Son La, and Lai Chau Provinces 
also provided tens of billions of dong and many thousands of 
tonnes of food staples to help people overcome addiction and 
substitute food crops and medicinal plants for poppy plants. 
The agriculture sector has carried out successful research on 
new species of vegetables and medicinal plants with high 
economic value to replace poppy plants effectively. 
  In order to eliminate drug addiction successfully, we have 
to 
be persistent in encouraging the replacement of poppy plants 
with food crops, high-value medicinal plants, or vegetables used 
for oil. We have to accelerate the campaign to denounce drug 
dependence as a bad and immoral practice. The families of drug 
addicts, together with society, should help rehabilitate addicts 
and keep them away from drug pushers. 
  The vice of drug addiction is bringing disaster to many 
households. Nobody should avoid participating in the movement 
to suppress this dangerous vice.

  [Text] New Delhi, March 7 (UNI [United News of India]). 
Despite tightening of controls, India continues to be a major 
source of illicit drug production and trafficking, according to 
the latest report of the International Narcotics Control (INC) 
board. 
  During the first six months of 1993, 50 tonnes of cannabis 
(ganja), large consignments of illicit cannabis, resin and more 
than 1.5 tonnes of opium were seized by Indian authorities. 
  Lawful cultivation of both cannabis and opium poppy are 
allowed in India to extract alkaloids for use in the 
pharmaceutical industry. It is also an important source of 
foreign exchange. 
  The report by the Vienna-based agency working in close 
cooperation with the United Nations International Drug Control 
Programme (UNDCP) said most of the cannabis seizures in India 
were effected on its borders with Nepal and Pakistan. Nepal was 
identified as an important base of origin of cannabis to India 
as well as Europe. 
  The board noted that of late Maldives which is a 
non-signatory to the 1981 single convention on narcotic drugs 
has become a major point of trafficking of drugs to Europe and 
America the consumption of illicit drugs also has significantly 
gone up in Maldives. 
  In India, Clandestine cultivation of cannabis was detected 
in 
Kerala, Manipur, Nagaland and Tamil Nadu. Clandestine 
laboratories processing heroin from the opium poppies had been 
dismantled in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. 
  The report estimated that about six to seven per cent of the 
raw opium from the licensed processing factories was 
clandestinely diverted into illicit channels. 
  The increase in illicit traffic in heroin has been 
accompanied by its growing abuse in certain parts of South Asia. 
In India, heroin abuse remains a major concern. Originally 
confined to the North-Eastern states and larger cities, the 
habit is now spreading to other areas, the report said. 
  Intravenous administration of heroin and the high incidence 
of AIDS infection resulting from that form of abuse have become 
a major problem in Bombay, the report noted. 
  Another area of concern was the increasing illicit 
manufacture of methaqualone.

Pakistan has dumped tonnes of narcotics along the Rajasthan 
border and the drug pedlars are waiting for security lapses to 
push the contraband into India, according to the Border Security 
Force (BSF) chief, Mr. D.K. Arya. 
  The drugs are worth hundreds of crores of rupees in the 
international market. The move is a part of Pakistan's larger 
strategy to weaken India economically and expose New Delhi to 
international pressure in yet another arena -- Narco-terrorism.

<F P=106> [Article by Amit Baruah: "Yangon [Rangoon] To Look Into </F>
Delhi's Charge on Heroin"] 
  [Text] Tamu (Myanmar), March 2. 
  Myanmarese [Burmese] enforcement authorities have promised 
to 
examine India's contention that large quantities of heroin are 
flowing across the border to India through Moreh in Manipur and 
other parts of the country. 
  This agreement was arrived at across the table at the 
first-ever meeting of Indo-Myanmar officials held at a place 
close to Tamu (Sagaing division) on February 28 and March 1 as 
per the recent bilateral agreement to prevent illicit 
trafficking in narcotic drugs. 
  Myanmar [Burma], according to estimates, produces more than 
2,000 tonnes of raw opium annually, about 60 per cent of the 
total worldwide. Most of the estimated 2.5 lakh kg produced 
travels to Western countries. 
  In a free and frank exchange, a departure from the mistrust 
that has marked relations between the two nations, officials 
arrived at a modus operandi to coordinate enforcement efforts. 
  Talking to the press after the meeting, Police Lt. Col. Hkam 
Awng, Deputy Director in the Myanmarese Central Committee for 
Drug Abuse Control, Yangon, said they were "surprised" to hear 
that large quantities of heroin, entering India from the Myanmar 
border, had been seized by the Indian authorities. 
  "We take this issue very seriously. We will look into it," 
Lt. Col. Awng-said. Earlier seizures of the dreaded drug, he 
maintained, had been of small quantities. 
  Recently, the Manipur police seized as large a quantity as 
one kilo while the Delhi police arrested an individual with 
another kg of "number four" (the purest grade) heroin 
originating in the Tamu-Moreh area. All this evidence was placed 
before the Myanmarese delegation. 
  `Govt. not linked': The Myanmar official, however, 
refuted allegations that Myanmar authorities were in any way 
benefiting from the drug trade. "These allegations are totally 
untrue," the Lt. Col. said, denying stories in the Western press 
that there were links between drug lords and the Myanmar 
Government. 
  According to Mr. M.D. Sharma, Director-General of Police, 
Manipur, who led the Indian delegation, the seizure of one kg of 
heroin by the Delhi police from Mr. Jagdish Chawla had further 
confirmed that large quantities were entering Moreh from Tamu. 
  Mr. Sharma said that Mr. Chawla after his arrest had told 
the 
police that this was his "16th trip" with the drug from the 
Tamu-Moreh area. The 15 runs earlier had been successful ones. 
  LTTE, the recipient: He said that the drug from 
Moreh travelled to Bombay and Madras and then made its way to 
Sri Lanka. Mr. Sharma said there was evidence to suggest that 
the LTTE [Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam] was the recipient of 
the drug, which, obviously, is used to finance its terrorist 
activities. 
  In a bid to put a lid on the profitable drug trade, India 
and 
Myanmar have agreed to exchange regular intelligence and 
information apart from the decision to set up wireless links 
between the two countries pending the introduction of satellite 
telephones. 
  Apart from the regular quarterly meeting of "contact 
officers", there will be monthly ground-level meetings of field 
officers as well to facilitate enforcement efforts. Meetings 
between officers for the Myanmar-Mizoram, Myanmar-Nagaland and 
Myanmar-Arunachal Pradesh officers will also be held as a result 
of the discussion. 
  In turn, the Myanmar authorities stressed that large amounts 
of Phensydyl, a cough mixture containing codeine, was creating 
problems for them. Detailed maps showing the routes of entry 
from the Indian side of the border were presented. 
  Myanmar officials confirmed that they had no information to 
suggest that there had been movements of Acetic Anhydride, used 
to produce heroin, from the Indian border into their country. 
  Seizures in the Shan State of Myanmar, however, revealed the 
chemical was now entering from China. India also referred to a 
shipment of some 400 tonnes of Ammonium Chloride to Yangon, to 
which the other side said it was for the manufacture of 
"Myanmarese medicine". 
  The Myanmar delegation informed Indian authorities that they 
had stationed special Narcotics Task Forces at Myitkyina, Katha, 
Mandalay, Homalin, Monya and Kalay -- believed to be the main 
trafficking routes. 
  Lt. Col. Hkam Awng, when asked, said they had no reports of 
any laboratories refining heroin along the Indo-Myanmar border. 
He said that major income substitution programmes were under way 
in his country to wean people away from poppy cultivation. 
  "A lot of development is going on. We are engaged in the 
task 
of changing the socio-economic structure of these areas. A whole 
new Ministry has been set up for the purpose," he maintained. 
  Going by the reactions from both sides, the first-ever 
meeting of Indian and Myanmar officials drawn from the police, 
narcotic control authorities, intelligence agencies and customs 
and revenue intelligence was a success.

  [Text] Bombay, March 5: Four kg of heroin, foreign and 
Indian currency totalling Rs 5 crores were seized by customs 
officials from four persons, two foreigners and two Indians, 
here on Thursday. 
  On following a tip-off, officials went to the Breach Candy 
swimming pool and arrested Jackson, a Finn, as he was passing on 
a packet to a British national, Martin. The packet contained 30 
grammes of heroin, officials said. Interrogation of the duo led 
the police to a flat in Venus Apartment, Altamount Road, 
revealed that Jackson had allegedly stashed away large amounts 
of currency and a trans-receiver. 
  Even as officials searched the apartment, an Indian, Manoj 
Singh, walked in. He too was interrogated and he revealed that 
he had come accompanied by his mother, Rajmani Singh alias 
Mishra, to deliver heroin to Jackson. The Singhs further led the 
officials to another flat in Savitha Apartments at Versova, from 
where some more heroin and currency was seized by the officials. 
Further investigations are on.

<F P=106> [Article by Gautam Mehta: "ISI-aided Drug Cartel Busted"] </F>
  [Text] Ahmedabad, March 13. One of the biggest drug cartels 
operating in the western region along the Gujarat border, 
involving the trafficking of narcotics worth over Rs 150 crores 
and with the active support of Pakistan's Field Intelligence 
Unit (FIU), a branch of ISI [Inter-Services Intelligence], 
during the past several years, has been busted by the Kutch 
police. 
  According to the DSP [Deputy Superintendent of Police], Mr. 
Pramod Kumar, a call-girl, and two Pak nationals from Bombay and 
seven persons including three Pak nationals from Kutch, who were 
allegedly involved in the cartel, have been arrested by the 
police. 
  Suleman Hamid Hingolja, the kingpin of the cartel and his 
associates had during the interrogation named a major and a 
subedar of the Pakistan army, as agents of the FIU who were 
funding the smuggling of narcotics, motivating the accused for 
indulging in drug-trafficking and espionage activities, and 
sending information and photographs to Pakistan about the vital 
army and the BSF [Border Security Force] installations in Kutch. 
The cartel was supplying the drugs to prospective peddlers in 
Gujarat, Bombay and Rajasthan. 
  However, the busting of the cartel has also indirectly 
exposed the lapses on the part of the security agencies, 
guarding the vast land border in Kutch. These lapses are evident 
from the fact that Suleman had stated to the police that he was 
operating through the Kutch border for the past 15 years and had 
crossed the border to Pakistan along with his aides carrying 
huge quantities of narcotics more than 27 times. 
  Suleman also revealed to the police that he was never given 
the reward for drug-trafficking in cash, it was always in kind. 
According to the Kutch police, during each trip, Suleman used to 
get more than 30 kg of either brown sugar, charas or heroin from 
the FIU agents as a "commission." After finalising the deal, the 
narcotics were packed into small plastic bags. 
  Later, Suleman sold the drugs at the rate of RS 1,600 per kg 
to the drug-peddlers in Gujarat, Bombay and Rajasthan. Out of 
the total earnings from the sale of the drugs, Suleman used to 
send at least Rs 22,000 to the FIU agents in Pakistan towards 
the hawala transactions. 
  The FIU agents were also supplying imported pistols and 
revolvers for sale to gun-runners. The police have so far 
recovered one imported revolver from the accused. 
  However, the exact quantity of narcotics procured by Suleman 
and his associates from Pakistan and supplied to the 
drug-peddlers during the past 15 years is not known. The police 
have received information that Suleman and his gang had so far 
carried narcotics worth over Rs 150 crores. 
  The Kutch DSP, Mr. Pramod Kumar, who had carried out the 
interrogation of the accused Suleman, Dawood Kasam, Yunus Dosal, 
Hasan Junus, said that police records reveal that Dawood Kasam 
was nabbed by the police in 1987 and three kg of narcotics 
seized from him. 
  Mr. Kumar also said that the accused had close links with a 
call-girl, Rabia Ibrahim Patni, in Bombay and two Pak nationals, 
Abdul Latif Abdul Gani and Nurmohammed Ibrahim. All three have 
been nabbed by the police.

  [Excerpts] Islamabad -- The National Assembly Monday 
adopted four bills, including the Dangerous Drugs (Amendment) 
Bill, 1994 to provide death penalty to drug traffickers. 
  The bills were passed without any discussion as the 
opposition continued to boycott the session. 
  Stating the objective of the dangerous drugs bill, the 
Interior Minister said it has been tabled to check the menace of 
trafficking of narcotic drugs which has assumed alarming 
situation in the recent years. It is expedient to award capital 
punishment to the criminals involved in offences relating to 
trafficking, or financing the trafficking of heroin or cocaine 
or opium or coca leaf, import into Pakistan, export from 
Pakistan, import or export inter-provincially. 
  The Minister said the bill seeks to achieve that object by 
amending relevant provisions of the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1930, 
to provide death penalty and also to raise the minimum 
punishment of imprisonment. 
  In order to prevent the narcotics smugglers from benefiting 
out of the illegal gains, acquired through narcotics 
trafficking, the bill further seeks to achieve this objective by 
amending relevant provisions of the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1930, 
to provide for forfeiture of assets of a person convicted for 
two years or more. Later the House adopted the bill. 
  The Interior Minister also tabled another bill titled as The 
Prohibition (Enforcement of Hadd Amendment) Bill, 1994, for 
passage. 
  While stating the objective of this bill, the Minister said 
the expression "raw opium" has not been defined in The 
Prohibition (Enforcement of Hadd) Order, 1979 which resulted 
into release of accused. The Federal Shariat Court and the High 
Courts have, therefore, desired an appropriate amendment in the 
statute, the Minister added. The House passed the amended bill 
with voice vote. 
  The House also adopted the Anti-Narcotic Task Force Bill, 
1993 which provides for the constitution of anti-narcotics task 
force. 
  Describing the objectives of the bill, the Interior Minister 
said that with a view to inquiring into and investigating all 
offences relating to, or connected with, preparation, 
production, manufacture, transportation, trafficking or 
smuggling of intoxicants, narcotics and chemicals, precursors or 
reagents used in the manufacture of narcotics or dangerous drugs 
or assets derived therefrom, the Federal government decided to 
constitute an anti- narcotics task force, and empower its 
members with necessary legal powers for the aforesaid purpose. 
  He said the bill seeks the necessary legal frame work for 
constitution of the said anti-narcotics task force, by the 
Federal Government and empower its members with such powers, 
including the powers relating to search, arrest of persons or 
seizure of property and such duties, privileges and liabilities, 
as a police officer has in respect of offences under the Code of 
Criminal procedure, 1898 or any other law for the time being in 
force. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "We Need Full Measures to Eliminate Narcotics"] </F>
  [Text] Among the Benazir government's priorities, in 
addition to establishing law and order, eradicating 
unemployment, is the elimination of narcotic trade and taking 
action against smugglers. Thus, a decision was made to take 
steps to eliminate drug smuggling and the lists prepared during 
the caretaker government were also acquired. This system of drug 
smuggling in Pakistan has been going on for many years. In 
addition to affecting our nation's economy and prosperity, it 
hinders implementation of law and order. It can also prove 
destructive to the new generation. About 12 or 15 years ago, the 
drug abuse was limited to hashish and opium, however, after the 
Soviet interference in Afghanistan, heroin also joined this 
list. Its trade spread because its price has the secret of 
changing people from rags to riches. Therefore, people who 
hanker for money and disregard fear of God use various tricks to 
make money. As the result of it, the drug trade has also reached 
educational institutions and even female students, in addition 
to male students. Although all the Pakistani governments during 
the last few years have taken some steps to end drug smuggling, 
there have been difficulties in totally controlling narcotics 
trade because of involvement of some influential persons in 
drugs, especially hashish and heroin, smuggling. Heroin worth 
millions of rupees is seized every year, however, the persons 
involved in this trade are so influential and they have so many 
contacts that they manage to escape the law. It is hoped that 
the present government which has the mandate from the majority 
of our people will pay attention to this evil without any 
leniency or favoritism, and will leave no stone unturned in 
totally eliminating this evil. Peace-loving citizens and 
patriots will fully cooperate with the government to eradicate 
this curse.

Compartments of a Truck"] 
  [Text] Haripur (MASHRIQ Correspondent). The CIA [Central 
Investigative Agency] of Haripur district on instructions from 
Chowdhery Manzur Ahmed, S.P. of Haripur, have foiled efforts to 
smuggle drugs worth 200,000 rupees during its campaign against 
drug smuggling. As in the past, the criminals managed to flee. 
According to details received here, someone informed that a 
truck, tag number GLT 8926, was being used for smuggling hashish 
and opium. A police party under the leadership of CIA Inspector 
Nasim Afzal Khan was formed. This party established a check 
point at Jamal Flour Mills on Khatar Road. Around 4:00 am the 
truck with tag number GLT 8926 approached that point and the 
police ordered it to stop. The criminals fled the truck. During 
the search of the truck, the police recovered 105 kilogram opium 
and 30 kilogram hashish from hidden compartments and confiscated 
the truck. Investigation has been started to register a case 
against the unknown criminals. The criminals as usual have 
managed to flee. Meanwhile the social and serious circles in 
Haripur have said that if the activities of Haripur district 
police are reviewed, it will be learned that they have not 
succeeded in arresting even one criminal involved in this ugly 
and death-dealing trade.

  [Text] Mirpur Khas, 9 March (Special Correspondent) -- The 
decision to investigate the notorious employees of Mirpur Khas 
Excise department has become a prey to pressure from politicians 
and influential people. It should be remembered that in a 
high-level meeting of the Excise and Taxation department 
recently, the performance of Mirpur Khas was greatly criticized. 
The state minister who presided over the meeting revealed in 
that meeting that employees of Mirpur Khas Excise Department 
were involved in drug smuggling and the ugly trade of drug 
dealing was being carried out in various parts of Mirpur Khas 
under their patronship. The state minister had ordered 
investigation against the employees of Mirpur Khas Excise 
Department. It is said that the employees of the excise 
department allegedly put political pressure to stop the 
investigation against them. It is worth mentioning here that 
journalists had advised Chief Secretary of Sindh Shah Jehan S. 
Karim during his recent visit about the increasing drug trade 
and Mr. Karim had ordered an investigation against corrupt 
employees. It is said that some excise department employees 
applied political pressure and stopped implementation of this 
order.

  [Text] Customs agents at Jeddah's King 'Abd-al-'Aziz 
Airport foiled a major conspiracy to smuggle drugs in the 
intestines of smugglers. They arrested five Pakistanis and one 
Afghan smuggler who concealed drugs in balloons they swallowed. 
Some of them also concealed the drugs in capsules they inserted 
in their anuses. 
  That was only one of repeated smuggler attempts to bring 
those poisons into the Kingdom. 
  But God, and the alertness and vigilance of customs agents, 
precluded those drugs from reaching the hands of citizens. 
  The Customs Department has been alert to the fiendish and 
advanced techniques used by smugglers in their criminal pursuits 
and consequently decreed last Rabi'-al-Awwal month to organize 
an integrated enforcement team that would search for drugs 
concealed in the intestines of smugglers. 
  The al-Jawallah Team [Wayfarers] was organized into three 
squads, each composed of 13 employees and female inspectors. 
  The team has achieved repeated successes in apprehending a 
number of smugglers who arrive into the country carrying 
different kinds of narcotics in their guts. 
  In the main, smugglers conceal drugs, particularly heroin, 
by 
stashing them into balloons, or the like, that they would then 
insert into their intestines. 
  Some 400 such balloons, weighing about 1 kg, have been 
apprehended. Another technique used by smugglers to conceal 
drugs is to insert them into their bodies through the anus by 
introducing capsules and oval objects into the body. There were 
eight such capsules weighing some 300 grams. 
<H5>  Smugglers Dressed in Pilgrimage Garb </H5>
  The [Wayfarers] team apprehended on the last day of the 
blessed month of Ramadan a gang of Pakistani smugglers composed 
of five Pakistanis and one Afghan smuggler. 
  It was discovered that they carried in their intestines a 
number of balloons filled with heroin, as well as other kinds of 
capsules and oval objects. 
  Some of them were dressed in pilgrimage garb in order to 
ward 
off suspicion. 
  AL-MADINAH interviewed Khalaf al-Ghamdi, commander of one of 
the three teams, who reviewed the details of apprehending the 
smugglers and discussed the mission of the team. 
<H5>  Suspicion Starts It All </H5>
  Said al-Ghamdi: 
  "The team was formed in the third month of the year 1413 
Hijra [1992] for the purpose of apprehending only those who 
smuggle drugs in their intestines. We are not concerned with 
those who smuggle by any other means, such as in their valises, 
for example. The technique typically involves swallowing heroin 
by mouth or inserting it through the anus. 
  "The Customs Department decided to organize a team trained 
in 
exposing that method of smuggling. 
  "The team studies passenger documents and scrutinizes their 
bodies then determines if there is cause for suspicion. 
  "We suspect three or four passengers out of every thousand, 
thanks to exacting procedures as well as vigilance and 
concentration by employees highly trained and experienced in 
smuggling detection." 
  Al-Ghamdi went on: 
  "An employee would then take away the passport of the 
suspect 
passenger -- here suspicion rises to about 50 percent -- give 
him a scrutinizing look, and ask him some questions. 
  "At this point, the passenger would show signs of confusion 
and disorientation, and it is by those signs that an employee 
would determine if the passenger is hiding something." 
<H5>  Instruments to Detect Smugglers and Users </H5>
  "Then comes the turn of drug-detection instruments which 
identify what type of narcotic is involved. 
  "Those instruments are capable of detecting not only 
smugglers but also users. 
  "When an instrument signals, we know that smuggling is going 
on, but we don't stop there. We use X rays to make certain." 
<H5>  Fasting Prior to Swallowing Drugs </H5>
  Al-Ghamdi describes the techniques used by smugglers to 
insert contraband into their intestines: 
  "A smuggler fasts for about two days before swallowing the 
drugs. His stomach has to be completely empty or he won't last 
the distance. Then there is the process of evacuation which 
accompanies the stomach functions while producing food digesting 
enzymes. 
  "Once he swallows the drugs, the smuggler lives on liquids 
only without partaking of any food. 
<H5>  Anesthetizing Before Capsule Insertion </H5>
  "As to inserting the contraband through the anus, smugglers 
place the drugs in oval objects or capsules. A smuggler may 
carry seven or eight such capsules. 
  "According to one smuggler, the person who provides him with 
the narcotics keeps him from eating for two days then gives him 
a shot of anesthetics to put him to sleep. Another person then 
inserts those `capsules' or `eggs' into his bowels. 
  "About four hours later, the smuggler wakes up and heads 
directly for the plane he intends to board. He would be at the 
airport for about three hours in addition to flight time. In 
other words, he would carry the drugs in his intestines for 
about 12 hours before arriving in the country." 
<H5>  190 Cases of Smuggling </H5>
  Regarding the weight of the capsules, al-Ghamdi says: 
  "They range in weight from 80 to 300 grams of heroin, 
depending on capsule size, and any one smuggler may carry 
between five and eight capsules. 
  "Balloons, on the other hand, weigh between four and 10 
grams. As to pills --they band six or seven tablets together. 
Some 400 such balloons were apprehended." 
  Since deployment, the [Wayfarers] team has so far foiled 190 
smuggling operations through the intestines.

  [Excerpt] The board of directors of the European Drugs 
Monitoring Center met for the first time this morning at the 
Belem Cultural Center. Mario Rui reports. 
  Rui: The organization has a budget of more than 
900 billion escudos to diagnose, and at least try to control, 
drug trafficking. This is the organization's main objective. 
Much more than monitoring, the center will give the [European] 
Community and its member states objective and reliable 
information which can be studied at a European level so the 
Community can take the necessary measures to reduce drug use, 
production, and trafficking. The organization was set up by the 
Twelve and will be based in Lisbon. [begin recording] 
  Portuguese Deputy Minister Marques Mendes: This is 
above all a political question. Faced with a tragedy of this 
kind, faced with the dimension of this phenomena in Europe and 
in the whole world, faced with the major efforts by the various 
societies, and in view of the small results achieved so far, I 
believe it is not possible for people to turn their backs on 
each other when it comes to this issue. [end recording]

  Operation "Balatum" -- coordinated by the central 
investigation department of the gendarmerie in association with 
national Magistrate Andre Van Doren -- succeeded in inspecting 
two fishing vessels 54 miles off the Belgian coast. "La 
Berceuse," which came back from Morocco and headed for Zeebrugge 
and "L'Orka," a small shrimp-fishing vessel, were boarded during 
a transshipment operation involving a large quantity, 10 tons, 
of hashish with a street value of 1 billion Belgian francs. 
Caught in the act, the crew of the two vessels, the head of the 
operation and 11 accomplices, were arrested and placed at the 
disposal of the examining judge of Bruges. [passage omitted] 
  We can safely assume that all members of the organization's 
Belgian gang have been effectively taken out of circulation.

Against Narcotics Yields Gain"] 
  [Text] Copenhagen: There are still many and large problems 
with narcotics and AIDS in Copenhagen, but it looks like the 
trend is going in the right direction. The municipality of 
Copenhagen still has a widespread and serious narcotics problem, 
and new cases of HIV infection are confirmed daily, but the 
problems are not any longer growing. Nevertheless, it is 
certainly not a rosy picture that the AIDS and Narcotics Council 
gives in its report for 1993. 
  "Our initiatives in the treatment and information side, and 
our condom and needle-exchange programs have borne fruit. The 
situation in Copenhagen is less negative than many other places, 
but it is definitely serious," says Copenhagen Chief Public 
Health Service Physician Claus Lundstedt. 
  In the narcotics area it is particularly falling prices and 
rising consumption of smoking-form heroin that is causing 
concern. But also the group of young people who are in danger of 
becoming addicted have need for concern, according to the 
council report. 
  "We must have more and better treatment services that should 
offer individual treatment plans for each abuser. But if they 
are not motivated to free themselves from their abuse, we aren't 
going to spend money on them," says Lundstedt. 
  The council is trying to find a particular method for 
dealing 
with those drug abusers who are HIV-infected and sick. At the 
same time, a better information campaign will be directed to 
those in socially disadvantaged groups and foreign-language 
speaking groups, whom until now have been more difficult to 
reach. 
  Schoolchildren are to have education on HIV and AIDS, and 
there is going to continue to be free handing out of condoms and 
clean needles. The council is going to try and get better 
statistical data regarding both narcotics and HIV. 
  "There is a huge need for more information, because as it is 
now, we don't have a real insight on the extent of the 
problems," says Lundstedt.

Narcotics Billions"] 
  [Excerpts] Enormous sums are involved when political 
leaders, dealers, police chiefs, the UN, Interpol, and ministers 
discuss how to stop "the global narcotics threat." [passage 
omitted] 
  No one knows the precise number of substance abusers in 
Denmark, but from many sources it seems there are around 10,000 
people who regularly use hard drugs such as heroin, 
amphetamines, and cocaine. Some 4,000 of these reside in 
Copenhagen. But the narcotics problem is no longer only a 
big-city phenomenon. Drugs are appearing in even the smallest 
villages. Most substance abusers make their living from 
trafficking profits. According to Jorgen Green, director of the 
Storstrom County Youth Center, abusers cost society 400 million 
kroner annually for this activity. [passage omitted] 
  The narcotics trade is a billion [kroner] business. A 
cautious estimate assumes an annual street sale of hard drugs 
amounting to at least 1.5 billion kroner. In 1992, the police 
and customs seized 38.5 kg of heroin, 21.5 kg of cocaine, and 
73.6 kg of amphetamines. Around 150 million kroner is used for 
fighting narcotics violations. In Copenhagen alone there are 170 
police officers who are exclusively engaged with narcotics and 
narcotics-related crime. Ninety percent of all telephone taps 
deal with narcotics. Drug abusers are connected with 25-50 
percent of all break-ins. Their damages cost insurance companies 
at least 450 million kroner yearly. [passage omitted] 
  One-fourth of judges' time is devoted to trying people 
charged with drug violations. Around 40 percent of the places in 
Danish prisons are occupied by drug abusers and drug dealers. 
They cost society annually around 350 million kroner. Only a 
very small percentage of those charged are convicted pursuant to 
the drug-kingpin paragraph [in the law code]. By far the most 
have been put behind bars for small-scale pushing, or because 
they have had small amounts of substances in their possession. 
[passage omitted] 
  No one has a purview of the the total amount spent on 
treatment and prevention. But a rough estimate would be around 
at least 350 million kroner for the entire country. In the 
municipality of Copenhagen, which houses approximately half the 
country's treatment places, 64 million kroner have been 
appropriated for counternarcotics efforts in 1994. In addition, 
funds are being spent on ambulatory treatment in physician 
offices and hospital inpatient treatment, and money for this 
purpose is also being provided to privately operated care homes 
and shelters. [passage omitted]

Permitted"] 
  [Text] Karlsruhe -- The possession and consumption of 
hashish and marijuana in small quantities will no longer be 
punishable. In a verdict released yesterday, the Constitutional 
Court in Karlsruhe decided that the authorities must turn a 
blind eye if cannabis products are procured or imported solely 
for occasional private use and if there is no danger to third 
parties. 
  In its decision, the Second Senate failed to specify the 
meaning of "small quantities" and "occasional private use," but 
placed the laender under an obligation to define these terms in 
order to coordinate the procedure for adopting new rules on 
discontinuing criminal proceedings. So far, only 
Schleswig-Holstein has defined these limits. Schleswig-Holstein 
courts consider a "small quantity" to mean up to 30 grams, on 
the assumption that this is a one-week supply for a single 
person. 
  At the same time, the Constitutional Court confirmed the ban 
on drugs as set down in the law on anesthetics, thus rejecting 
seven appeals from German courts that had said that permitting a 
limited use of drugs might not be in conformity with the 
Constitution, especially because of the different way of 
treating hashish and alcohol. 
  According to the Constitutional Court judges, the difference 
in sentences that can be meted out for the misuse of hashish, 
alcohol, and nicotine does not collide with the constitutional 
principle of equality. The misuse of alcohol involves dangers 
similar or even greater than those posed by the misuse of 
hashish and marijuana, but it should be borne in mind that there 
are many possible uses of alcohol, most of them not leading to a 
state of intoxication, whereas in the case of cannabis products, 
intoxication figures in first place. Needless to say, there is 
no "right to be intoxicated." 
  After a long period of time, the number of drug-induced 
deaths in Germany once again clearly increased in the first 
quarter of the year. The Interior Ministry in Bonn said that 
the number of such deaths increased from 343 to 372 against the 
first quarter of 1993, an increase of 8.5 percent. The number 
of first-time consumers of hard drugs went up by 16.8 percent, 
reaching 2,250.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Karlsruhe: Hashish Consumption </F>
Publishable"] 
  [Text] The Constitutional Court has issued a kind of 
commentary about its own ruling on hashish. It described as 
"groundless" reports that it had approved the consumption of 
hashish. The Court explained that it had declared the ban on 
drugs and all drug-related offenses to be in keeping with the 
constitution. However, lenient sentences may be applied to 
minor offenses. The Court further explained: "Law-enforcement 
bodies must in principle discontinue with prosecution if hashish 
is only consumed in small quantities for private consumption, 
and without danger to third parties." The Court considers terms 
such as "free of punishment" or "approval" to be wrong, because 
in a legal sense, the consumption of hashish and marijuana 
remains punishable. The Court has merely forbidden the 
prosecution of petty consumers of hashish in certain 
circumstances; therefore, in ordinary language, such persons 
remain free of punishment.

<F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Manfred Kanther by </F>
Klaus-Peter Siegloch on 1 May; Kanther in the studio in Mainz -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] Siegloch: This ruling [by the 
Constitutional Court about making the use of small amounts of 
hashish and marijuana not punishable by law] has been criticized 
by a particularly great number of politicians from the Christian 
Democratic Union/Christian Social Union. So far, you have not 
said anything. Do you agree with it? 
  Kanther: One should comment on a ruling as soon 
as one has read it in its entirety. I note that this debate is 
going on without anybody having read it in its entirety, because 
the most important item of the ruling is the confirmation that 
the use of all drugs, including cannabis products, is punishable 
by law. The motions brought by administrative courts against 
that have been rejected by the Federal Constitutional Court. 
  Then there is the statement, which has not yet been 
detailed, 
that in individual cases, where the possession of small amounts 
of drugs is involved, punishment can be ignored. This is 
nothing new, this is already legal practice now. 
  This has led to a political debate about the question of 
releasing hashish for general consumption. I think this debate 
is disastrous. Hashish must not be generally available. The 
Federal Government is completely clear on that. I will 
certainly not say today the opposite of what I said last week. 
The inhibition thresholds for drug consumption, in particular 
among young people, must not be lowered but must be kept high. 
  Siegloch: Mr. Kanther, this is your political 
view. However, the ruling -- or at least that part which has 
been published so far -- sounds as if this offense remains 
punishable but is no longer prosecuted. This gives the message 
to the public that now practically anyone can use hashish, one 
just must not deal with hashish. 
  Kanther: I think that this message is dangerous. 
I do not criticize an individual ruling by the Constitutional 
Court here. I say that this is not the policy of the Federal 
Government. The Federal Government's policy is quite clear -- 
making any kind of trafficking and possession of any kind of 
drugs punishable by law, while knowing that, given the frequency 
of drug abuse, it is impossible to punish every single case, 
and, in particular in the case of possession for one's own 
consumption, punishment need not be imposed because there are 
other forms of education and help and social or educational 
influence on the addicts. All this -- this social and 
educational aspect -- is undisputed. However, in the end the 
possession and dealing with drugs must remain punishable.

<F P=106> [Hans-Werner Loose report: "Criticism of Hashish Release"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn -- The decision of the FRG Constitutional 
Court in Karlsruhe to no longer make the use of small amounts of 
hashish and marijuana a punishable offense has given rise to 
harsh reactions from politicians and society. Above all, 
politicians of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] and the 
Christian Social Union [CSU] criticized the decision. Doctors 
and criminal police officers also fear that the wrong 
conclusions might be drawn from the decision. Approval came 
from the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]. 
  State Secretary Eduard Lintner (CSU), drug commissioner of 
the Federal Government, sees "a danger that the state will 
suffer a setback in the struggle against drugs." The Karlsruhe 
ruling is "a wrong signal and a hard blow to all our efforts for 
prevention, which I have to overcome," Lintner told DIE WELT. 
  Angela Merkel (CDU), minister of women and youth, fears 
"that 
young people now think that hashish is permitted and believe it 
is not any more harmful than a filter cigarette." Mrs. Merkel 
told DIE WELT: "Hashish and marijuana are and remain entrance 
drugs, whose danger is played down far too often." 
  Karsten Vilmar, president of the Federal Doctors' Chamber, 
warned against drawing the wrong conclusion from the ruling. It 
might give rise to the impression that hashish is harmless and 
therefore be made generally available. 
  Eckart Fiedler, manager of the Association of Employees' 
Health Insurance Companies, fears "cost increases, which we have 
to pass on to the 27 million people insured with us." Fiedler 
told DIE WELT that the ruling "runs counter to the 
responsibility to promote health and undermines our efforts." 
He demands "to continue the massive struggle against entrance 
drugs." 
  The Federation of German Criminal Police Officers (BDK) 
think 
that "the path embarked upon here" leads "in the end to the 
complete release of all drugs and the addiction of broad strata 
of the population, in particular young people." Says the BDK: 
"If all problems with which the rule-of-law state is unable to 
cope were dealt with in this way, break-ins would soon have to 
be exempt from punishment, too." 
  In contrast, Kurt Weidmann, parliamentary manager of the 
Hesse SPD Landtag groups, said that the decision of Karlsruhe is 
an "important contribution and courageous step toward 
decriminalization." 
  The Federal Office of Criminal Investigations [BKA] in 
Wiesbaden does not see a change, even though statistics indicate 
this trend: 1,738 drug deaths in 1993 -- 361 fewer than in 
1992; 14,346 first consumers of hard drugs -- 1,296 fewer than 
in 1992; 1,095 kg of heroin seized -- 143 kg less than in 1992; 
11,352 kg of cannabis products seized -- 814 kg less than in 
1992. However, the trend this year is going upward again. 
  Because of the high figure of unknown incidents, the BKA is 
certain: "Drugs are available on the German drug market in 
sufficient quantities." 
  The drug experts in Wiesbaden know: "Small-scale smuggling 
from the Netherlands to Germany continues unabated." The fast 
trains from The Hague via Venlo to Duisburg or the Eurocity 
train "Piet Mondrian" from Amsteradam via Emmerich to Cologne 
have long been called "Hashish Express." Last year 620 kg of 
hashish and 56 kg of marijuana were seized at the Dutch-German 
border. Cannabis can be bought legally for 10 gilders per gram 
in any of the 1,365 "coffieshops," which have an annual turnover 
of 600 million marks. 
  The Justice Ministry in The Hague welcomes the ruling of the 
German Constitutional Court: "We are in favor of coordinating 
the policy of the various countries as much as possible."

<F P=106> [Anna Tomforde report: "Possession of Cannabis is Legalised </F>
in Germany"] 
  [Text] Germany's Constitutional Court legalised the 
possession of small amounts of hashish or marijuana yesterday. 
  The decision follows a growing number of cases in which 
lower 
courts have refused to enforce laws banning the possession and 
use of cannabis. 
  It brings Germany into line with other European countries 
notably Holland. "It is an important legal and political signal 
because it marks the withdrawal of criminal law from sections of 
drugs policy," Wolfgang Neskovic, a Lubeck judge, said yesterday. 
  It was his court which, in 1991, refused to sentence a woman 
accused of smuggling 1.12 grammes of hashish to her husband in 
prison. 
  "The ruling only adjusts the legal situation to reality," 
one 
expert said yesterday. 
  It calls on Germany's federal states to harmonise laws on 
drug possession, which vary widely between conservative and 
social democrat-ruled states. In the future, possession of 
"small quantities of cannabis for occasional personal use" will 
not be punishable. Trading and possession of larger amounts will 
remain punishable by fines. 
  Interior ministry figures show that 1,207 kg of hashish were 
confiscated in Germany in the first three months of this year, 
double the amount seized during the same period in 1993. 
  Professor Winfried Hassemer of Frankfurt university said the 
hashish ban had encouraged a thriving black market and led to 
"enormous profit margins" for organised crime. 
  While some commentators warned yesterday that the ruling had 
neglected the "damaging social repercussions" of hashish use, 
others stressed that alcohol and nicotine were far more serious 
hazards. 
  The point was also taken up by the Constitutional Court, 
which recognised that the dangers inherent in alcohol abuse 
"equalled and sometimes even exceeded" those of cannabis 
consumption. But, the court added, the difference was that with 
alcohol "intoxication is not the prime aim". 
  Statistics show that Germany has 3 million alcoholics, 
800,000 people dependent on medication and 120,000 drug addicts.

<F P=106> [Heribert Prantl commentary: "A Light Tail Wind From </F>
Karlsruhe"] 
  [Text] The German police no longer believe in punishment 
for drugs, and are giving up chasing petty drug pushers. They 
refuse to do senseless things like prosecuting drug addicts. 
This can clearly be seen from the (not yet published) crime 
figures for 1993, which show that the number of recorded drug 
offenses in the north German lands is sinking dramatically. In 
Schleswig-Holstein, drug-related crime has fallen by 33.4 
percent. That is not at all because drug addiction has 
disappeared there. It is primarily because the police are no 
longer chasing petty drug offenders. That has been the case for 
several years now regarding the consumption of soft drugs, and 
has applied to hard drugs since 1993. Only in Bavaria, where 
the police are under pressure from conservative-repressive 
politics, do police figures on drug offenses show an increase. 
  German juvenile court judges and juvenile lawyers have also 
had enough. They consider the drug policy up to now to have 
been a failure, and say it is wrong to turn drug addicts into 
criminals. At their first federal-level meeting in December 
1993, they called for the free dispensation of drugs. The 
juvenile judges observe on a day-to-day basis that one cannot 
heal sick people by means of punishment, and that a therapy 
ordained under compulsion seldom works. That means that the 
prosecution of drug-addicts only helps the dealer-Mafia, who 
force a drug addict, who needs 250 German marks worth of drugs a 
day, into crime. However, the legislators' panic-ridden fear of 
anything connected with liberalization has prevented a revision 
of drugs policy until now. 
  The thought-provoking practice of courts and judges was 
based 
on the assumption that the Federal Court would approve of it, 
that it would supply a tail wind. It was expected that the 
Court would abolish criminal proceedings at least in cases 
involving the soft drug hashish. However, the wind that came 
from Karlsruhe yesterday is no wind of change, merely a light 
breeze. The Constitutional Court judges did not lift the ban on 
hashish. Neither did they nullify the law governing the use of 
anesthetics. They merely called for a more restrained 
consumption. Regarding the private consumption of hashish, 
punishment will be applied less than has been the case until 
now. This involves restrained, cautious sentences, but 
certainly not a general green light for the drugs policy 
currently in force. The judges merely said that the code of 
punishment for drugs is not so harsh that it can be considered 
unconstitutional. Constitutionally, it is still "acceptable" 
for the legislators to abide by their previous concept of 
repression. But that also means that they are free to revise 
their way of thinking. 
  Revising their way of thinking includes a recognition of the 
fact that drug addicts are, first and foremost, sick people. It 
also includes a recognition of the fact that crime in Germany 
would immediately fall by 10 to 20 percent if these sick people 
were treated instead of being turned into criminals.

<F P=106> [Article by Noel Smith: "&pound;20m Cannabis Smuggling Duo </F>
Jailed for 10 Years"] 
  [Text] A Dutchman and Belgian national who tried to smuggle 
cannabis worth &pound;20m into Ireland were yesterday jailed for 
10 
years. 
  Judge Kevin O'Higgins at Tralee also sentenced them to seven 
years for being in possession of the drug on the same date. The 
sentences are to run concurrently and date from the time of 
arrest last July. 
  The judge refused an application for a certificate of leave 
to appeal but granted free legal aid in the event of appeal. 
  He ordered the forfeiture to the State of the luxury yacht, 
the Brime and said that the yacht could be used by the Navy as 
they saw fit. 
  A jury had found Egbertus Marius van Onzen (36) of 
Amsterdam, 
Holland, and Frank Loopmans (31) of Antwerp, Belgium, guilty on 
Wednesday night of possessing the drug and of intent to supply 
it. 
  The trial, the longest in living memory in Kerry, was in its 
fourth week and the jury of eight men and four women had 
deliberated for more than 3-1/2 hours. 
  Judge O'Higgins described the charges as extremely serious. 
He paid tribute to the Irish naval service which, he said, had 
distinguished itself and showed great competence, skill and 
courage. The judge had heard during the trial of the key part 
played by the LE Orla under the command of Lieutenant Commander 
Mark Mellett. 
  He also singled out for special mention Garda Sergeant 
Christopher McCarthy, stationed at Finglas, Dublin, for his 
courage and bravery during the arrest of the Brime. 
  The crime, said Judge O'Higgins, appeared to have been 
committed on purely commercial motives and it seemed to him that 
the accused were very seriously involved. However, there were 
obviously bigger fish elsewhere in relation to the crime. 
  Garda Inspector Jim Fitzgerald told the court that van Onzen 
was born in 1957, one of a family of 11. He was living on board 
a vessel in Amsterdam and with three other people had joined the 
crew of the Brime. They were offered Stg &pound;50,000 to do the 
job. 
  There was no record of a previous conviction. He had been in 
custody since July 13. 
  Loopmans was born in 1963. He had three brothers and one 
sister and his mother said he had only become involved after a 
number of business ventures floundered.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Deaths From Heroin Drop From 1,217 </F>
to 840"] 
  [Text] Rome -- Less heroin, more cocaine, especially 
synthetics -- these are drug addicts' preferences, according to 
the 1993 report published by the "carabinieri's" anti-drug 
force. The NAD's [narcotics squads] seized 15,000 XTC [ecstasy] 
tablets and 3,000 LSD stamps -- substances which were 
practically absent from the market in previous years. Synthetic 
drugs are in fact cheaper (a tablet costs between 50,000 and 
80,000 lire [L], compared to L120,000-150,000 for a heroin 
dose). According to the "carabinieri," the increase in the use 
of synthetic drugs explains the reduction in the number of 
deaths from overdose, which dropped from 1,217 in 1992 to 840 in 
1993. Furthermore, the NAD's determined that most of the drugs 
came from the Netherlands and their price, at the source, was in 
the region of L2,000-3,000. Milan, Genoa, Verona, and Rome are 
the major distribution centers. 
  Yesterday the NAD's exposed a Milan woman doctor who had 
been 
issuing morphine prescriptions -- in the form of hydrochloride 
syrup -- to 35 drug addicts, many of whom had criminal records. 
The prescriptions were made out in the name of a person who had 
died some time before. Over a three-year period, from 1990 to 
1992, she signed 1,600 prescriptions for as many bottles. This 
doctor's case is not an isolated one: In the course of the 
police operation, more than 1,000 people were arrested, 
including 11 medical doctors; 1,584 people were arrested and 
subsequently released on bail (including 357 doctors and 
chemists); and 598 kilograms of drugs were seized.

<F P=106> [Report by Grania Langdon-Down, Crime Correspondent, PA News] </F>
  [Text] The largest seizure of cocaine in the UK, valued at 
250 million pounds sterling, was found in drums of bitumen on 
its way from South America to Poland, it was disclosed today. 
  The 1,300 kilos of particularly high purity cocaine were 
discovered in a consignment of 48 drums by officers who searched 
a ship when it called in at Birkenhead, Merseyside, on January 
24. 
  Customs officers removed the cocaine and substituted other 
drums on board the Polish-American ship the MV Jurata, which was 
en route from Venezuela to Poland, and tracked it to Gdynia 
hoping to identify the smugglers, chief investigations officer 
Douglas Tweddle said today. 
  One man is being interviewed by Polish police after the 
drums 
were delivered to a warehouse on the outskirts of Warsaw on 
February 3, but customs officers were not able to identify the 
Western European figures behind the deal. 
  Mr. Tweddle said: "This massive seizure confirms 
intelligence 
reports that the South American `narco barons' are targeting 
cocaine shipments on Western Europe and are seeking to use South 
American countries as a back door. 
  "We are delighted to have been able to work with the Polish 
authorities to inflict this major blow on these drug 
traffickers." 
  Customs believe some of the cocaine would have filtered on 
to 
the streets of the UK. 
  Forty officers were involved in Operation Ayala, named after 
a racehorse which ran in the Grand National. 
  Customs identified the shipping route from South America to 
former Soviet states as a likely path for cocaine shipments. 
  Based on that intelligence they decided to carry out an 
intensive search of the MV Jurata's load. The crew of the ship 
were not involved and the substitute drums were sent on 
unnoticed. 
  It is the second large seizure of cocaine being routed by 
the 
South American cartels to Poland. UK customs tipped off Polish 
authorities about another consignment which led to 520 kilos of 
cocaine being seized in Poland. 
  Suspicion had fallen on 48 barrels of bitumen found in the 
drums. The first one was genuine but the other 47 had inner 
containers each packed with up to 30 kilos of cocaine. 
  They had been insulated to protect the drugs from the heat 
of 
the bitumen. 
  Mr. Tweddle said in early January they had been able to 
identify a separate consignment travelling direct from South 
America to Poland which enabled the authorities there to seize 
520 kilos of cocaine. 
  The two operations meant the authorities had prevented two 
tonnes of cocaine with a UK street value of 400 million pounds 
sterling flooding on to the western European market. 
  "There is little doubt some of it would have ended up in 
Britain, probably via Germany and Holland. We hope this success 
will act as a catalyst for further ones in the future," Mr. 
Tweddle said at the Customs House in London. 
  He said the Jurata was a "tramp steamer" which had stopped 
off at Birkenhead to unload some legitimate cargo. It had then 
stopped at Hamburg before completing its journey to Poland. 
  The seizure was the largest, not only in the UK, but also in 
central and eastern Europe. There have been bigger hauls in 
Spain and Holland. 
  "With the collapse of the former Soviet Union, the Customs 
services in central and eastern Europe are not particularly well 
developed and traffickers see places like Poland and Russia as 
an easy back door to western Europe," he said. 
  The previous biggest UK haul -- 907 kilos -- was discovered 
two years. [sentence as received]

"Amphetamine Seizures Rise by Over 300 Per Cent"] 
  [Text] Almost a tonne of amphetamine tablets and powder 
were seized by police and customs last year, according to the 
National Criminal Intelligence Service. 
  At least half the total of 995 kilos was seized by customs 
officers, an increase of 342 per cent on 1992. But the majority 
of the 5,000 individual seizures were made by police inside the 
country. 
  Although 90 per cent of the drugs were manufactured in 
Continental Europe, particularly Holland, illicit amphetamine 
"laboratories" were uncovered in Britain. 
  It is now estimated that one in 10 people aged 16-29 has 
tried amphetamines at least once. 
  While amphetamines and cannabis remain the most frequently 
misused drugs, crack cocaine is the one most closely associated 
with extreme violence. 
  Crack users and dealers committed 10 murders and 21 
attempted 
murders in London alone last year, according to an NCIS survey. 
  Police are also concerned about the increasing use of 
injected steroids. While not illegal, there were many examples 
of users committing rape, extreme domestic violence and other 
forms of serious assault. 
  Other seizure figures were: 
  Cannabis customs officers seized 53,145 
kilogrammes of cannabis, up 19 per cent on 1992, while police 
discovered 5,600 kilogrammes, a rise of 21 per cent. 
  A relatively new and highly potent form of cannabis known as 
"skunk" is becoming much more widely available, police said. It 
is up to 30 times as powerful as normal cannabis resin and 
produces a strong hallucinogenic reaction. 
  Cocaine seizures fell sharply. This was largely 
due to the statistically distorting effect of two extra large 
seizures in 1992. Demand was not thought to have dropped. 
  Customs officers seized a total of 750 kilos, a fall of 
nearly 70 per cent from the 2,250 kilos recorded during 1992 
which included two of about a ton each. Police seized about 20 
kilos, a rise of 28 per cent on 1992. 
  Crack seizures are becoming more widespread 
outside London, making up about 50 per cent of the seizures at 
street level. The weight of seizures rose by more than 90 per 
cent to 2.8 kilos, a new record. 
  Heroin seizures rose by a quarter to 560 
kilogrammes, another 120 kilogrammes was seized on the streets, 
an 88 per cent rise largely influenced by a single seizure of 37 
kilogrammes in London. 
  The average street purity was about 28 per cent, with the 
most common cutting agents being paracetamol and caffeine. The 
latest figures for addiction related to 1992. 
  They show an increase of 19 per cent on the previous year 
with a total of 24,703 registered addicts, of whom 9,663 were 
newly notified. Twelve per cent were addicted to cocaine. 
  LSD seizures fell by 11 per cent. But the total 
still amounted to 275,000 doses.

<F P=106> [Article by Stewart Tendler, crime correspondent: "Drug </F>
Police Fear Rise in DIY Cannabis"] 
  [Text] A potent home-grown variety of cannabis is making 
rapid inroads into the underground drugs market, according to 
the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS). 
  The NCIS annual drugs survey, issued yesterday, reports that 
20 production sites for "skunk" were found in Britain last year, 
mainly in Wales. Police discovered anything from a hundred to a 
thousand plants being grown in basements and garages, using 
hydroponics and market gardening techniques such as high 
intensity lighting. 
  The plants grow more quickly than cannabis cultivated out of 
doors. Growers can produce cannabis worth &pound;2,500 to 
&pound;4,000 
from a metre of cultivated plants. The conditions give the 
plants very high concentrations of THC, the active chemical, 
which produces effects similar to LSD. 
  Stuart Wesley, director of the drugs division at NCIS, said 
there was concern at the increasing appearance of skunk. In 
Holland, skunk plants supply 20 to 50 per cent of cannabis 
consumed in coffee houses and are said to be second only to 
tulip cultivation in Dutch agriculture. 
  Skunk is part of an intensifying drugs scene. Police are 
making recorded seizures of amphetamines, and 31 murders or 
attempted murders in London last year were linked to crack 
cocaine. There are also fears that steroid abuse is growing. The 
Home Office is considering whether steroid drugs should be 
controlled by misuse of drugs legislation. 
  Det. Chief Supt Tony White, head of the NCIS drugs policy 
unit, said that there was evidence of steroid users starting to 
mix with the main drugs underworld. One research project into 
needle exchange programmes had shown steroid users accounted for 
28 per cent of the clients. 
  The NCIS figures show that cannabis remains the most popular 
drug and last year 58,000 kilograms were seized. Amphetamines 
are the second favourite and in 1993 seizures rose by 65 per 
cent to 995 kg. Police also found 18 illicit amphetamine 
laboratories. 
  The survey reports that crack cocaine is appearing more 
frequently outside London and makes up half of all cocaine 
seizures, which last year fell by 70 per cent from 2,250 kg in 
1992 to 750: the high 1992 figure was caused by two very large 
seizures. Discoveries of heroin rose by 88 per cent to 120 kg.

<F P=106> [Article by Anthea Hall: "In Provincial Areas, Young People </F>
Are Mixing Narcotic Cocktails -- With Fatal Results: Drug 
Culture Gets Grip on Small Towns"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Police raids on suspected 
drug-dealers in Blyth, on the Northumberland coast, are becoming 
more and more frequent. 
  But not frequent enough, according to distraught parents 
whose children have been involved with or killed by drugs: 
"They're blaming the kids for taking cocktails of drugs -- but 
why are the drugs available in the first place?" says Janet 
Murphy, whose daughter Jennie Hindhaugh, 16, is the fifth young 
person to die from drugs in Blyth in the last two years. 
  Blyth, a once prosperous port, is a dignified town which 
seems to hold its head high in the face of economic decline. It 
is a town where old ladies are safe in the street and there is 
little violence except domestic punch-ups. But now it has a 
reputation for a flourishing petty drug culture that corrupts 
and kills. 
  Blyth's new infamy came to national attention when Mrs. 
Murphy published a photo of her dying daughter, on a 
life-support machine. With it she published one of the formerly 
vibrant Jennie as a champion gymnast. 
  In Operation Crackdown last week -- an exercise to reassure 
the public of police concern over drug dealers -- the 30 
detectives in the South East Northumberland CID spent each 
weekday from 7 AM until 11 AM raiding the houses of suspected 
dealers. 
  Out of 42 warrants, they scored 28 successes. The collection 
of small amounts of various drugs and bizarre items of drug 
paraphernalia showed what a small, squalid industry it is: "We 
found five grams of heroin recently, which was our biggest hit 
for months. There's nobody in Blyth with an ounce of heroin, no 
major dealers here," Det. Chief Inspector Ken Anderson said. 
  So how can such a small-time drug culture have such a 
devastating effect? 
  The death roll -- Beverley Nesbitt, 19, Suzanne Calvert, 16, 
Steven Tait, 30, Tracey Cavner, 21, and Jennie Hindhaugh, 16, -- 
reveals one obvious disturbing factor. Apart from Steven, a 
heroin addict, these were young girls who died from random 
mixtures of drugs. The popular term "cocktails," implying some 
kind of party chic, is misleading. 
  The reality is sordid and pathetic. Whereas heroin dealing 
has a strictly professional aspect to it, the random cocktail is 
the result of low-level drug dealing, often from kids who have 
burgled chemists' shops and who sell unnamed drugs in clubs on 
Saturday nights to girls looking for excitement. [passage

<F P=106> [Article by Ian Burrell: "Drug-Free Zones Set Up in Jails"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Drugs are now so widely available in British 
prisons that drug-free wings are being established. They will 
allow inmates a refuge from the dangers of addiction and 
drug-related violence. 
  Prisoners are only allowed into the wings if they sign 
contracts agreeing to abstain from drugs and alcohol and to 
provide urine samples for testing. 
  The number of drug finds inside prisons increased by more 
than 50 percent to 4,585 last year. Michael Howard, the home 
secretary, has identified drug abuse as one of the most serious 
problems facing the prison service. [passage omitted] 
  The setting up of the drugs-free wings is partly a response 
to a report on Long Lartin by Judge Stephen Tumim, the chief 
inspector of prisons, in December 1992. This said: "The prison 
was suffering from an epidemic of hard drug-taking. Incidents of 
discovery of large quantities of drugs were frequent, while 
stories of substance abuse abounded." It added: "Homemade 
`hooch' was sometimes consumed in front of the staff, yet prison 
rules expressly forbid prisoners to have any intoxicating 
liquor." [passage omitted] 
  If the scheme is a success, inmates from other prisons may 
be 
allowed to request transfers to the drug-free wing at Long 
Lartin. 
  At Swaleside prison, a medium-to-high risk jail on the Isle 
of Sheppey in Kent, a similar scheme is due to start in May. 
  Other jails are monitoring the scheme with a view to 
establishing their own drug-free wings. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Yuriy Shcherban] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 28 Apr -- A two-day conference at the 
Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs [MVD] of directorates and 
departments engaged in the struggle against drug dealing and 
drug addiction representing the internal affairs bodies of 14 
states -- the former republics of the USSR (only a 
representative of Tajikistan was missing) -- ended today. 
  Aleksandr Sergeyev, head of the directorate of the Ministry 
of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation for combatting 
illegal drug dealing, told journalists that the conference had 
discussed basic areas of cooperation. 
  In reply to a question from an ITAR-TASS correspondent, 
Sergeyev said that in 1993 in Russia there were about 53,000 
crimes connected with drug addiction or illegal drug dealing -- 
83 percent more than in the 1980's. In 1993, 53 tonnes of 
narcotic substances had been confiscated, and 500,000 people had 
been charged.

<F P=106> [Vitaliy Tyshkevich article: "Their Drugs Barons Will Not </F>
Turn Up in the Russian Market. We Have Enough of Our Own" -- 
from the "Retsept" section] 
  [Text] We have recently seen in the mass media 
increasingly frequent forecasts that Russia is destined to turn 
more or less into an international market for the sale of drugs 
in the near future. How accurate is this claim? Let us turn 
for comment to criminal specialists engaged in this area and 
doctors specializing in drug abuse, and also see what some 
foreign publications have to say. 
  In the opinion of experts from the Russian MVD [Ministry of 
Internal Affairs] Department for Struggle Against the Spread of 
Drugs, the appearance of international criminal syndicates in 
our country's market in the near future is impossible for two 
reasons. First, the prices for the imported "goods" are so high 
that they will be beyond the domestic "consumer's" reach: For 
example, a gram of cocaine costs about $100. Second, Russia and 
the CIS countries are themselves capable of becoming vendors of 
the raw materials for drugs production and are already doing so: 
For example, Chu and Amur hemp, from which hashish is made, 
differs very little in its properties from the equivalent 
commodity which the international cartels are buying up in the 
countries of the "golden triangle." 
  Apart from this, Russian drugs dealers are not allowing 
their 
foreign competitors to penetrate their market: After all, drug 
dealing is becoming one of the most profitable businesses, 
ranking second after arms dealing. What is more, we are talking 
not just about natural substances but also about synthetic drugs 
used in medicine. 
  There are quite a few confirmations of this. You only have 
to recall the "Olainefarm" affair [editorial note: this is a 
reference to a major seizure of amphetamines produced at the 
Latbiofarm pharmaceutical plant in Olaine, Latvia in December 
1992] which caused a sensation some time ago. Ilmars Penke, 
director of the collapsed pharmaceutical giant, began to produce 
amphetamine, a stimulant which is classified as a narcotic all 
over the world. Then the unlicensed sale of this drug to 
Germany began. As a result Penke was arrested by Interpol's 
German agency. A second example is this: A St. Petersburg 
medicinal compounds plant mastered the industrial production of 
ephedrine -- a drug for asthmatics from which you can make a 
cheap narcotic, the so-called "dzhef" [an ephedrine derivative], 
at home. 
  The following is a very recent example. Not long ago, in the 
settlement of Kupavna (Moscow Oblast), the garage of Ivan 
Tyulyayev, director of the "Akrikhin" Chemical and 
Pharmaceutical Combine, burned down. Before this, several 
attacks had been made on his property, and there are always 
these genuine, imported mafia cars with their zonked young 
drivers parked outside the plant. Ivan Ivanovich himself stated 
to the militia on several occasions that he is being threatened 
and pushed into illegal activities. 
  All these details were received from the MVD. 
  But what are Western journalists writing about this matter 
of 
concern to us? The following details are to be found in the 
journal MEDICINE REVIEW. It emerges that cheap and particularly 
toxic drugs of unknown origin -- hallucinogens as a rule -- have 
recently been appearing on the U.S. and European drugs markets. 
The number of cases of clinical intoxication has increased with 
their appearance. The article also presents figures: The 
number of people poisoned by narcotic substances in the United 
States rose from 1,234 a month (in 1985) to 10,345 people a 
month (in 1992 when, it is believed, a massive expansion of the 
narcotics market began from CIS countries). 
  But their drug addicts are ultimately their own problem. But 
to what degree are the rumors about the spread of their opium to 
our market justified? From a set of figures provided to us by 
the State Drug-Abuse Center, you can clearly discern the group 
of users of this potion in this country. On the whole what we 
have here are examples of multiple drug addiction. Moreover, 
our drug addicts use substances whose narcotic properties are 
simply beyond the imagination of people in the West. So the 
doctors' opinion coincides precisely with that of the law 
enforcement agencies -- the Medellin or any other cartel will 
never break into the Russian market as a vendor.

<F P=106> [Article by Irina Timofeyeva: "A Quiet War With Invisible </F>
Victims: Over the First Quarter Novosibirsk Militia Confiscated 
Almost Half a Tonne of Drugs"] 
  [Text] She got very scared; this was obvious to 
experienced operatives from the department for combating illegal 
drug distribution. And of course she did! She had spent several 
days on a train. Could not sleep properly -- kept watching this 
milk can; she would have put it under the pillow, but this was 
not possible -- honey would spill out. She just walked into the 
hotel room; just breathed a sigh of relief. And then everything 
collapsed instantly. Here it is, this milk can on the table -- 
there are three kilograms of raw opium in it, hidden in the 
honey. In monetary terms -- more than R40 million. Outside her 
window, free, city sparrows were chirping welcoming the spring, 
while she was facing... 
  ...Novosibirsk Oblast is among the 10 regions in Russia 
where 
due to the activism of antidrug departments registered 
drug-related crime is on the rise. There is no contradiction in 
this. Illegal distribution of drugs -- growing, manufacturing, 
transporting, storing, and distributing -- are a latent -- in 
other words, hidden -- crime. (Alas, drug use has been taken off 
the list of criminal offenses during the past few years). This 
means that the better the operatives' work is organized, the 
more the personnel are informed -- the higher the figures. Over 
the last three months of last year, 302 criminal cases were 
initiated; now there are 470 over the first quarter. This is 
against the background of an overall decline in the crime rate. 
Almost half a tonne of drugs (marijuana, poppy straw, and so on) 
have been confiscated, as compared to 1,200 kg over all of last 
year. Including 15 kg of raw opium. Calculate the value, keeping 
in mind that one kg costs R15 million. Also confiscated: 400 kg 
of controlled substances -- narcotics, hallucinogenics, or 
substances enhancing the effect of real medicines 
(tranquilizers, antidepressants, etc.). Despite the ban, they 
are still sold in the streets and in commercial kiosks. Where 
does it all come from at a time when there are not enough drugs 
in hospitals, and some are not in pharmacies -- or if they are, 
it is at prices beyond anybody's reach? The old supply and 
distribution disbalance is playing into the hands of those who 
make money on anything. 
  To win the battle against drug dealers, one must have, using 
modern terminology, a data bank. "We control the situation in 
the sphere of drug use," is the simple explanation given by one 
of the senior people in the department. Criminal investigation 
goes from crime to a criminal. In the Department for Combating 
Illegal Drug Distribution [ONON], they go from a criminal to 
crime. Naturally, the woman with the milk can was "escorted" all 
the way to the hotel room. About a month ago there was a 
burglary in an apartment in Leninskiy Rayon. The owner of the 
apartment was messed up so badly that he did not make it to the 
hospital. Several hours later a suspect was detained: The trail 
had started with the victim who was known in the drug addicts 
circles. 
  Approximately 40 percent of the pot consumed by Novosibirsk 
drug addicts is manufactured within the oblast. Which is not 
surprising, since poppy does grow here, as well as hemp, which 
has contaminated 27,000 hectares. Nobody is in a hurry to remove 
it -- rural residents are busy with other things, and the 
militia has limited resources. The transparency of so-called 
borders, plus being at a crossroads, attracts drug business from 
Central Asia, the Caucasus, and Ukraine. It is brought most 
often by train or car. In increasingly larger consignments. Only 
a year ago one kg was considered a large consignment. In January 
almost 12 kg were confiscated from just one courier. It is not 
rare to encounter consignments of eight, five, four kg. In 
specialists' opinion, the bulk of raw opium (one gram of which 
is equivalent both in effect and in cost to a cup of poppy 
straw) is brought from Afghanistan through Tajikistan. 
  I have heard the opinion expressed that militia efforts to 
combat the drug business only increase it. It does not make 
sense, they say, to catch small-time dealers because others take 
their place. It is a superficial and erroneous opinion. ONON 
works in different directions. A one-time catch of three kg of 
opium is not a small-time deal. In some operations just one 
seller unloads the drugs to 100 or more buyers. They get 
registered, and the seller will face a trial. Drugs cost money, 
and a drug addict as a rule does not work. The more distributors 
are isolated, the fewer the number of mercenary-type crimes. The 
department has an interrayon unit for investigation of general 
drug-related crimes. There were 100 of them solved in the first 
quarter. More than 20 units of firearms uncovered, not counting 
ammunition. In one commercial kiosk, together with marijuana 
they found two shrapnel grenades. A gun disguised as a pen was 
found in possession of a female drug seller. One charge was 
sufficient to kill a person. The next day, a home-made revolver 
was found. A certain T., who has committed 16 apartment 
burglaries and an assault, was detained. 
  Almost half a tonne of confiscated drugs has a street value 
of R410 million -- this is just for three months. This is the 
amount taken out of criminal circulation. This means that this 
money will not be used to support crime bosses; will not be used 
to set up organized groups and gangs; will not be used to 
purchase arms or hire contract killers. And these millions, 
which is also important, will not have flown to near-abroad 
countries, where they are like dollars for us -- hard currency. 
Because over a three-month period criminal charges were brought 
against 54 couriers and distributors from the former republics. 
  What is the prognosis? The demand -- which means the supply 
-- will keep growing. Increasingly, more young people and 
teenagers get drawn into the horrible game. A drug addict does 
not live long. He is lucky if he makes it to 40. Drug-related 
crime committed by juveniles last year increased by more than 20 
percent as compared to 1992, and over three months of this year, 
by 19 percent. Crime committed in the state of drug intoxication 
is on the rise. As a rule, distributors do not use their own 
goods. Of more than 300 persons (80 of them women) charged with 
distribution of drugs, only two had previous convictions. Fresh 
people -- which means that the drug business does not surrender 
its positions. There is also a trend toward the use of synthetic 
drugs, which destroy a person 20-100 times faster. 
Trimethylphentanil, one gram of which is enough to make 1,000 
doses, and crack have not yet reached us. Choice drugs cost 
incredible money. The situation is under control. Last year two 
labs were liquidated in the city, which had the needed set of 
chemicals to produce "synthetics." The number of poly-drug 
addicts -- those who can use anything, whether it is hashish, 
marijuana, or vodka -- is growing. 
  Meanwhile, many bitter words are being said in different 
departments on the subject of combating and preventing drug 
addiction. The result is practically zero. It is like the shouts 
"Halva! Halva!" do not make sweet taste in the mouth. While 
medical practitioners for drug addiction have a clear picture of 
the terrible danger, it looks like our educational system does 
not intend at this point to enlighten children and their parents 
openly and on a broad scale. ONON personnel have enough 
conversations with fathers and mothers who refused to notice the 
strange behavior of their offspring and the suspicious glitter 
in their eyes. Where are our hygienic-educational measures, 
which used to be quite strong in the past? 
  The drug business is essentially a part of organized crime. 
It is also smuggling. It has to be interdicted at customs and by 
the endlessly reorganized KGB. Yes, they also work on it. But 
the lion's share of the work is still left to militia. 
Meanwhile, the department that deals with it has only five cars. 
There are probably rich, decent, and concerned people in our 
city, too. The perfidy of drugs also is in that they do 
distinguish whose son (or daughter) jokingly, in pretense, 
inhales that first puff. And then progresses to a needle... 
Perhaps they would find it worth it to help in this quiet war, 
because it is indeed a war against a formidable enemy.

  [Excerpts] Some 570 kg of poppy straw, eight liters of 
extract, 35.5 kg of marijuana, and 1 kg of hashish were 
confiscated in Kharkiv during 1993. Over the first three months 
of this year, 118 kg of raw drugs, worth some 2 billion 
karbovanetses on the black market, were confiscated. As of 
today, 1,061 drug addicts are registered in Kharkiv. 
  This information was presented at a news conference 
organized 
by the Kharkiv Internal Affairs Department. In addition, these 
figures reflect the factual work of the Kharkiv militia in their 
fight against drug trafficking. As for the true state of 
affairs in this sector, it can be demonstrated with the 
following data: Currently, one in every three crimes is 
committed by a drug addict. [passage omitted] 
  The dynamics of drug abuse are increasing. There is a 
network of criminal clans which has raised the production and 
trading in drugs to an industrial level. By the way, if in the 
past Gypsies were the primary drug dealers, currently this 
market is predominantly occupied by emigrants from the Caucasus 
and Near East. [passage omitted]

  [Text] George Town, Grand Cayman, CANA--Nearly 700 pounds 
of marijuana in plastic and burlap bags was found in the bush on 
a remote Cayman Islands beach last weekend. 
  A police spokesperson said the actual weight of the 
marijuana 
came to 697.5 pounds. The marijuana was contained in 23 separate 
bags that were marked "Jamaica" on the outside, he said. 
  The marijuana appeared to be professionally packaged and 
intended for trans-shipment to another destination, most likely 
the United States, the spokesperson said. 
  The drug had a street value of approximately US$850,000. 
  Drugs Squad Superintendent Trevor Cutts said the large 
amounts of marijuana and cocaine found on Cayman beaches 
recently "indicate the islands are still being used to ship 
drugs from Jamaica and Honduras to the United States." 
  Travellers from the Caymans, particularly U.S. citizens who 
have been on vacation here, are seldom searched or detained when 
clearing customs at Miami International or other U.S. airports, 
officials here say. 
  Three U.S. nationals have been arrested here in the past six 
months and charged with transporting drugs back to the United 
States. 
  All have admitted they were recruited to be "mules" by local 
residents who offered them a week's vacation in the Cayman 
Islands in return for ferrying marijuana and cocaine back to the 
States.

  [Text] Through the publication of a decree in the official 
gazette yesterday, the Foreign Ministry promulgated an agreement 
with Jamaica for the prevention, control, surveillance, and 
repression of the illegal consumption and trafficking of drugs 
and narcotics. 
  The agreement is signed by former President Patricio Aylwin. 
It was approved by Congress as stated in Resolution No. 1280 of 
the Chamber of Deputies. 
  The two governments are aware of the problems stemming from 
drugs, including the deterioration of economies and the harm to 
peoples' health. 
  The idea is to establish a permanent mechanism that will 
allow Chilean and Jamaican authorities to exchange information 
related to drug trafficking.

  [Text] The most tumultuous debate in recent times in 
Colombia was unleashed today after the Constitutional Court 
decided to legalize the personal consumption of drugs such as 
marijuana and cocaine. The debate has reached such a point 
that, going against the tradition of not speaking publicly, the 
Constitutional Court justices who opposed the decision are 
expressing their dissent. Here is a report by Juan Roberto 
Vargas: 
  [Vargas] Good evening. We are here with one of the justices 
who dissented from the majority decision adopted by the 
Constitutional Court yesterday to decriminalize the consumption 
of drugs--that is to say, the use of the infamous personal dose 
of drugs. Dr. Jose Gregorio Hernandez, why did you dissent from 
this decision? 
  [Hernandez] I disagree with the decision because I believe 
the standard, or standards, declared unconstitutional by the 
Constitutional Court were, in fact, not unconstitutional. Just 
the opposite is true. Far from violating the Constitution, they 
extended it. The advancement of personal freedom [libre 
desarrollo de la personalidad] has limits within the 
Constitution. These limits basically involve the well-being of 
others and the maintenance of juridical order. This is because, 
to the extent that a person who has consumed drugs acts under 
the influence of a substance that prevents him from being fully 
aware of the reality around him, he is capable of causing 
enormous harm, even committing crimes, which obviously would 
threaten public interest, harm society, and should therefore be 
penalized. 
  [Vargas] Thank you, Dr. Jose Gregorio. We should point out 
that this is the most significant and controversial decision the 
Constitutional Court has made. We must remember that the vote 
was 5-4 among the justices who decided to decriminalize personal 
drug use. The dissenting justices say this will have serious 
international repercussions as far as Colombia's image in the 
fight against drug trafficking is concerned. This will create 
grave legal problems, because it opens the doors to the definite 
legalization of drug trafficking and will create serious 
psychiatric and psychological problems among the youths who 
consume these substances.

<F P=106> [Report on news conference by Colombian President Cesar </F>
Gaviria prior to his departure for Venezuela with unidentified 
reporters on 6 May; place not given; from the "Caracol's 0600 to 
0900" newscast--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Announcer] Santa Fe de Bogota -- President 
Cesar Gaviria Trujillo has rejected the legalization of the 
possession of drugs for personal consumption as ruled by the 
Constitutional Court. He said that the decision may encourage 
drug addiction. Criticizing the top constitutional court's 
ruling on the free development of personality [desarrollo de la 
peronalidad], he said that if this view is to become the norm, 
it should been done through a decision by the Congress of the 
Republic or by referendum. Gaviria added that [words 
indistinct] implementing this rule, one should study the 
possibility of amending the Constitution to limit the 
individual's right to development of the personality. This is 
what the president said, noting that he respects the Court 
ruling but does not agree with it. 
  [Gaviria] The government will abide by but does not agree 
with the Constitutional Court's ruling to legalize drug 
consumption for various reasons. First, the government believes 
this will encourage an increase in drug consumption in Colombia, 
thus seriously undermining the tranquillity of the people and 
family development. It could also significantly increase crime 
and violence. The government does not believe that this issue 
should become an aspect of the development of the personality of 
the individual. Carrying that view to an extreme may have 
exceedingly undesirable effects, so I hope the Court will 
explain this in the ruling to be announced to Colombians in a 
few days. The Constitutional Court must clarify a number of 
aspects so Congress can at least regulate them in a statutory 
law. This must not turn into an absolute right, because that 
would lead us to absurd decisions. The Court must make it clear 
that the use of narcotics by minors and adolescents must be 
limited or banned at the very least. Also, the Congress--or the 
Court--should be able to avoid or limit consumption in schools 
and universities. I would also say that the Court should make 
it clear....[pauses] It should at least give Congress the 
option of banning drug consumption in public places. If 
possible, it must also ban drug consumption by women who are 
pregnant or nursing. The free development of personality ought 
not lead to babies with birth defects caused by drug 
consumption. We must not say that we cannot control such things 
on account of the principle of development of the personality. 
That would lead to absurd situations. 
  It must also be clear that drivers or pilots cannot take 
drugs. No one could live in this society if that were allowed on 
the grounds that it is personality development. As president, I 
would say that free development of the personality cannot mean 
that Colombia is unable to campaign against drug abuse because 
that would hamper the development of the personality. We would 
become a society that regards drug consumption as desirable and 
advisable. We may almost have to encourage it, something that 
greatly disturbs the government. The government has taken 
other considerations into account. True, some U.S. states and 
European countries have legalized drug consumption. Those 
decisions, however, have had controversial results. I 
understand that consumption has increased in the countries where 
drugs have been legalized. 
  Aside from that, the legislatures have made those decisions 
following a very broad public debate. I do not know if 
countries or states allow the personal use of hard drugs like 
cocaine. I do not have that information. I have not heard of 
that because the extremely high level of addiction makes us 
quickly realize that it is not a matter of personality 
development but of a simple addiction or illness. 
  If we turn this into a personality development issue, that 
means we cannot force people to undergo treatment. I do not 
know of any country in the world that has reached that extreme. 
  I return to the same point. I think the ruling must allow 
Congress to pass a law governing all these aspects. I would 
also say that the countries that have taken these steps, as I 
said before, did so after a broad discussion and based on a 
political decision made by Congress or the citizens. I think 
that if this option were to be pursued, it would have to be 
discussed by Congress or made by decision of the citizens in a 
popular consultation. 
  I would even understand if the Court stated that this cannot 
be considered an offense or violation, but Congress' authority 
to make decisions of this type in a governing law must be 
preserved. If that is not possible, I hope the Court's ruling 
will allow Congress to establish restrictions on all I have 
said. I would go even further. I think this possibility must be 
examined in case it is decided that the state will be unable to 
establish those restrictions. We would then have to think about 
amending the Constitution to place limitations on the right of 
autonomy and the development of personality. We could even ask 
citizens in the near future if they agree with a change of this 
nature in the Constitution by way of a referendum. 
  As time goes by, I hope to say more about this issue. I 
really hope the Constitutionality Court will clearly establish 
that no abuses will be committed and that limitations will be 
established within this decision, with which the government does 
not agree. As I said before, I, as head of the government, will 
abide by this ruling as we are mandated to abide by the 
Constitutionality Court's rulings. I believe, however, that the 
promulgation of this law as the development of individual 
personality could have serious and dangerous implications for 
Colombian society. [Words indistinct] I hope the Court's ruling 
at least allows Congress, through a governing law, to place a 
series of limitations on that decision by the Court. Otherwise, 
there may be very grave implications for this society. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, will the government take immediate 
action to overcome this impasse, taking advantage of the state 
of internal disturbance? 
  [Gaviria] No, no, no. We are not going to resort to the 
state of internal disturbance to respond to a Constitutionality 
Court ruling. We are forced to wait for the Constitutionality 
Court's ruling to analyze its scope and implications. Only then 
will we decide what to do regarding limitations on said 
decision. We hope we can resort to Congress to establish 
something that the Constitution and the very Court rulings have 
established; that is, that the law have reasonable limitations. 
We are living in a state of law, so it must be possible. I 
cannot imagine the Court granting the absolute right to consume 
drugs in Colombia. This could also lead to unreasonable 
situations. 
  If no limitations are set, it is possible that suicide and 
even abortion could be legalized. No! Personality development 
has clear limitations. In Colombia and all civilized societies, 
there are limitations. The Court has declared legal mayoral 
decrees establishing limitations on alcohol consumption, so I 
cannot understand how the Court deems it reasonable to establish 
limitations on alcohol consumption but not on drug consumption. 
I go back to another absurd point, which I hope the 
Constitutional Court ruling will clarify. This may mean that 
medical prescriptions for drug consumption cannot be written 
because they limit the development of personality, and people 
have the right to consume any drug with any number of effects. 
This is incorrect, and I hope the Court clearly establishes the 
capacity and right of society to set limitations in this 
instance. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, could the Court ruling at some 
point support the prosecutor general's proposal to legalize 
drugs and [words indistinct] international level? 
  [Gaviria] I cannot answer that question. You would have to 
ask the prosecutor general directly. You would have to ask him 
if the elimination of sanctions on drug use is part of his 
proposal or if he believes the legalization issues must be 
studied further. Only the prosecutor general can answer those 
questions. 
  [Reporter] The U.S. Government protested Colombia's decision 
on the media. Is there any official statement on that yet? 
  [Gaviria] No, I think it is irrelevant. It is a domestic 
matter. I was not talking about international consequences, and 
I am not going to. I think we must discuss this here and now as 
a domestic issue; as a Colombian issue. 
  Again, I sincerely appeal to the sensibility and maturity of 
the Constitutionality Court and hope it does not make this an 
absolute right. If they do, it could lead us to truly absurd 
and dangerous situations. I hope we do not go so far as to call 
this an absolute right of an individual in the development of 
his or her personality that allows no limitations. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Announcer] That was President Cesar Gaviria before leaving 
for Caracas, Venezuela for a first visit with President Rafael 
Caldera. This is the president's first meeting after being 
elected OAS secretary general.

<F P=106> [News conference by Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera and </F>
Colombian President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo with domestic and 
foreign reporters, moderated by Guillermo Alvarez Bajares, chief 
of the Venezuelan Central Information Office, from the Ayacucho 
Room of Miraflores Palace in Caracas--live relay] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] 
  [Alvarez] [passage omitted] William Parra, representing 
Colombian television. 
  [Parra] Colombia has stood out among the nations of the 
world, because it has paid the highest price in the 
antidrug-trafficking fight; unfortunately, there is news 
regarding Colombia's proud struggle. The Constitutional Court 
has decided to legalize a specific drug dose for personal 
consumption. What is the Colombian President's response to the 
Constitutional Court's decision, especially in light of the 
unanimous rejection expressed by Colombian sectors? There is 
even a letter by the business associations stating that if 
Colombia and the government want to hold a referendum to reject 
the court's decision, they are willing to pay for all the 
publicity. What is the Colombian President's response to this, 
and what kind of image does this create abroad of the country's 
antidrug-trafficking struggle? 
  [Gaviria] I gave a full response to that before I left this 
morning, but allow me to explain something quickly now. We will 
abide by the Constitutional Court's decision, but we do not 
agree with it. We do not agree because of the serious effects 
it could have on Colombian people's health. This can create 
violence. We do not agree with the rationale behind the 
decision, which says this is something concerning the 
development of one's personality. We are highly concerned with 
this, and we must still wait for the ruling itself to be handed 
down. The decision was made, but the ruling has not been issued 
yet. We hope the Colombian Congress will be able to issue a law 
establishing the limits for which such a decision calls. I am 
referring to the limits that should be established on 
consumption by children and teenagers, consumption in schools 
and public places, preventing drivers and pilots from using 
drugs, and all these other normal restrictions any community 
must impose when taking such a step as this. 
  There should be clear provisions for people to be able to 
appeal for and receive medical treatment for drug consumption. 
I do not believe the Colombian community or society can in any 
way accept drug consumption as something good or as something 
against which it cannot fight. The president has also said that 
in countries or in U.S. states where this decision has been 
adopted, this has been a decision citizens or their 
representatives made. This should not be a judicial decision 
but, rather, a decision of the Colombian parliament, the 
Colombian Congress, preceded by a public discussion on the 
implications of such a decision, such as health and family 
considerations; in fact, I have mentioned the possibility of a 
referendum, for which our Constitution provides. 
  [Alvarez] Miss Paola Badaraco, representing Venezuelan 
newspapers. 
  [Badaraco] Good afternoon, Mr. President. Together with the 
question asked by my colleague from your country, I would like 
to know or advise you that in Venezuela, a judge from the state 
of Tachira has just released 32 people implicated in the 
laundering of drug money. Do not both of you, the two 
presidents, fear that the struggle against drugs could founder 
in light of such decisions by the judicial branch? Thank you. 
  [Gaviria] It would seem to be a question for... [pauses] 
That 
is news to me. Well, yes. What Colombia's Constitutional Court 
decided in principle--I say in principle, because only an 
announcement on a decision has been made, not a ruling--is to 
eliminate sanctions or penalties for personal drug consumption. 
They invalidated the provision stating that personal drug use 
was a violation of Colombian legislation. 
  The president of Colombia's Constitutional Court clearly 
said 
that this does not mean that drug trafficking will now be legal. 
The sanctions set forth in our codes for drug trafficking and 
drug production remain unchanged. This only refers to the 
elimination of penalties for personal drug use. As far as I 
understand, the court invalidated the articles establishing 
arrest for this type of violation. 
  This in no way weakens the struggle against the drug cartels 
or drug traffickers. I am sure Colombian society would never 
take such a step, much less at the international level. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta's strong 
opposition to the Constitutional Court's recent decision has 
apparently weakened the legal arguments supporting the approval 
of the personal drug dose. 
  [Begin Arrieta recording] I disagree with the ruling, which 
I 
think is capable of creating complex legal, moral, social, and 
international problems in the country. In terms of the law, 
such a broad interpretation of personal freedom could create 
distortions that have no place in this government. We will soon 
find ourselves debating other social issues, such as euthanasia 
or suicide. Let us keep in mind that personal freedom cannot be 
extended to a point at which it harms society. [end recording]

  [Text] President Gaviria spoke and other reactions 
followed. The presidential candidates and the police 
counternarcotics director support Gaviria and agree that 
personal consumption should not be legalized. 
  [Andres Pastrana, presidential candidate of the Conservative 
Party] I totally disagree with the Constitutional Court because 
Colombia is invaded by drugs. We are a drug-producing and 
drug-distributing country. If we open the doors to personal 
use, it will be like offering incentives to increase drug 
addiction rates. The laws must be obeyed, but there has been a 
flaw in the Court. I think we must look for mechanisms that 
will allow us not to be permissive. That is where we must 
direct our efforts. 
  [Unidentified Reporter] What are the good and bad aspects of 
this court decision? 
  [Pastrana] Personally, I don't see anything good about it. 
  [Enrique Parejo, presidential candidate for the Democratic 
National Alternative] I think the Court has made a serious 
mistake. The decision could lead to a considerable increase in 
drug use in the country. If running a red light and thereby 
endangering the lives and physical wellbeing of persons is 
subject to sanction even if nothing happens, that is all the 
more reason why the use of drugs should be sanctioned. 
  [Miguel Maza, presidential candidate of the National Civic 
Consensus] For me it is a legal absurdity. It is impossible to 
conceive of the law as a cold summation of a series of norms 
that are totally alien from the wishes and feelings of a people. 
After carefully analyzing the clamor made by mothers, fathers, 
the clergy, and the government in expressing their opinions, the 
only thing left for these five magistrates to do is resign.

  [Text] Government, political, and church sectors have 
expressed opposition to the Constitutional Court's decision to 
legalize personal doses of certain drugs. The impossible seems 
to have occurred in Colombia: Everyone agreed on the same issue. 
  National Drug Director Gabriel Vega, presidential candidates 
Andres Pastrana [Conservative Party]; Ernesto Samper [Liberal 
Party]; Antonio Navarro Wolff [19 April Movement Democratic 
Alliance]; Miguel Maza [National Civic Consensus]; and Episcopal 
Conference President Monsignor Pedro Rubiano oppose the decision. 
  [Begin recording] [Vega] I heard the court president say 
these drugs are similar to alcohol, which is untrue. I asked 
him how a child of 11, 12, 13, or 14 could make a responsible 
decision concerning drug use. 
  [Pastrana] I respect the court's decision, but I disagree 
with it. 
  [Samper] The legalization or acceptance of a personal dose 
in 
a country such as Colombia, which is known as a producer and 
where one assumes large quantities of drugs are readily 
available, constitutes a dangerous step. 
  [Navarro] I sincerely do not like the decision, because it 
will not resolve the problem and will create a debate that will 
confuse many. 
  [Maza] I cannot understand how a court of such importance 
can 
manage to pass such a legal atrocity, knowingly, because they 
must know this: They are creating many ills for Colombia. 
  [Rubiano] In view of this country's realities and people, we 
must keep the common good in mind. I wonder what good it can do 
the country to legalize drugs now. [end recording]

  [Text] A veritable powderkeg was set off by the 
Constitutional Court's decision to legalize personal drug use. 
President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo was the first to express his 
rejection, stating very strongly that he does not agree with the 
decision. The Court, in view of the avalanche of criticism by 
presidential candidates and by the population in general, 
defended itself by saying that a mountain is being made out of a 
molehill. 
  The government and the Constitutional Court had a difference 
of opinion regarding the impact of the decision to legalize the 
personal consumption of drugs. The president says it is 
dangerous, while the Constitutional Court says the government 
and the Congress have ways to cope with the situation. 
  [Begin recording] [Gaviria] First, the government believes 
this will encourage an increase in drug consumption in Colombia, 
thus seriously undermining the tranquillity of the people and 
family development. It could also significantly increase crime 
and violence. 
  [Constitutional Court President Jorge Arango Mejia] That is 
a 
respectable opinion, which I do not share. The Constitutional 
Court has exercised its legitimate function of interpreting the 
Constitution. It has determined that a norm is contrary to the 
Constitution. 
  [Gaviria] It must also be clear that drivers or pilots 
cannot 
take drugs. No one could live in this society if that were 
allowed on the grounds that it is personality development. 
  [Arango] Regarding alcohol, a person can imbibe liquor, but 
he could commit a crime if he infringes upon the rights of 
another person in a criminal way. [end recording] 
  Finally, the court president said it was contradictory to 
authorize personal drug consumption and punishments for it at 
the same time.

  [Text] Colombia's industrialists and businessmen have said 
a referendum is needed to determine whether minimum doses of 
drugs for personal consumption should be legalized. Alberto 
Vasquez Restrepo, president of CAMACOL [Colombian Chamber of

  [Begin Vasquez recording] As we said in a communique sent to 
the president today, we are absolutely dumbfounded. This 
decision has really taken the country by surprise and we have 
asked the president to invoke the constitutional right to 
consult the people on any subject. This right to a referendum 
is needed more than ever today, considering that there is no 
higher body above the Constitutional Court to which this 
decision can be appealed in order to abolish or modify it. [end

  [Text] Minutes before leaving for Costa Rica, President 
Cesar Gaviria held a news conference to reiterate his position 
on holding a plebiscite to ensure that the people will decide 
whether to accept or reject the legalization of drugs. Jorge 
Enrique Botero has the story: 
  [Begin recording] [Gaviria] The government is more convinced 
about the possibility of holding a plebiscite. 
  [Botero] Gaviria unexpectedly commented on the decision by 
the country's highest constitutional organization. 
  [Gaviria] Congress or the people should have discussed, 
analyzed, and voted on a decision such as this one; it should 
not have been a court decision. 
  [Botero] Gaviria said he will seek counsel to initiate the 
plebiscite process. 
  [Gaviria] We will have to decide along with the Electoral 
Tribunal and the National Civil Registry Office when to hold the 
plebiscite. 
  [Botero] The president added it is unlikely the consultation 
will be made during the 29 May presidential elections, but he 
hinted of a possible plebiscite during the runoff elections, 
should they be necessary. [end recording]

  [Text] "The Colombian Government has replied to the U.S. 
State Department letter in accordance to its duty: to defend 
the honesty of the institutions and judicial authorities." 
Presidential candidate Andres Pastrana has made this statement 
as he expressed his support for the Colombian response to the 18 
April U.S. letter questioning Prosecutor General Gustavo de 
Greiff's attitude. 
  Pastrana has said: "It is worrisome that as policies of 
submission [sometimiento] are enforced certain self-confessed 
criminals tarnish the names of other parties and even the image 
of an entire country so as to have their sentences reduced for 
allegedly collaborating with authorities." 
  Pastrana also urged the two governments to reestablish the 
lines of communication, to normalize bilateral relations, and to 
reactivate the mechanisms of judicial collaboration to fight 
international drug trafficking. 
  Meanwhile, Pastrana has reiterated his opposition to the 
legalization of drugs, saying: "Should Senator Kerry or any 
other U.S. authority have substantial information that will 
contribute to preventing drug trafficking from interfering with 
Colombian politics, he must say it immediately by providing the 
details he knows."

  [Text] Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff has asked U.S. 
authorities to stop U.S. officials from attacking him without 
justification. De Greiff has also called on the U.S. Government 
to continue cooperating with the exchange of evidence, as this 
will advance the end of the scourge of drug trafficking. 
  Upon returning from a trip to the UK and the United States, 
the official said in a communique that he held a news conference 
in Washington and had emphatically rejected the charges that 
drug traffickers have infiltrated the government and that there 
is corruption in top government positions and in the legislative 
and judicial branches, as claimed by a convict at a U.S. Senate 
subcommission. 
  The prosecutor said that in his opinion, the procedures to 
bring drug traffickers to trial and the penalty reduction policy 
in effect should continue. De Greiff said those who say drug 
traffickers are given lenient treatment or illegal sentence 
reductions are liars. "No pardons or amnesties of any kind have 
even been considered," he said. De Greiff said cooperation with 
justice cannot be conditioned to forcing judicial officials to 
use given evidence, prior to consultation of their decisions, 
with the country that gives the evidence. 
  De Greiff had told the U.S. media he had not proposed drug 
legalization as a way to stop the use of illegal drugs but, 
rather, as a way to stop drug traffickers from obtaining the 
excessive profits they are making. This decision has to be 
adopted, however, by the international community as a whole, he 
added. 
  The official said Senator Kerry could not affirm, if he acts 
in good faith, that regarding one drug trafficker (Julio Fabio 
Urdinola), who surrendered to justice, the Prosecutor's Office 
has reached an agreement to give him a four- or a 
four-and-one-half-year prison sentence. "There has been no 
trial provision, much less an out-of-court agreement on this 
issue," he added. 
  De Greiff arrived in the UK on 15 April and met with the UK 
prosecutor general, the secretary of state of foreign affairs, 
officials of the Investigation Center on Drugs and Health 
Behavior, and other officials and parliamentarians of that 
nation. During those meetings, de Greiff explained the scope of 
Colombian justice and thanked them for the material and 
intellectual aid the UK has given to Colombia in this field.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Colombian Foreign Ministry in </F>
response to U.S. Senator John Kerry's protest note; place and 
date not given--read by announcer] 
  [Text] The Colombian Government, although it disagrees 
with the prosecutor general on some points, cannot accept 
whatsover doubts being cast on its motives or its determined and 
unchanging commitment to reach the common goal of fighting crime 
in general and fighting drug trafficking in particular. In 
addition, the Colombian Government, because it believes the 
necessary climate of constructive understanding between the two 
governments is not being served, flatly rejects the fact that a 
political leader, in this instance Senator John Kerry, has used 
his post and the post's inherent prerogatives, such as the 
legislative branch's political control procedures, to grant 
privileges to, listen to, and believe false charges by a 
confessed criminal against Colombia, its institutions, the 
private sector, and even the media. Such a position represents 
an attack on Colombian society and its authorities because it 
casts a shadow of suspicion and implies corruption, or at least 
general complicity with drug traffickers, in a country which is 
well-known to have made the greatest possible sacrifices and 
which has achieved the greatest results in the struggle against 
this scourge. 
  The Colombian Government expects that judicial cooperation 
between the two countries can return to normal and that the 
channels of dialogue, exchange of ideas, and joint work between 
judicial authorities of the two countries can be kept open. To 
achieve this, the best possible joint efforts should be made to 
overcome any disagreements resulting from the difficulties 
inherent in the handling of such a complex matter. 
  Finally, the Colombian Foreign Ministry wants to underscore 
the importance of cooperation because the absence of this can 
benefit only our common enemies--those interested in fanning the 
fires of discord and (putting obstacles) in the path of justice. 
  [Signed] Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 3 May (DPA) -- Colombian Foreign 
Affairs Minister Noemi Sanin today asked the U.S. Government to 
normalize judicial relations between the two countries. 
Judicial relations were partially suspended by Washington 
following a disagreement with Colombian Prosecutor General 
Gustavo de Greiff. 
  The request was made after the Colombian Government told the 
United States that "under no circumstance" can it accept that De 
Greiff be criticized by U.S. State Department officials, who 
have publicly stated they do not trust him and therefore have 
stopped sending to Santa Fe de Bogota evidence against drug 
traffickers. 
  Sanin, in statements to the press, indicated that Colombia 
and the United States should uphold together the struggle 
against the common enemy, drug trafficking, which gets an upper 
hand when judicial authorities do not cooperate. Colombia's 
rejection of criticism against De Greiff was included in a note 
sent by Sanin to the U.S. State Department. The U.S. State 
Department on 18 April sent a letter to the Cesar Gaviria 
government denouncing the prosecutor general's behavior. 
  Washington's protest was prompted by a letter De Greiff sent 
the U.S. judge in charge of the case of Colombian drug 
trafficker Dandenis Munoz. In the letter De Greiff said that 
Colombia had no pending charges against this criminal concerning 
the attack against an Avianca airplane, which killed 107 people 
in November 1989. 
  The prosecutor general's letter was sent at the request of 
Munoz's lawyer. Munoz is serving a six-year sentence in New 
York for using illegal identification. U.S. political and 
judicial circles believe there was "improper meddling" by De 
Greiff in the case. 
  The U.S. Government, through the State Department protest 
note, criticized De Greiff and cast doubt on his resolve to 
fight drug trafficking, thus increasing tension over the past 
few months between U.S. judicial authorities and the Colombian 
prosecutor general. 
  The quarrel began in 1993 when de Greiff said in a news 
conference in the United States that it would be good to develop 
ways to legalize drug trafficking in view of what he called 
"little interest" by developed countries to halt consumption and 
at the same time reduce the mafia's economic power. 
  When referring to the protest note sent to the U.S. State 
Department, Sanin said that despite the fact the Gaviria 
government has conceptual differences with de Greiff, it does 
not accept that the prosecutor general be cast under a bad 
light, especially on an international level. 
  "Colombia does not accept, under any circumstance, 
statements 
against the prosecutor general, who is an efficient and properly 
qualified person, committed to fighting crime and drug 
trafficking," the foreign minister said. 
  Likewise, Sanin's diplomatic note criticized the position of 
U.S. Senator John Kerry, who invited a criminal to a 
Congressional session, who accused the Colombian Government, 
politicians, and the media of having been "corrupted" by the 
mafia's narco-trafficking money.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 4 May (NOTIMEX) -- The Colombian 
Senate today strongly condemned what it views as U.S. meddling 
in Colombia's judicial system. 
  During a debate that lasted several hours, the legislative 
branch closed ranks around Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff, 
whom the U.S. State Department has accused of acting 
independently in the Colombian Government's struggle against the 
mafia. 
  Senator Fernando Mendoza said the country to the north "has 
no moral basis for criticizing the Colombian authorities." He 
noted: "In Colombia, people die from drug traffickers' bullets, 
while in the United States people die as a result of overdose." 
  Senate President Jorge Ramon Elias criticized the position 
of 
Colombian Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez for maintaining a 
weak stand in the face of criticism from U.S. congressmen and 
U.S. officials in Colombia. 
  Gonzalez, promoter of a bill calling for stronger penalties 
against the mafia, admitted that "the nation's sovereignty is 
being threatened not only by foreign pressure, which we must 
reject strongly and with dignity, but also by crime." 
  During the debate at the Senate session to which De Greiff 
was summoned, the senators discussed an eventual modification of 
the Criminal Procedure Code and, especially, the possibility of 
toughening the sentences handed down to confessed 
drug-traffickers who surrender to authorities. 
  Liberal Party Senator Humberto Pelaez said the executive 
branch's proposal to reform penal legislation "is the result of 
U.S. pressure." Senator Maria Izquierdo, of the same party, 
cautioned that Congress will not make changes to this law. 
  The Criminal Procedure Code grants significant sentence 
reductions to drug traffickers who surrender to authorities, 
confess to at least one crime, and collaborate in the arrest of 
other criminals. The code also envisages releasing prisoners 
who spend six months in prison without being brought before a 
court. 
  Last Sunday, President Gaviria decreed, for the third time 
in 
the past two years, a state of internal disturbance, which 
enables him to issue or void public order decrees to prevent the 
release of more than 800 inmates, most of whom are accused of 
drug trafficking or terrorism. 
  According to U.S. congressmen and other U.S. officials, De 
Greiff has adopted a "weak" position in his negotiations on 
sentencing Cali Cartel and Medellin Cartel bosses. 
  De Greiff has denied the charges and reiterated: "I am not 
scared of a foreign power or pressure from organized crime." 
The prosecutor general quipped at the Senate's full session: 
"I suffer from a strange spinal disease that prevents me from 
bending down in front of the powerful."

  [Text] The prosecutor general of the nation sparked a new 
controversy when he said that the war on drug trafficking is a 
failure. He is now confronting the Drug Police, and he has his 
own figures and balance. With the following figures Prosecutor 
General Gustavo De Greiff summarized, point by point, his own 
balance. 
  [Begin De Greiff recording] Marijuana consumption has 
skyrocketed, while cocaine and heroin consumption has suddenly 
increased. What kind of success is this? 
  Not even 10 percent of the drugs that reach the markets or 
are even meant to reach the international markets are seized. 
What kind of success is this? 
  The public force in Colombia killed Mr. Rodriguez Gacha, 
killed Mr. Pablo Escobar, extradited Mr. Ledher, imprisoned 
several drug traffickers. However, none of these events has led 
to any variations in the illegal drug market. What kind of 
success is this? [end recording] 
  De Greiff has used these figures to support once again his 
proposal for studying the legalization of drugs in Colombia. 
  [Begin De Greiff recording] I am not becoming an advocate 
for 
the legalization of drugs. Nonetheless, I believe it is a 
weapon that will destroy the wealth of drug traffickers. [end 
recording] 
  Predicting the United States will probably unleash a storm 
against him as a result of these statements, De Greiff warned 
that he is ill. 
  [Begin De Greiff recording] I have a strange disease in my 
spine that does not allow me to bend over before those who are 
powerful. [end recording]

  [Text] Point by point, the authorities involved in the drug 
fight, refuted the prosecutor general's assessments. 
  [Colonel Jose Antonio Gallego, chief of the Narcotics 
Division] "I personally and professionally respect all 
observations made by the prosecutor general, but I cannot share 
that statement because it is very obvious that following the 
death of Gonzalo Rodiguez Gacha and Pablo Escobar, drug 
trafficking in Colombia was completely reduced to zero by the 
national government." 
  As for the increase in the amount of cultivated areas: 
  [Gallego] "That is not completely true because, as regards 
coca plantations, we have seen an increase since last year that 
is not more than 5 or 7 percent. The same is not true for 
marijuana or poppy plantations." 
  As for the small number of drug and money confiscations: 
  [Gallego] "We can say that we have confiscated plenty of 
drugs of different types in the country." 
  As for the small number of drug traffickers in jail: 
  [Gallego] "The National Police, alone, in the first four 
months of 1994, have arrested 450 Colombians and 42 foreigners 
involved in the trafficking of drugs." 
  As for the increase in drug consumption: 
  [Gallego] "An increase in consumption is relative. If it is 
indeed happening, it should not be in significant numbers 
because indicators show that at this time there is less 
availability of the substance than in previous years."

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 1 May (DPA) -- The private 
Caracol radio station reported the Colombian Government decreed 
a state of internal disturbance tonight, thereby preventing the 
release of more than 700 inmates, including dangerous 
terrorists, drug traffickers, and guerrillas. This mechanism 
authorizes President Cesar Gaviria to issue special, temporary 
laws without the approval of the National Congress. 
  This is the only mechanism available to the Gaviria 
administration to prevent the mass release of inmates upon the 
completion of their prison terms because public prosecutors have 
failed to study their cases to begin their trials. 
  The decrees issued by Gaviria during this period will be 
valid for as long as the state of exception is in effect. 
According to the Constitution, the state of internal 
disturbance could last 90 days and could be extended for an 
additional 90 days.

  [Text] A few minutes ago, the national government decided 
to decree a state of internal disturbance to prevent the release 
of incarcerated guerrillas and drug traffickers. Hans Sarmiento 
has the story. 
  [Begin recording] [Sarmiento] This is the third time the 
government has declared a state of internal disturbance to avert 
a legal crisis. This time the state of internal disturbance has 
been declared amid a dispute between Prosecutor General Gustavo 
de Greiff and the national government. The prosecutor general, 
however, made peace with the president at the beginning of the 
meeting [not further identified] and accepted the state of 
internal disturbance even though he had previously opposed it. 
  [De Greiff] The president convinced me how appropriate the 
measure was and how dangerous the mass release of inmates was. 
I accepted because I am a reasonable, not arrogant, man. 
  [Sarmiento] Some 860 inmates will have to wait two more 
months, the period of the state of internal disturbance, for 
their cases to be considered. At the end of this period, 
however, there is no guarantee they will be released. 
  [Unidentified speaker] We Colombians are inclined to declare 
a state of internal disturbance and to live in a state of 
exception. I think Colombians must trust a government and a 
state that are willing to adopt timely measures to maintain 
public order. 
  [Sarmiento] As part of the state of internal disturbance, a 
judicial emergency was decreed, and trials with faceless judges 
were suspended for 60 days. [end recording]

  [Text] The Joint Special Command raided two communications 
bases of the Cali Cartel a few hours ago, thus it is slowly 
undermining the cartel's infrastructure. So far this year, 150 
people have been arrested and 18 clandestine landing strips 
destroyed. The latest raids have weakened the cartel's powerful 
communications system. 
  The first communications base was raided north of Cali. The 
Candelaria Limitada brick company was used as a front for the 
operation. The "National Newscast" has learned that alleged 
drug trafficker Diego Montoya Sanchez, alias Don Diego, owns the 
company. The authorities are currently pursuing Montoya. During 
the raid, the authorities located checking accounts, financial 
statements, seven hand-held communications radios, battery 
chargers, and batteries. They also found documents of (Acetel 
Limitada), another communications company, with the 
registrations for 20 hand-held radios and permits from the 
Communications Ministry. The authorities found copies of checks 
for over 500 million pesos. The Joint Special Command raided a 
second company, (Compania Conalviver), also north of Cali. The 
communications center had no permit from the Communications 
Ministry. The command seized four screens, monitors, 
communication radios, and other equipment. According to the 
state's intelligence corps, these communication companies cover 
the entire Valle del Cauca Department and serve as fronts for 
the Cali Cartel to make transactions and contact drug 
traffickers at the service of that cartel.

<F P=106> [From the "Seven O'Clock Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] The controversial sentence reduction process with 
confessed drug trafficker Juan Diago Arcila Henao, a.k.a. El 
Tomate, which had been denounced by a Barranquilla judge as a 
judicial outrage, was overturned today by the Santa Fe de Bogota 
judge who reviewed the case. This is the first time this has 
occurred following negotiations between a prosecutor and a 
criminal. 
  More than 15 days ago, on direct orders of the Justice 
Ministry, a Santa Fe de Bogota regional judge began to examine 
the sentence reduction agreement that the Prosecutor's Office 
had negotiated with El Tomate. Serious flaws were found which 
did not justify the sentence reduction that had been granted. 
According to the deal annulled today, Juan Diego Arcila Henao's 
17-year-sentence for drug trafficking, illicit enrichment, and 
conspiracy to commit crime had been reduced to only four years 
for confessing, cooperating, and providing information. El 
Tomate's new sentence must now be decided. 
  This is the first time a deal with a drug trafficking 
kingpin 
has been rejected. This newscast has also learned that in order 
to avoid new overly generous sentence reduction agreements 
between drug traffickers and prosecutors, a special oversight 
commission will be created to review legal proceedings against 
important capos.

<F P=106> [Letter submitted to CAMBIO 16 by Gilberto and Miguel </F>
Rodriguez Orejuela] 
  [Text] Because of the media's attitude toward us, an 
attitude motivated by a need to create a stronger impact and 
sensation with the news, as citing specific names certainly 
draws a wider audience and increased circulation, this arbitrary 
and constant persecution and the sacrifice of our constitutional 
rights by people who would rather make news than present the 
news is becoming intolerable to us. We are, therefore, making 
the following remarks. 
  1. The dissemination of this large amount of news, most 
often 
at odds with reality, persistently ignores our constitutional 
rights contained in Articles 15, 20, 21, and 29 of the National 
Constitution. We have not waived those rights, and we will 
defend ourselves by using the instruments provided by law. 
  2. The essence of a democratic state of law is based on the 
fundamental rights of the individual. These pillars of democracy 
cannot be resigned or renounced. One such right is the right to 
information contained in Article 20 of the Constitution in its 
two major aspects: the right to inform and the right to be 
informed. We respect this important and universal principle, and 
we defend its historic and political raison d'etre. 
There can be no doubt that we have always greatly respected, as 
we shall continue to do, the oral, written, and television 
media, because of the convictions imparted to us by our academic 
and political background. 
  3. A free press, so cherished by democracy, must act 
responsibly (Article 20, second paragraph of the Constitution). 
The parameters of this responsibility are described in the 
Constitution. The right to information loses primacy when it 
clashes with individual rights; therefore, it must be exercised 
truthfully and impartially (Article 20, first paragraph) so 
these rights will not be damaged. 
  4. Most recently, all news reports on the antidrug campaign 
and the seizure of prohibited substances that create physical or 
psychological dependency have been accompanied by three 
references that have become a standard and mandatory feature: 
  4a. Ownership of the cargo seized, no matter where these 
substances were found in Colombia or elsewhere, is attributed to 
the "Cali Cartel." 
  4b. It is stated that the Cali Cartel is an organization 
created and run by the undersigned. 
  4c. The article is illustrated with photos of the 
undersigned, depending on the desired magnitude of the impact. 
  We dispute all of the above: there is no proof to support 
the 
constant linkage of our names with the criminal deeds reported 
in the news. Even worse, it can be corroborated by the news 
accounts themselves that the reported events have no connection 
to us, and our names, photos, and images were used improperly 
only to give color, illustrate, and capture the attention of the 
listener, reader, or viewer. 
  5. Neither of the undersigned has ever been convicted in 
Colombia or in any other country of the crime of drug 
trafficking. We have borne the legal proceedings against us both 
here and abroad with dignity, decorum, and respect for justice. 
  6. According to our Constitution, those who bear great 
responsibility to ensure the community's respect for the 
Constitution, that is, the National Government, particularly the 
Office of the Prosecutor General and the Office of the Attorney 
General, and what is known as the fourth estate (the media), 
must perform their duties and uphold the principle of the 
citizens' equality before the law (Article 13 of the 
Constitution). Therefore, it is clear that the guarantee of the 
presumption of innocence contained in Article 29 of the 
Constitution protects us, and no one can incriminate us, 
especially publicly. This is illegal when no charges have been 
proven against us in any court, nor has our guilt been 
established by a definitive court ruling (Article 29 of the 
Constitution and Article 2 of the Criminal Procedures Code), the 
only judgment that a state of law accepts. Otherwise, we may at 
some time take legal action. 
  Because of our respect for the law, when any of the media 
has 
proof of criminal activity on our part, including a definitive 
conviction, we will not oppose publication of that information 
with whatever publicity the media consider appropriate. But 
until that happens, we demand that our constitutional rights be 
respected and observed, by virtue of our status as Colombian 
citizens. 
  [Signed] Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela, Miguel Rodriguez 
Orejuela, Cali

  [Text] The Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) said yesterday that a 
direct link has emerged between Colombian drug lords and two 
Jamaican gang leaders described as prominent political activists. 
  A statement from Derrick Smith, party spokesman on National 
Security, said hostilities had developed between the two 
gangsters after a robbery in New York by the Black Roses Gang. 
Twenty-five kilograms of cocaine and US$1 million in cash were 
stolen from a Colombian drug ring. 
  According to the JLP, two Colombians are now in Jamaica to 
ensure that approproriate punishment is inflicted for this 
violation. 
  An associate of one of the gang bosses known as "Rat" had 
four of his cronies killed and their bodies found in a car along 
Diamond Road recently. "Rat" fled to New York shortly after but 
was shot dead less than 24 hours after arrival. 
  In the ensuring hostilities between both gangsters, the JLP 
says, there has been increasing importation of guns and 
ammunition concealed in bags of rice, barrels of clothing, and 
in the guts of television sets and refrigerators.

  [Text] Western Bureau--Autopsies performed on three 
Canadians who died in Montego Bay on Sunday, confirmed a report 
in yesterday's GLEANER that the visitors had ingested cocaine. 
  A forensic pathologist found that the men had together, 
swallowed 147 packets of cocaine weighing 553.5 grams. 
  The victims are: David Nast, 23, of Winnipeg; Sheldon 
Figusson, 28, and Noland Delaronde of Oak Point on Lake 
Manitoba, Canada. 
  This is what forensic pathologist Dr. Ademola Odunfa found: 


    -  Nast's stomach had in [it] 60 small packets of cocaine 
weighing 215 grams. He died after 12 of the packets burst inside 
his digestive system. 


    -  Figusson's had 38 packets weighing 157 grams in his 
body, four of which had ruptured. 


    -  Delerande had 49 packets weighing 182 grams, and nine 
of them had burst in his system. 
  The police said the men were booked on a flight scheduled to 
leave the island at 5:30 p.m. on Sunday when they fell ill. They 
were rushed to the Cornwall Regional Hospital where Nast was 
pronounced dead on arrival. His friends were being taken to the 
Doctor's Hospital in a chartered taxi, when Delaronde reportedly 
said he feared dying also as he, like his friends, had swallowed 
cocaine. They collapsed and died as hospital workers were taking 
personal details in preparing them for admission.

<F P=106> [Report by Jaime Flores in Baja California; from the "ACIR </F>
Radio News" newscast--live relay] 
  [Text] [Unidentified announcer, at the Radio ACIR studios 
in Mexico City] At noon, we reported on a news conference by 
Sergio Ortiz Lara--now under arrest--a news conference he gave 
as the deputy prosecutor of Baja California, not as a prison 
inmate. Ortiz Lara was arrested last night on charges linked to 
drug trafficking, the 3 March shootout, and the release of two 
people involve in this shootout. He also is accused of 
administrative crimes. At 1400, Baja California Governor 
Ernesto Ruffo also held a news conference. Jaime Flores, can you 
tell us what he said? 
  [Flores] Governor Ernesto Ruffo's news conference ended not 
more than five minutes ago. He came from the capital to meet 
with the press and give his views on Sergio Ortiz Lara's arrest 
yesterday, as you have already noted. Mr. Ruffo said he 
considers the Federal Attorney General's Office as being 
completely politically irresponsible in the way it has handled 
these conjectures. Ruffo said the arrest is based solely on 
theory and not on hard facts. In a sense, he supports Sergio 
Ortiz Lara. 
  Ruffo has asked the federal government for more transparency 
and openness in its actions. He said that coordination--as 
required between state institutions and the federal 
government--must exist in incidents such as this. I questioned 
Mr. Ruffo during the news conference on the statements made this 
morning by Sergio Ortiz Lara. Ortiz Lara had indicated that 
these actions not only harm the Attorney General's Office, but 
they also harm other federal institutions and Ernesto Ruffo's 
government. In this regard, Ruffo said openness and 
transparency were needed, and he added that the government needs 
to avoid conjectures or empty theories, because it cannot 
operate under such conditions. Ruffo said authoritarianism is 
not the way such issues should be handled. He added that on 
this occasion the authorities had fallen into authoritarianism. 
  In conclusion, he said--after I had asked him whether this 
problem had become imminently political in nature--that the 
current situation of confrontation will prevent democracy from 
progressing. The truth is that one must not act on conjectures. 
He said that soon he will try to meet personally with President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari and with Government Secretary Jorge 
Cartizo. 
  He also said that, from his point of view, there is no 
relation between Sergio Ortiz's arrest and the murder of 
Municipal Security Director Federico Benitez. As everyone 
knows, Benitez was gunned down last Thursday at La Mesa while 
travelling with this bodyguard in an official vehicle. The 
state governor does not agree with the Federal Attorney 
General's Office handling of Ortiz Lara's arrest. He said this 
action is based on conjectures and not on hard facts. 
  He also said the matter of Cristine's disco, which was 
mentioned by Attorney General Diego Valades, is nothing more 
than speculation, because there is no specific information 
involving Sergio Ortiz Lara. 
  Unofficially, I would like to tell you that it has been 
learned that an arrest warrant has been issued against former 
Prosecutor Juan Francisco Franco Rios. As I already mentioned, 
he is considered responsible for having sold identification 
credentials to drug traffickers--in this case, to criminals who 
were killed at Cristine's during the shootout. 
  [Announcer] What party is Juan Francisco Franco linked to? 
  [Flores] Juan Francisco Franco Rios was, up intil two weeks 
ago, justice prosecutor. Of course, he belongs to the PAN 
[National Action Party] administration. This incident occurred 
barely one year after Ernesto Ruffo became governor. He has 
always been linked to drug trafficking matters. This 
information I am giving you is unofficial, although we will try 
to confirm it. A tight lid has been placed on this case. 
Deputy Prosecutor Sergio Ortiz Lara depended on former Justice 
Prosecutor Juan Francisco Franco Rios. This news is unofficial. 
It is very suspicious that just over a week ago he left his 
post and now no one know his whereabouts. The current 
prosecutor is Pedro Vidal Rosas. 
  [Announcer] Furthermore, Jaime--please allow me to make a 
comment and remind our listeners of this--I read a report two 
weeks ago in which the governor of Baja California referred to 
rumors linking his brother to drug trafficking. He said that if 
this were true he would put his brother in jail. Now we are 
hearing that, according to investigations and the events of the 
past few days, there is an apparent connection between members 
of PAN--and, remember, this assertion is not mine--and drug 
trafficking, which has also been linked to the arrest of Baja 
California Assistant Attorney General Sergio Ortiz Lara. You 
also pointed out and wondered whether this is not becoming a 
political or partisan issue and whether both sides--government 
officials and the PAN--should be called upon to fully adhere to 
the law. 
  [Flores] Well, reporter Ana Patricia asked Mr. Ruffo about 
that very same thing. His answer was this: Oh, the famous 
Claudio. He said it jokingly; he was smiling and calm. He said 
the only thing he knows about his brother is that he owes a debt 
to the Finance Secretariat involving some property he owns in a 
small town called Rosarito, 30 km south of Tijuana. He says his 
brother Claudio Ruffo's problems are exclusively under the 
jurisdiction of the Finance Secretariat, to which he owes an 
unspecified amount of money, and he admitted that his brother is 
living on the other side of the border. He said, however, that 
he is not aware of any lawsuit against Claudio, adding that 
action should be taken against his brother or anyone else 
charged with drug trafficking. Ruffo added that he has 18 more 
months in office and that his goal is to combat crime. This is 
exactly what Mr. Ruffo said about his brother.

  [Text] Mexico City, 5 May (EFE) -- Mexican authorities have 
seized a little more than 400 kg of cocaine paste and 
confiscated an aircraft that flew from Cali, Colombia, to the 
Cancun International Airport, a source at the Attorney General's 
Office [PGR] reported today. 
  The drugs were discovered in a building at the airport, near 
the aircraft whose range and speed, according to the PGR, make 
it ideal for transporting drugs. For this reason, the plane was 
confiscated and its two crewmen detained. 
  The authorities estimate that, considering price 
fluctuations 
and the quality of the drugs seized, the load would have yielded 
close to 6 million doses and would have had a market value of 
$50 million. The authorities said an investigation has been 
opened to determine the exact origin of the drugs and the 
involved of the plane's crew. 
  The PGR has reported that so far this year approximately 7.5 
metric tons of cocaine have been confiscated in various actions 
throughout the country.

<F P=106> [Article by Roberto Garduno Espinosa] </F>
  [Text] The Attorney General's Office (PGR) has said the 
arrest of Carlos Resendez Bertolousi in Monterrey is one of the 
most important blows dealt to drug trafficking. Resendez was in 
charge of laundering the money that the Tamaulipas 
Cartel made by selling drugs. The PGR added that the 
alleged criminal, who is linked to Juan Garcia Abrego, main 
Tamaulipas Cartel leader who is on the loose, was 
sent to the Topo Chico Social Readaptation Center [Centro de 
Readaptacion Social de Topo Chico] in Nuevo Leon State. 
  A group of judicial policemen led by Horacio Brunt Acosta 
received a tip on 19 March and arrested Resendez as Raymundo 
Gumaro Garza Sanchez and Eliseo Hernandez, who had $110,000 in 
their possession. The two men said the money came from the sale 
of 50 kg of cocaine owned by Resendez. 
  The PGR based its investigations on reports by the U.S. DEA 
and the Federal Judicial Police (PJF). These reports indicate 
the following: "Carlos Resendez is a key and essential figure in 
the operational and financial organization owned by Juan Garcia 
Abrego, currently on the loose and alleged author of many 
crimes, including health crimes, arms warehousing, and fraud 
[usurpacion de funciones]. 
  The relationship between the two capos began in 
1982, when Resendez was a Tamaulipas Judicial Police chief. 
Upon meeting Garcia, he offered him and his relatives 
protection. Years later, as he left the Judicial Police ranks, 
Resendez "suddenly" became a prominent businessman in charge of 
a company called Autolineas Mavi, Inc. 
  Two large economic transactions cast a shadow over Resendez. 
On 19 May 1993, he made deposits of up to 5 million new pesos 
in the Banorte Bank account no. 1023597771, under the name of 
Nohema Quintanilla, whom the PGR believes is his mistress. The 
second incident was the confiscation of $432,000 from Cornelio 
Herrera and Adriana Castrocerio, who claimed the money belonged 
to Resendez. 
  These reports indicate that the Tamaulipas Cartel, 
in operation for the last 15 years, is a multinational business 
whose tentacles reach to the United States, Mexico, Guatemala, 
El Salvador, and Colombia. In the United States, the cartel 
operates in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, California, Ohio, New 
York, and New Jersey. In Mexico, the criminal organization 
operates in 23 states. In addition, six estates, businesses, 
and companies linked to Resendez have been located. They all 
are under different names. 
<H5>  The Steps of Resendez </H5>
  The PGR also detected the purchase of five 1994 vehicles 
from 
the Country Car Company, whose alleged owner is Garcia Abrego. 
Another case involves the hiring of a "large group of exclusive 
artists," who would presumably perform at his daughter Zulema's 
wedding on 15 May. The PJF learned that Resendez introduced 
Ruben Ramirez to Juan Garcia Abrego to ensure that "Ramirez 
would become Garcia's legal representative in charge of 
recovering real estate and personal property owned by the 
Tamaulipas Cartel chief. 
  In late 1993, the PGR captured several cartel members and 
Garcia's henchmen, including Luis Medrano Garcia, Jose Medrano 
De la Rosa, and Adolfo De la Garza, whom the federal government 
will prosecute. Medrano De la Rosa is charged with murder and 
criminal association. 
  Our Monterrey correspondent, David Carrizales, reported that 
when Resendez was presented to the media he admitted to being a 
friend of Garcia Abrego's, but he said he is innocent of the 
drug trafficking charges. He added he is the victim of a 
vendetta by Eduardo Valle, private secretary of Attorney General 
Diego Valades Rios. 
  Resendez is in the custody of the 6th Topo Chico District 
Court. Two arrest warrants on two associates of Garcia Abrego's 
are still pending.

  [Text] Mexico, Federal District, 4 May (EFE) -- The Mexican 
Judicial Police have seized 5.8 tons of marijuana worth $36 
million, a spokesman for the Attorney General's Office (PGR) 
reported on Wednesday. 
  The operation was conducted in La Paz, capital of Baja 
California Sur State, some 1,250 kms northeast of Mexico City. 
  According to the available information, the seizure was made 
at a La Paz loading terminal during the inspection of a trailer 
that had come from the port of Mazatlan, Sinaloa State, one of 
the states with the highest incidence of narcotrafficking. 
  According to the driver, the truck was bound for the 
California border, where the drug would have a commercial value 
of $36 million. 
  The PGR is holding the truckdriver pending a decision on any 
penal action against him for crimes against the public health. 
It has also begun investigating the plan and possible 
accomplices of the prisoner, as well as the place of origin and 
the destination of the drugs.

  [Text] Federal Judicial Police (PJF) arrested an alleged 
drug trafficker in Tijuana, Baja California for trying to take 
317.2 kg of cocaine base to the United States. The drug would 
have been worth $30 million on the international market. 
  The PJF conducted three operations in Guerrero, Morelos, and 
Tijuana, seizing approximately two kg of pure heroin. 
Operations in four other states resulted in the seizure of 62 
kg of ephedrine and 1,024 kg of marijuana. In other operations 
conducted in seven states, 31 alleged drug traffickers were 
arrested and 13 vehicles confiscated. 
  The Attorney General's Office [PGR] reported that PJF 
members, on duty at the checkpoint (Precos) in Benjamin Hill 
Municipality along the Tijuana border with the United States 
forced a truck driver who was hauling lumber to stop for 
inspection. 
  The policemen carefully checked the vehicle inside and out 
and discovered a false bottom in which they found dozens of 
packages wrapped in plastic. 
  Upon removing the plastic, they found that the packages 
contained pure cocaine weighing a total of 317.2 kg. 
  Ramon Lopez Salazar, the truck driver, was taken to the PGR 
and charged with crimes against public health. The driver said 
he had picked up the drug in Ciudad Obregon, Sonora and was 
instructed to take it to the town of Progreso, Baja California, 
from where it would be smuggled into California in the United 
States. 
  The PGR said that if the 317.2 kg of pure cocaine had 
entered 
the drug market, it would have put some 5 million fixes into 
circulation. 
<H5>  Seizures in Seven States; 31 Alleged Drug Traffickers </H5>
Arrested 
  The PJF has seized nearly 2 kg of pure heroin, 62 kg of 
ephedrine, and one ton and 24 kg of marijuana in various 
operations in seven states. Police arrested 31 alleged drug 
traffickers and confiscated 13 vehicles. 
  In Guerrero, the PJF found 810 grams of heroin hidden 
between 
shoe boxes and car tires at a residence in Petatlan 
Municipality. Additionally, they arrested brothers Bartolo and 
Alejo Villasenor and Valente Nunez Cardenas. 
  In Morelos, four alleged drug traffickers in possession of 
613 grams of heroin were arrested. 
  A woman was arrested at Tijuana International Airport for 
having three packages containing 590 grams of heroin taped to 
her body. According to the PGR, the drug was detected by a 
"sniffer dog." 
  The woman told personnel at the Federal Prosecutor's Office 
that she received the drug from an individual in Caleta de 
Campos, Lazaro Cardenas Municipality, Michoacan, who paid her 
500 nuevos pesos to take it to Tijuana. 
  Another four people were arrested in various operations in 
Tijuana. Authorities seized from them a total of 62 kg and 460 
grams of the chemical precursor ephedrine, 181 kg and 280 grams 
of marijuana, and two trucks. 
  Meanwhile, a truck driver transporting 274 kg of marijuana 
inside his vehicle was arrested at a residence located at the 
km-17.5 marker on the road to San Felipe Ensenada, Baja 
California. 
  The PJF apprehended a bus driver from the Omnibus of Mexico 
line and his escort on the Durango-Parral road in the town of 
Morcillo, Durango. The report added that 107 kg of marijuana 
was inside the bus. 
  An individual who was promised $2,500 to transport 150 kg of 
marijuana to Vallecillo, Nuevo Laredo, was arrested in Nuevo 
Laredo, Tamaulipas. 
  Two people were arrested in El Precos, located at the km-163 
marker of the Mexico City-Laredo road, Linares-Hualahuises 
stretch. Officials seized 121 kg and 500 grams from these two 
individuals, who were accompanied by two children. 
  Several operations in Baja California Sur resulted in the 
seizure of 84 kg and 500 grams of marijuana and a vehicle and 
the arrest of three alleged drug traffickers.

<F P=106> [From the "Extravision" newscast; passages within quotation </F>
marks are recorded] 
  [Text]The Government Ministry will ask the National 
Legislative Assembly to expedite approval of the draft narcotics 
law. Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta today announced that 
the U.S. Government will contribute $100,000 to the fight 
against drug trafficking. He also announced that the Nicaraguan 
Government will present a formal request to the United States to 
open a DEA office in the country. [Sandinist] Deputy Doris 
Tijerino, chairperson of the Legislative Assembly drug 
committee, recently warned of the danger that such a move would 
represent, saying that opening a DEA office in Nicaragua would 
be an affront to national sovereignty. 
  Minister Alfredo Mendieta rejected drug trafficking charges 
against members of the National Police [PN], calling the 
incidents a campaign to discredit the institution. Today he 
denied that any high-ranking PN officer was involved in drug 
trafficking and affirmed that there are political motives behind 
the accusations. 
  [Mendieta] "I strongly deny that the PN, as an institution, 
could be involved in any way. I strongly reject any implication 
of involvement by PN Brigade Commander Fernando Caldera. I 
think it is all politically motivated. Although this may 
surprise the media, I think there are some politicians behind 
all this, as I have said from the beginning." 
  Commander Roger Ramirez said that he has done nothing 
illegal, much less behind the backs of the PN commanders. He 
was referring to his 25-percent partnership in a hotel on Corn 
Island, which represents a $55,000 investment. He said he 
received the money as compensation from the Government Ministry. 
Mendieta confirmed Ramirez' statements. 
  [Mendieta] "We have no evidence indicating that Commander 
Ramirez was ever involved in drug trafficking or any other 
drug-related crime. We are aware of Mr. Ramirez' investments, 
and he has told us that these funds came from payments made by 
the Government Ministry during his transition and in 
compensation for injuries sustained in the line of duty." 
  The government minister today strongly criticized those who 
want to discredit the PN. 
  [Mendieta] "You cannot implicate an institution such as the 
PN, which has demonstrated a high degree of efficiency in the 
fight against drug trafficking. Furthermore, we believe it is 
even more dangerous to implicate certain individuals who are in 
fact involved in drug trafficking." [sentence as heard] 
  Commander Roger Ramirez stated that he has the full support 
of Brigade Commander Augusto Fernando Caldera as well as of his 
commanding officer, Lionel Espinosa, both of whom are well aware 
of the fact that he requested his discharge for family and 
health reasons. Ramirez said he has no enemies in the PN ranks. 
  [Ramirez] "If there is any kind of ill will over this whole 
matter, as some newspaper reports indicate, I do not think it is 
coming from the PN. Then again, I cannot say that for a fact, 
because one minute you think you have friends, and the next they 
stab you in the back." 
  Ramirez said his conscience is clean. 
  [Ramirez] "I think there are some people interested in 
discrediting me simply because I tried to maintain a 
professional image within the institution in accordance with the 
ground rules the government set forth for the institutions that 
make up the Armed Forces. In the end, I have a clean and 
peaceful conscience." 
  Commander Roger Ramirez presented documentation for his 
partnership in the Corn Island hotel and for his bank accounts 
and bank deposits, which total less than $12,000. 
  [Managua EL NUEVO DIARIO in Spanish on 2 May publishes a 
475-word report on pages 1 and 8 stating that "EL NUEVO DIARIO 
has learned that PN Brigade Commander Caldera forced Commander 
Roger Ramirez to resign." The report goes on to say that "our 
sources assured us that Ramirez was found to have a checking 
account with a $240,000 balance, which he could not explain," 
adding that the "DEA advised Caldera that the funds were from 
drug trafficking activities." The report warns that "the 
entangling nets of drug trafficking are gaining ground in 
Nicaragua," pointing out that "one high-ranking officer has 
become addicted to cocaine" and the identity of another, "known 
as the `narco-policeman', will soon be released."]

  [Text] Panama City, 4 May (ACAN-EFE) -- The Panamanian 
police confiscated from the "Cali Cartel" 900 kg of cocaine 
worth $36 million. The cocaine was going to be sent by land to 
Guatemala for shipment to the United States. 
  Idelfonso Suira, head of criminal investigations of the 
Judicial Technical Police (PTJ), confirmed today in a news 
conference the arrest of six Panamanians, four Colombians, and 
one Peruvian linked to the drug shipment, one of the country's 
largest. Authorities did not release the names of the persons 
arrested and who were placed in the custody of the Attorney 
General's Office. The authorities did say that the drugs 
belonged to the international gang known as the "Cali Cartel," 
because it is based in that Colombian city. 
  Suira said that the drugs, wrapped in red, yellow, and green 
1-kg packages, were seized in an auto repair shop in Panama 
City. The repair shop was preparing a false bottom in a vehicle 
to be used to take the cocaine to Guatemala. 
  The General Customs Directorate (DGA) reported that during 
the four years of President Guillermo Endara's mandate, the DGA 
alone seized more than 4.5 tons of drugs worth $230.7 million 
and 312 persons of various nationalities were arrested, 98 of 
them women. Some of the largest cocaine shipments, amounting to 
several hundred kg, have been seized in the Colon Free Zone, one 
of Latin America's largest free zones. Panama's security 
organizations publicly pledged not to allow the Colombian mafia 
or guerrillas to plant coca leaves in Panamanian territory, 
which, together with drug trafficking to U.S. markets, has 
become another threat to the country. 
  Last month brought to a close a long joint operation in 
Panama with the assistance of Colombia and the United States, in 
which several plantations in the Darien jungle in southern 
Panama were destroyed. The United States has warned of drug 
traffickers' interest in Panama due to its free zone, 
international banking center, and permissive corporate laws. 
Nevertheless, U.S. Government drug "Czar" Lee Brown, 
responsible for fighting drugs, said that the current Panamanian 
civilian government in 18 months has seized more drugs that 
during the 20 years of military dictatorship. In 1993, nearly 4 
tons of drugs were seized in Panama, mostly cocaine from 
Colombia, while in the two preceding years a total of only 3 
tons were seized. 
  Major Jose Rosas, director of the National Maritime Service 
(SMN), told ACAN-EFE that drug trafficking activity in Panama 
has dropped since 1993, at least with regards to maritime 
surveillance. In 1992, he said, packets of cocaine that were 
dropped into the sea from night flights fell like rain on 
Panamanian coasts. The increase in drug trafficking led the 
government to authorize the construction of several naval bases 
to resupply SMN patrol boats, both in the Gulf of Panama as well 
as in the western area bordering Costa Rica.

  [Text] Approximately 900 kg of cocaine valued at $36 
million were seized yesterday in the port of Coco Solo, Colon 
Province. The cocaine was contained in two ships, Panamanian- 
and Honduran-flagged vessels, Judicial Technical Police (PTJ) 
sources have revealed. 
  The drugs were seized in a joint operation conducted by the 
Third Prosecutor's Office in Colon, the Secretariat of 
Narcotics, and PTJ agents, according to sources. The operation 
was supervisized by Prosecutor Manuel Sucaris and Narcotics 
Secretary Natzul Poso. 
  Eight people, including Panamanians and foreign nationals, 
were arrested in yesterday's operation, it was reported. 
  According to sources, the drugs were to be transshipped 
abroad. Two days ago, another 900 kg of cocaine, belonging to 
the Cali Cartel, were seized and 11 people were arrested in the 
area of La Rivera, Pedregal Corregimiento. 
  Detective Idelfonso Suira, chief of criminal investigations 
of the PTJ, reported the shipment of drugs seized two days ago 
was found in a double-bottomed container, which was to be 
transported to Guatemala and then to the United States.

  [Excerpts] Ernesto Perez Balladares, presidential candidate 
of the United People alliance, went to the San Fernando Hospital 
for a drug test, which came out negative. Perez Balladares 
stressed that if he wins the presidential elections, he will 
implement a vigorous policy against drug trafficking. 
  [Begin recording] [Perez Balladares] I came for a drug test 
because I think the Panamanian people have the right to demand 
and to know whether their candidates are using chemical 
substances. I also had a stress test because I think the next 
president should have enough physical stamina and be in good 
enough health to keep the promises made to the Panamanian people. 
  [Ortega] Could this be viewed as a prelude to your 
government's policy against drugs? 
  [Perez Balladares] You can be sure that if I took the test, 
I 
will demand that everyone else do likewise. [passage omitted] 
  [Ortega] Why did you take the drug test? Have other 
candidates done the same? 
  [Perez Balladares] I hope we all do it. I think it should be 
done as a sign of respect for the Panamanian people so they can 
be sure that none of us use any type of chemical substance. [end

  [Text] Superintendent General Publio Fretes Fernandez, 
retired--the head of the National Narcotics Directorate 
(Dinar)--has stated that Paraguay urgently needs a law to stop 
money laundering because drug money is being actively laundered 
in Paraguay. He announced that a bill will be submitted to 
Congress soon. "Money is being laundered on a regular basis in 
Paraguay. There is no other explanation for the ease with which 
so many people mysteriously invest money in our country," Fretes 
said. The high-ranking police officer explained that there is 
abundant and obvious evidence that a lot of money from doubtful 
sources openly circulates in Paraguay. 
  He added: "You can see the high-rise buildings, stadiums, 
and 
amphitheaters that have sprouted like mushrooms after rain in 
Asuncion and its suburbs. A lot of money is involved, a lot of 
investments." 
  He explained: "Even though Dinar does not have a law on 
which 
to act, it investigates to the extent possible. It would be 
impossible for those involved to identify any legal source for 
their capital. These are reliable signs that drug money is 
laundered in Paraguay." 
  The chief of Dinar added that since he took over the Police 
Investigative Department he noticed the swift and easy 
"circulation" of large amount of cash. 
  "At the airport we frequently find people bringing in or 
taking out $800,000 or $900,000. Asked about the source of this 
money, they merely say it was taken it out of a bank. We can do 
nothing because we had no law to back us up. These amounts of 
money are bound to draw attention," the police officer explained 
when talking about the clues available to the drug enforcement 
police. Fretes added that his organization, which is under the 
jurisdiction of the National Antinarcotics Secretariat (Senad), 
is drawing up a bill which it will submit to Congress in due 
time.

  [Text] The 290 kg of crystallized cocaine that National 
Narcotics Directorate (Dinar) personnel recently seized in 
Vallemi is allegedly linked to the ongoing exchange of 
Paraguayan cattle for high-grade Bolivian cocaine. 
  Police sources released this information yesterday, adding 
that the backgrounds of several local cattle breeders are 
currently under investigation. 
  It is assumed that the cocaine is being brought into 
Paraguay 
and exchanged for cattle, preferably cows capable of surviving 
and reproducing in the Bolivian climate, so as to replenish 
Bolivia's cattle stock. 
  Drug enforcement agents arrested Paraguayans Victoriano 
Gomez, 41, ID card No. 2,919,135; and Juan Albino Frutos, 44, a 
tradesman born in Bahia Negra, ID card No. 1,788,598. 
  The two were carrying 20 kg of crystallized cocaine en route 
to Europe, where the black market value of the shipment is over 
$20 million. 
  Initial reports indicated that the discovery and seizure of 
the narcotics was possible thanks to information that the U.S. 
Embassy in Asuncion supplied to Dinar. 
  According to rumors, the U.S. Embassy received encrypted 
information on this affair via satellite from the Department of 
State in Washington, following an investigation ordered by the 
Pentagon. 
  Reliable sources have indicated that the Clinton 
administration is closely following South American drug 
enforcement programs, especially in Bolivia and Paraguay, an 
area which is considered to be "of interest for the security of 
the United States." 
  It would seem that the recent seizure in Vallemi awakened a 
great deal of interest among Washington officials because the 
"cattle meat" connection is involved, sources close to the case 
said. 
  Meanwhile, Dinar sources have been saying that the seizure 
in 
Vallemi was the result of patient investigations carried out in 
Fuerte Olimpo and Bahia Negra.

  [Text] Lima, 5 May (EFE) -- It was reported officially 
today that a Peruvian military court has annulled the life 
prison sentence imposed in March on drug trafficker Demetrio 
Chavez, aka Vaticano, and has sentenced him to 30 years in 
prison. 
  The maximum sentence for Vaticano was commuted by the 
Supreme 
Court of Military Justice (CSJM) because although it believed 
Vaticano cooperated with terrorist groups, he never participated 
directly in murders. 
  The CSJM, which also sentenced Chavez to pay $50 million in 
compensation to the government, reported that it has been proven 
that Vaticano maintained close links with terrorists, and 
exerted influence on armed groups, especially on the Shining 
Path [SL], based on his economic power. 
  "That allowed the SL to intensify actions in that zone (the 
Huallaga Valley) and in several other parts of the country, with 
the resulting selective murders," a document released by the 
CSJM states. 
  The document states that Vaticano's influence reached, among 
other zones, the Cuchara Valley, where since 5 April security 
forces have been carrying out a great antisubversive offensive. 
  The SL protected the illegal airports and the landings and 
takeoffs of the airplanes in which Vaticano had been sending 
drugs to Colombia since 1990, the document states. 
  In exchange, the drug trafficker gave the SL weapons, 
ammunition, communications equipment, and from $10,000 to 
$20,000 in cash for every airplane that took off with 500 kg of 
cocaine. 
  Demetrio Chavez was arrested on 28 February in Cali, 
Colombia, during an operation coordinated between the Colombian 
and Peruvian authorities, and expelled on the same day to Peru 
as an "undesirable."

  [Text] Beside the serious problem created by the poppy 
cultivations found in various regions of the Amazonas 
Department, thousands of hectares of illegal coca are being 
grown in other regions of this department, specifically in the 
Utcubamba and Condorcanqui Provinces. 
  According to spokesmen of the Army 5th Jungle Infantry 
Division, which is headquartered in El Milagro, it is estimated 
that in those two provinces about 10,000 hectares of coca are 
being grown, much of it in full growth while some has already 
been harvested. 
  "The case is worrisome and if no measures are taken, 
Condorcanqui and Utcubamba may become the new bastions of 
trafficking" said a high military officer. He revealed that one 
month ago a group of U.S. Embassy and DEA officials came to El 
Milagro base to verify this information. 
  He added: "They gathered information, offered aid, but so 
far 
nothing happened." 
  Coca is being grown in the mountains in zones which, by 
contrast with the Huallaga region, cannot be seen from a 
helicopter, they can only be reached by walking. 
  In Condorcanqui Province, the coca fields begin in El Muyo 
settlement (about four hours by car from Bagua Chica) and 
continue through Tutuberos, Montenegro, Soldado Oliva, 
Shunshunga, Nazareno, Yusabarranca, San Rafael, Mesones Muro, 
and end in Imazita. 
  All the settlements are alongside the Transversal de la 
Selva 
highway that goes alongside the Maranon River. 
  At the other extreme, in Utcubamba Province, the coca fields 
begin in Tiricon and continue through La Union, Tupac Amaru, El 
Paraiso, Yusubarranca, El Tambo, and end in Santa Maria de Nieva. 
  The 5th Jungle Infantry Division, which is headquartered in 
El Milagro, is trying to control trafficking in this zone even 
though their exclusive task is to watch over the border zone in 
the Condor mountain range. 
  Their sporadic operations are sometimes wasted, as verified 
by reporters of our newspaper when, with a military patrol, they 
entered the jungle in Mirana Alta. 
  There, the soldiers discovered that the six coca maceration 
pits they destroyed one month ago were operating again. Even 
worse, they found coca already processed. 
  The work of the Interior Ministry and the Police are 
practically null. Their personnel only go after people wanted 
for interrogation or they investigate trafficking cases when the 
Army gets the means and the personnel, and invites them to go 
into the jungle. 
  And when they go, their work is unbelievable. There in the 
mountains they are exposed to the sun and the torrential rains 
that sometimes fall. 
  Alamiro Bustamante, provincial assistant prosecutor of 
Bagua, 
said: "They should hear in Lima how they have to work. 
Truthfully, there is little we can do."

<F P=106> [Report by Monica Vecco] </F>
  [Excerpts] During a visit to the basin of the Pichis and 
Palcazu Rivers, LA REPUBLICA established that several groups of 
drug traffickers from San Martin and Ucayali--which managed to 
dodge repression by the security forces--now operate in the 
mountainous Pasco region. 
  Laboratories for the production of cocaine base paste, large 
quantities of precursors, groups of Colombian henchmen, and 
airstrips for the clandestine shipping of drugs dominate the 
region where three successive governments have unsuccessfully 
tried to execute a regional development program. 
  Dozens of Peruvian and Colombian "firms," most of them from 
Uchiza, operate in the Pichis-Palcazu region. 
  The region is shared by the Colombian "Palenque," "Crespo," 
and "Palito" firms, and Peruvian traffickers Reynaldo Quiroz 
Ruiz, aka "Pacho," Luis Lopez Aguilar, aka "Somoza," "Cabezon," 
"Tio Rios," "Raymond," "Los Ayacuchanos," "Rene," and "Lucho 
Pelado." 
  "Lucho Pelado" comes from Tocache and heads a "firm" that 
purchases large quantities of cocaine paste. This firm operated 
in Uchiza, Aguaytia, and Zungaro, where it handled about 500 kg 
per month of washed cocaine paste. 
  Colombian drug trafficker "Crespo," who previously operated 
in Campanilla and Saposoa, is one of the largest buyers in the 
zone. He moves approximately one tonne of washed cocaine paste 
per month. 
  "Somoza," who operated in Sion and Juanjui, is one of the 
few 
to have a cocaine hydrochloride laboratory in San Juan town, two 
and one half hours up the Pichis River. 
  But the most powerful firm belongs to the much-feared 
Colombian trafficker "Palenque," who is responsible for an 
average of three 600-kg drug flights per week, that is, 
approximately two tonnes per week. 
  Three new "firms" started in the region about two weeks ago. 
Among them is "La Coneja," which used to supply precursors to 
the Cachique Rivera brothers in Aguaytia. The firm allegedly 
represents the Cachique Rivera brothers. 
  On 26 March, "Palenque"--who is one of the cruelest 
traffickers--sent his henchmen to set fire to "La Coneja's" 
laboratory on the Palcazu River bank. About 15 neighboring 
houses also caught fire and were reduced to cinders. 
  "La Coneja," who drives a late-model white Tercel along the 
dusty roads of Palcazu town, has been warned to leave. 
  Previously "Palenque" opposed the entry of the Cachique 
Rivera brothers who moved with their army of henchmen to 
Iscozacin, from where they currently make their shipments to 
Colombia. 
  The "colochos" (Colombians) hold the monopoly of the cocaine 
hydrochloride production and zealously defend it from any 
Peruvian "firms" that want to supply the Cali Cartel. The 
Cachique Rivera brothers are the only ones who have the mafia's 
authorization to produce cocaine hydrochloride. 
  In June and November 1993 joint DEA and Navy forces used 
five 
gunships during operations in Palcazu and Puerto Victoria. On 
both occasions the traffickers were warned and managed "to flee" 
in time. 
  LA REPUBLICA learned that some "firms" took refuge in Puerto 
Bermudez, where the Army's OR 34-A Oxapampa battalion is 
stationed. Some battalion officers reportedly receive 
"protection fees" to turn a blind eye to the traffickers 
activities. 
  It is said that while Captain Marcos Rios Ruiz was commander 
of this Army base--between April and August 1993--drug planes 
were seen operating from the Puerto Bermudez commercial airport. 
  A merchant who chose not to identify himself said: "Everyone 
knew this was going on but could say nothing out of fear." 
  Civilians charged that the Army captain received "protection 
fees" to allow traffickers to operate. 
  Puerto Bermudez Mayor Evaristo Zumaran Cayata was also 
charged with cooperating with the "firms." The "Juana Corina" 
mothers club in Puerto Bermudez accused the mayor of "pocketing" 
$4,000 for every flight he authorized. 
  During a heated meeting on 2 January 1993, the mothers asked 
Zumaran Cayata "to say what happened to the money he received 
for signing permits. It was to have been used for local 
projects." 
  Neither the mayor nor Judge Jorge Camacho, who was his aide 
and was also accused of corruption on the same occasion, 
answered. 
  Machinery belonging to Puerto Bermudez City Hall was used to 
improve the Gavilan airstrip that was administered by "Somoza" 
and hired to other "firms." 
  Army Captain Carlos "Alex" Alzamora replaced Rios Ruiz. 
According to civilian sources, he allowed traffickers to set up 
a clandestine airstrip along a portion of the Marginal highway 
near the town of Gavilan, 7 km from Puerto Bermudez. 
  Some honest people of the region have stated that before 
Alzamora was replaced by Captain "Coyote" [not further 
identified] in December 1993, the number of "firms" increased, 
converting the peaceful town of Puerto Bermudez into a shelter 
for traffickers. 
  Last 24 March, a high-ranking officer from the Army 
Inspector's department arrived in a MI-17 helicopter to inspect 
the military units in Oxapampa. 
  Just three days before, the newly appointed commander of 
Puerto Bermudez battalion, Captain "James" Becerra Luna, gave 
orders for the Gavilan clandestine airstrip to be mined and 
surrounded by barbed wire to prevent traffickers from using it. 
They only left one four-meter wide lane open for the 
circulation of traffic. 
  Less than 150 meters away, on the Marginal highway, is a 
checkpoint where the Army permanently checks the circulation of 
vehicles and passengers from La Merced to the Pichis-Palcazu 
valley. 
  A month earlier the FAP [Peruvian Air Force] placed concrete 
and steel blocs that were ripped out and only replaced after 
drug planes had been allowed to land. 
  One wood cutter of the zone said: "The soldiers blocked the 
way when an aircraft was about to land." 
  As soon as one landing strip is destroyed the traffickers 
build another. 
  Some 3 km from Gavilan is the Cajonari airstrip and two 
hours 
up the Pichis River the "Pacho" firm has a 900-meter strip in 
San Jose de Azupizu, from where an average of three aircraft a 
week take off. 
  There are more strips along the Pichis River in San Juan 
(where "Somoza" firm has a cocaine hydrochloride laboratory), 
San Pedro, San Pablo, and Santa Isabel towns. 
  The Cajonari and Lorenzillo Uno airstrips are located in the 
60 km that separates Puerto Bermudez from Palcazu. 
  In the towns of Raya, Esperanza, Quirishiari (an indigenous 
Ashaninka Indian settlement), Siria, Lorenzo, Lorenzillo Uno, 
and Lorenzillo Dos, which are between Puerto Bermudez and 
Palcazu, there are large coca leave plantations and laboratories 
where "Pepe," a chemist from Pucallpa, turns coca leaves into 
cocaine base. 
  There are airstrips in Puerto Victoria and Isla Codo, the 
latter is just one hour from Ciudad Constitucion, on the Pichis 
River. The Cachique Rivera brothers allegedly have a cocaine 
hydrochloride laboratory in Ciudad Constitucion. 
  In the town of Santa Rosa de Chivis, one hour from Gavilan 
by 
the Marginal highway, the traffickers have another airstrip. 
  To build this airstrip, last September the traffickers 
seized 
machinery belonging to the Pichis-Palcazu project and abducted 
one of the operators who was only found after two days of an 
exhaustive search. 
  Palcazu, 150 km from La Merced town along the Marginal 
highway, is the main drug center for the valley which has many 
laboratories where merchants deliver the unrefined or processed 
drugs. 
  Local inhabitants say it "is the center" where the main 
firms 
as well as henchmen, prostitutes, and terrorists gather after 
fleeing from Huallaga. 
  Palcazu bridge is one of the favorite places to close deals. 
This is where the merchants--who ride motorcycles or brand new 
pickups--bring their knapsacks containing their work tools 
(spoons and candles) to test how pure the drug is. 
  In Puerto Bermudez the drug is more pure, therefore, it 
costs 
more. Merchants pay up to $720 per kg of "base," while in 
Palcazu the price is $650. 
  In Zungaro, Aguaytia, and Pucallpa "base" costs $520 per kg. 
  Approximately 7.5 kg of cocaine "paste" is obtained from 100 
square meters of coca plantation. About 3 kg of "base" or 
"washed paste" is obtained from 7.5 kg of cocaine "paste". 
About 1 kg of cocaine hydrochloride is obtained from 1 kg of 
cocaine "base." 
  The arrival of thousands of people and the circulation of 
hundreds of thousands of dollars in the Pichis-Palcazu Valley 
seems to have brought the prosperity settlers expected from 
ambitious development projects. Prosperity is apparent. 
  Towns may lack water, electricity, airfields, sewerage 
systems, and telephones but just as in the Huallaga valley, 
trafficking has attracted many prostitutes, common criminals, 
and subversives who "escaped" from Huallaga. 
  The latest population and housing census shows that the 
population of Palcazu increased from 16,000 to almost 20,000 
people following the coca migration. [passage omitted] 
  But the most serious concern for farmers in the zone is that 
the wide area opened by traffickers in Pichis-Palcazu threatens 
the native forest of the high jungle region. 
  Hundreds of thousands of hectares, where not even a single 
coca plant was grown, are now being destroyed. The rivers are 
beginning to show the first signs of contamination due to the 
indiscriminate dumping of chemicals used for making drugs.

<F P=106> [Article by Miguel Ramirez from the EL COMERCIO Research </F>
Unit] 
  [Text] (Chachapoyas) -- Poppy sowing areas and small 
cultivation plots are multiplying dangerously in the mountain 
regions of Amazonas Department. The forces of order cannot 
reach these sites because of a lack of logistical support and 
financial resources. Opium is extracted from the poppy and then 
processed into morphine and heroin. 
  EL COMERCIO reporters have confirmed that they surveyed the 
zone for two weeks, and found one of these sowing areas no more 
than 50 meters long. 
  In these areas, also known as pits or nurseries, the poppy 
seeds are sown and then transplanted to the cultivation plots. 
One teaspoon of poppy seeds is sold for between $400 and $450, 
while 1 kg of opium latex is sold for between $1,000 and $1,500. 
  We found the sowing area in a region of Rodriguez Mendoza 
Province, after an 18-hour walk and after having climbed steep 
and rough mountains. We were accompanied by a group of "poppy 
growers" whom we convinced to let us take a few photographs. 
  In the region the poppies were sown between January and 
February. According to the poppy growers the plants were still 
small, and would not be ready for harvesting until they are five 
months old, or some time between June and July. 
<H5>  Lack of Resources Prevent Sending Patrols to Region </H5>
  The National Police provincial chiefs in Jaen, Bagua Chica, 
Utcubamba, Chachapoyas, and Rodriguez de Mendoza have large 
amounts of data on these sowing areas, but their facilities are 
precarious, they lack specialized personnel and, worse still, 
they have no money to finance operations in the field or to pay 
guides to take them to the plantations. 
  The situation of the contingents of the 5th Army Division of 
Jungle Infantry stationed at the El Milagro settlement is very 
similar. This division is commanded by General Vladimiro Lopez. 
  An antinarcotics police chief of the Second Region of the 
Peruvian National Police in Chiclayo, which is commanded by 
Carlos Rodriguez Hurtado and covers the Amazonas Department 
jurisdiction, told us that "we have trustworthy reports about 
these plantations, but in order to reach them we need resources, 
because this sort of operation can last weeks or even entire 
months." 
  It is not easy to reach the poppy sowing areas or 
plantations. They are never near villages or settlements, and 
never near roads, trails, or rivers. 
  They are in the middle of rough mountains that are difficult 
to climb. The poppy growers get there after walking for days 
under the pouring rain that falls in the region at this time of 
the year. 
  Police forces still cannot reach these places. For the time 
being, they limit themselves to collecting data obtained from 
peasants or friends who for various reasons come to the police 
and military barracks. 
  Thus the Chiclayo and Jaen police offices and, in 
particular, 
the Chachapoyas and Rodriguez de Mendoza offices received 
reports that in the latter province there are small poppy 
plantations in the settlements of Chirimoto, Limabamba, Omia, 
Huambo, Millpuc, Totora, and Rio Verde. 
  It was in one of those settlements that EL COMERCIO found 
the 
small poppy sowing areas. 
  Similar poppy sowing areas can be found at the settlements 
of 
Chirinos, La Colpa, and Nuevo Mundo (in San Ignacio), Naranjos, 
Molipampa, and Jumbilla (near Chachapoyas), and at Chontali (in 
Jaen). 
  It must be pointed out that these settlements are only 
mentioned as points of reference, because to reach the sowing 
areas and plantations one has to walk for days. It must also be 
emphasized that the forces of order are not in any condition to 
get there for lack of the necessary resources. 
  The police reports that are regularly sent to the Antidrugs 
Division (Dinandro), headquartered in Lima, state in their 
conclusions that "for lack of logistical material and financial 
resources, and due to unfavorable geological, geographic, and 
climatic factors, the forces of order cannot reach and destroy 
the coca and marijuana plantations nor the poppy plantations 
which, to a certain extent, are smaller (one of these reports 
was dated 5 April 1994, and was prepared by the Chachapoyas 
Provincial Police Station). 
  The reports conclude, more or less, as follows: "To 
neutralize and eradicate the drug trafficking activities in our 
jurisdiction, it is recommended that the command organize joint 
Peruvian Army- Peruvian National Police teams, duly comprised of 
specialized personnel for military-police operations and having 
air and ground support, to achieve positive results in the 
antidrug effort." 
<H5>  The Poppy Growers' Routes </H5>
  As a matter of fact, the logistical material of the police 
precincts is deplorable. The Chiclayo Antinarcotics Directorate 
office, for example, is located in the "Tupac Amaru" shantytown. 
It has no vehicles, and does not even have a telephone for its 
communications. 
  The same thing is true in Bagua, where the only truck the 
police have is out of order. At Rodriguez de Mendoza there is 
an old vehicle that is unsuitable for such rough terrain. 
  Those who are conducting investigations in the region have 
still not clearly established the poppy growers' modus operandi 
or the routes they use. They have indications, however, that 
the opium obtained at Rodriguez de Mendoza is leaving the region 
through rough trails that lead to San Martin, while the opium 
obtained at San Ignacio leaves the region through Huancabamba. 
  Opium leaving Rodriguez de Mendoza is also allegedly being 
taken to Utcubamba ([word indistinct] Grande), and then to 
Chiclayo. This was learned when Jorge Inga (33) was arrested 
last year with opium latex that had been given to him by another 
person in Utcubamba. 
  Peasants of the region have confirmed that these plantations 
are being encouraged by people coming from the east, i.e, from 
San Martin, across the Amazonas Department border. 
<H5>  Other Plantations Detected </H5>
  Interior Ministry sources and General Tomas Marki Montero, 
head of the Ayacucho Policial Military Command, have reported on 
several other plantations in addition to those detected by EL 
COMERCIO. 
  Poppy plantations were thus also detected in Nuevo 
Cajamarca, 
Roque, Sauce, Soritor, and Bambamarca, as well as in the 
Ayacucho jungle and on the Apurimac River banks.

  [Excerpt] Last week THE CRUSADER took issue with the Prime 
Minister for his Independence Message Statement that "we have no 
hostile borders to defend." We were also very concerned at the 
Prime Minister's announcement that off-shore banking was poised 
to become the ``fourth leg'' of the St. Lucia Economy. Surely 
the track-record of offshore companies in the Caribbean is 
chequered enough to indicate the need for circumspection and 
caution in entertaining the idea of offshore Banking Services in 
St. Lucia. The sudden and precipitous manner in which St. 
Lucians received the news that the government had already 
decided that offshore services would be the "Fourth Leg" of the 
economy, was enough to generate anger about the lack of 
consultation in such matters. 
  This month St. Lucia features prominently in a scandal in 
which US$23 million in drug money was laundered through an 
offshore bank by the name of Commerce Clearing Trust Company 
Limited International. This Bank is based in St. Lucia. It was 
chartered on April 3, 1992 and listed a registered office at 37 
Jeremie Street, Castries St. Lucia. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Samuel Blixen] </F>
  [Excerpts] Approximately a month ago, the interior minister 
installed an Anti-Mafia Unit to try--through intelligence 
work--to break up the connection between police officers and 
Uruguayan criminal organizations. These organizations are part 
of international mafia networks dedicated to white slave trading 
and drug trafficking. 
  The classified information being handled by the Interior 
Ministry reveals that mafia infiltration into various domestic 
circles has affected an alarming number of middle- and 
high-ranking police officers. 
  There are numerous indications that organizations dedicated 
to the white slave trade and drug trafficking have developed 
support structures at the neighborhood level and in sports and 
recreational organizations. 
  But these mafias have not enrolled only police officers. 
Police, congressional, and judicial documents indicate that the 
mafias have also ensured the complicity of sports entrepreneurs, 
professional sportsmen, and people in the entertainment 
business. The reports even included the name of one deputy. 
  The evidence of the degree of development and impunity of 
these criminal organizations with international connections has 
alarmed people at the highest levels. It is believed that these 
mafias are trying to create social support bases such as those 
in Brazil, Bolivia, and Colombia. In these countries drug 
traffickers control entire neighborhoods, as well as entire 
lines of productive activities. 
  National mafias combine violence, coercion, and corruption 
to 
protect an impunity system that has been characterized as 
"shameless." 
  In this respect, the "total inefficiency" of the police 
organizations responsible for the repression of the white slave 
trade in trying to stem the constant "export of prostitutes" is 
considered a key factor in the growing power garnered by 
Uruguayan mafias. 
  Some legislators think that the absolute impunity enjoyed by 
"pimps and dealers" ["fiolos"], their intermediaries, and 
contacts with organizations managing the international criminal 
trade constitutes a threat to institutional powers. 
  The creation of the Anti-Mafia Unit is the consequence of 
the 
fear and concern expressed in political circles over the 
increasing levels of corruption provoked by these organizations. 
The considerable international economic power of these groups 
is derived from criminal activity considered to be an 
international "scourge." 
  The information collected during the investigation of some 
concrete cases has confirmed that in Uruguay there is an 
interaction between drug trafficking, the white slave trade, and 
contraband. 
  BRECHA learned that the Anti-Mafia Unit has begun to process 
information from various sources, and has launched an 
investigation into the origin of capital that permits some 
individuals to enjoy a lifestyle not in accordance with their 
"official" incomes. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  War on Mafias </H5>
  The official inability to act, the reiteration of classified 
reports, and the need to face the power of the mafias has forced 
the Human Rights Committee to take the initiative to coordinate 
efforts in this area. It was estimated that the situation was 
extremely serious and out of control at the beginning of March. 
Committee members held several meetings with Interior Minister 
Raul Iturria and Interior Under Secretary Juan Luis Storace to 
demand an effective offensive against criminal structures and 
the police protection they enjoy. 
  The decision to create the Anti-Mafia Unit was the result of 
these closed-door meetings. There was a tacit agreement between 
the ministry and the committee not to hinder the investigations, 
no matter who is involved. 
  The unit is made up by three high-ranking officials whose 
backgrounds have assured and satisfied the legislators. The 
unit will be directly subordinated to the interior minister. 
One high-ranking official will operate in the administrative 
field, a second will be responsible for international relations, 
and the third will move in the field of police intelligence. 
(BRECHA will omit the names of these officials and the names of 
individuals suspected of involvement in illegal activates, 
witnesses, and those who denounced the illegal acts, for obvious 
reasons and so as not to hinder the investigations under way.) 
  At first it was said that the government decision might 
imply 
an action similar to the "Clean Hands Operation" now under way 
in Italy. That was allegedly the initial idea, but Minister 
Iturria decided to keep a low profile. The minister told BRECHA 
that despite the existence of elements implicating police 
offices with the mafias, "it is difficult to obtain proof 
through administrative investigations." Besides, the minister 
intends to act cautiously "in order not to affect the entire 
police institution, which is indispensable to any 
administration." Officially, Minister Iturria prefers to face 
the offensive against organized crime with a "reorganization" 
that will place the investigation and repression of the 
so-called "international crimes" under his portfolio's 
jurisdiction. An expression of that reorganization is the 
decision to move the intelligence, narcotics, and Interpol 
departments from under the jurisdiction of the Montevideo Police 
Department. 
  Other officials think the Interior Ministry will not be able 
to destroy the mafia organizations without an in-depth attack 
against police corruption. "Otherwise those involved in the 
white slave trade and drug trafficking will continue to act with 
impunity," a deputy told BRECHA. The deputy said he was willing 
to wait a reasonable time for results before proposing other 
measures.

  [Text] Caracas, 4 May (EFE) -- Commenting on a court 
decision acquitting 32 presumed drug traffickers, Judge Mildred 
Camero denounced on 4 May that drug trafficking has infiltrated 
all levels of the Venezuelan judicial branch. 
  Camero, judge of the Second Trial Court, said the judicial 
branch has lost credibility in Venezuela. 
  "Drug trafficking is everywhere and is increasingly 
corrupting those institutions that were once untouchable. We 
must adopt a firm position on the drug problem," she said. 
  Camero said there is money laundering and the legalization 
of 
drug-related capital in Venezuela. She added there seems to be 
a heavy flow of money into the country, but a high rate of 
poverty prevails, because a false economy is what really exists. 
  Camero had issued arrest warrants against 32 presumed drug 
traffickers, including Rafael Alcantara, president of the 
exchange house "Cavelba," who spent four and one-half months in 
prison for alleged money laundering. Alcantara was acquitted 
yesterday by Judge Luis Contreras Ramirez of the Second Trial 
Court. 
  Alcantara said he will sue Camero for abuse of authority and 
the huge losses he incurred when he had to close his business.

  [Text] Deputy Julio Montoya (MAS) [Movement Toward 
Socialism], vice president of the Drug Committee, said Congress 
must reach a consensus on the drug trafficking and money 
laundering problem, because Venezuela cannot continue to sit 
back and do nothing while the drug cartels carry out their 
assaults both abroad and at home. 
  Montoya warned yesterday of plans by the agents of drug 
traffickers to free members of the Grecian-Latin Connection 
whose cases are being handled by a judge in Sucre State. 
  Montoya also spoke about drug trafficking operations in 
various parts of the world such as Operation Polar, which is 
related to drug trafficking, and Operation Rainbow, which is 
related to money laundering. 
  He said that according to a Disip [Directorate of 
Intelligence and Prevention Services] report, more than 300 tons 
of cocaine will leave the country's ports and airports in the 
coming days, thus our authorities must be on alert. 
  Deputies Julio Montoya and Julio Elias Mayaudon (National 
Convergence) announced their support for Judge Mildred Camero 
[not further identified]. 
  Montoya also commented on a ruling by Luis Contreras Pernia, 
judge of the Third Superior Court of Tachira, to release certain 
people allegedly linked to drug trafficking. 
  "This is a narco-loving judge. According to information 
available to us, he has a history of ruling in favor of drug 
traffickers." 
  Legislators will vote today on the proposals made by various 
political blocs during this week's debates in the Chamber of 
Deputies on drug trafficking and money laundering. 
  The numerous proposals range from the most controversial 
one, 
presented by Deputy Lindolfo Contreras, to legalize drugs in 
Venezuela to others presented by Deputy Luis Emilio Rondon, 
president of the Committee against Improper Drug Use, which 
include the creation of a narcotics police force and a permanent 
chair on basic, intermediate, and diversified education with 
emphasis on the struggle against this scourge and on preventive 
measures. 
  During the debates, most legislators referred to the case of 
Tachira Judge Luis Contreras Pernia as a "blow dealt by drug 
traffickers" to which the authorities and the entire country 
must respond. 
  Another much debated issue is drug legalization, which has 
its supporters and opponents. Most legislators think that other 
actions to stop drug trafficking in general must be considered 
before drug consumption is legalized in Venezuela.

  [Text] Beijing, May 5 (XINHUA) -- Punishments will now be 
handed out for transporting, selling, storing and using poppy 
capsules illegally; disturbing public order and damaging 
people's health through religious activities; and stirring up 
conflicts between nationalities, hurting unity of nationalities 
and inciting separation of nationalities. 
  These are three of the 18 new offenses which have been 
included in the draft supplementary provisions to the 
regulations governing offenses against public order, which was 
submitted to the current session of the Standing Committee of 
the National People's Congress (NPC), China's legislative body, 
for deliberation this morning. 
  Minister of public security, Tao Siju, explained to the 
session that along with the present changing social order, some 
new problems and offenses have occurred which have disturbed the 
social order and public security and hurt public interests. 
  "However, the original regulations had made no provisions 
about these activities and it has become difficult to handle 
these cases according to law," said the minister. 
  The existing regulation was put into effect on January 1, 
1987. 
  Other newly prescribed offenses include: 
  --- disobeying the provisions on the management of social 
organizations, and carrying out activities under the name of a 
social organization without registration; or to keep on working 
under the name of social organization after its registration was 
revoked, it has been ordered to disband, or simply banned; 
  --- organizing activities of superstitious sects and secret 
societies to disrupt public order, do harm to the public 
interest, or damage people's health through feudal superstition; 
  --- disobeying supervisory provisions while undergoing a 
period of being put under surveillance, or deprivation of 
political rights, probation with suspended prison sentence or 
being paroled. 
  Those who commit such offenses, but not to the extent to be 
punished according to criminal law, will be put under 15 days 
detention, with fines of up to 200 yuan or a warning. 
  Meanwhile, those fabricating or distorting facts, spreading 
rumors or otherwise disrupting public order, or doing harm to 
the public interest through other means, will be put under 15 
days detention and ordered to write a confession or warning, if 
the offenses are still not severe enough for criminal punishment.

<F P=106> [By Yindi Loetcharoenchok] </F>
  [Text] The Burmese junta has accused two rebellious ethnic 
groups of co-operating militarily with opium warlord Khun Sa and 
warned that such an association "can hinder" continuing peace 
talks. 
  Spokesmen for the Karen and Karenni flatly rejected the 
charges as "groundless" accusations aimed at discrediting the 
anti-Rangoon ethnic movement. 
  In an interview yesterday, the Burmese Armed Forces Attache 
in Bangkok, Col Thein Swe, said the Karen National Union (KNU) 
and the Karenni National Progressive Party (KNPP) had each sent 
a delegation last month to meet Khun Sa. 
  He claimed that a three-member Karenni team led by Deputy 
Chief of Staff Aung Mya subsequently signed a "military 
alliance" with Khun Sa's Mong Tai Army (MTA). 
  Thein Swe said he did not know the contents of the pact but 
suspected they had "probably" agreed not to let a third military 
force pass through territories they respectively control. 
  He accepted that the Burmese army would need to pass through 
the Karenni area to successfully attack the MTA. He said the 
State Law and Order Restoration Council (Slorc) will launch 
offensives against Khun Sa's forces, but "it is not yet the 
time". 
  The attache also charged that a five-member Karen delegation 
met Khun Sa during April 10-12 and that a KNU landmine expert, 
Lt Col Isaac had taught the MTA how to produce anti-personnel 
mines and helped set up a weapons factory. 
  The MTA's move implied that it was aware of Slorc's pending 
offensive and had taken the preventive measure of planting 
landmines in the likely path of advancing Burmese troops, 
according to Thein Swe. He said such military cooperation with 
Khun Sa "can hinder" negotiations between Slorc and the two 
ethnic groups. 
  Khun Sa's group could not be reached for comment. 
  In separate interviews yesterday, both the Karen and Karenni 
guerrillas agreed they had sent teams to Khun Sa's area in 
southern Shan State, but rejected as "groundless" the 
accusations that they were cooperating militarily with the 
warlord. 
  Khun Sa, or Chang Si-fu in Chinese, controls a narrow strip 
of territory east of the Salween River in southern Shan State 
alongside the Thai border province of Mae Hong Son. 
  Although he claims not to be a drugs trafficker and says he 
only imposes a tax on opium or heroin passing through his 
territory to finance the Shan state's struggle for independence, 
Rangoon and the world community have branded him a drugs baron. 
Despite his denials, US courts have accepted 10 separate 
narcotics-related charges brought against him. 
  A Karenni spokesman who requested anonymity said the KNPP 
delegation's visit was in response to a recent letter purporting 
to be from Khun Sa to three ethnic movements--Karen, Karenni and 
Mon--urging them to unite and cooperate politically and 
militarily with him to counter Slorc. 
  The three groups had discussed the letter. It was ambiguous 
and they had been suspicious of its authenticity and wary of 
being used by an outside party. 
  Khun Sa later confirmed that he had sent the letter, he 
added. 
  The Karenni spokesman confirmed that Aung Mya and two other 
KNPP members did go to see Khun Sa to seek clarification. 
  But he rejected Thein Swe's accusations of a "military 
alliance" with Khun Sa as "groundless propaganda," intended to 
"discredit" the Karenni movement. 
  "We, the KNPP, are not stupid. He deals in drugs. How could 
we (reach an agreement with Khun Sa)... If we did, people would 
think that we deal in drugs and we would then lose our political 
objective (Karenni independence)," he said. 
  The Karenni have a policy to continue peace talks with Slorc 
but no date or venue had been agreed on for the next meeting, he 
said. The KNPP was still pressing for the talks to be held 
outside Burma. 
  Likewise, a Karen spokesman while accepting that a 
delegation 
was sent to Khun Sa's area, denied the team was there to teach 
the Mong Tai Army how to produce mines. He said it was 
"possible" that the trip was in response to the warlord's letter 
but he had not seen the letter itself. 
  "Some small officers went there just to see the place. There 
is no agreement whatsoever signed with Khun Sa," he said. 
  Although the Karen have agreed to enter bilateral ceasefire 
talks with Slorc, no meeting has ever taken place. The two 
sides can not agree on a venue as the Karen want the meeting 
outside Burma while Slorc insists that it takes place inside the 
country.

  [Text] Shan State, Burma -- Reputed drug kingpin Khun Sa 
says he wants his Shan State to become a province of Thailand 
under Their Majesties the King and Queen. 
  Shan State has more to offer Thailand than Burma's central 
government in terms of a developing market, natural resources 
and cheap labour, he told THE NATION. 
  Khun Sa, also known as Chang Si Fu, is leader of the Shan 
Maung Tai Army (MTA). 
  "We the Shan State wish to become a province of Thailand. 
All Shan people have full respect for the Thai monarch and the 
Royal Family. Also we would like to have bilateral trade, the 
way the European Union countries trade among themselves." 
  The people of Shan State, like other Burmese ethnic groups, 
have been fighting for independence from the central Rangoon 
government, which is administered by the military's State Law 
and Order Restoration Council (Slorc). Khun Sa is widely 
reported to be funding his state by trading in heroin, which is 
produced from opium poppies grown throughout the area. 
  Khernsai Jaiyene, a close aide to Khun Sa, said the MTA has 
sent a letter to the King seeking his help in settling the 
problems of minority groups in Burma. 
  "So far, it seems to us that this (the King's help) is the 
only way to end the fighting by the Burmese people struggling 
for independence from the government," said Khernsai. 
  Khun Sa also expressed concern over the planned 
transportation network linking Thailand, Burma, China and Laos. 
He said it would adversely affect his people and his state. 
  "The network has been pushed purely for economic gain, 
without taking into consideration the wants of the people and 
without good management. The Shan State, which covers one third 
of Burmese territory, would be badly affected," he said. 
  According to Khun Sa, the Burmese government wants a leading 
role in the project because it would be an opportunity to 
eliminate the minority ethnic grouping. 
  "The Burmese government will spend money given for the 
project to purchase weapons to fight against our people and 
other ethnic groups," he said. 
  Slorc would make use of the transport system to be built 
under the project as strategic routes to transport men and arms 
to wage war against minorities. 
  Khun Sa said he was referring to two routes, one linking the 
Bumma-China border province of Lua to Keng Tung and to Tachilek 
in Thailand's Chiang Rai province, and to a proposed railway 
linking China and Laos. 
  "The only way the Burmese government will use the project is 
to tackle its domestic political conflicts, and that means more 
suppression of the minorities," he said.

  [Text] A close aide of Burmese drug warlord Khun Sa 
yesterday denied that the opium kingpin wants his Shan state to 
become part of the Thai kingdom. 
  Khernsai Jaiyene said although Khun Sa respects the Thai 
monarch highly and wants closer ties with Bangkok, he wants Shan 
to remain "independent". 
  He said Khun Sa could have been misquoted. 
  "We respect His Majesty the King and, once Shan state gains 
independence, we would like to invite the Thais to trade with 
us," Khun Sa said during a recent press interview. "All our rich 
natural resources can be sold to Thailand as raw material and 
Thailand will benefit immensely from it." 
  Khun Sa said he would like Shan state to have a close 
economic relationship with Thailand, like that of countries in 
the European Community.

  [Text] The Muang Tai Army (MTA) of drug warlord Khun Sa 
has attacked a Burmese government "caravan of gems" thought to 
be carrying 1,000 kilograms of heroin to Tachilek, near the Thai 
border, an MTA source in Chiang Mai said yesterday. 
  Fighting was continuing with reinforcements from both sides 
arriving at the battlefield, the source said. 
  He said fighting between the MTA and Burmese army had 
started 
on April 23 in the middle of Shan state. 
  "We are certain that the gem caravan also carries a ton of 
Number 4 heroin to Tachilek (a Burmese border checkpoint 
opposite Chiang Rai)," the source said. 
  "There are 10 trucks carrying goods and another 10 carrying 
soldiers as guards." 
  The caravan had set out from Mong Hsu, a mining city. It had 
passed through Kunhing, Huapaang, Mong Ping, Tongtaa, Keng Tung, 
Doi Muai, Mong Lang and Mong Ko, the source said. 
  The location of the battle is Mong Ping. 
  The source said the convoy guards belonged to the State Law 
and Order Restoration Council (Slorc) Army Unit 331, which 
recently occupied Mong Kyood, in MTA territory. 
  He claimed the MTA had taken the first two trucks of the 
caravan but could not say whether they were army or goods trucks. 
  "We are predicting an extended phase of military engagement 
here. If MTA's leader Khun Sa can get hold of all the trucks, it 
will considerably discredit Slorc's image. 
  "Slorc maintains that it has nothing to do with the drug 
trade," the source said. 
  Khun Sa had sent nearly 800 soldiers from Hua Mong, the 
headquarters town of MTA, to support the forces engaging Slorc. 
  Slorc had sent nearly 4,000 soldiers from Mong Pan, Unit 99, 
to protect the caravan and fight off MTA forces. 
  Slorc was also getting support from the army of a minority 
Chinese group, the Kokang, which engaged in gem mining with 
Slorc, the source said. 
  Khun Sa said last week that he was sending 3,200 soldiers to 
the North, but would not reveal their precise destination for 
security reasons.

<F P=106> [Report by Manisai: "Development at Pha Lavek"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Pha Lavek is situated in a mountainous area. It 
is part of Hom District in Vientiane Province. In the past the 
production and the life style of the people were very close to 
nature: they engaged in slash and burn agriculture, 90 percent 
of the people were malnourished, and they died from malaria and 
diarrhea. Their condition was very serious. But because of the 
efforts of the central echelons of the party and state the Lao 
89 project was started. This development project of the UN drug 
prevention organization has continued from 1989 to the present 
and has brought a change of direction. Pha Lavek has begun to 
develop, overcome its past troubles and progress toward a new 
life. There has been development on many sides, both material 
and spiritual, for the progressive Hmong. 
  Mr Wanna, the deputy district leader of Hom District, 
Vientiane Province reported to me that Pha Lavek included 10 
villages and a population of 4,500. Before 1989 the 
communication routes between the localities and central 
authority were broken. The government used aircraft to transport 
food and medicine to help the people each month. But with the 
start of the drug prevention project, funded at no cost by the 
United Nations, there has been development for 3 years, and Pha 
Lavek has made progress. Goods production has been developed 
substantially, for example: an economic base has been built, and 
a communication route reaches from Vientiane to Pha Lavek--the 
road from Tha Bok to Pha Lavek is 42 km long and vehicles travel 
it conveniently both in the dry season and the rainy season. Now 
there is daily passenger service from Vientiane to Pha Lavek to 
Long San. Project officials also completed a new road 29 km long 
from Pha Lavek to Nam Gnouak (Vang Gnasai) which could be 
traveled in the dry season, and they completed a 44 km road from 
Pha Lavek to Ao Sai in Sai Somboun District which could be 
traveled in the dry season. As for agricultural production, 
before 1989 there were only 60 hectares of wet-field rice land 
while there were 386 hectares of dry-field rice land, and 90 
percent of the population was engaged in slash and burn rice 
cultivation and opium cultivation for which they moved on every 
year. Now the area of wet-field rice has increased to 208 
hectares, and the Hmong people have generally come down to build 
permanent homes on the plains and cultivate wet-field rice and 
raise animals and commercial crops more and more. Only 100 
hectares of dry-field rice land remain in Pha Lavek. There are 
more than 3,000 head of cattle and buffalo being raised, and 
there are many pigs and poultry of various kinds. 
  With regard to commercial crops the people in some villages 
are working to raise coffee on 2 hectares, peanuts and soybeans 
on 6 hectares, and are raising Job's tears experimentally on 2.5 
hectares. They are also raising many hectares of various 
vegetables. Another outstanding development is that in addition 
to raising the wet season rice crop on wet-field rice land, in 
Ban Pha Lavek Village and Nam Pang where conditions are right 
for irrigation they experimented with raising dry season rice on 
2 hectares, and it appears to have been very successful. All 
this has allowed them better to meet the demand for food of the 
people of Pha Lavek--they can supply 70 percent of their food. 
  Education and public health are being broadened. In Pha 
Lavek 
now there is one secondary school. In the 1993 to 1994 school 
year there are more than 40 students in the first through third 
years of secondary school. There are six primary schools, and 
there are more than 1,000 students in the first through the 
fifth primary grades. Public health and education in hygiene for 
the people are being expanded broadly. A hospital was built 
according to standards with funds from the project and the 
people from three locations. In addition many houses have 
toilets. There are medical personnel and medicine assigned to 10 
villages. Therefore it is clear that illiteracy among children 
of school age and illness and death among the people have been 
attacked and reduced. Another outstanding development which 
occurred in early 1994 was that 21 drug addicts received 
treatment to end their addiction completely with assistance from 
the project and the Thai drug prevention organization. [passage

  [Text] Taipei, April 30 (CNA) -- Police arrested four 
suspected drug dealers and seized 2 kilograms of heroin during a 
raid on a house in Taichung, central Taiwan, late Friday [29 
April] night. 
  The four suspects were Lin Chen-hsiung, 49; his wife Lin 
Chang Shu-mei, 44; Shieh Yu-chi, 30; and Li Ming-wei, 42. 
  The suspects had collaborated with drug dealers in Hong Kong 
and Thailand to smuggle heroin into Taiwan many times during the 
past year, the Criminal Investigation Bureau said Saturday. 
  Bureau agents began to shadow Lin and his associates last 
May. The police found the ring was headed by a Hong Kong-based 
man, known only as "Simon." Lin was responsible for drug 
distribution in Taiwan, agents said. 
  The agents found that the heroin was smuggled into Taiwan 
inside opaque bottles of alcohol. The smugglers placed small 
amounts of heroin inside the bottles and carried only two 
bottles each time through customs without incident, the agents 
said. 
  The agents said they will continue their investigation into 
the case.

  [Text] Talking to reporters at the National Assembly this 
afternoon, Thanong Siriprichaphong, an MP from Nakhon Phanom 
Province, insisted that he is innocent of all drug charges. He 
is gathering evidence to clarify the issue with all parties 
concerned: 
  [Begin recording] [Thanong] I consulted with the people in 
Nakhon Phanom and the Chat Thai Party about resigning as an MP 
as soon as I heard the news reports. They told me there was no 
need to resign. I deny the charges; I insist that I am innocent 
of all charges. As soon as I learned of the news, I contacted 
my lawyer to fight the charges. I learned about the charges 
from newspaper, radio, and television reports. The house and 
the assets are not in my name. I am checking on what I am being 
charged with--maybe it has to do with failing to pay the house 
mortgage. I am gathering evidence. I still do not know what I 
am being charged with. 
  [Question indistinct] 
  [Thanong] I will clear the parliamentary issue. I will not 
allow the image of the House of Representatives, the Chat Thai 
Party, or the people of Nakhon Phanom to be damaged. [end

  [Text] Chat Thai MP Thanong Siriprichaphong, accused by 
U.S. antinarcotics authorities of marijuana smuggling, says he 
is prepared to fly to the United States if necessary to defend 
himself. 
  After keeping a low profile for a few days, Mr. Thanong 
resurfaced in Parliament to deny all the charges at a press 
conference. 
  He offered to resign over drug dealing charges only if these 
damaged his party and supporters and threatened to sue the press 
for publicising the accusations lodged against him by the U.S.. 
  Nicknamed "Po Pet," the MP for Nakhon Phanom strongly 
dismissed the marijuana trafficking allegations made against him 
by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). 
  Mr. Thanong told almost 100 reporters and photographers he 
was ready to clear himself of the allegations and said he had 
never been contacted by the DEA. Nor was he served with an 
affidavit from the agency. 
  The MP said such accusations were damaging but he was 
"gentleman enough" not to accuse anyone else. Asked how he felt 
at being accused of having been involved in the trafficking of 
47 tons of marijuana, he said: "Just one gramme of marijuana 
would hurt me enough." 
  He said he would have his lawyer fly to the U.S. to hear the 
claims and, if necessary, he would be prepared to defend himself 
in the U.S.. 
  "I'd rather go and hear the charges myself but they advised 
I 
send my lawyer first," he said. He has a life-long visa to 
enter the U.S. 
  The DEA has accused Mr. Thanong of involvement in the 
smuggling of 47 tons of marijuana from Thailand to the U.S. in 
the past 10 years and reported that his house in Los Angeles and 
a Mercedes Benz worth about 30 million Baht in all had been 
sequestrated. 
  But Mr. Thanong claimed he had no business in the U.S. and 
did not own a house in California as alleged. The MP said he 
had owned a car in the U.S. but sold it. 
  "I didn't own the house or any other assets in the U.S. as 
reported," he said. 
  He said he had consulted his constituents in Nakhon Phanom 
and Chat Thai Secretary General Banhan Sinlapa-acha and they all 
advised against his resigning as an MP. 
  The MP said he needed no parliamentary immunity from arrest 
on such charges and would resign without hesitation only if 
there was any serious damage to the House, Chat Thai and Nakhon 
Phanom people. 
  "If the (Chat Thai) party tells me to make a decision, I'll 
resign no matter whether or not I was guilty." 
  As for whether the drug charges were a political game, Mr. 
Thanong said he was "too gentlemanly to comment.'' 
  "I hate to mention any third person unnecessarily. That's 
another point. I may be seen positively or negatively. But I 
am what I am." 
  Opposition figures, including Chat Thai Deputy Leader Thawit 
Klinprathum, have claimed the Thanong issue is a political ploy 
to discredit Chat Thai by digging up drug claims made against 
Mr. Thanong last year. 
  Mr. Thanong said he would be ready to testify before the 
House Committee for Parliamentary Affairs on Tuesday as asked by 
its chairman. He declined to say if he had any serious conflict 
with anyone just before the issue was publicised. He said 
everyone would naturally have some people on their side. 
  The MP said he would consult his lawyer as to whether he 
could sue newspapers, radio and TV stations which reported the 
claims. 
  "I think I'm going to take legal action against newspapers, 
radio and TV. Many times I have been hit by newspapers. I'm 
definitely going to sue if I can." 
  A few times during the conference Mr. Thanong was sarcastic. 
Asked if he believed the drug issue was part of a political 
game, he declined to give a direct answer but said only: "I'm 
not a reporter." 
  He said the Thai press could jump to conclusions on anything 
more clearly than the police. 
  "Don't make me act like the Thai press which can make all 
kinds of judgements," he said. 
  House Speaker Marut Bunnak said Mr. Thanong should be 
questioned over the claims in Thailand rather than in the U.S.. 
  Mr. Marut said the U.S. should take steps under Thailand's 
Drugs Suppression and Prevention Bill and international 
agreements. 
  Mr. Thanong would not be ousted as an MP just because of the 
claims he said.

<F P=106> [News feature: "The Life of Thanong Siriprichaphong"] </F>
  [Text] Thanong Siriprichaphong was born to a middle-class 
family on 24 February 1952 in Si Chiang Mai District, Nong Khai 
Province. He graduated from the University of Honolulu in the 
United States with a B.A. After completing his secondary 
education, his parents moved to Nakhon Phanom Province where 
they started their business of bringing consumer goods into Laos 
for sale and returning to Thailand with forest products and 
scrap iron. 
  During the Vietnam War, Nakhon Phanom was thronged by 
American G.I.'s. Therefore, it was not hard for Thanong to 
boost his status to that of a tycoon by sending all kinds of 
goods for sale to an American camp. Then, he was called Sia 
[tycoon] Po Pet [Thai nickname meaning duck]. As he became 
rich, he invested in various areas such as the Little Duck Hotel 
in Chiang Rai Province, and also operated tour and entertainment 
businesses in the Phatthaya beach resort town in Chon Buri 
Province. At the end of 1992, the Little Duck Group comprised 
19 companies. Among them was the Little Duck Travel Agency 
Company which was granted the right to sell advertisement for TV 
Channel 9 and thus ran into controversy. The company had to 
face an investigation by the Counter Corruption Commission and a 
lawsuit demanding compensation in a private case. 
  In 1993, Thanong planned for a huge land and real estate 
development project in Chiang Mai Province. The project would 
see the building of a hotel, a department store, an 
entertainment center, an aquatic park, an Amusement park, a 
business center, a market, and a wholesale market, all on 300 
rai of land. At present, he is in the process of entering into 
a joint venture with the Imperial Group in the Lat Phrao 
Imperial World project in Bangkok. 
  By doing so, business circles wonder what successes he has 
had to enable him to make such huge investments. 
  In politics, Sia Po Pet, or "Peter" as he is known in 
English, was elected as MP [Member of Parliament] of Nakhon 
Phanom Province for the first time in 1983 as a member of the 
Social Action Party. In 1986, he moved to the Muanchon Party led 
by Police Captain Chaloem Yubamrung. In that year, he stood 
against General Mana Rattanakoset, former leader of the Ratsadon 
Party in a general election in Nakhon Phanom Province and met 
failure for the first time. In 1988, he moved to a new 
constitutency to gain support from sub-district leader Kamnan Po 
in another election but failed again. Despite joining hands with 
General Mana in March, 1992, he failed once more. In September 
of the same year, he ran in an election in Nakhon Phanom 
Province as a member of the Chat Thai Party. This time, he 
succeeded in being elected MP for the second time. Despite of 
his reputation in business circles, it seems that not many 
people know him as an MP.

  [Text] Regarding the news report that the United States 
has issued warrants for the arrest of Thais, including a member 
of the House of Representatives, on charges of narcotics 
trafficking, Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said that Thailand 
will have to wait for further information from the United States 
because no charges have been clearly stated so far. He said 
that if the case is confirmed, it will be the duty of the 
persons concerned to give explanations. 
  [Begin recording] [Chuan] According to the information 
received on past events, the issue is connected with what 
happened several years ago. An American was arrested on a charge 
of narcotics trafficking. The suspect confessed and said that 
he bought the drugs from Thais. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Do you mean he referred to Thais? 
  [Chuan] He referred to Thais. The U.S. narcotics suppression 
authorities requested our Office of Narcotics Control Board 
[ONCB] to check the assets of those Thais. Therefore, I assume 
this issue would be in consequence with the said incident. Now, 
we have to wait for additional information or report that the 
United States will provide for us. As of now, nothing has been 
confirmed nor denied. 
  [Reporter] Did the American suspect give the names? 
  [Chuan] Yes, he gave the names. 
  [Reporter] One name or many? 
  [Chuan] Thai names were stated. I think more than one, but I 
am not sure how many. The suspect also said the operations had 
been carried out for many years. 
  [Reporter] [Question indistinct] 
  [Chuan] Nothing. No charges have been clearly stated yet. 
It is the event in the United States, and no clear details have 
been sent to us. We have only known from news reports. 
  [Reporter] But now the Thai Parliament [words indistinct]. 
  [Chuan] We must follow up on it. If it involves individuals 
or there is any confirmation, then it will be the duty of those 
persons involved to give explanations. 
  [Reporter] What has the ONCB been authorized to do, because 
this matter also affectes the image of Thailand? 
  [Chuan] The ONCB is following up on it to get more 
information. Right now we cannot give any more details than what 
we have received. [end recording]

  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai yesterday ruled out the 
extradition of Chat Thai Party MP Thanong Siriprichapong to the 
United States to face charges of drug trafficking. 
  Chuan said Thailand would prosecute its own citizens and 
would not extradite them to face charges in foreign countries. 
  The US Embassy in Bangkok announced on Wednesday that on 
January 12, 1993, it requested the Thai government to serve 
legal notice on Thanong that he was the subject of assets 
forfeiture proceedings before the US District Court in northern 
California. 
  "By principles, we will not extradite Thais to be prosecuted 
overseas," Chuan said. 
  "Extradition will be made only against foreigners who commit 
wrongdoings abroad and try to hide out in our country. 
  "(The United States) may request us to extradite (Thanong) 
but we will not do it. 
  "No matter what wrongdoing he might have committed, it is 
Thai officials' responsibility to prosecute him." 
  Thanong, a Nakhon Phanom MP, is accused by the US Drug 
Enforcement Administration (DEA) of having conspired to smuggle 
more than 45 tons of marijuana into the United States between 
1977 and 1987. 
  The US Embassy said the drug deals earned Thanong more than 
$10 million. 
  Chuan said yesterday he had ordered Foreign Minister Prasong 
Sunsiri to find out the full details of the charges. 
  The prime minister said the authorities were required to 
follow up the case and find out whether the opposition MP had 
committed crimes as charged. 
  Chuan said the Office of Narcotics Control Board (ONCB) 
might 
have been pursuing the case but did not yet have enough evidence 
to take legal action against Thanong. 
  "It is difficult to take action against someone if there 
isn't enough evidence," Chuan said. 
  Prasong met Chuan at Government House at 11.25 am yesterday. 
  Emerging from the meeting, Prasong told reporters he had 
briefed the prime minister over Thanong's case. 
  Prasong said the US government had so far not requested that 
Bangkok extradite Thanong. 
  He said the DEA only wanted the government to inform Thanong 
about the seizure of his assets in the US. 
  Thanong had the right to choose whether or not to appear 
before the US court. 
  National Security Council Secretary-General Charan 
Kunlawanit 
said police would find out more information about the alleged 
drug trade. 
  Police Director General Pratin Santipraphop said police were 
monitoring the case but could not take any action because there 
were no evidence against Thanong. 
  Pratin said police had yet to get evidence against Thanong 
from the United States. 
  Meanwhile, Charan Phakdithanakun, secretary-general of the 
Judicial Affairs Division of the Justice Ministry, said 
yesterday the Thai-US extradition treaty does not oblige Bangkok 
to extradite Thai citizens at US requests. 
  He said the treaty would normally apply to foreign criminals 
who escaped to Thailand. 
  In case of Thanong, Charan said the Thai authorities could 
take action against him if the alleged drug smuggling took place 
after September 27, 1991, the day a new Thai narcotics 
suppression law went into effect.

  [Excerpt] This afternoon Foreign Minister Squadron Leader 
Prasong Sunsiri called on Prime Minister Chuan Likphai, 
reportedly to discuss the issue of a member of parliament being 
involved in narcotics trafficking. Speaking to reporters 
afterward, the prime minister said he requested that the foreign 
minister ask the U.S. Embassy for information concerning the 
activities of the MP in question. He pointed out that the 
accused, Thanong, has not been proven guilty: 
  [Begin recording] [Chuan] Based on the information we have, 
at this time he is not being regarded as having committed any 
wrongdoing. Therefore, we must find out what the facts are. In 
my meeting with the foreign minister this morning, we decided to 
request the U.S. Embassy's cooperation in supplying us with 
information. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] What did he report to you? 
  [Chuan] After the news broke, we received information that 
the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration had requested that 
notices be delivered to three people--whose names were given--to 
inform them that their assets in the United States would be 
seized. The notices--sent by the supreme attorney general--were 
delivered to two of these people. The third person could not be 
reached and the letter was mailed to him. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, the foreign minister said he would instruct the 
Ministry permanent secretary to request information from the 
U.S. Embassy. He said the accusation not only damaged the 
accused but also the country's reputation. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Regarding the case that the United States has 
issued a warrant demanding a Thai member of House of 
Representatives to make clarification on a narcotics trafficking 
charge against him and U.S. authorities have frozen the assets 
in the United States of the said suspect, Foreign Affairs 
Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri this morning met with 
Prime Minister Chuan Likphai to inform him of what the Foreign 
Ministry would do next on this matter. The foreign minister told 
reporters after his meeting with the prime minister that he will 
contact the U.S. Embassay for further information. The matter 
also has adverse effects on the parliamentary institution and 
Thai people, and the Thai Government has not been idle on the 
matter, said Prasong. Regarding this, the Foreign Ministry has 
always followed up on the developments since it was first 
informed on 12 January 1993. The Office of the Supreme Attorney 
General has reported on the matter to the Foreign Ministry and 
also notified the suspect and his colleagues of their 
wrongdoings, telling them to give explanations to the court in 
the United States. 
  [Begin recording] [Prasong] I will contact the U.S. Embassy 
for further information, because once an accusation is made 
against a Thai, it also affects all the others--both the 
parliamentary institution and the country as a whole. Therefore, 
I would like to know about the additional information and 
evidence. I will contact the U.S. Embassy, because it used to 
contact the Foreign Affairs Ministry before on this. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Sir, when did they first inform us 
of 
the matter? 
  [Prasong] Around 12 January 1993. However, they [U.S. 
authorities] have been following this case for nearly 10 years, 
according to a report. 
  [Reporter] Sir, [words indistinct] what action will you 
take? 
  [Prasong] This is the responsibility of the authorities. I 
myself will coordinate the Office of Narcotics Control Board and 
police authorities in charge of narcotics work to give them 
information. 
  [Reporter] As an MP [Member of Parliament], what would you 
say about this? 
  [Prasong] It is up to the House of Representatives to 
consider. [end recording]

  [Text] Police cannot take legal action against MP Thanong 
Siriprichaphong, who has been accused by a US court of smuggling 
drugs into the United States, because the charges were brought 
against him outside Thailand, police chief Prathin Santipraphop 
said yesterday. 
  Pol Gen [Police General] Prathin said police had not yet 
been 
briefed by US officials and could not act at this stage. 
  On Wednesday, the US Embassy in Bangkok said in a statement 
that Thanong (Chat Thai-Nakhon Phanom) had been involved in 
successful and foiled attempts to smuggle more than 45 metric 
tons of marijuana into the country. 
  Thanong allegedly received about $10 million from drug 
trafficking between 1977 and 1987. His assets in the United 
States have been seized by a US court order, according to the 
statement. 
  Prathin said there was no automatic requirement for 
Thanong's 
extradition to the States. If it was requested by the US 
government, police would have to carefully consider how the law 
here applied to the case. Thai police may be able to oversee 
the case themselves, Prathin said. 
  It would be up to Parliament to approve Thanong's arrest if 
a 
warrant was issued. An MP cannot be arrested during a 
parliamentary session without the approval of Parliament. 
  Asked why police had taken no action against Thanong, even 
though he had long been a suspect, Prathin said police must be 
careful not to violate personal rights. 
  Police could make an arrest only when they had substantive 
evidence, he said. Police have lists of probable criminals and 
"influential" people, but they could not reveal them.

  [Text] The US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has 
asked the Thai Government to freeze the assets of a Chat Thai MP 
which were suspected to have been acquired through illicit drug 
trafficking, a senior official of the Office of Narcotics 
Control Board (ONCB) disclosed yesterday. 
  The source said the DEA made the request last year. It also 
supplied the ONCB with evidence allegedly linking Nakhon Phanom 
MP Thanong Siriprichaphong with several marijuana seizures in 
the United States. 
  US officials maintained that the MP's assets could be 
sequestrated according to the US-Thai Mutual Legal Assistance 
Treaty (MLAT) agreement in 1992 and the instruments of 
ratification. 
  The source said Mr Thanong's assets in the United States, 
including a house on the East Coast, had been seized a few years 
ago. 
  The official said Mr Thanong had been notified of the US 
action and asked to travel to the United States to defend 
himself, but he had yet to do so. 
  The Nakhon Phanom MP was not available for comment yesterday 
and attempts to contact him were not successful. 
  The DEA request and evidence were passed on to the Office of 
the Supreme Attorney-General about two months ago for 
consideration to determine if they were substantial enough to 
warrant the sequestration of the MP's assets. 
  If this is approved, it will be the first sequestration in 
Thai history of assets suspected to have been acquired through 
narcotics trafficking. 
  The senior ONCB official said Mr Thanong had been kept under 
close watch by undercover anti-narcotics agents for a long time 
after some arrested drugs traffickers had implicated him. 
  However, he said there had been no hard evidence to show the 
MP was directly involved in the illicit drugs trade. 
  When asked about the DEA request, Interior Minister Chawalit 
Yongchaiyut said yesterday he had not yet been informed about 
the US action. 
  He said the Thai Government was ready to cooperate fully 
with 
Washington. But he noted that the suspect must be treated 
fairly and Thai officials should not listen only to the US side 
of the story. 
  Chat Thai Party leader Praman Adireksan and 
secretary-general 
Banhan Sinlapa-acha declined to comment yesterday, saying they 
had not yet been formally informed about the DEA request. 
  But Chat Thai MP Samphan Loetnuwat dismissed the report as a 
"mere rumor" aimed at discrediting the party. 
  Chat Thai deputy leader Thawit Klinprathum said the case was 
a personal affair and had nothing to do with the party. 
  Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said he had no details 
about 
the charges and did not know enough facts to comment on the case. 
  But he added that Mr Thanong had not yet been arrested and 
formally charged, and therefore the evidence had to be shown 
first before Thailand could decide whether or not to go ahead 
with legal proceedings. 
  Sqn Ldr [Squadron Leader] Prasong said there would have to 
be 
specific plaintiffs and witnesses in the case, but at the moment 
Mr Thanong was considered innocent until proven guilty. 
  New Aspiration Party deputy secretary-general Prasong 
Bunphong who lost to Mr Thanong in the last election, yesterday 
urged the MP to show up and clear himself. 
  Mr Prasong, a former Nakhon Phanom MP, also called on 
Parliament President Marut Bunnak to investigate the case. 
  Deputy Interior Minister Den Tomina, however, said he would 
find out about the case from US officials when he visits the 
United States tomorrow. 
  As chairman of the Interior Ministry's Drug Suppression 
Committee, Mr Den said he would visit the DEA office and make 
enquiries about the case. 
  He said that if the DEA had sufficient evidence against the 
suspect, it should ask Thai officials to make the arrest. 
  Some Thai legislators have been on the DEA's watchlist for 
suspected involvement in drug trafficking. In 1976, three 
former MPs, Chumphon Maninet, Nisit Wetsiriyanan and Manit 
Phrommanon were arrested in Hong Kong with one kilogram of 
heroin. Mr Nisit was acquitted but the two other politicians 
together with another Thai, Pricha Liyarak, were sentenced to 
ten years in prison.

  [Text] The House committee which oversees MPs' conduct 
yesterday pledged a full inquiry into Chat Thai MP Thanong 
Siriprichaphong, accused by a US court of smuggling huge amounts 
of marijuana into the United States over a period of years. 
  Meanwhile, the opposition yesterday conspicuously deferred a 
decision on a plan to censure the government. It was not 
immediately clear if the opposition bloc was-buying time to 
ponder the possible backlash from the Thanong case. 
  Charoen Khanthawong (Dem-Bangkok), chairman of the House 
committee, said the committee would formally open an 
investigation into the matter next Tuesday. 
  "This will seriously affect the (credibility of) Parliament. 
We must uphold the honor of Parliament by getting to the bottom 
of the matter and explain it to the public," Charoen said. 
  "In my opinion, Thanong should resign and the party to which 
he belongs must also take responsibility." 
  The committee chairman said the most severe measure which 
could be taken against Thanong would be for MPs to sign a motion 
seeking his ouster from the House of Representatives. 
  "But I don't think we will have to resort to such a harsh 
measure," he said. 
  Chat Thai secretary-general Banhan Sinlapa-acha yesterday 
said that no Thai law enforcement officials had confirmed, or 
denied, the allegation that Thanong had been involved in 
trafficking drugs to the US. 
  "The man himself denied he had anything to do with it," 
Banhan said. 
  "The party has yet to see if there is any hard evidence to 
substantiate the charge against Thanong. The way I see it, this 
is a personal affair. The party could not have known about it." 
  However, Banhan said, he had asked Thanong to explain at a 
press conference, probably sometime today. 
  He did not think the timing of the disclosure was aimed at 
hurting Chat Thai's reputation. 
  "This case could not hurt the party's credibility. We have 
yet to see the facts," he said. 
  Banhan would not say when the opposition intended to submit 
a 
no- confidence motion against the Chuan administration or which 
Cabinet members would be targeted in the censure. The 
opposition had been expected to make a decision yesterday. 
  Piyanat Watcharaphon, a former Social Action MP, said the 
Chuan government had apparently neglected to take legal action 
against Thanong though it had been aware of the US charges 
against him for more than a year. 
  "The question is why it was revealed just now, when the 
alleged wrongdoing happened a long time ago," said Piyanat, who 
lost his seat when he was sacked from the party. 
  He believed Prime Minister Chuan Likphai and other coalition 
leaders must have been aware of the matter but had failed to act 
on it. 
  Sources said a group of Democrat MPs plan to submit a motion 
seeking an official inquiry into the cases of Thanong and other 
MPs who have been accused of involvement in international drug 
trafficking. 
  Opposition leaders did not mention their much-heralded plan 
to censure the government when they emerged from a meeting at 
the Princess Hotel yesterday. On Tuesday they had promised a 
decision would be made at the meeting. 
  At a press conference after the meeting, opposition leaders 
instead criticized the government on such issues as terrorism in 
the South and the controversial Pak Mun Dam. They also denied 
allegations that some opposition leaders masterminded the 
southern violence in an attempt to destabilize the government.

  [Text] The House committee overseeing MPs' conduct 
yesterday vowed to push for the ouster of Chat Thai MP Thanong 
Siriprichaphong if he failed to clear himself of charges that he 
was involved in smuggling marijuana into the United States. 
  The House committee on parliamentary affairs plans to hold a 
meeting on Thanong next Tuesday but has tried unsuccessfully to 
contact the MP, whose testimony is essential before the panel 
can come to a decision. 
  Committee chairman Charoen Khanthawong said if the panel 
concluded that Thanong had damaged Parliament's reputation it 
would campaign for his ouster as MP. 
  "If we consider him to be guilty, the House committee will 
invoke article 93 to oust him," said Charoen. 
  Under article 93 of the Constitution an MP who tarnishes the 
reputation of Parliament can be ousted by a three-quarters 
majority vote, or 270 of the 360 members of the House. 
  The motion would require the support of at least one-third 
of 
House or 120 members, before it could be submitted. 
  Thanong has been accused of conspiring to smuggle more than 
45 tonnes of marijuana into the United States, and his American 
assets have been frozen by a California court. 
  "I think Thanong should resign to clear up all problems. An 
MP has previously resigned from the House after he being found 
to be involved in corruption," Charoen (Democratic-Bangkok) said. 
  Charoen said he had called an urgent committee meeting on 
Tuesday at Parliament to discuss the matter and there would be 
an opportunity for Thanong to make an explanation. 
  "I'm not so sure Thanong will show up. The committee has 
been unable to contact him," the committee chairman said. 
  He said if Thanong was found guilty MPs could ask the House 
of Representatives to consider the matter promptly, without 
having to wait for the House committee to submit a motion. 
  Deputy Interior Minister Den Tomina said before leaving for 
the United States yesterday that Thailand may permit Thanong's 
extradition to the US for trial. 
  Senior Thai officials said Washington had not yet requested 
Thanong's extradition. 
  Den was invited to the US by the Drug Enforcement 
Administration [DEA] to discuss antidrug trafficking measures 
before Thanong's case was publicized. 
  He told reporters at Don Muang Airport the DEA will give him 
all information relating to Thanong's case. He was uncertain 
whether US authorities had issued an arrest warrant for 
Thanong's extradition. 
  Although Thailand has an extradition agreement with the 
United States, part of the agreement states that Thai 
authorities can take legal action against a suspect arrested 
here, Pol. Gen. Prathin said. 
  The opposition Chat Thai Party has played down Thanong's 
case 
as a "personal affair", but indicated it would expel him if 
presented with solid evidence. 
  Chat Thai MP Newin Chitchop said his party would definitely 
sack Thanong if he was found guilty. 
  He admitted that press reports about Thanong affected the 
party's image. 
  "However, I think this is a personal matter and has nothing 
to do with the party. Actually, there are good and bad people 
in every institution," Newin said. 
  Chongchai Thiangtham (Chat Thai-Suphan Buri) yesterday 
accused government MPs of releasing the news to the public in a 
bid to discredit the opposition. 
  "This is an old issue that we have known of for a long time. 
But I don't know why it is publicized now," he said. 
  "I think this is similar to the previous case when they 
wanted to discredit Narong," he said. 
  US drug allegations forced Narong Wongwan, a Chat Thai Party 
adviser to withdraw his premiership candidacy in March 1992. 
Narong strongly denied the accusations. 
  Chongchai said Thanong should explain himself to the public 
as soon as possible. 
  He said Thanong had not contacted the party since the 
charges 
against him were made public. Nor had the party been able to 
contact him because he had many houses in Nakhon Panom, Chiang 
Rai and Phatthaya and other places, he added. 
  Suwat Liptaphanlop, secretary-general of the Chat Phatthana 
Party, said the charges against Thanong were unlikely to affect 
the opposition's unity because it was a personal matter. 
  However, if Thanong was found guilty the Parliament's image 
would suffer. The opposition would discuss the issue next week, 
he said. 
  Senior government officials yesterday denied claims the 
government was just drumming up a previously unattended issue to 
discredit the opposition which is planning to launch a censure 
offensive against the Chuan administration. 
  "We never have such an idea (using Thanong's case to 
discredit the opposition) in our head," said Democrat 
Secretary-General Sanan Khachonprasat. 
  Deputy Agriculture Minister Suthep Thuaksuban, a Democrat 
MP, 
said the government would "never become involved in any 
political ploy". But he added all MPs should help to protect 
the reputation of the House and all political parties should see 
to it that their members observe ethical principles. 
  Pol. Maj. Gen Chaowalit Yotmani, chief of the Office of 
Narcotics Control Board [ONCB], confirmed that Thanong's case 
was not being used as a political tool. 
  "If the opposition wants the ONCB to clarify the issue, we 
are willing to do so," he said. 
  Kraisak Chunhawan said Thanong must be arrested if police 
have enough evidence to back charges against him.

  [Text] A key coalition figure was responsible for making 
public the U.S. drug charges against a Chat Thai MP to discredit 
the biggest opposition party for fear it would replace his own 
party in Government, an opposition source alleged yesterday. 
  The source said the resurrection of the U.S. Drug 
Enforcement 
Administration marijuana-trafficking charges against Chat Thai 
MP Thanong Siriprichaphong were "timely" as they came amid 
speculation that the Chat Thai Party under new leader Banhan 
Sinlapa-acha might be considered to replace some coalition 
partners. 
  The source, who is close to both Chat Thai and Chat 
Phatthana 
leaders, said the DEA charges against Mr Thanong lodged with the 
Office of the Narcotics Control Board [ONCB] late last year and 
with the Office of the Supreme Attorney-General two months ago 
were "dug up and publicized" to serve the coalition party's 
political survival. 
  The DEA has been asking Thai authorities to seize the assets 
of Mr Thanong, nicknamed Po Pet, in Thailand under a Thai-U.S. 
legal agreement. His property in the U.S. has already been 
seized. 
  "It was not news today as it all happened months ago. But he 
was smart enough to dig it up and try to tarnish Chat Thai so 
his party would continue to remain with the coalition," said the 
opposition source. 
  He said Phalang Tham deputy leader Prasong Sunsiri should be 
asked for more information about the Thanong drug case. Dubbed 
Thailand's CIA chief, Foreign Minister Prasong was formerly 
secretary-general of the National Security Council. 
  Sqn Ldr [Squadron Leader] Prasong yesterday said the charges 
against Mr Thanong had tarnished the reputation of all MPs. 
  He said it would be up to the Chat Thai Party to issue a 
clarification and decide what to do with the MP. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan said the incident was a 
personal affair but it put the reputation of the entire nation 
at stake. 
  Mr Banhan said he had asked Mr Thanong, who was somewhere in 
his constituency of Nakhon Phanom yesterday, to rush to Bangkok 
today and address a press conference to clear himself of the 
charges. 
  He said he had asked the ONCB and several other agencies 
about the DEA charges against Mr Thanong but none could confirm 
the Chat Thai MP was guilty. 
  The Chat Thai secretary-general who is set to assume the 
party leadership Saturday, said Mr Thanong had told him over the 
telephone he was innocent of all the DEA charges. 
  Mr Banhan said the charges were a personal matter involving 
Mr Thanong and the party would not do anything to protect him if 
he is found guilty. 
  But he said it was "possible" the whole thing was simply a 
rumor designed for political purposes. 
  Mr Banhan said he knew something about the drug scandal but 
could not say anything for lack of hard evidence. 
  "There are so many rumors in Thailand but we are never moved 
by them," he said. 
  The case was not discussed at the weekly luncheon of 
opposition leaders yesterday, according to Social Action Party 
secretary-general Chaloem Yubamrung. 
  SAP leader Montri Phongphanit said he wondered if the recent 
bombings in the South were the work of the coalition rather than 
the Opposition. 
  "I wonder if the coalition partners might be trying to 
topple 
one another through these bombings in the South. This came to 
me after all the accusations that the Opposition is trying to 
overthrow the Government," he said. 
  Pol Capt Chaloem said there was not a single opposition MP 
in 
the South. 
  Chart Thai leader Praman Adireksan complimented the police 
for having arrested a woman in connection with the bombing at a 
railway station in Nakhon Si Thammarat on April 23 which killed 
three people and wounded 18 others.

  [Editorial: "Chat Thai Moves in Right Direction"] 
  The Chat Thai Party's decision Saturday to conduct an 
inquiry 
into the drug trafficking allegations made against one of its 
MPs, Thanong Siriprichaphong, by the US Drug Enforcement 
Administration (DEA) represents a step in the right direction to 
clear up this scandal. The move will dispel any doubt that the 
party will simply blindly jump to the defence of its member and 
let the case be swept under the rug after the embattled MP has 
made the denials. 
  Notably, the internal investigation on the drug dealing 
charges was the first taken by the party executive committee 
under a new helmsman, Mr Banhan Sinlapa-acha, who assumed the 
party leadership Saturday. Mr Banhan also called upon people to 
come forward to see him if they have recriminating evidence 
against any other Chat Thai MPs who may have a hand in shady or 
illegal activities. Such uncharacteristic straightforwardness 
should be a healthy sign especially for the Chat Thai Party and 
also for the political atmosphere in general. 
  Mr. Thanong's denial of all the charges made against him by 
the DEA and his announcement that he is ready to fly to the US 
to defend the case are not unexpected. Yet, these 
pronouncements by themselves cannot dispel all doubts that may 
still linger in the minds of many people who are well aware of 
the MP's background or who heard what he said during the 
much-publicised press conference at the Parliament last Friday. 
He could repeat the same denials 100 more times anywhere in 
this country, but it will simply be a self-deception if he 
expects more people to take him seriously. The lingering 
scepticism is not likely to vanish unless he shows his courage 
to prove his innocence by deed rather than words--that is to 
face his accuser in the US district court. 
  It is not impossible that the whole saga may be a 
well-calculated ploy to discredit the Chat Thai Party and to 
divert public attention from all the problems and negative 
events confronted by the Government as suggested by some 
Opposition MPs. But this is a totally different issue from that 
of Thanong's. A clear answer must be put forward by the Chat 
Thai Party before the case could be put to rest. 
  The party's five-man committee to probe the drugs scandal 
has 
been assigned with a daunting task to find out the facts and to 
make public the result of the findings. At stake is not the 
reputation of Thanong, but, more importantly, that of the party 
which has been tarnished more or less. Therefore, the probe 
team must be impartial and, at the same time, broadminded. To 
get the facts, it is necessary that the committee must seek 
information and evidence from the accuser which is the DEA, the 
Office of Narcotics Control Board, the Police Department or even 
the National Security Council. In the meantime, the embattled 
Nakhon Phanom MP who should be regarded as innocent until proven 
otherwise, must be given the opportunity to prepare his defence. 
  Mr Thanong's predicament is, after all, just the tip of the 
iceberg of the shady or illegal business activities that several 
of our politicians, senior police and military officers and 
senior civil servants are believed to be involved in and which 
are yet to be exposed--if they ever get to be exposed at all. 
There have been talks or reports of some parliamentarians 
acting as mafia bosses, operating illegal casinos and 
surrounding themselves with bodyguards or gunmen, or MPs who 
talk persuasively about forest conservation in the Parliament 
but who own and operate sawmills which clandestinely accept 
illegal logs. Ironically, these men can manage to stand tall in 
society and accorded due respect. 
  Chat Thai is a big party which is made up of members of 
diverse backgrounds and business activities--some of whom are 
known to be involved in unlawful or unethical activities. The 
party should also be well aware of its problem of reputation and 
recognition, especially among the well-educated public. If the 
party is to gain the trust and recognition of the public, its 
first priority should be to clean up its image which, in the 
past, has been tainted by its close association with or its 
subservient attitude toward politically ambitious military 
officers and the lack of political conscience. 
  With a new leader in charge, the Thanong case will hopefully 
provide a fresh start for the Chat Thai Party to project a new 
image and to take a new political course that will be more 
acceptable to the general public.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Parliament Must Take Action on Drug Charges"] </F>
  [Text] If the reactions of the country's leaders were 
anything to go by, Tuesday's revelation that a Thai politician 
is wanted on drug smuggling charges in the United States doesn't 
really amount to much. 
  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration had told him about the case in January 1993 and 
that he had passed the information along to the Justice Ministry. 
  Parliament President Marut Bunnak dismissed the allegations 
as "just a rumor" and said it was premature to start talking 
about setting up a parliamentary committee to investigate them. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan, who oversees 
anti-narcotics agencies, said he thought the Americans had 
enough evidence to back up their charges. He also said the case 
only involved one individual and had done little damage to the 
country's reputation. 
  But Thanong Siriprichaphong is not just an individual. He is 
the honorable member of Parliament for Nakhon Phanom and a 
representative of the Thai people. 
  Earlier this year, as in so many previous years, Thailand 
was 
condemned in the U.S. State Department's annual narcotics report 
because of the "widespread" involvement of high ranking 
government and military officials in the drug trade. 
  Few people in Thailand dispute the accusations. 
  A senior Thai police officer recently told the Associated 
Press: "Who are the big drug people? Just look at the newspapers 
and you'll see some, giving money to charity and getting awards." 
  However, it wasn't until 1992 when Narong Wongwan was forced 
to withdraw as a prime ministerial nominee after the United 
States confirmed he was suspected of being involved in the drug 
trade that any politicians were named. 
  If Thai authorities agree to a seizure request, Thanong 
would 
be the first Thai MP to have assets frozen for involvement in a 
narcotics case. 
  At the moment, the U.S. charges against Thanong remain just 
that--allegations that have yet to be proven in court. 
  Nevertheless they make interesting reading. 
  The first charge dates back to late 1977, when Thanong was 
said to have arranged for a shipment of two tonnes of marijuana 
to the US west coast. 
  Six years later, he was alleged to have sold 7 tonnes of 
marijuana to American dealers in Mexico. 
  At the beginning of 1986, it is charged he signed a deal to 
supply 18 tonnes of marijuana to American smugglers. Later that 
year, he allegedly agreed to arrange a further shipment of 15 
tonnes, the U.S. prosecutor's affidavit says. 
  Altogether, Thanong is alleged to have arranged for the 
smuggling of about 45 tonnes of marijuana for which he received 
$10.3 million in cash. 
  The affidavit makes for detailed reading. It lists locations 
of meetings, names of smuggling vessels, transaction values and 
more. 
  The evidence contained in the report was considered strong 
enough for a US district court to rule that Thanong's assets in 
the United States be seized. It is now 16 months since the DEA 
supplied the information to the Thai authorities. 
  But as of yesterday many leading law figures, including the 
secretary general of the Office of Narcotics Control Board 
Chawalit Yotmani, said they had yet to even be informed of the 
case by the government. 
  The failure of senior government officials to act on the 
case 
is at the very least another example of Chuan's aversion for 
controversy and at the worst, something much more sinister. 
  The long delay has also no doubt done considerable damage to 
Thailand's relationship with Washington, which is known to be 
increasingly critical of the country's inability to stem the 
drug tide. 
  Now that the charges are public knowledge, Chuan and 
parliament must act decisively. A parliamentary committee 
should be set up immediately and the accusations thoroughly 
investigated. 
  To do any less will only enhance the world's impression that 
the hallowed chambers of Thailand's parliament are a sanctuary 
for drug trafficking suspects.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Thai Parliament Must Be Free of Narcotics"] </F>
  [Text] A Thai member of parliament has gained notoriety 
after being accused by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration 
[DEA] of involvement in the international drug trafficking 
movement. As a result, his assets in the United States have 
been seized and his name blacklisted as persona non grata by the 
United States. It has become major news in view of the current 
political situation in Thailand. 
  It can be said that this sort of notoriety is nothing new. 
In the past, several MP's have faced similar charges in 
Australia and Hong Kong; some were even imprisoned abroad based 
on those convictions. 
  An MP who was a former political party leader and a one-time 
candidate for prime minister lost any chance of becoming a 
national political leader because the United States accused him 
of involvement in narcotics trafficking and declared him persona 
non grata. No details were ever given about his alleged 
activities. It became a big story after a report citing a 
Foreign Ministry official or an official of the embassy 
concerned was made public. The story gradually faded away, and 
whoever was concerned with the issue--whether Thai or 
foreigner--never provided any details to clear up the resulting 
confusion. 
  In the latest case, a USIS release claims that the DEA 
provided the Thai Government with a chronology of the Thai MP's 
trafficking activities dating back to 1977 and sought assistance 
in gathering information on the MP's background and assets. 
This was to facilitate the DEA's appeal in a California 
district court to seize the MP's assets. The release also noted 
that a house in Los Angeles and a Mercedes 560 SL were assets 
the MP acquired with profits made by smuggling narcotics into 
the United States beginning in 1977, when the MP started 
smuggling shipments of one or two tons. In mid-1987, U.S. 
Customs officials seized a shipment. 
  Although it is merely an accusation, we believe many people 
feel this causes great damage to Thailand. In particular, the 
honor and prestige of the House of Representatives--which is a 
major institution in Thai society--have been damaged because one 
of its members has been accused of conduct that international 
society and the United States have been trying to suppress. 
  Therefore, we appeal to the president of the House and the 
leader of the party the MP in question belongs to: Take 
responsibility in this notorious issue by undertaking an inquiry 
with the DEA and bringing the MP in person to clarify the 
matter. In this way the people's skepticism can be cleared up.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Make The Facts Clear"] </F>
  [Text] There is a rumor that a U.S. Government office has 
seized assets in San Francisco worth some 30 million baht 
belonging to Thanong Siriprichaphong, a member of parliament 
from Nakhon Phanom. To date no one--including the Thai 
Government and the Office of Narcotics Control Board--has been 
able to confirm or deny the rumor. 
  We feel the Thai Government and the House of Representatives 
have a duty to clear up the facts on this issue. This is 
because regardless of whether the rumor is true, the MP's party 
and the House will suffer damage, as will the country's 
reputation. Even if the seizure of assets did take place, the 
question of whether the MP's conduct conforms with the 
accusation is another matter. 
  The concerned U.S. authorities may have seized the assets in 
line with the relevant U.S. law, but it does not mean we have to 
believe the U.S. accusation is true. On the contrary, the Thai 
Government must carry out its own inquiry to provide justice to 
a Thai citizen. In this context, the U.S. Administration's role 
in dealing with the Singapore Government in the case of a caning 
sentence against a U.S. citizen is no different. 
  It is strange that the Thai Government does not seem to be 
paying much attention to this issue. This is evident in the 
fact that it was the private news agency INN that broke the 
news, and no Thai agency has been able to confirm or deny the 
story. This is despite the fact that the Office of Narcotics 
Control Board maintains regular contact with the DEA to exchange 
information on the arrest of narcotics traffickers. We wonder 
what the government has been doing, or whether it is considering 
using this issue as a political weapon to cover up the bombing 
reports or discourage the opposition's planned no-confidence 
motion. 
  It is becoming a joke that instead of benefiting from this, 
the government could be suspected of planting the rumor or using 
it to subdue the opposition. We feel that if the government 
promptly verifies the story and clears up the facts it will gain 
credit. If the Nakhon Phanom MP is guilty as charged, no one 
can help him.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Damage Done to Thailand Cannot Be Removed by a </F>
Denial of the Charge"] 
  [Text] Thanong Siriprichaphong, Chat Thai Party MP of 
Nakhon Phanom Province, showed his courage when he held a news 
conference on 6 May to deny the U.S. charge that he was involved 
in drug trafficking. By formally denying the charge--two days 
after it was publicized and became a scandal worldwide, Thanong 
has displayed his sense of responsibility. 
  Yet, Thanong's denial was simply aimed at self-protection 
and 
cannot clear up the damage done to the Thai parliament, which 
represents the entire Thai people. His denial at the news 
conference does not prove that the U.S. charge was unfounded. 
In other words, there is no proof that Thanong's denial was the 
truth. 
  A scandal involving a member of parliament naturally affects 
the image of the whole nation, and, if it is not immediately 
clarified, the charge would leave a scar on the nation--the way 
it used to be in the past when our leaders never bothered to 
correct the image of the country and let the world look at the 
Thai as untrustworthy people when it came to the question of 
narcotics. 
  As Thais who must share the blame, we therefore call on Mr. 
Thanong, the Chat Thai Party, and the Thai parliament to jointly 
take responsibility in solving this problem. Mr. Thanong, the 
accused, especially must show his spirit and accept U.S. 
inquiries to prove his innocence. In fact, nobody can charge 
him guilty, neither the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration nor 
the Office of the Narcotics Control Board, since there is not 
enough evidence against him. But as a parliamentarian and 
public figure, Mr. Thanong should make a sacrifice by answering 
the U.S. charge to prove his innocence and thus to restore the 
honor to the entire nation. 
  At this stage, we think most of the Thai people still hold 
Mr. Thanong 100 percent innocent. However, when U.S. 
authorities were seriously seeking cooperation from the Thai 
Government to deal with the case, we cannot help having doubts 
about him. Therefore, it is not enough for Mr. Thanong just to 
deny the charge. Also, it will not improve the image of the 
country if we treat it as a political game and use a delaying 
tactic to buy time until the scandal dies down by itself. 
  We think that, under the present situation, Mr. Thanong 
should challenge the U.S. justice and prove his innocence with 
courage and dignity. Mr. Thanong should accept a full 
investigation, instead of pursuing the case against the media 
through his lawyer, since that would not help in clearing up 
Thailand's image.

  [Text] Police said yesterday they plan to arrest a former 
drug adviser to ex-U.S. President Jimmy Carter who was 
photographed in Burma wearing the uniform of opium warlord Khun 
Sa's hilltribe army. 
  Lt-Colonel Supachai Sirisap, deputy head of the Foreign 
Affairs Division of the Royal Thai Police said: 
  "It is our intention to arrest him when we see him. He 
appears to have crossed the Burmese border illegally from 
Thailand." 
  The statement came after a spokesman for the United States 
embassy said that Peter Bourne, former adviser on narcotics to 
the Carter administration, was indeed the man photographed and 
identified in the Bangkok Post on Sunday as "Peter Bond". 
  A United States embassy spokesman said: 
  "He is not in Burma on any official business of the United 
States Government." 
  "As far as we are concerned Khun Sa is the single biggest 
heroin dealer in Burma and we have warrants out for his arrest," 
the U.S. embassy spokesman said. 
  Khun Sa has offered to sell the United States his annual 
opium crop numerous times in the past as part of his own plan to 
help eradicate the world of heroin. 
  The United States has refused to deal with him despite 
previous visits by Congressman Lester Wolf. 
  Bourne was relieved of his job as presidential adviser on 
narcotics after allegedly abusing his position. 
  Peter Bourne, aged 60, however was rumoured to have 
re-entered Thailand and departed on a U.S.-bound flight on 
Sunday night.

  [Text] Police yesterday denied a news report that they

Jimmy Carter, who reportedly became involved with Burmese opium 
warlord Khun Sa. 
  A newspaper yesterday quoted Lt Col Suphachai Sirisap, 
deputy 
chief of the Foreign Affairs Division, as saying police will 
arrest Peter Bourne when they see him. 
  He also was quoted as saying that Bourne, a former adviser 
on 
narcotics to the Carter administration, appeared to have crossed 
into Burma illegally from Thailand. 
  Bourne, 60, was relieved of his job as presidential adviser 
on narcotics after allegedly abusing his position, according to 
the report. 
  Lt Col Suphachai said yesterday he had never been 
interviewed 
as reported by the newspaper. 
  "I don't know about the issue at all. The report has damaged 
my reputation," he said. 
  Suphachai said he told reporters that any country wanting 
Thailand to arrest a foreigner must first contact the Foreign 
Ministry, which would then inform the Interior Ministry. The 
Interior Ministry would consider whether to order the Police 
Department to take legal action.

  [Text] Pakistan and Iran have agreed to make joint efforts 
with technical and financial assistance from the United Nations 
to check drug trafficking along their borders. A memorandum of 
understanding to this effect was signed in Tehran by retired 
Major General Nasirullah Khan Babar, Pakistani interior 
minister; 'Ali Mohammad Besharati-Jahromi, Iranian interior 
minister; and Giorgio Giacomelli, executive director of the UN 
International Narcotics Control Program. Under the agreement, 
antinarcotics measures along the border between the two 
countries will be made more effective, communications facilities 
will be improved, and arrangements will be made for training 
professionals of law-enforcement agencies. About $30 million 
will be spent on the new antinarcotics measures, of which $21 
million will be paid by Iran which will mostly be used for road 
construction to facilitate the speedy movement of security 
forces. Pakistan will provide $5.5 million, while the UN 
International Narcotics Control Program will pay $3.6 million.

  [Text] Retired Major General Nasirullah Khan Babar, 
minister of the interior, says the present government is 
determined to eliminate the drug menace from society. He said 
this while talking to reporters at Peshawar's airport upon his 
return from Tehran, where he signed a memorandum of 
understanding among Iran, Pakistan, and the United Nations 
Narcotics Control Program. He said the three sides will spend 
$31 million on narcotics control measures. The interior minister 
said narcotics are reaching Pakistan from Afghanistan because of 
the political instability there, while materials used to process 
heroin are being smuggled into Pakistan from India. 
  During his stay in Tehran, Nasirullah Khan Babar met Iranian 
President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani and conveyed messages of 
goodwill and good wishes to him from Pakistan's president and 
prime minister.

  [Editorial Report] Cairo ROSE AL-YUSUF in Arabic on 25 
April publishes on pages 14 and 15 a 2,200-word investigative 
report by Wa'il al-Ibrashi under the headline: "Top Secret and 
Published for the First Time." "Arrest of a Kuwaiti in Cairo on 
Charges of Financing Terrorism, and Search for Saudi Arms 
Dealer." Under this banner headline, the writer says that on 1 
April the State Security Investigations Department arrested a 
Kuwaiti called 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Mujaybil in a furnished 
apartment and took him for questioning on charges of "financing 
terrorism and supporting the extremists." During his 
interrogation, al-Mujaybil said that he is a member of an 
officially registered Kuwaiti society called "the Society for 
the Revival of Islamic Heritage." This society is headed by 
Shaykh Khalid Sultan Bin-'Isa and is managed by Shaykh 'Abdallah 
al-'Atiqi. He said he came to Egypt a few days ago to extend 
some aid to a number of benevolent enterprises in Egypt. 
  Egyptian security sources, according to the writer, have 
denied the story that al-Mujaybil came to extend aid to 
benevolent enterprises, saying that he was arrested red-handed. 
He was arrested in Cairo after several days and not when he 
arrived. The investigation sources revealed that a member of an 
extremist group who was under surveillance and owns a printing 
press for printing and publishing religious books and leaflets 
was seen more than once meeting with the Kuwaiti 'Abd-al-Rahman 
al-Mujaybil immediately after the latter's arrival in Cairo. 
When the security forces stormed the house of the printing 
press owner, they discovered a check for a large sum of money 
paid to him by 'Abd-al-Rahman al- Mujaybil, as well as large 
sums of foreign currency. Al-Mujaybil claimed under 
interrogation that he gave the check to the printing press owner 
to pay for printing a book because the cost in Egypt is less 
than any other place, and that his relationship to the man is 
purely professional. However, the security authorities were not 
convinced and the investigation is continuing. 
  Meanwhile, the writer continues, the security authorities in 
Egypt and in more than one Arab country--such as Algeria, Yemen, 
and Jordan--are looking for a Saudi arms dealer called Nasir 
Mashhur al-Ruwayli, classified as the "most dangerous arms and 
drug smuggler across Arab borders." He uses drug smuggling to 
conclude arms deals. He smuggles these arms to Arab countries 
where there is intensive extremist activity, particularly Egypt, 
Algeria, Yemen, and Jordan. The writer says that al-Ruwayli is 
wanted in Saudi Arabia and several other Arab countries.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Dr. Hasan </F>
Rowhani, Ayatollah Khamene'i's deputy on the Supreme National 
Security Council, by an unidentified RESALAT correspondent in 
Tehran; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [RESALAT] As the secretary of the Supreme 
National Security Council, what image of domestic and external 
security would you project for the Islamic Republic of Iran? 
What would constitute the most serious threats at home and 
abroad? 
  [Rowhani] The image of national security is wonderful, 
although not ideal. We are talking of the security of a country 
in which there were changes in every area 15 years ago, when a 
rare kind of revolution reached fruition. This revolution has 
numerous enemies. Similarly, we have put behind us a prolonged 
and major war that lasted eight years, the marks and effects of 
which have not been obliterated. We are constantly encountering 
the mischief-making of the counterrevolutionary groups. 
  Compared with our Northern, Eastern, and Western neighbors, 
our security is remarkable. The condition of our Southern 
neighbors is different and a vast array of foreign military 
forces is present. We should view their situation differently. 
In those areas, security is provided by others and for their 
own interests. 
  We still have some centers of insecurity in the west and 
east 
of the country. In the West, Iraq is the root cause of 
insecurity. In Kordestan, the vestiges of lackey grouplets 
remain active. A country that has borne the brunt of war for 
eight years, a war that has included security issues, cannot 
efface them fast. [passage omitted] 
  In the eastern regions we have pockets of insecurity 
stemming 
from the problem of narcotics. The issue of combating drug 
smugglers is tackled mostly for human considerations. 
Generally, the smugglers do not want to distribute drugs in 
Iran. They mostly want their goods to transit through Iran. 
The center for manufacturing narcotics is in a region outside 
Iran, between Pakistan and Afghanistan. They want to use Iran 
as a route to convey the drugs to Europe and the United States. 
The primary users of drugs are the Americans and then the 
Europeans. 
  The main drug dealers and smugglers are also in the United 
States and Europe. At times, even Western officials are 
involved in this smuggling, which was exposed during recent 
humiliating discoveries in Europe and the United States. 
  If the corruption in Europe and the United States and the 
straying of their youth were not important for us, we could 
ignore our campaign against the smugglers and, naturally, the 
eastern regions of the country would become completely safe. 
  It is because of our sense of responsibility toward the fate 
of mankind that we continue this struggle against these death 
peddlers. Unfortunately, the Westerners are not only ungrateful 
to our self-sacrificing forces, they castigate us for our 
treatment and execution of the smugglers and label it human 
rights violations. 
  But we consider ourselves beholden to the fate of humans, as 
the happiness, health, and good fortune of our fellow beings is 
one of our mottoes. Thus we can say that we have two centers of 
insecurity, one of which relates to Iraq and the other to 
narcotics. [passage omitted]
