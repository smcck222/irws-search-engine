<F P=106> [Article by Steen Voigt: "The Baltic Sea Begins on Land"] </F>
  [Text] The Baltic Sea is something we sing about during 
international matches at Parken, something we think about when 
Bornholm fishermen sell cod at Christiansborg Slotplads, or when 
a Swedish court is asked to find elusive solutions to bridge 
projects. 
  But the Baltic Sea is actually closer to us than that every 
day. 
  After all, it begins on land, in Danish wheat fields, in 
Swedish fields, in the Russian taiga, and in Czech and Polish 
mining and industrial regions. 
  Thousands of water sources -- rivers, streams, and creeks -- 
carry toxic substances from industry, unpurified waste water 
from towns, and nutritive salts from agriculture out into the 
sea. 
  Thus, protecting and restoring the unique natural resources 
of the Baltic Sea is naturally a matter of national importance 
not only in Denmark, but in all nations surrounding the 422,000 
square meter saltwater sea. 
  Mobilization of the people is one of six points in a 
long-range plan of action developed by a special task force of 
the Helsinki Commission (HELCOM) to save the Baltic Sea. 
  This is also because environmental and nature-friendly 
thinking must gain understanding among the people, particularly 
in the formerly communist countries. 
  After all, it is mainly the local people who will have to 
pay 
for purification facilities and containers. In return, they will 
have better health, a better environment, and more plentiful 
nature. 
<H5>  Hot Spots </H5>
  The plan, which includes the years 1993 to 2010, will 
require 
total investments of over 130 billion kroner over the 18-year 
period. Of this amount, just under 80 billion will go directly 
toward a number of polluting "hot spots" such as industrial 
plants and cities that send untreated wastewater directly into 
the closest river. 
  Most of these "hot spots" are in Poland, the three Baltic 
countries, and the Russian cities of St. Petersburg and 
Kaliningrad. But investments will also be made deeper into 
Europe, in the Czech and Slovak Republics. 
  Air pollution, in the form of nitrogen compounds from 
constantly increasing auto emissions and from power plants, is 
another significant cause of the ecological imbalance in the 
Baltic Sea. 
  Along with nutrient wastes from households and 
overfertilized 
agricultural lands, this disturbs the ecological balance of the 
sea, resulting in algae growth, oxygen shortage, and the death 
of fish, bottom animals, and plants. In recent years, 
approximately one-fourth of the Baltic Sea has been affected by 
the death of plants and animals on the sea floor. 
  The plan points to three hot spots in Denmark. 
  Two of these are the Belt and Oresund, which are 
overburdened 
with nutrients from agriculture. The Danish clean water plan of 
1988 was unable to remedy these situations. 
  The third involves the release of wastewater from Copenhagen 
into Oresund. During heavy rains, Copenhagen County's sewerage 
and treatment facilities still have insufficient capacity and 
untreated waste from the sewers is released directly into 
Oresund. County plans for the region include investments of a 
half to a billion kroner. 
<H5>  Warnings </H5>
  The HELCOM plan comes 25 years after the first serious 
alarms 
about the sorry condition of the Baltic Sea began to be sounded 
for the general public. 
  Troubled researchers reported finding environmental poisons 
such as PCB and DDT in Baltic Sea seals, fish, and birds. Driven 
by the UN's environmental conference in Stockholm in 1972, these 
concerns were translated into action, culminating on 22 March 
1974. 
  At that time, at the invitation of Finland, the then seven 
Baltic Sea nations signed signed the Helsinki Convension on 
protecting the Baltic Sea environment. This was the first 
international agreement of its kind for regulating all pollution 
of the sea. 
  Since then, this convention and HELCOM have been the axis 
around which work involving nature and the environment in the 
Baltic Sea has turned. Through so-called recommendations, the 
commission has set guidelines for everything from permissible 
chemical emissions to environmentally sound harbor facilities 
for shipping traffic. 
<H5>  Good Tempo </H5>
  From the Finnish capital, where of course the commission has 
its headquarters, General Secretary Ulf Ehlin, a Swedish 
oceanographer, said that 20 years of work and cooperation had 
reduced pollution in the Baltic Sea. 
  It is difficult to say precisely where and how much, due to 
the poor data available from the beginning of this work from the 
Eastern countries during the Iron Curtain period. 
  But the general secretary pointed to the rapid effort 
against 
the environmental pollutants PCB and DDT, which threatened 
several bird species and seals with extinction, as an extremely 
positive experience in this body of water, which stretches from 
the Gulf of Bothnia in the north to Skagen in the west. 
  "The situation has improved in many places and many 
aspects," 
Ehlin told BERLINGSKE TIDENDE. 
  One positive surprise is that even now over 20 billion 
kroner 
have been appropriated for investments. 
  This includes major investments in purification plants in 
East Germany as a result of reunification, which have raised 
this figure considerably. But Poland alone is responsible for 
just under a third of the total sum, and that is good news, 
according to Ehlin, who also points to Estonia and Lithuania. 
  Several Danish companies have made preliminary studies in 
connection with the plan of action and since the breakup of the 
East they have examined possible projects and delivered 
environmental technology and know-how to the Baltic nations and 
Poland, in particular, in cooperation with both Danish and local 
authorities. 
  Denmark has made direct investments in many environmental 
projects in the Eastern countries, through the environmental 
assistance program of the Environmental Affairs Ministry and, 
beginning this year, through environmentally related sector 
programs, such as in the energy and agriculture sectors. A total 
of 300 million kroner has been appropriated for the Eastern 
countries in 1994, which will benefit the Baltic Sea as well. 
<H5>  More in Addition </H5>
  Private nature and environment organizations are also 
playing 
an important role in the restoration of the Baltic Sea. 
Greenpeace, the World Wildlife Foundation, and others were 
included in the commission's work at an early stage, receiving 
observer status at the meetings. 
  And in the formerly communist countries, grassroots 
movements 
have sprung up and they are working together with organizations 
and agencies in every way. 
  The World Wildlife Foundation, WWF, has been given 
responsibility for a key point in the plan, namely the 
restoration of important coastal wetlands and islands in the 
Baltic nations and Poland. 
  These areas have all been reclaimed and used for agriculture 
or abused with waste and pollution because they have not been 
considered important. 
  Since 1992 the chairman of the Helsinki Commission has been 
Fleming Otzen of the Environmental Board. He has been involved 
with work surrounding the convenstion for over 20 years. 
  He believes the Baltic Sea is in worse shape today than in 
1974. 
  "Things had begun to go downhill at that time and you cannot 
reverse that trend with a convention. That is not possible. The 
destruction will continue for a number of years." 
  Since then, a lot has happened that no one thought of in 
1974. 
  "Air pollution was incorrectly underestimated. And now there 
are all the nutrient salts that are the problem. The oxygen 
deficiency will continue until agriculture stops its 
overfertilization and until sewage is no longer emitted into the 
sea," he said. 
  Next Tuesday [1 March] Otzen will host the environmental 
ministers of the Baltic Sea nations at the 15th meeting of the 
convention, to celebrate its 20th anniversary. 
  But they will also evaluate the results of previous 
decisions, including the decision to reduce by half the emission 
of a long list of environmentally harmful substances into the 
Baltic Sea during the decade of 1985 to 1995. 
  This reduction by half will hardly be achieved, but they are 
working hard on the matter.

<F P=106> [Article by Ole Vigant Ryborg: "Danish Skeleton in the </F>
Closet"] 
  [Text] Danish overevaluation of the merits of the 
environmental guarantee before the national referendum on the EC 
package in 1986 has in reality rendered the guarantee unusable 
for Denmark and weakens Denmark in negotiations on environment 
and health issues. 
  Health Minister Torben Lund has dusted off the environmental 
guarantee and has been advocating use of it in connection with 
the food-coloring directive. In other places -- particularly in 
the central administration -- there is very little enthusiasm 
for turning this kind of political leverage into a legal 
proceeding. 
  There was no hesitation in the voice of Prime Minister Poul 
Schluter when on 28 January 1986 he rose from his seat in the 
Folketing and ascended the podium: 
  "Many spokesmen have said: We wish to make our own decisions 
in the environmental sphere, and I well understand this. We will 
achieve this, and will achieve it in a better way than before. 
  ``But now we will have a different system, a system that 
enables us to make our own national regulations. It is 
unprecedented in the EC for this to be acknowledged in EC law. 
It is incorporated into the treaty itself in Article 100 A.'' 
  The prime minister played his trump. At that point, it was 
just a month until the Danish people were to go to the polls and 
accept or reject the so-called EC package. The prime minister 
and his enthusiastically pro-EC foreign affairs minister had 
serious domestic problems. A majority of the Folketing was 
opposed to Danish acceptance of the "package." There were two 
parts to the EC package, in particular, that had caused a 
majority in the Folketing to urge a no vote. The first was the 
additional power the European Parliament would assume, and the 
other was the fear that the environment would take second place 
to harmonization of the inner market. 
  While the issue of the European Parliament's role was a very 
technical matter, the discussion around the so-called 
environmental guarantee evolved in 1985 into an orgy of Danish 
assurances about the guarantee's merits. The guarantees for 
Danish health and the future of the environment were touted 
within the Folketing, the Marketing Committee, in statements 
issued by the Foreign Affairs Ministry, and in commentary from 
the daily press. Yet, it is interesting to note that after eight 
years, it has never yet been "necessary" to invoke those 
guaranties. This despite obvious problems in the EC related to 
solvents, cancer-causing agents, and the most recent issue on 
food coloration. The cause: Nearly every case in which the 
environmental guarantee might be invoked provides an opportunity 
for exposure of the fact that the Danish interpretation of the 
environmental guarantee is not viable. 
<H5>  Negotiation Problems </H5>
  It is not exactly a well-kept secret that Denmark employs a 
much wider interpretation of the use of the environmental 
guarantee than that laid down by the European Commission's legal 
services. Or compared to the other EU [European Union] nations. 
Even before the national referendum in February 1986, the 
question of Denmark's interpretation was raised and later 
discussed. One place it was discussed was at the conference held 
in Copenhagen in April 1987, in which the general directors of 
both the Council of Ministers and the Commission's legal 
services, Dewost and Ehlermann, clearly laid down a ruling that 
made the guarantee less usable than the Danish interpretation 
would have it. 
  The fact that there is a discrepancy in the interpretations 
is not unusual, but the very strict Danish interpretation of the 
environmental guarantee has ultimately become a problem for 
Denmark in the negotiations in Brussels. 
  A number of centrally placed Danish diplomats have admitted 
to INFORMATION that the Danish interpretation is a distinct 
inconvenience when Danish officials and ministers in Brussels 
must fight to maintain Danish standards on environmental and 
health issues. These officials argue that if those in Brussels 
could "threaten" the Commission with the idea that Denmark might 
invoke the environmental guarantee, such a threat could 
influence the Commission to alter its proposals in a direction 
more favorable to Denmark. 
<H5>  Guarantee or Sop? </H5>
  The basic difference in the interpretation of treaty Article 
100 A, which contains the environmental guarantee, is largely a 
matter of the extent to which this article is a genuine 
guarantee for a better environment and the extent to which it is 
a kind of sop to those countries who are likely to vote against 
the directives on the inner market when they are put to a vote. 
In 1985/86, there was no question in the Danish mind that the 
article was a real guarantee. 
  "In those instances in which the uniform technical 
regulations do not adequately safeguard health, work 
environment, or the environment in general, a member nation may 
introduce national measures with the object of fulfilling this 
goal," Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, then foreign affairs minister, 
assured the Folketing on 28 January 1986. He was backed up by a 
number of statements issued by the Foreign Affairs Ministry in 
the period before the national election. 
  However, in at least four areas, the Danish interpretation 
of 
the guarantee diverges from the interpretation in other places. 
This concerns: 

  -  Regulations established in committee procedures. 
  -  The 
extent to which a nation must vote negatively in order to invoke 
the environmental guarantee. 
  -  The extent to which a nation has 
the right to invoke the environmental guarantee for the purpose 
of introducing stricter regulations at a later date, after an EC 
regulation has already passed. 
  -  Which party should bear the 
burden of proof when the EC Court is called upon to determine 
whether a nation may set higher standards for the environment 
and health. 
<H5>  Food Coloring </H5>
  Of these, the final point is the crucial reason why Denmark 
on a number of occasions has refrained from invoking the 
environmental guarantee. Both in the case of warning labels for 
cancer-causing substances and in the present case of the 
so-called food-coloring directive, problems have arisen because 
there is disagreement among the technical experts on the 
inherent danger of the substance. While, in Denmark, it is 
regarded as a fact that a number of substances allowed by the 
directive are dangerous, a number of experts from other 
countries consider these substances to be harmless. Therefore, 
if Denmark is to invoke the environmental guarantee with any 
effect, a crucial question must be who would have the burden of 
proof if such a case should go before the EC Court. The European 
Commission does not hesitate in this matter. According to the 
Commission, the country that wishes to invoke the environmental 
guarantee has the burden of proof before the Court to 
substantiate its claim. The Danish interpretation is exactly the 
opposite. 
  "It is obvious that if the Court is to render an opinion on 
the allegation of misuse, it is incumbent upon the party 
bringing the complaint to substantiate it. The burden of proof 
on the member nations will as a result be lighter," wrote Kent 
Kirk, the current Conservative EU spokesman, in a commentary in 
INFORMATION on 24 February 1986. 
  Should Denmark invoke the environmental guarantee in 
conjunction with the food-coloring directive, the fact that 
Denmark overinterpreted the guarantee in 1986 would in all 
likelihood be revealed. 
<H5>  Freedom of Action </H5>
  And, if at a later point, it could be shown that some of the 
substances that are now permitted by the food-coloring directive 
in Denmark were dangerous, it would not be possible to tighten 
up on Danish regulations by invoking the environmental guarantee 
without the risk of raising a conflict over interpretation. 
  "It must follow that even if the Council has passed joint 
regulations, a member state can retain more comprehensive 
pre-existing regulations; that a member state can choose 
directly at the time of passage and implementation of the EC 
regulation to impose stricter national regulations, or else 
choose in the first instance to utilize the joint regulations, 
but later -- in light of developments -- choose to tighten these 
through the use of national regulations," wrote the Foreign 
Affairs Ministry in a statement issued 30 January 1986. 
  Evidence that the Commission does not agree with this 
interpretation can be found, among other things, in an answer 
given by the Commission in the European Parliament on March 1987 
to Else Hammerich, a member of the EC Parliament at that time. 
  One problem with the food-coloring directive is that, once 
the directive is passed, a special committee will continually 
revise the list of substances that are allowed or prohibited. In 
the debate on the directive, former Industry Minister Jan 
Trojborg has put a great deal of emphasis upon the fact that 
Denmark was able to insert a clause to the effect that in the 
period before the directive goes into effect this committee 
should evaluate a number of substances again. The Danish 
interpretation of the environmental guarantee suggests that 
Denmark could also avail itself of the environmental guarantee 
with regard to the committee's later work, while the Commission 
in its answer to Hammerich clearly said no to that kind of use 
of the guarantee. The EU Court has, as a result, decided that if 
Denmark wishes to invoke the environmental guarantee on the 
food-coloring directive, it must occur immediately after the 
passage of the directive. 
  The environmental guarantee has again been dusted off by, 
among others, Health Minister Torben Lund who has urged using it 
in connection with the food-coloring directive. But, in other 
places -- especially in the central administration -- there is 
very little enthusiasm for turning this kind of political 
leverage into a legal proceeding. Denmark has too many potential 
skeletons in the closet for that.

<F P=106> [Article by Pauli Andersen: "Clean Water"] </F>
  [Text] The European conception of clean drinking water will 
be profoundly challenged in coming years. The chemical industry 
and a number of EU [European Union] nations will permit drinking 
water to contain toxins, as long as it does not harm humans. 
Denmark has said no to more toxins in the waters. But Danish 
scientists maintain this position is unreasonable. 
  "Never drink water," said W.C. Fields, who would never have 
dreamed of mixing a drop of the stuff into his shot glass of 
whiskey. 
  The Danes were not listening. They drink several billion 
liters of it each year. All in good conscience. For, as long as 
there have been humans on this earth, clean groundwater has been 
a given as profound as life itself. 
  Yet, even as the second millennium is humming its final 
refrain, the conception of this pristine necessity of life has 
been challenged by something resembling the first bar of the 
virgin spring's swan song. 
  The threat arises from chemicals leached from old industrial 
sites and nitrates from the use of agricultural fertilizer. To 
this may be added new information about raw water that arrives 
at water purification plants polluted with pesticides. Denmark's 
Geological Survey (DGU) has just published this finding in a 
report on the state of the groundwater. 
  How great is the threat? Have they found quantities in the 
groundwater so minuscule they are incapable of causing harm? 
Is the perception of pollution in reality a deception 
perpetrated by instruments so sensitive they (to use a 
scientist's words) could measure Napoleon's urine production on 
an anxious morning at the front? 
  Can Denmark and Europe sacrifice with equanimity the 
principle of uncontaminated groundwater for the sake of 
maintaining our present-day intensive and industrialized 
agricultural operations? Or is the discovery of toxic sprays and 
nitrates in the groundwater so alarming that agriculture must 
accustom itself to the use of much less fertilizer and poisons? 
  That is a question that will occupy an important place on 
the 
EU agenda in the coming year. 
<H5>  Pressure on the EU </H5>
  Billions and billions of kroner are at issue. The chemicals 
industry is afraid that restrictions on the use of pesticides 
will cause their profits to plummet. And many governments in EU 
countries have so much difficulty in achieving the requirement 
of zero-contaminated groundwater that they are facing 
extraordinary expenditure for water purification, if the 
regulations are not relaxed. 
  It is estimated that 25 billion kroner will be used in 
Denmark over the course of 30 to 100 years for cleaning up old 
dump sites and industrial locales. Purification of water or the 
relocation of water wells because of the nitrate and pesticide 
content in reservoirs is expected to cost the society an 
additional billion. 
  Reflecting the concerns of agriculture, the economy, and the 
environment, the dilemma has taken the form of an assault upon 
two EU directives. A number of member countries are demanding 
that the regulations on certification of plant toxins and 
protection of the groundwater be relaxed. The main argument 
being advanced is that it is all right for groundwater to 
contain traces of pesticides when it is a question of harmless 
quantities. 
  Following an Irish initiative, the Belgian chairmanship 
shortly before Christmas made the proposal that the World Health 
Organization's water quality standards, rather than the 
principle of zero contamination, should be applied to pesticides 
in drinking water. 
  Ireland, Great Britain, France, Spain, and Belgium support 
this proposal. If they are to avoid billions in expenditure for 
purification, threshold values will have to be set at a level 
they can achieve, according to one of the main arguments. 
  The push for more relaxed regulations for pesticides in 
drinking water has come at a time when the EU's fifth 
environmental program is advocating stronger protection of 
groundwater and a lower consumption of pesticides. It also comes 
at a time when the EU heads of state have auspiciously announced 
"that the major battles on behalf of the environment will be won 
or lost during the course of this decade." 
  The official Danish position is as clear as uncontaminated 
drinking water. More relaxed regulations will be a major setback. 
  But Danish scientists are posing the question whether 
healthwise it is even reasonable for Denmark to insist upon the 
principle of uncontaminated drinking water. 
<H5>  Critical Scientists </H5>
  Associate Professor Erik Arvin of the Laboratory for 
Technical Hygiene at Denmark's Technical University is one of 
the critical voices: 
  "Pesticides in the microscopic quantities found in Danish 
groundwater are not harmful. However, Danish environmental 
policy in the groundwater issue is determined almost exclusively 
by what it is technically feasible to measure. The attitude is, 
if it can be measured, it's toxic. 
  ``An ordinary halt in traffic causes the ingestion of 30 to 
40 times the concentration of chlorinated solvent as is found in 
groundwater. And a public pool is a downright gas chamber viewed 
from this perspective,'' he said. 
  Veterinarian Bent Fenger, director of WHO's European Water 
and Sewage Office, dared to lay his head on the block when it 
came to the health and scientific threshold values the 
organization has established for chemicals in drinking water. 
Although the values are up to 1,000 times higher than the 
existing threshold values of 0.1 microgram (in principle, zero), 
he guaranteed them to be so safe that human health is not an 
issue as long as the values are not exceeded. This would hold 
true even if there were many different substances present in the 
water at the same time. 
  "The threshold values build upon a thorough scientific 
documentation of materials with built-in safety factors of up to 
100,000," said Fenger. 
<H5>  Pesticides and Cancer </H5>
  In some of the scientific investigations on pesticides under 
discussion, one may read that many of these substances are 
carcinogenic. This is true of a study published in 1992 by Dr. 
Flemming Lander, a Danish physician who studied occupational 
diseases. 
  Lander demonstrated a frequency of up to five times the 
average number of cancer cases among gardeners. That is, among 
people who have frequent contact with pesticides. 
  On the basis of his work with cancer patients and 
pesticides, 
Lander stated that, as far as health was concerned, it was 
playing the lottery to place threshold values on the pesticide 
content of drinking water. 
  His study, which included 4,000 gardeners, did not mention 
types or doses of the pesticides the gardeners had been exposed 
to. But an organization under WHO, the International Agency for 
Cancer Research (IARC), has recorded a number of pesticides that 
are potentially cancer causing. This includes, among others, 
five of the eight chemicals that DGU measured in treated water. 
  "We register chemicals that have the ability to cause 
cancer. 
But our records do not tell what doses are necessary to cause 
it," said biologist Henrik Moller from IARC in Lyon. 
  How much or how little of these substances must be present 
to 
cause cancer or other health problems has simply not been 
evaluated by Danish environment administrators. The idea that an 
evaluation of levels dangerous to health should supplant the 
guiding principle of zero contamination runs up against strong 
resistance from environmentalists. 
  Finn Bro Rasmussen, chairman of the EU's advisory 
Environmental Chemicals Committee, considered it absurd to place 
one's fate in the hands of science in so basic a question as 
groundwater. 
  And in the Danish Environmental Board, Gunver Bennekou, 
director of the Office of Preventive Means, agreed: 
  "You can perhaps run a risk with food or medicine. Because 
those substances can quickly be removed if we learn something 
new. But with groundwater it is a question of an ongoing process 
over many years. In other words, our knowledge is of no use if 
we find out that we set our threshold values too high," she said. 
  Anders Baekgaard, director of the Danish Purification Plant 
Association, said: 
  "We would have considerable difficulty explaining to our 
consumers that they can feel easy about drinking water with 
toxic residues or solvents in it. But it is also a bad idea to 
relax quality standards in an area, like water, that is an 
important pillar in the maintenance of life itself." 
<H5>  The People's Voice </H5>
  The voice of the people is as yet very meek. The battle over 
drinking water has so far not appealed to popular movements to 
anything like the same degree as the question of nuclear power 
did, for example. 
  Danish environmental opinion on the subject has been 
virtually synonymous with agronomist Lone Albrektsen. She 
started the Greenpeace agricultural campaign. Ever since the 
organization shut down that aspect of its work, she has worked 
alone on her own to capture people's attention concerning the 
groundwater problem. 
  Her main point is that the threat to the groundwater cannot 
be eliminated unless agriculture is radically transformed into 
an extensive and ecological operation. 
  "If EU support to today's industrialized agriculture were to 
be given instead to ecological operations, ecological 
agriculture would pay for itself far better in the long run than 
conventional agriculture. At the same time, society would save 
the money for prevention of pollution that conventional 
agriculture generates. To slack off on environmental 
requirements for the sake of encouraging the current form of 
agriculture would be an unforgivable experiment with the health 
of our own and future generations," said Albrektsen.

<F P=106> [Article by Janni Andreassen: "Green Taxes Will Hit the </F>
Gluttons"] 
  [Text] Environment: Industry will get an increasing share 
of green taxes. Seen from an economic point of view, this is not 
a catastrophe, according to a lecturer in social economics. 
  Green taxes will change attitudes toward consumption and 
resources. It will be expensive to use unnecessary energy. Seen 
in another way, if Mr. and Mrs. Jensen absolutely must lie in a 
heated water bed, then they must pay more than the rest of us 
who remain on a mattress and slats. 
  With the government's tax reform of the summer of 1993 it 
will be the housekeepers who will notice the green taxes. 
  Now a committee across party lines is sitting to put the 
finishing touches on the details of a proposal in which it will 
be industry's turn to pay taxes that will provide an income of 
about 3 billion kroner over a period of a few years. 
  All industry has been against the tax, arguing that the 
medicine can be so strong that it knocks the patient for a loop. 
  "But seen from an economic point of view, green taxes are 
not 
a catastrophe for industry," Jesper Jespersen, a lecturer in 
social economics at Roskilde University Center, says. 
  "What industry can fear is that the government may rapidly 
introduce higher taxes without any form of repayment to 
industrial firms. This would create problems. Therefore I also 
think that the government's signal to industry should have been 
clearer so that everyone would understand that the introduction 
of green taxes is something that is coming but that at the same 
time requires a long-run strategy." 
<H5>  Green Success </H5>
  Japan is the history of a green success. But it didn't look 
like this 20 years ago, when the country was about to choke in 
environmental problems. The energy crisis in the 1970's came to 
Japan's rescue. Instead of letting the gas-guzzler stay in the 
garage and riding a bicycle to the baker, the Japanese developed 
the technology for a small, environmentally friendly, compact 
car. 
  Today the Japanese have overcome their problems in resources 
and environment with very tough taxes. This has not meant any 
economic catastrophe. On the contrary, Japan has reduced its 
energy consumption to a third of that of the United States, 
which means that they are three times more energy efficient. 
  "In the Danish industrial cost picture, energy makes up 
today 
about 3 percent. Therefore, for example, a doubling of the price 
will not be an cost catastrophe." 
  ``But industry must have the necessary time for the change 
so 
that in its investment plans it can take into account that 
energy has become more expensive, that to a greater extent than 
before more must be invested in energy-saving machines and in 
the necessary preparation for production." 
  ``If in addition, political care is taken to connect the 
green proceeds to the development of resource and energy saving 
technologies, this will contribute to an increase in the rate of 
industrial change so that in reality businesses will not be 
particularly burdened economically. They will simply have some 
earlier costs that would have come anyway and that they would 
have had to pay just the same.'' 
<H5>  Question of Style </H5>
  Will green taxes primarily be used to change attitudes and 
conduct? 
  "Green taxes are primarily environmentally regulating. They 
must not be used to fill up the national coffers. They are to 
hit marginal consumption -- extreme consumption -- both in 
industry and in housekeeping. And not, for example, like carbon 
dioxide emission, which is screwed together completely 
backwards. If you are a little pig in the environment, you must 
pay 50 kroner per ton in taxes. If you are a somewhat smaller 
pig, you only pay 25 kroner. And if you pig out in high style, 
you may have to pay according to the environmental provisions of 
industry. 
  ``One does not get a better environment free." 
  ``Today most of the environmental taxes are imposed upon 
total consumption." That is, we pay the same 50 ore in taxes for 
the first and the last kilowatt hour [kwh]." 
  ``This is falling between two stools. The first kwh that is 
used in a company or in a house is a necessity. Without it, we 
cannot survive economically or physically. Therefore the tax on 
the first part of the consumption is not conduct-regulating, 
either. But at the other end it can become so, when you use kwh 
to warm up the water bed -- or you don't close the chimney or 
replace the energy-consuming bulb with an energy-saving one in 
the factory." 
  ``Fifty ore in tax for the last kwh does not push people 
much 
in a conduct-regulating direction. But it produces perhaps five 
kroner in five years." 
  ``The important thing is to make people understand the 
saving 
percentages and green taxes in good time. In five years things 
will work fine. In a few years industry can adapt its activity 
either by lowering the temperature, rationalizing production, or 
by carrying out energy savings. The point is that it must be 
expensive not to save where it is possible to do so.'' 
<H5>  Repayment </H5>
  Shall industry have a direct share in the repayment of 
profits from the green taxes? 
  "The ideal competitively would be to give the money back to 
the individual businesses. But some companies are more locked 
into their methods of production. Even if they get a part of the 
profit, it is not certain that they will be able to use it to 
save energy. Therefore I would much prefer to give it back on a 
branch level, so that the firms that have the possibility of 
changing their production structure can have some of the money." 
  ``In repaying on a branch level, there is always the danger 
of being cost-neutral, even if this is not completely correct, 
because the moneys originally came from the businesses 
themselves. But this must be seen in the light that one is 
getting a cleaner environment and possibly also products and 
production processes that will be more competitive when energy 
prices rise." 
  ``It is a gamble. But one of the gambles that is less 
uncertain." 
  ``Finally, there is an important difference in the way one 
measures the environmental effect. The choice is between 
administrative regulation and a market one. In their report of 
May of last year, the wise men concluded unanimously that it is 
up to seven times cheaper to use the economic instruments, 
because they can be adapted to the businesses that can most 
easily change their production structure." 
  ``Whereas if one forces a uniform regulation onto all 
businesses, then one forces a costly task upon the ones that 
have difficulties in changing.'' 
<H5>  Danish Solitary Path </H5>
  Is the Danish solitary path useful in the environmental 
area? 
  "As far as value growth and consumption possibilities are 
concerned, it does not make a lot of difference whether Denmark 
alone introduces the carbon dioxide tax or whether it is made 
into part of a larger common European action. This is also in 
the wise men's report. A coordinated effort will give a little 
minus in value growth of 0.3 percent, while an isolated Danish 
effort will give a minus of 0.4 percent." 
  ``It would be a little harder on private consumption, where 
a 
coordinated effort leads to a fall of 0.3 percent, while an 
isolated Danish effort gives a minus of 1.0 percent." 
  ``Where one considers that consumption is rising by 3 
percent 
a year at the moment, it is only a third of one single year's 
consumption rise that we lose by going our own way." 
  ``But this is not the impression one gets when one hears 
comments from industry and political organizations. They have 
simply not digested the results. This is too bad for the wise 
men, and it is too bad for the debate.'' 
<H5>  National Coffers </H5>
  What do you think the finance minister means by 
conduct-regulating green taxes? 
  "Conduct-regulating taxes can lead to a cleaner environment 
and a less energy-dependent production and consumption. But it 
can also be done in a way that makes the finance minister happy." 
  ``What there is a lot of, namely labor, will be made 
cheaper. 
And what there is little of, resources, will be made more 
expensive." 
  ``There are not many wage taxes left in Denmark to regulate. 
But the gross tax and the earmarked labor market taxes are in 
reality the gearshift the finance minister can back up with." 
  ``He can also use the gearshift to back up with the 
withholding tax by saying that the businesses that change their 
cost structures do not have to pay all the withheld amount of 
worker taxes if they in turn are willing to have resource 
consumption be taxed by a corresponding amount." 
  ``And what's the trick? Well, the finance minister gets just 
as much money in his coffers. He eases the tax on the use of 
labor and increases it on the resource side." 
  ``There may be businesses that will have difficulties in 
managing a change. Therefore such an arrangement can be done 
voluntarily at first." 
  ``With the great unemployment we have, we must now work on 
the environmental sector. This is enough to work on.''

<F P=106> [Article by Tapio Mainio: "Forest Research Institute: Heavy </F>
Metal Emissions Into Environment Have Decreased; Volume of 
Cadmium Reduced by One-Fourth"] 
  [Text] According to the Forest Research Institute (METLA), 
less heavy metal than before is spreading into Finland's natural 
environment. According to the METLA report, the amount of toxic 
cadmium in moss samples has decreased by one-fourth over the 
past five years. 
  Cadmium and nickel emissions into the air have decreased 
because the fertilizer industry has changed its production 
methods. 
  According to an earlier Environment Ministry study, 
discharges into the ground increased during the late 1980's, but 
emissions into the air and water decreased. 
  Cadmium is one of the most toxic elements. As an 
environmental toxin, it accumulates in tissue, especially the 
kidneys and liver, and it may cause serious intoxication. Not 
all of cadmium's injurious effects are known. 
<H5>  Most in Harjhavalta and Kokkola </H5>
  According to the METLA study, high cadmium content was still 
measured in the moss samples collected in Harjavalta and 
Kokkola. There were also increased concentrations in the 
environments of the biggest population centers in southern and 
southwestern Finland. 
  METLA studied heavy metal discharges in moss. In the study 
that was just completed, they compared the results obtained in 
1985 with the moss samples collected in 1990. About 5,000 
samples were collected from 3,009 different sites in Finland in 
the selected test area. 
  "I'm particularly pleased with the drop in cadmium and lead 
discharges since they spread easily to wide areas. For example, 
cadmium reaches Finland as remote fallout from Central Europe," 
Assistant Professor Eero Kubin of METLA said. 
  Cadmium gets into the environment from the fertilizer 
industry and from combustion gases produced by the burning of 
waste, among other sources. There is also a certain amount of 
cadmium in phosphate fertilizers and substances used for coating 
products. 
  There was over 0.5 microgram of cadmium per gram of moss 
sample in Kokkola and Harjavalta. Concentrations of as much as 2 
micrograms per gram were found in moss in studies made in 
Poland, Romania, and Hungary. 
  According to the foreign substance statute, there may be up 
to 0.1-0.5 milligrams of cadmium per kilogram in foodstuffs. 
  "The order of magnitude is the same if the guideline figure 
is compared with the results of the moss studies, although moss 
is not eaten. It is, nevertheless, hard to say whether the 
Kokkola or Harjavalta discharges are affecting people's health," 
METLA chemist Harri Lippo said. 
<H5>  Study To Be Repeated Next Year </H5>
  "We get a good picture of heavy metal emissions in Finland 
and how they are changing with the aid of samples. Impurities in 
the atmosphere like heavy metals reach the ground along with 
rainwater. The metals accumulate in the tissues of the moss 
since they get their nourishment from rainwater," Lippo said. 
  The extensive moss study will be repeated next year. The 
study is part of an international follow-up study that was begun 
as a joint Nordic effort in 1985. 
  From the results it is apparent that the volume of lead, 
which is damaging to people and the environment, has decreased 
by one-third over the past five years. The switch to unleaded 
gasoline has done the most for reducing lead emissions. 
  The volume of vanadium in the environment has also decreased 
since the oil refineries have abandoned the use of heavy fuel 
oil and switched to natural gas. 
  Chromium, copper, iron, and zinc concentrations have 
remained 
at the same levels or increased slightly. Tornio's large 
chromium emissions have, however, decreased since the Outokumpu 
steel mill improved its cleaning equipment. Chromium is known to 
cause allergies.

<F P=106> [Article by Johanna Mannila: "Forest Industry Committee </F>
Wants To Put an End To Draining and Plowing of Forests by 1996"] 
  [Text] The forest industry environment committee has 
unanimously proposed new laws and is demanding that nature 
conservation programs be implemented within seven years. 
  The plowing and draining of forests and spraying of sapling 
thickets with pesticides will come to an end by the end of 1996 
if the unanimous proposals in the forest industry's first 
environment program are implemented. 
  The recommendations are of great importance to the landscape 
of northern Finland because over half of the forest regeneration 
areas are being plowed. Machine contractors will be given two 
years to adapt to the situation. 
  The forest industry's environment program was delivered to 
Environment Minister Sirpa Pietikainen (Conservative) and 
Agriculture and Forestry Minister Martti Pura (Center Party) on 
Tuesday [15 March]. The program differs from the agriculture 
program in that the committee proposes changes in the laws for 
the forest industry, and it does not settle for recommendations. 
  According to the program, the diversification of commercial 
forests will be the most important task of forestry experts 
during the present decade. 
  The committee wants to call clear-cutting cultivation 
cutting. In the committee's opinion, it is unfair to compare 
Finland's few hectares of clear-cut forest with Canada and 
Russia's thousands of hectares of logged forest, especially 
since they are not worried about renewing their forests in those 
countries -- by seeding and planting -- as we are in Finland. 
  The committee proposes 10 hectares as the initial size of 
areas to be clear-cut; a clearing area could be as large as 15 
hectares in Lapland. Clearings will not be completely stripped 
anymore; some of the trees are supposed to be left to grow old 
and decay. 
<H5>  Order of Importance for Nature Conservation Programs </H5>
  In its program the committee also proposes that the forest 
law be revised and they demand that the current nature 
conservation programs be implemented within the next seven 
years. They lay particular emphasis on protection of the program 
for the conservation of old forests and of threatened species. 
  "The purpose of the program is to change the forest industry 
such that, in addition to timber production, the industry also 
sees to the care of all of the forest wildlife and the 
maintenance of biodiversity," the chairman of the committee, 
general manager Juhani Viitala, emphasized. 
  The program teaches Finns a new expression, key biotope. 
  Groves, lush woodland, stream banks, shoreline, island, and 
hardwood forests, among others, are ecologically important key 
biotopes. The program lays emphasis on special care for them and 
their importance to commercial forests. 
  In the committee's opinion, we ought to take a critical view 
of the purchasing of forestland in connection with conservation. 
"We don't have to buy up everything. We're considering exchanges 
of land, nature conservation bonds, shares in state companies, 
and use restrictions as alternatives instead of redemption," 
Viitala said. 
  On behalf of the health of the forests, they propose in the 
program that logging be increased. 
  Finland's forest growth comes to 85-88 cubic meters, 3 
million of which are in protected areas. "We estimate that 
compliance with this program would exclude 5 to 10 million cubic 
meters from logging. Since 55 million cubic meters are logged in 
normal years, implementation of the environment program will not 
jeopardize the forest industry's growing need for timber either." 
<H5>  Forest Boards Would be Responsible for Monitoring </H5>
  Locally, forest boards would be responsible for the 
diversity 
of forest wildlife and its development. The forest boards would 
work in cooperation with environment officials. 
  Monitoring the care of the environment would be entrusted to 
the forest boards. Since difficulties that have arisen in 
implementing conservation programs have negatively affected 
relations with landowners, the committee proposes that forest 
care associations serve as intermediaries in sales of woodpecker 
forests. 
  "Landowners would get information on conservation programs 
from representatives of forest care associations, with whom they 
are used to doing business anyway. This is assuming that 
environment officials inform the forest organizations on the 
biological principles conservation is based on and provide them 
with information on financing and alternative courses of 
action," Viitala said. 
  Implementation of the environment program would cost the 
government 260 million markkaa a year. 
<H5>  Proposals for New Forest Laws </H5>
  Law for the permanent use of forests: Finland's first 
general 
law governing forests. The drafting of the law has already begun 
and it is supposed to go into effect in 1995. The law would 
apply to all forests owned by owner-group associations, the 
state, and corporations. 
  Private forest law: The promotion of forest wildlife 
diversity would be specified as the goal of forest care. To go 
into effect in 1996. 
  Laws on forest centers and association forests as well as 
forest care associations: Forest organizations' obligation to 
promote the diversity of forest wildlife would be written into 
the laws. The organizations would be responsible for furthering 
care of the environment in connection with practical forest 
management and for monitoring them in cooperation with 
environment officials. To go into effect in 1996. 
  Forest damage prevention law: Those who gather wood in the 
summer would be obligated to avoid turning over roots, which 
decays spruce thickets. Forest contractors would have to pay 
forest owners compensation for any damage they cause while 
harvesting trees starting with 1996. The committee wants to ban 
excessive cleaning up of forests so that some decaying trees 
will be left in forests. 
<H5>  National Policy </H5>
  The environment program for the forest economy was drafted 
within six months, faster than anyone would have thought 
possible. International agreements signed by Finland and the 
forest industry's ability to compete on markets in which 
emphasis is laid on sound ecological practice are behind the 
Agriculture Minitry's speedy action. 
  Diversity must be included in ministry programs and laws 
since Finland committed itself to promoting diversity in its 
forests at the environment conference in Rio and at the 
conference of forestry ministers in Helsinki. 
  Committee chairman Juhani Viitala hoped that the program 
would receive some measure of official support from the 
government. It will be easier for us Finns to demand that others 
make changes in the ways they exploit their forests if our own 
laws and guidelines are in order. 
  On the committee were representatives of, among others, the 
forest industry, the National Board of Forestry, Tapio, the MTK 
[Forest Industry Association], the National Boards of Waters and 
Environment, and the Nature Conservation League. Ten of the 12 
members of the committee were foresters. 
  In addition to official Nature Conservation League member 
Esko Joutsamo, the committee also heard a great deal from Nature 
League, World Wildlife Foundation (WWF), and Greenpeace 
activists at different points of their deliberations. 
  The committee's unanimous proposal will now go through a 
rapid round of circulation for comment. The Environment 
Ministry's forest conservation strategy, which concentrates on 
protected areas and restoration problems, among others, instead 
of commercial forests, will be presented next week.

  [Excerpts] Environmental investments beyond Finland's 
borders have proved effective, says the Foreign Policy Institute 
in a report. Environmental cooperation with Estonia and Karelia 
has advanced well, but has been badly limping with Russia. 
Jaana Kannninen reports: 
  Kanninen: Finland has pursued environmental 
cooperation as part of its foreign policy for three years. 
There have been joint projects with four separate regions, 
Estonia, St. Petersburg, Karelia, and Kola. It became clear 
during these years that it is easier for a small unit to work 
with another small unit. The projects in Estonia and Karelia 
have got off the ground well. 
  Begin unidentified voice recording: The problem 
areas are the Murmansk area, St. Petersburg, and the Leningrad 
region where the scale is large. If one looks at this problem 
of scale, Finland's possibility of having more effective input 
in environmental cooperation in this region lies in seeking 
international cooperation partners, thereby sharing the burden. 
For instance, if we join the European Union, one central 
possibility is to direct the European Union's environment 
policies into these areas and that way acquire more resources. 
[end recording] 
  Kanninen: Tapani Vaahtoranta, director of the 
Foreign Policy Institute, says that there are other reasons too 
for the failure in Russia. The Russians have criticized the 
Finns for being too selfish. According to them, the Finns want, 
above all, to boost their exports of environmental technology. 
Surprise has also been expressed that the Finns want to support 
what locals regard as secondary issues. Why is it so important 
to clean St. Petersburg's effluent when the inhabitants in the 
region do not even have proper drinking water, people have asked. 
  One problem is that, with the exception of the Republic of 
Karelia, Russia's decisions are still made in Moscow, far from 
the problems. The Foreign Policy Institute suggests that 
Finland could start supporting local citizens' organizations. 
[passage omitted] 
  The effluent purification plant in Tallinn is the most 
advanced of the cooperation projects. The renovation of the 
power stations in Narva and the installation of desulphurization 
equipment in Kostamus are also in the construction stage. In 
the past three years, FM [Finnish marrka] 110 million of Finnish 
money has been spent on near-area cooperation, a sum which it 
has been worthwhile spending beyond the border, even for selfish 
reasons, says director Tapani Vaahtoranta. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Michel Castaing report: "Demonstration Against Superphenix </F>
Intended To Rouse Antinuclear Movement"] 
  [Text] The protest march to be held from 9 April to 8 May 
by the "Europeans Against Superphenix" ecologist group, going 
from Creys-Malville in the Isere region of France to the prime 
minister's residence in Paris, is intended to reawaken the 
antinuclear movement in the light of the upcoming national 
debate on energy and June's European elections. 
  After years of tranquillity, the hamlet of Faverges, in the 
north of the Isere region, was peacefully invaded on the morning 
of Saturday 9 April by the first participants -- some 1,000 
people -- in the antinuclear march organized by the Europeans 
group Against the Superphenix nuclear reactor. [Footnote 1] 
[The coordinating group of the Europeans consists of six 
organizations: the Malville committee (Lyons), the FRAPNA 
(Rhone-Alpes Federation for the Protection of Nature), 
Greenpeace-France, the GSIEN (Group of Scientists for 
Information on Nuclear Energy), and the World Wildlife Fund, 
from Milan. The Europeans includes some 300 associations or 
groups, including political parties (the Greens, Generation 
Ecology, the Greens in the European Parliament, and Red and 
Green Alternative), and several dozen foreign associations, 
predominantly German and Swiss.] 
  Faverges had doubtless seen nothing like this since that 
dramatic Sunday 31 July 1977 when a major antinuclear rally 
(over 20,000 demonstrators) degenerated into violent clashes 
with the police, leading to the death of a 30-year old pacifist 
schoolteacher, Vital Michalon who was killed by a grenade. 
Before the departure for Creys-Malville, the site of the fast 
breeder reactor which was ringed by police, and Moestel, the 
stages on this first day, a commemorative plaque was unveiled to 
his memory. 
  This march, which will take the ecologists to the Paris 
science and technology park before moving on to the prime 
minister's office on 8 May, heralds the awakening of an 
antinuclear movement which has lost much of its sting in recent 
years, in particular in the area around the Superphenix. The 
local reasons for this are twofold: first, the fast breeder 
reactor has been shut down since 2 July 1990, and concerns have 
thus been lulled; secondly, maintenance operations have created 
some 2,500 jobs. 
  Previously openly opposed to Superphenix, the mayor of a 
small neighboring town expressed an opinion widely shared in the 
region: "We all have relations working in the power station, so 
now is not the time to be picky, even though I am still aware of 
the specific risks posed by the reactor." 
  It was the government's decision, made on 22 February, to 
use 
Superphenix not as a nuclear power station but as a "reactor 
dedicated to research and experimentation," that jarred its 
opponents back to life. The Europeans Against Superphenix 
reiterated that "it was during safety experiments that Soviet 
engineers caused the worst accident in nuclear history." 
Throughout the journey the caravan of protesters will hammer 
out a slogan worthy of [French satirist and comedian] Coluche: 
"If you laughed at Chernobyl, you mustn't miss Creys-Malville!" 
<H5>  Highly-Symbolic Stop-Off Points </H5>
  "Pull the plug on Superphenix!" declares the 15-meter long 
banner leading the procession out of Faverges, indicating that 
the protest is focused firmly on the only industrial-scale fast 
breeder reactor in the world and that the ecologists do not 
intend getting way-laid by more general issues. 
  The whole range of arguments against the use, in whatever 
form, of the Creys-Malville plant is used, including its high 
cost: "In 20 years, this reactor has already cost over 50 
million francs [Fr], has only operated for 176 days and still 
wastes Fr600 million a year," and the risk it poses: 
"Superphenix still contains 5 tonnes of plutonium and 5,000 
tonnes of sodium." [footnote 2] [Superphenix cost Fr27.7 
billion in today's money to build, Fr7.65 billion of which in 
interim interest. Maintenance costs Fr650 million per year 
(Fr750-800 million in 1993). To completely abandon it would 
cost Fr12bn, to which can be added Fr18 billion in compensation 
for France's partners. The station operated for 7,400 hours 
(slightly more than 300 days) since being hooked up to the EDF 
grid in 1986. Fuels used total 5.5 tonnes of plutonium, while 
3,500 tonnes of the 5,000 tonnes of sodium are still contained 
inside the reactor tank.] 
Encouraged by a precedent -- three days before the scheduled 
restart date of 2 July 1992, the then-Prime Minister Pierre 
Beregovoy froze any decision -- and guessing that the Balladur 
government will not make any further decisions on restarting the 
reactor before the European elections in June, the anti-Phenix 
movement intends putting this period to the best use by exerting 
as much pressure as possible. All the more so, of course, since 
the national energy debate opens at the start of May. 
  The fliers that are to be distributed from Faverges to Paris 
state: "We must put a stop to this costly, dangerous, and 
useless experiment... Errare humanum est, perserverare 
diabolicum [to err is human but to persevere is diabolical]." 
Abandoning the reactor would be considered "a brave and 
positive act." The antinuclear lobby has also broken away from 
the radical attitudes of the past, at least in appearance. 
  In this way, the Europeans Against Superphenix are thus 
again 
out campaigning for support. Greenpeace-France hoped that "the 
march can trigger a chain reaction along its route, mobilizing 
sectors of public opinion reaching far beyond traditional 
ecologist groups. Everyone understands that, behind Superphenix 
there is the need for a greater transparency in the debate on 
energy choices in France." 
  This is why highly-symbolic stop-off points have been 
chosen, 
such as the Lyons headquarters of the NERSA, the Superphenix 
operating company; the power stations at Fessenheim (Haut Rhin), 
Cattenom (Moselle) and, on 26 April (eight years to the day 
since the Chernobyl disaster), the station at Nogent-sur-Seine; 
the European Parliament in Strasbourg, etc. The march will also 
pass along some Swiss towns (Geneva, Lausanne, and Basle), and, 
the organizers insist, it will also visit a number of 
"alternative sites" promoting renewable energy sources. The 
caravan will also be running a campaign of postcards addressed 
to the prime minister.

<F P=106> [Article by Frank Elsner: "How Much Ecological Recovery Can </F>
There Be in Wismut? -- Environment Experts Say GDR [German 
Democratic Republic] Uranium Mining's Legacy of Contamination 
Will Cost Much More Than 15 Billion German Marks [DM]"] 
  [Text] In the GDR it was a country within a state with its 
own police and jurisdiction, closely watched by the Soviet 
secret service: the mining area of the "Soviet-German Wismut 
Corporation." Over a period of 40 years the USSR [Union of 
Soviet Socialist Republics] took some 220,000 tons of uranium -- 
the raw material for its military and civilian nuclear programs 
-- from the ore deposits of southern Saxony and Thuringia. Its 
legacy is Germany's biggest ecological disaster. Environment 
experts fear that decontaminating it properly will cost far more 
than the DM13 to DM15 billion officially estimated. 
  Those who gained from the wasteful exploitation of nature 
and 
human beings will not pay the price of it. Bonn inherited the 
GDR's half of Wismut anyway, and in May 1991 the USSR handed its 
half over as well--and with it all responsibility for more than 
3,000 radioactive waste heaps, 300 shafts and mines and a large 
number of sludge lagoons containing uranium and radioactive 
decay products. 
  The bomb must be defused by the successor company Wismut 
GmbH. The resources -- about DM700 to 800 million a year -- will 
be provided by its sole shareholder, the Federal Ministry of 
Trade and Industry. Chief executive, Manfred Bergmann, estimates 
that the ecological repair work will take 10 to 15 years. Then 
it will be possible to "build kindergardens again" on the 
contaminated areas. Trade and Industry Minister Rexrodt 
explains that the "Wismut project" meets "international 
standards." 
  Environment experts think otherwise. Munich radiation 
biologist Edmund Lengfelder says that the GDR's lax radiological 
protection rules have been perpetuated in the Reunification 
Treaty for what was once the world's third largest uranium 
mining area, in particular. According to Gerhard Schmidt of the 
Darmstadt-based Ecological Institute, the lack of statutory 
rehabilitation targets such as are standard in the USA is 
painfully obvious. "Wismut has no measuring stick for its work." 
  Whether Wismut has the technology to keep the environmental 
hazards permanently under control is also a matter of 
controversy. Lengfelder disputes in particular that the 
radioactive sludge lagoons are securely sealed -- a great hazard 
for the groundwater. "Perfect reclamation" could easily breach 
the DM100 billion cost limit, the radiation biologist believes: 
"Bonn must know what quality it wants. It is a political 
matter." 
  Worse than that: After thoroughly plundering the uranium 
stocks, in 1962 Wismut gave all the worthless mining areas back 
to the respective local authorities. These are now getting not 
a penny from the pot in Bonn.

<F P=106> [Article by Hans Dieter Sauer: "Recycling Improves PVC's </F>
Image"] 
  [Text] [First paragraph is editor's summary] VDIN, 
Duesseldorf, 18 Feb 94((Curse or blessing))no artificial 
material is a source of such vehement discussion as polyvinyl 
chloride. The economy has built up a comprehensive 
infrastructure for recycling and is thus removing a portion of 
PVC from critical environmental discussion. PVC is everywhere. 
It is found as window frame, drainpipe, floor covering, cable 
sheathing and automobile part, but also as transparent wrap, 
record, check-cashing card and ring binder. Every year the 
chemical and plastic processing industries put 1.4 million tons 
of new PVC in circulation, and approximately 360,000 tons are 
discarded annually as used products. Producers and processors of 
PVC praise its resistance, durability, and versatile 
applicability. Environmentalists, on the other hand, see it as 
particularly environmentally harmful material: during production 
the carcinogenic gas vinyl chloride is employed, and PVC also 
contains toxic materials as softeners, as well as lead and 
cadmium for UV stabilization. Not least, burning the artifical 
material can create dioxins and fusanes.The great majority of 
old PVC is still deposited as trash or burned. But the material 
is more and more often becoming part of a cycle. Werner 
Preusker, chief executive of the Bonn working group PVC and 
Environemnt (AgPU), a coalition of PVC producers, processors and 
users, private individuals and institutes, emphasizes: "There 
are functioning recycling possibilities today for the most 
important PVC products." 
  For windows, floor coverings, pipes and gutters 
(quantitatively these products make up half of all PVC products) 
the organization of comprehensive collection systems is in full 
swing in Germany or has already been completed. The first major 
plants for reprocessing the used material have started up. Six 
manufacturers of PVC windows have joined forces in the "Window 
Recycling Initiative" (FREI), which has reached agreement with 
numerous window and facade companies about returning used 
windows. FREI members in turn have committed themselves to using 
recycled PVC products in the production of new window profiles. 
The windows are taken for reprocessing to Dekura GmbH in Rahden, 
in Westphalia. As a rule the recycled material is processed into 
a profilejnucleus which is surrounded by a layer of new material. 
  Reprocessing is done basically in three steps. After rough 
shredding and the sorting out of glass splinters, a shredder 
chops up the frame pieces along with fittings and steel frames. 
Then magnets and separators separate iron and nonferrous metals 
out of the mixture, and a socalled heavy goods selector picks 
out any fragments of glass and metal which remain. The material 
is then ground into small grains, sifted, extruded at 150 
degrees Celsius and finally granulated in pill size. The plant 
can process 1.5 tons of used windows in an hour. At present it 
is running a single shift -- not enough material is being 
supplied for more. 
  Because numerous depositories still accept used windows, 
according to Dekura's chief executive Horst Detering, "recycling 
is having the ground cut away under it."Besides FREI, the 
profile producer VEKA in Sendenhorst also takes back old PVC 
windows. In the Thuringian town of Behringen, north of Eisenach, 
VEKA Environmental Technology GmbH has constructed for about 
DM30 million the "most modern recycling plant in Europe for 
windows, roller blinds, plates and profile remnants made of 
PVC." The fully automated plant also uses their different 
physical properties to separate the window components))glass, 
metal, rubber and PVC. 
  According to the oprators, 97.5 percent of the material 
provided can be recovered in reusable quality; only 2.5 percent 
is unusable waste. Production leader Erich Schulz emphasizes as 
a particular advantage that soon it will be possible to sort the 
recycled product into white and colored. For this purpose every 
grain of PVC is subjected to a flash of light; if it is a white 
grain, a puff of air from a jet is released by its greater 
reflectivity and the grain is blown off the conveyor belt, while 
the colored grains are unaffected and stay where they are. The 
plant can also reprocess the wooden windows with plastic coating 
typical of the GDR, socalled plasta)windows. Since the wood is 
untreated, according to Schulz it is suitable for the 
manufacture of chip boards. To ensure supplies, VEKA has made 
agreements with 300 processors of PVC frames to supply 
dismantled windows, roller blinds and profiles in Behringen. 
  Floor coverings have been collected since 1990 by the 
working 
group PVC Bodenbelag Recycling (AgPR) in selected test areas and 
processed in a plant in Grossefehn in East Frisia. However, it 
took some time to master the technology. "We needed to find out 
that you have to proceed quite differently in the reprocessing 
of used coverings than in the reuse of production residue," 
reports Hans Juergen Nettelnbreker of the company Huels AG, 
which developed the procedure for AgPR.The solution they found 
was socalled cold grinding. The soft PVC is hardened by liquid 
nitrogen so that it can be reduced to very fine grains with a 
diameter of 200 micrometers. 
  In this way not only is the quality of the grind improved 
but 
a significantly higher throughput is also achieved. The plant's 
present capacity is 4,000 tons per year according to 
Nettelnbreker, more is not available at the moment on the used 
PVC market. The recycled material is reused by the member 
companies of AgPR as an underlay for floor tiles. 
  After being dismantled last autumn, the plant is now being 
rebuilt in a more favorable location in Troisdorf near Bonn. A 
plant is being planned at the same location for the recycling of 
PVC roof guttering. 
  PVC tubes are collected under the guidance of the Artificial 
Materials Association (KRV) in Bobb. From the dealers the 
material goes to four regional centers, where it is sorted and 
cleaned. The processing is scheduled to begin soon on the 
premises of the Wavin company in Westeregeln near Magdeburg. A 
total of approximately 5 percent of PVC waste is now being 
recycled, in the estimation of Walter Toetsch of the company 
Huel AG. 
  In the case of pipes and windows, because of their long 
life, 
at present there are only minimal quantities of less than one 
percent. In the case of floor coverings, approximately 20 
percent is reprocessed. Recycling stands or falls with the 
collection system. 
The purity of the various types and the soiling of the 
material, and thus ultimately also the quality of the recycled 
product, are determined by the method of collecting. 
  Since different PVC types are used for different products, 
the basic rule is: window profiles are made into window 
profiles, floor coverings are made into floor coverings, and 
pipes are made into pipes.When collection is carried out by 
professionals, good results are achieved. 
  Experience has proved, however, that collection in 
unsupervised containers yields unusable mixtures even when the 
user is given extensive information.In any case, collection is 
associated with high costs. That is why recycled products are 
usually more expensive than raw materials. Toetsch confirms that 
"the recycling of artificial materials, apart from production 
wastes, must always be subsidized through the product or through 
a disposal fee. "At Huels AG, PVC was ground nine times to 
technical school standards and reformed into products without 
its mechanical properties deteriorating. But practical 
recyclability is limited by the structure of the finished 
products, demands placed on the material during use, and the 
type of collection. 
  In order to exploit the potential of nine cycles, more than 
90 percent of every product generation would have to be 
recovered and cleanly sorted. "That is unrealistic," Toetsch 
points out. Even copper, he said, achieves a recycling quota of 
only 40 percent, which represents 1.7 cycles. Material recycling 
has its limits for PVC too. Depending on the application, a 
realistic proportion of recycled material in new products lies 
between 20 and 30 percent. This gives the upper limit for 
material processing, as is stressed by AgPU expert Joachim 
Eckstein. 
  If high reprocessing quotas were demanded, Eckstein 
calculates that there would unavoidably be large surpluses of 
recycled material. In his estimation the EU could accumulate a 
mountain of 50 million tons of used plastics over a period of 10 
years. He is firmly convinced that "a return quota of 60 percent 
with nothing but material recycling cannot possibly be 
realized." The Federal Environmental Agency (UBA) in Berlin has 
not yet taken up anjunambiguous position on PVC recycling. It 
describes its own attitude as "ambivalent"; it is true that 
recycling reduces wastes, but it does not solve the problems 
which lie in the material PVC itself. The UBA hopes for 
clarification from a research project with the title "Ecological 
Comparison of Products Which Contain Bromides and Chlorides With 
Those Which Do Not in the Construction Industry." The results 
should be available by the end of this year.

Biopalma, Is Here"] 
  [Text] Naples -- Clean, sulfur-free fuel that is extracted 
entirely from plants and is made of soya, rape, and sunflower 
oil. For the time being this is almost a pioneer initiative but 
it opens up a new frontier in the production of a vegetable 
diesel oil, which is an alternative to diesel oil, and also with 
a more acceptable performance in terms of heating and urban 
pollution. The sophisticated technology for the production of 
Biopalma, which is the name under which the diesel oil produced 
from vegetable oils will be marketed, is a project of the Palma 
distillery. A company that is part of the Neopolitan 
agroindustrial and biochemical Palma company with annual 
revenues of 550 billion lire. Its holding company, Palfin, 
controls four sectors of activity. Distillation, with plants in 
Campania (Palma company), Puglia (Trani), and Sicily (Vinum 
Marsala and Trapas Trapani). The plants of Bari Palolio and 
Palvino operate in the oil sector; Chirico and Campano in the 
food sector. Finally the sole biotechnology plant is located in 
Calitri. 
  The fuel, say its producers, will revolutionize the fuel 
market within the coming years because it does not contain 
sulfur, the major cause of acid rain. This fuel was inserted in 
the Ruffolo- Conte decree two years ago to prevent pollution in 
urban areas and is currently being tested by several transport 
companies (AIM and Vicenza, AMT Trieste, ACAP Padua, ATM Milan, 
SEPSA Naples, and others). Since Biopalma is obtained from 
renewable sources it does not impoverish natural resources and 
drastically reductes polluting emissions from

<F P=106> [Article by Jacopo Giliberto: "Combustible Gas From Plastic </F>
Residues"] 
  [Text] We know that old automobiles have always been 
recycled as much as possible. The steel that is used for the 
automobile chassis and the mechanical parts, amounting to 70 
percent of the vehicle's weight, is melted down and reused. 
  Together with a pool of specialized companies and car 
wreckers belonging to the ADA [Car Wreckers Association], Fiat 
has launched the FARE (Fiat Auto Recycling Program) to recycle 
other components that generally end up in refuse sites: glass 
(car lights, windows, windshields), upholstery, principal 
plastic materials. 
  However, something always remains at the end of the Fiat 
cycle. It is the so-called fluff: various plastic fragments, 
pieces of upholstery, rubber strips, tires, and so on. 
  To date this material has only gone to refuse sites, since 
the presence of such varied components has made combustion in 
traditional incinerators a difficult problem. In addition the 
fumes are generally very "dirty" and purification calls for 
costly equipment. 
  In order to recycle this material the Montello Steelworks 
(of 
Bergamo) have taken part in the FARE project to test a 
innovative system of energy recovery that is based on the 
principle of pyrolysis. 
  The process has been developed in conjunction with the 
Smogless company of Milan. 
  A semi-industrial plant called SMIR is already at an 
advanced 
stage of testing. Here the fluff is transformed into 
combustible gases that are useful in improving steel fusion and 
thereby result in energy savings. All this is achieved with 
very limited emissions. 
  The material undergoes a first separation stage: the finest 
part "which is generally very rich in inert gases," they explain 
at Montello, is eliminated. Then the real two-stage process 
begins. 
  The first stage is the transformation of fluff into gas and 
vapor at 600 degrees Centigrade. 
  The material is then fluidized by premixing with ferrous 
waste, which comes out at 500 degrees Centigrade: the iron is 
then introduced into the electric kilns at this temperature, so 
as to reach "a considerable saving in electrical energy because 
of the fusion," the steelworks affirm. 
  The vapors thus generated are sent to a second plant that 
was 
constructed with the experience of Smogless. 
  It is a grinding furnace in which an electric arc with 
carbon 
electrodes (which also generates thermoelectric and 
photochemical reactions) brings the gases to a temperature of 
1,000 degrees Centigrade in an ionized and reducing environment. 
  A bed of incandescent coke, crossed by a difference in 
electric potential, exhalts the reactions. 
  In this way all the most dangerous composites, such as 
dioxins and furanes due to the presence of chlorine (which is 
contained in PVC for example) are eliminated from the gases. 
  "Since the energy required to increase the temperature is 
supplied by electric energy and photochemical reactions," 
explain the Montello technicians, "the introduction of 
supporting combustion or air is not necessary." 
  The result is an extremely low content of carbon dioxide and 
nitrogen, thereby increasing the heating power of the gas that 
is produced. 
  In addition the vapor molecules are broken up and 
transformed 
into elementary components: carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and 
methane while the presence of chlorine and sulfur forms simple 
residues such as muriatic acid and hydrogen sulfide. These are 
eliminated with an alkaline solution purification, since the 
absence of carbon dioxide gives extremely high efficiency at 
limited costs. 
  The vapor obtained from this plant is a technological gas 
that Montello uses in the steel billet heating ovens.

<F P=106> [Ole Mathismoen report: "Norway Cannot Give Much Help to </F>
the Kola Peninsula"] 
  [Text] Russia cannot afford nuclear safety in the northern 
regions. And Norway cannot afford to give very much help. 
  This was Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore Godal's conclusion 
yesterday when he yesterday put before the Storting a report on 
nuclear safety and chemical weapons in the regions close to 
northern Norway. 
  The Cold War has been succeeded by major environmental 
challenges. In areas very close to Norway there are enormous 
temporary dumps of nuclear waste, several dozen abandoned 
nuclear submarines, an old and unsafe nuclear power station, and 
large quantities of nuclear arms. 
  "It goes without saying that Russia has an indepednent 
responsibility for safety at nuclear installations and for 
solving the problems of waste. But neither Russia nor the other 
states of Eastern Europe are able to give this the highest 
priority. Such enormous resources are needed to sort all this 
out that the only possibility is broad international 
cooperation," the foreign minister said. He mentioned NATO, the 
EU [European Union], the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development, and the North Atlantic Cooperation Council as 
possible forums for such cooperation. 
  The foreign minister stressed strongly that Norway can only 
be involved in a small way in paying the bill for the biggest 
nuclear cleanup operation ever. Hitherto Norway has spent only 
36 million kroner in aid for the EAst. In the past it has been 
estimated that it will cost somewhere in the order of $150 
billion to clean up the nuclear chaos on the Kola Peninsula. 
  "But Norway is assuming a lobbying role to get nuclear 
safety 
in northwestern Russia onto the international agenda," Godal 
said. But who will actually pay the bill, he was asked. "Russia 
and Europe's taxpayers will have to foot the bill," he said. 
  Asked whether Norway has plans for further short-term 
assistance for the Kola region in the absence of a larger-scale 
international aid operation, he replied: "We are keeping the 
situation under constant observation, but we have no plans for 
measures at present. These are sensitive issues on which we 
naturally want to work closely with the Russian authorities." 
  In the course of last winter there were several minor 
accidents at the nuclear power station on the Kola Peninsula, 
further nuclear submarines were mothballed, and the situation 
regarding several of the temporary waste dumps -- such as the 
dump ship Lepse, for example -- deteriorated dramatically. In 
the light of this the foreign minister was asked if Finnmark is 
today facing a real nuclear threat: 
  "The potential dangers are considerable. But the situation 
is not acute," Bjorn Tore Godal said. 
  Yesterday the foreign minister was able to announce that the 
Russian authorities with the foreign minister at their head have 
given permission for a third Norwegian-Russian research 
expedition to former nuclear waste dumping sites in the Kara 
Sea. Now the way is clear for an expedition to the formerly 
forbidden Ambrosimov Bay on Novaya Zemlya where there is reason 
to believe that considerable quantities of solid nuclear waste 
has been dumped. 
  The foreign minister's report to the Storting is the first 
public document on nuclear safety in the Kola region. Hitherto 
it has been the Bellona Environmental Foundation which, since 
the fall of the Iron Curtain, has constantly been digging up new 
information about the piles of radioactive waste the Cold War is 
leaving behind in the northern regions.

  [Text] Kyoto, April 12 KYODO -- France and Chile have 
jointly proposed tough regulations on tourists to Antarctica 
after reports of environmental damage caused by visitors to the 
frigid continent, sources at the Antarctica conference here said 
Tuesday [12 April]. 
  Signatories of an international treaty on the Antarctic are 
meeting here at the Kyoto International Conference Hall until 
April 22 to discuss policies to protect the environment at the 
South Pole. 
  The proposed regulations would hold the tourists, their 
travel agents, and their countries responsible for protecting 
the environment, the sources said. 
  Tourists, who have been growing in number in recent years, 
and their travel agents would be required to submit a detailed 
plan of their visit 15 months before departure and strictly 
observe the environmental protection agreement during their 
trip, the sources said. 
  Home countries of the tourists and agents would be asked to 
approve the visits to Antarctica and in the event of violations 
of the protection agreement would be denied approval for visits 
up to five years, the sources said. 
  The United States and Britain, on the other hand, plan to 
propose guidelines for the tourists and adventurers, and are 
opposed to the strictness of the joint proposal of France and 
Chile. 
  Between 2,000 and 3,000 tourists visit Antarctica each year, 
but there have been reports of the tourists trampling penguin 
nesting grounds, damaging local plant life and disrupting 
scientific experiments being conducted in the area.

<F P=106> [Article by Katarina Koivisto: "Condition of Baltic Sea </F>
Improving Steadily"] 
  [Text] The condition of the Baltic Sea is improving, and 
discharges of heavy metals and so on have declined. From the 
list of so-called hot spots--particularly critical sources of 
effluent--drawn up by the Helsinki Commission for Protection of 
the Baltic Sea (Helcom) a couple of years ago, 13 such spots 
have already been deleted. Hopes are good that it will be 
possible to eliminate more hot spots over the next few years, 
says Helcom, which concluded its meeting in Helsinki on Friday 
[11 March]. 
  The 13 critical sources of effluent that have already 
succeeded in reducing their discharges to a considerably lower 
level are in Finland and Sweden but also in Latvia and 
Lithuania, which have been able in particular to reduce their 
discharges of polluted municipal refuse. Latvia is not a member 
of Helcom, but will join within a few months. 
  The Finnish hot spots are mainly industrial, and all 
factories are working to reduce their effluent levels. The two 
factories removed from the critical list at the end of last year 
were Kaukas in Lappeenranta and Enso-Gutzeit in Kaukopaa. Since 
that time, Metsa-Botnia in Kasko has also been removed from the 
list. Two of the hot spots that Finland is having the most 
trouble doing anything about are sewage from the municipalities 
in the region of the capital and fish breeding in the 
archipelago waters. 
  At its meeting, Helcom adopted a recommendation concerning 
the reduction of polluting effluent from the fish farms. 
<H5>  Money Available </H5>
  When Helcom designated the hot spots around the Baltic Sea, 
it estimated that cleaning them up would cost a total of 10 
billion ECU's or about 63 billion markkas. About one-fourth of 
that amount has already been allocated to various projects, 
according to Fleming Otzen, Helcom's general secretary. 
  "We now know what needs to be done at most of the critical 
spots, and new measures are being adopted all the time," says 
Otzen. There are still nearly 120 hot spots in the Baltic Sea 
area, most of them in countries that belonged to the former 
Eastern bloc. 
  The situation in the Baltic Sea has also improved because 
many East European states have been forced to shut down 
factories due to the lack of money and raw materials with which 
to keep them operating. The lack of money has also led to a 
decline in the use of artificial fertilizer by agriculture. 
According to Otzen, Helcom now has a good opportunity to 
introduce better technology in factories of that kind before 
they begin operating again. 
<H5>  Investment in Protection of Environment </H5>
  Also adopted at the meeting in Helsinki were three 
recommendations concerned solely with protection of the 
environment. The first of those recommendations deals with the 
100- to 300-meter restricted zone that will prevent construction 
on the shores of the Baltic Sea. Finland has accepted that 
recommendation, but with the reservation that construction with 
a special permit and construction in planned areas will be 
allowed. 
  A recommendation regarding a network of nature reserves was 
also adopted at the meeting. That network will consist of 62 
different areas in the Baltic states, and it corresponds almost 
completely to the national nature reserves already in existence. 
But now that Helcom has adopted this recommendation, an 
individual nation will not be able to abolish a nature reserve 
without Helcom's approval. 
  The third recommendation dealing directly with protection of 
the environment calls for drawing up a so-called red book of 
threatened marine biotypes--that is, natural areas and 
species--in the Baltic Sea area. An initial survey will be 
conducted in each individual country. 
  The issue of chemical weapons being dumped into the Baltic 
Sea was also discussed at the meeting. Earlier reports to Helcom 
listed the known locations where dumping has occurred, but 
information on possible Soviet-era dumping in Russian and Baltic 
territorial waters is still lacking. In any case, it is safer to 
let the chemical weapons stay where they are than to try to 
bring them to the surface, says Otzen. 
  "Fishing in the Baltic Sea area is so active that we now 
have 
a very good picture of where chemical dumping has taken place," 
says Otzen. "This means that we are not necessarily going to 
find any more old Soviet weapons."

  [Text] Shenyang, April 13 (XINHUA) -- Northeast China's 
Liaoning Province is launching an environmental protection 
campaign to increase its residents' awareness of pollution 
problems. 
  The province, one of the major heavy industrial centers in 
China, has been plagued by industrial pollution for a long time. 
Shenyang, capital of the province, and Anshan, a steel city, 
and other large and medium-sized cites were once 
pollution-ridden and are now still facing serious problems of 
pollution. 
  To reduce pollution and better protect the environment, the 
province is now taking every possible measure to make its 
residents aware of pollution problems. 
  Children in schools all over the province are given books on 
environmental protection which explain in simple and clear 
language the relationship between nature and human beings, and 
between environmental pollution and disease. 
  Two special primary schools have been established, where 
students are examined on the subject of environmental protection 
as well as other subjects. 
  Government officials are also required to stay abreast of 
problems of pollution. They are given lectures on the basics of 
environmental protection and its relationship with economic 
development. 
  Factories are now paying attention to environmental 
protection as well as to safety in the workplace. Newspapers 
give prominent space and radio and TV use prime time to cover 
stories on environmental protection. 
  The chief of the provincial bureau of environmental 
protection has even hosted radio phone-in programs on 
environmental protection.

<F P=106> [Report by Zhu Baoxia: "Chemical Registration To Stop Deal </F>
in Toxins"] 
  [Text] Chemical traders will have to get environmental 
clearance beginning next month before their goods can be 
imported or exported, an attempt to combat shipments of toxic 
materials. 
  The National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) must 
check all chemicals exiting or entering the country, a switch 
from the old system that only required inspection from the 
Customs General Administration. NEPA, along with Customs and 
the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec) 
issued the regulations yesterday. It takes effect on May 1. 
  The regulations were drafted in response to a UN call to 
stamp out unauthorized transfers of toxic chemicals worldwide. 
  And they are also aimed at protecting the national 
environment and the people's health, said Li Hengyuan, deputy 
division chief in charge of solid wastes and chemicals in NEPA. 
  Li said that chemicals play a key role in economic 
development and improving people's living standards, but some 
cause pollution and major health problems. 
  The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that about 60 
to 
90 percent of the known cancer cases are caused by chemicals. 
  Li said China has experienced rapid development in chemical 
production over the past few years which are widely applied in 
many fields. Add to this a large number of pesticides imported 
for agricultural production. 
  Customs in Shanghai and Guangzhou alone saw imports of 6 
billion yuan (about $700 million) in chemicals in 1993. 
  Nepa has received numerous reports of chemical accidents in 
recent years, Li said.

  [Text] Hohhot, April 16 (XINHUA) -- The Inner Mongolia 
branch of China International Airlines has grown trees by way of 
aerial seeding on more than 700,000 ha of land in north China 
over the past more than a decade years. 
  North China has vast arid or semi-arid areas, with scarce 
vegetation and serious desertification. Forest cover in north 
China is lower than 10 percent. The development of the local 
economy has thus been seriously hampered. 
  Beginning in the late 1970's, the company was assigned to 
shoulder the task of planting trees in north China through 
aerial seeding. 
  As a result, the ecological environment, and production and 
living conditions of farmers and herdsmen in those areas 
selected for aerial seeding have shown marked improvement thanks 
to painstaking efforts in the past decade, local officials told 
XINHUA.

  [Text] Taipei, April 14 (CNA) -- Taiwan is embarking on a 
comprehensive war against trade in endangered species products, 
particularly rhino horn and tiger parts, an official with the 
Council of Agriculture [COA] said Thursday [14 April]. 
  The announcement comes on the heels of the U.S. announcement 
Monday that it was hitting Taiwan with trade sanctions because 
of its unsatisfactory efforts to stop such trade. 
  Li Chin-lung, secretary-general of the COA, a cabinet-level 
organization directly in charge of carrying out Taiwan's 
conservation policies, said that to win the war, Taiwan will 
first have to carry out four major tasks requested of it in 
March by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered 
Species (CITES). 
  The four tasks include consolidating stocks of endangered 
species products, reinforcing marking of the products, 
accelerating the passage of a revised wildlife protection law, 
and tightening the crackdown on the trade, Li said. 
  Li said cracking down on the trade in rhino horn and tiger 
parts will be given top priority, and added that it would take 
from three to six years to fully comply with the CITES request. 
  Li made the pledge after a meeting between COA officials and 
officials from the Ministries of Finance, Economic Affairs, 
Justice, Education, and the Department of Health, all of which 
are expected to back the COA's action plan. 
  At the Executive Yuan, meanwhile, COA Chairman Sun 
Ming-hsien 
said a new conservation strategy would be mapped out within 
seven days. He also announced that a national wildlife 
conservation and plant protection conference will be held in 
mid-July. 
  Additionally, Sun said, another 130 conservation police will 
be added to the conservation army around the island, and more 
wildlife protection units will be established under central, 
provincial, and county governments. 
  COA efforts will also include strengthening conservation 
education programs and promoting information and personnel 
exchanges with Asian countries in conservation education, Sun 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 19 KYODO -- Japan should take steps to 
recover increasingly scarce marine resources in the area of sea 
around Japan and to create better working environments for 
female workers in the fisheries industry, urged a government 
white paper released Tuesday [19 April]. 
  The annual white paper on fisheries said Japan's total 
fisheries production, including catch and cultured fish, 
amounted to 9.27 million tons in 1992, down 7 percent from the 
previous year. 
  It is the first time fishery production has declined four 
straight years since 1945, the paper said. 
  Deep-sea fishery production increased by 0.8 percent to 1.27 
million tons. It was the first year-on-year increase in five 
years for deep-sea fisheries, which have been generally 
declining due to tightening regulations on fisheries in 
international waters, the paper said. 
  Coastal fisheries also increased by 4 percent to 3.27 
million 
tons. 
  Offshore fisheries, however, declined 17 percent to 4.53 
million tons, dropping below 5 million tons for the first time 
in 15 years. 
  The paper said the decline in offshore fisheries reflects 
the 
growing scarcity of marine resources in Japanese waters. "It is 
an urgent task for Japan to recover marine resources in the 
Japanese waters by such means as releasing fish fry and 
maintaining underwater reefs for fish," it said. 
  Utilization of marine resources should also be more 
effective, it added. 
  The paper, submitted at a regular cabinet meeting by 
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Eijiro Hata, also 
noted for the first time the importance to the industry of the 
female workforce. 
  Women are taking an important role in the workforce of the 
fisheries industry and as leaders of local activities in fishing 
areas, it said. 
  It is important to encourage young women in the field to 
stay 
by creating a better working environment for them, the paper 
said.

  [Text] Kyoto, April 20 KYODO -- Delegates to an 
international Antarctica meeting under way in Kyoto basically 
agreed Wednesday [20 April] on a set of guidelines for visitors 
to the South Pole to protect its "unique and pristine" 
environment. 
  The regulations proposed by Britain and Australia urge 
tourists, explorers and travel agencies to control their own 
activities to protect the wildlife and environment of the 
continent. 
  They will be formally adopted during the conference's final 
sessions Thursday and Friday. 
  "Do not feed, touch, or handle birds or seals," "do not 
damage plants," and "do not use guns or explosives," are among 
the draft's guidelines urging visitors to refrain from 
activities that disturb the Antarctic flora and fauna. 
  Tourists and adventurers are also asked to respect protected 
areas, to stay away from research facilities and study sites, 
not to dispose waste or collect rocks and fossils as souvenirs, 
and to plan their trips sensibly. 
  The draft obligates tour organizers to notify national 
authorities about planned activities, assess and monitor the 
environmental impact of their expeditions and employ experienced 
and trained guides. 
  Travel agents must inform tour participants about the 
requirements of the 1959 Antarctic treaty and its follow-up 
provisions and educate them about proper behavior in Antarctica. 
  Delegates could not reach a consensus on how the guidelines 
should be implemented by national governments but decided to 
discuss national solutions at the coming Antarctica conference 
in South Korea next year. 
  Restrictions on tourism have become a hot potato among 
treaty 
signatories since the adoption of the protocol on environmental 
protection to the Antarctic treaty in 1991. 
  Countries like the United States and Britain, from where 
many 
tourists visit the area, were opposed to tough regulations 
involving liability for environmental damage as proposed by 
France and Chile. 
  A major success of the Kyoto conference is that delegates 
reached an agreement on the tourism issue at all. However, a 
Japanese delegate decried that the guidelines were watered down 
to minimum requirements. 
  "Their content is characterized by the thinking `let's start 
from the common ground for the time being,'" the delegate said. 
  A U.S. delegate said the need for such guidelines on the 
other hand shows "how close the South Pole has moved to us." 
  About 250 delegates from some 40 countries, international 
organizations and nongovernmental groups are attending the 
meeting which started April 11 and runs through Friday. 
  About 7,000 tourists including some 100 Japanese visit the 
South Pole each year, but there have been reports of the 
tourists trampling penguin nesting grounds, damaging local plant 
life and disrupting scientific experiments being conducted in 
the area.

<F P=106> ["South Korean Puppets' Nuclear Waste Dumping Denounced" -- </F>
KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 21 (KCNA) -- Working people in 
Pyongyang held a mass rally today to bitterly denounce the South 
Korean puppets' criminal dumping of nuclear waste. 
  Hwang sang chun, chairman of the State Environmental 
Commission, and representatives of various strata took the floor. 
  The speakers branded the South Korean rulers' nuclear waste 
dumping in the sea as an anti-national, anti-human crime that 
can be committed only by those indifferent to the existence of 
the nation and international law and as a never-to-be-condoned 
crime in cutting the lifeline of the nation. 
  The South Korean puppets dumped as much as 11,000 trillion 
bequerel of nuclear waste in the sea in the 1986-1992 period. 
  In South Korea, even the Raktong River has been contaminated 
with radioactive material, causing a big public stir. 
  The speakers said due to the South Korean puppets' nuclear 
waste dumping, fishes in South Korean waters have disappeared, 
the haul of myongthae has diminished to ten percent, undaria 
pinnatifida and other sea resources have been exterminated and 
women often give birth to deformed babies. 
  They pointed out that the nuclear waste dumping is getting 
more grave and dangerous with the nuclear arms development 
promoted in secrecy in South Korea. 
  The South Korean puppets started to develop nuclear weapons 
under the "nuclear umbrella" of U.S. imperialism long ago and 
now they are promoting nuclear arms development, possessed of 
reprocessing facilities. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam unilaterally scrapped the joint 
declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. 
  The speakers denounced the Kim Yong-sam group for massively 
shipping Patriot and other means of nuclear war to South Korea 
and desperately working to unleash a war while crying for an 
"international cooperation system" and "military countermove" 
over the faked-up "nuclear issue" of the North. 
  They demanded that the South Korean puppet clique 
unconditionally stop the nuclear arms development, discard the 
intention of igniting a new war in collusion with outside forces 
and step down without delay.

  [Text] Kwangju, April 20 (YONHAP) -- Greenpeace, the 
international anti-nuclear and environmental protection group, 
demanded Wednesday that the government and Korea Electric Power 
Corp. (KEPCO) reveal all mishaps and precise information related 
to the nuclear power plants in Yongkwang, West of Kwangju. 
  In a press conference at the Kwangju City Council building, 
Greenpeace said the two nuclear reactors in Yongkwang were 
highly hazardous due to technical flaws in their steam 
generators and fire protection equipment, and urged the 
authorities to disclose data about the reactors and mishap 
details. 
  The nongovernmental body, on a 13-day Korean tour kicked off 
April 12 by its flagship MV Greenpeace, traveled from the 
Northern port city of Samchok and Pusan to arrive in Kwangju on 
Wednesday while staging various antinuclear campaigns and other 
activities to raise environmental consciousness along the way. 
The group will reach Seoul on Friday after stopping off at 
Inchon. 
  This particular steam generator, a core part of nuclear 
reactors made by Westinghouse of the United States, is causing 
accidents worldwide due to technical problems, Greenpeace 
campaigners said. 
  Yongkwang's steam generators, which were built in a similar 
period as those of other countries, could also have defects, 
they said. A campaigner pointed out that a control rod had been 
destroyed while a fuel rod was changed at the No. 2 Yongkwang 
reactor in March 1988 but nothing was revealed about the mishap. 
Greenpeace urged the government and KEPCO to look into the 
possibility of nuclear accidents and conduct training for 
emergency evacuations to ensure public safety. It pledged to 
work with environmental coalitions in the area in staging 
antinuclear campaigns and continue with its environmental 
activities in Korea. 
  Later in the day, Greenpeace sponsored a seminar at Chonnam 
University and showed a video tape of its activities. 
Campaigners from various nations then visited the Mangwol 
cemetery, where victims of the Kwangju uprising are buried, and 
took part in a concert to get across their environmental message.

  [Text] President Fidel V. Ramos issued Memorandum Order 
[M.O.] No. 201, creating a committee to study the expeditious 
issuance of environmental compliance certificate [ECC] for 
infrastructure projects. The committee is composed of the 
National Economic and Development Authority director-general as 
chairman, and the secretaries of the Departments of Environment 
and Natural Resources, Public Works and Highways [DPWH], Energy, 
and Transportation and Communications and the chairman of the 
Coordinating Council of the Philippine Assistance Program as 
members. 
  In signing the order, President Ramos said the government is 
now engaged in the implementation of major infrastructure 
projects that are crucial to the attainment of the Philippine 
development goals. Mr. Ramos noted that lately, implementation 
of this infrastructure projects has been delayed due to the 
difficulties encountered in securing environmental compliance 
certificates. The president tasked the committee to undertake 
the following: 
  1. to determine the scope of environmental compliance 
certificates; 
  2. to formulate ways and means by which the issuance of 
environmental compliance certificate may be expedited; and 
  3. to submit recommendations to the executive secretary for 
the formulation of the appropriate order. These recommendations 
should be submitted to him not later than 15 May of this year. 
  Executive Secretary Teofisto Guingona Jr. said President 
Ramos issued M.O. 201 in view of the request of Public Works and 
Highways Secretary Gregorio Vigilar for presidential assistance 
for the immediate implementation of the Pampanga Delta 
Development Project [PDDP]. According to Vigilar, the 
submission of an environmental compliance certificate is one of 
the priority requirements of the Overseas Economic Cooperation 
Fund [OECF] of Japan before it issues a conforme to the 
contracts of the PDDP. Vigilar said that during the president's 
visit to PDDP site last 25 March, the OECF representative in 
Manila, (Iteyo Tanakan) informed him that the OECF will continue 
to withhold the release of PDDP funds until the DPWH has 
complied with the conditions stated in the ECC. Vigilar said 
that the OECF is particularly concerned with Section 1.3 of the 
ECC which requires the DPWH for the contractors to secure 
endorsement from every concerned local government units and 
municipalities for right, suitable and acceptable relocation 
scheme and conduct consultations with affected residents prior 
to project implementation.

  [Text] A total of $32.71 million worth of assistance to 
the country's environment sector has been approved by the 
European Community (EC) for 1994. 
  In a report to President Ramos, National Economic and 
Development Authority (NEDA) Director General Cielito Habito 
said the assistance will go to the preservation of natural 
parks, integrated protected areas and industrial pollution 
abatement. 
  Habito said EC assistance will not only boost the 
government's environmental protection program but also enhance 
institutional linkages, investment promotion, agrarian reform 
implementation and coconut processing. 
  He reported to the president that a high-level business 
conference is expected to be held in Europe in September or 
October this year. 
  "This will explore possible business opportunities between 
the Philippines and EC countries," Habito said. "Hopefully, the 
conference will bear fruitful results in upgrading Philippine-EC 
trade relations." 
  The EC infused a total of $75.37 million in the country last 
year which mostly financed rural development projects in Western 
Samar, Catanduanes, Aurora, Guimaras, Biliran, Bantayan, Camotes 
and Pitogo. 
  "The private sector also received grant financing for a 
packaging center and assistance to the computer software 
industry, which reflected greater private sector access to 
official development assistance," Habito said. 
  Habito informed the president that the EC has expressed 
interest in initiating regular high-level consultations to 
review pipeline projects as well as its ongoing projects. The 
first consultation might be held this May, he said.

  [Excerpt] Protecting the ozone layer from further 
depletion is everyone's concern -- from the use of aerosol 
sprays to the safe disposal of cholorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and 
halons in appliances. 
  Yesterday, the Department of Environment and Natural 
Resources (DENR) signed a memorandum of agreement (MOA) with 
multilateral financial institutions (MFIs) and the Land Bank of 
the Philippines for the launching of a phaseout program for 
Ozone Depleting Substances. 
  Under the MOA, MFIs like the Asian Development Bank and the 
World Bank are to provide funds to local appliance manufacturers 
for a shift from the use of ozone depleting substances to 
non-ozone depleting substances. 
  Manufacturers concerned are those producing refrigerators 
and 
air conditioners that use CFCs such as freon and fire 
extinguishers that use halon. 
  The MFl grant amounting to some $7 million will be loaned to 
the private sector via the Land Bank. 
  In his speech at the signing of the MOA, President Ramos 
stressed his government "has always stood firm in giving top 
priority to the improvement of the environment," even as he 
urged Congress to consider as priority measures those concerning 
environmental protection. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Taipei, April 21 (CNA) -- Taiwan will meet the four 
requirements set by a United Nations wildlife protection 
organization by the end of September, a Council of Agriculture 
(COA) official said Thursday [21 April]. 
  The UN's Convention on International Trade in Endangered 
Species (CITES) has asked Taiwan to make an inventory of all 
rhino horns, consolidate all rhino horn and tiger bone 
stockpiles, pass legislation to mete out harsher penalties for 
those involved in illicit wildlife product trade and effectively 
enforce all related wildlife conservation laws and regulations. 
  "We are determined to meet CITES requirements by the end of 
September," COA Vice Chairman Lin Shiang-nung said. 
  CITES will decide whether to sanction Taiwan for its alleged 
failure to eliminate illicit rhino horn and tiger bone trade in 
November. 
  "We hope our effort will spare Taiwan from CITES trade 
sanctions," Lin noted. 
  The COA will push the Legislative Yuan to pass a package of 
amendments to the country's wildlife conservation law, which 
propose stricter penalties for offenders, by the end of June. 
  "If the revised law can be passed soon, the United States 
may 
also lessen its trade sanctions against Taiwan," Lin said. 
  The Clinton administration decided to sanction Taiwan over 
wildlife conservation issues early this month. The decision 
will take effect within a month. 
  The COA has proposed a three-year plan for wildlife 
conservation, which will be implemented after being approved by 
the cabinet. 
  Under the plan, the government will spend NT [new Taiwan]$1 
billion (US$37.74 million) over the next three years to enforce 
the consolidation of rhino horn and tiger bone stockpiles, 
intensify the crackdown on smuggling of endangered species, 
increase conservation education and international conservation 
cooperation, establish an identification system for wildlife and 
wildlife products and a wildlife data bank, and train 
conservation specialists.

  [Text] Tirana, April 29 (ATA) -- Albania will sell 
pesticides abroad through open auctions. The pesticides were 
brought into Albania as credits during favourable conditions 
within the last three years. The Albanian Government has 
commissioned the Ministry of Agriculture to sell the pesticides 
to the producing companies and later through open auctions. 
  "A special commission of the Ministry of Agriculture will 
follow all the international laws in pesticides sale," Hasan 
Halili, minister of agriculture told an ATA reporter. Mr. 
Halili said he considers pesticides selling to be the only 
acceptable solution for avoiding the grave ecological and 
environmental repercussions the pesticides might bring about 
when they expire. 
  Last October, the government permitted the sale of the 
pesticides inside Albania but according to the data of the 
Ministry of Agriculture and food the sold quantity has been 
insignificant. 
  Mr. Halili said the very companies which brought the 
pesticides to Albania has continually made requests for retaking 
them. "If the producing companies would not evade in a proper 
time the pesticides, we will put them to auction after we have 
received the approval of the organisms which financed their 
transport," he said. 
  The European Union, through the Picu office in Tirana, has 
been the first organism which offered its assistance for 
treating the pesticides brought in Albania in the context of the 
PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] 
program. The specialists say they are worried about the 
pesticides problem. 
  480 tons of pesticides were brought to Albania during the 
1991-1993 period through the Italian credit, PHARE program and 
the World Bank credit.

  [Text] The president of the La Paz District Forest Chamber, 
Mauricio Hauser, reported that the clearing or burning of 
forests by campesinos is causing an annual loss of 80,000 
hectares in the country's tropical and subtropical regions. 
  He noted that 90 percent of the destruction is due to the 
process resorted to by poor farmers attempting to expand their 
land for cultivation. In other words, there is an annual loss of 
72,000 hectares that are permanently ruined. 
  According to Hauser, one of the main problems for the 
chamber 
that he heads is the progressive destruction of woods. It is 
difficult to curb this devastation, because consecutive 
governments have implemented policies aimed at establishing land 
with a capacity for agriculture and livestock raising (apart 
from the wooded areas), to provide for the consumption and 
export of food products. 
  Another cause leading to the constant destruction of forests 
is the economic and social crisis afflicting the populations in 
valleys. It has prompted waves of migration to the low-lying 
areas, with a resultant clearing of woods. 
<H5>  Lumbering Development </H5>
  Fewer than 4,000 hectares of woods are actually allocated 
for 
timber forest development, according to the La Paz Forest 
Chamber. 
  In fact, the incidence in that area is less: that is, only 
2,400 hectares under new management are converted into forests 
annually. It may be assumed that another five percent is 
destroyed by road construction. These are very low percentages 
compared with the increasingly extensive clearing. 
  The entrepreneurial organization's president claims that, 
for 
this reason, it has become essential "to take direct action to 
minimize the effects of poverty on the Bolivian population." He 
indicated that this could be achieved "through the country's 
productive-industrial reactivation, generating sources of 
permanent employment, and hence, better economic conditions." 
  Moreover, he called for the classification and demarcation 
of 
land suitable for forests, agriculture, livestock raising, and 
protection, through the passage of the Land Law. 
  According to the Forest Chamber, a more drastic change in 
the 
problem of forest and environmental destruction could occur 
through appropriation occupancy of woods and forest land, "as 
well as legislation that would convert Bolivia into a forest 
country, with large production, based on sustained management of 
the woods." 
  However, Hauser did not cite another cause of the clearing 
of 
forests in southern Bolivia: the consumption of charcoal by the 
Vinto smelting plant. Large wooded areas of Chuquisaca, and in 
Zudanez, Tomina, and Hernando Siles Provinces, have been left 
converted into uncultivated land by the burning of woods to 
supply the Vinto company with charcoal. 
  That devastation, repeatedly scored by the authorities and 
inhabitants of the south, has been condoned by the Forest 
Development Center, without allowing for the so-called 
"ecological respite" proclaimed by the previous government 
administration.

  [Excerpt] The country's forest resources are relatively 
well preserved, and there is time for them to be managed through 
appropriate policies. The reason is that the Amazon area shows a 
deforestation rate of 1.6 percent of the total recorded in Latin 
America, which is 50,000 square km per year, according to the 
FAO. This claim is made in a study from the Center for Research 
on the Capacity for Increased Land Use (CUMAT). 
  It maintains that the figures on the rate of deforestation 
previously used in the country are exaggerated, because an 
annual average of 200,000 hectares was cited, whereas the volume 
totaled only 80,087 hectares. 
  The determination of the area involved and the deforestation 
rate in Bolivia's Amazon area woods has been based on the 
assumption that the Bolivian Amazon area is the surface covered 
with wet forests, savannas, and bodies of water in the Amazon 
Basin. Also included is a small portion of the wet forests in 
the Plate Basin, approximately as far as the 18 degrees south 
latitude parallel. 
  The study revealed that the annual deforestation recorded is 
equivalent to that of an average period of five years. Santa 
Cruz Department is the one with the most deforestation, totaling 
391.7 square km (48.9 percent); followed by Cochabamba, with 
151.1 square km (18.8 percent); La Paz, with 109 square km per 
year (13.6 percent); Beni, with 98 square km (12.2 percent); and 
Pando, with 50.8 square km per year (6.3 percent). [passage

  [Text] Indian forest wardens do not suffice to protect the 
Chiman Forest from depredation. The Forest Development Center 
cites the need for reconciliation between equitable treatment 
and conservation of resources. 
  Bolivia's forests are declining by an average of 1,400 
square 
km annually, equivalent to 140,000 hectares per year, as the 
director of the National Forest Development Center [CDF], Javier 
Lopez Soria, admits. 
  Lopez Soria is a professional conservationist, ex-director 
of 
the League for Protection of the Environment (LIDEMA), and 
currently a leading government authority. He is convinced that 
the new Forest Law will prevent indiscriminate exploitation of 
wood, the forests' principal resource. 
  "Good regulations included in the law must be aimed at 
preventing plundering activities, encouraging rational use, and 
promoting forestation." Lopez made this comment in the very 
heart of the Chiman Forest, where he had arrived as a member of 
a group of government officials who had come to hear the demands 
of the Beni Indians and to assess the deterioration of their 
habitat. 
  The Indians have shown the authorities evidence of 
indiscriminate felling of trees, primarily the mara or mahogany, 
a precious species, very highly priced on the domestic and 
foreign market for the manufacture of furniture, flooring, 
doors, etc. 
<H5>  In Beni, 18 Percent of the Forests </H5>
  A total of 18 percent of Bolivia's forests (covering an area 
of 109.8 million hectares) are located in Beni. The Chiman 
Forest, with 1.2 million hectares, is facing an accelerated 
process of deterioration. Hence, if urgent measures are not 
adopted, this habitat, in which 2,266 Indians live, could be 
completely destroyed. 
  Not only is the mara tree becoming extinct, but the fauna as 
well; and the rivers are threatened by the intense activity of 
business firms still operating in an extensive area that was 
declared "Indian territory" in 1990. It was presumed that there 
would be no exploitation of resources by third parties in that 
area. 
  Lopez Sora claims that the situation in Chiman is complex, 
but remarked that its solution is part of a structural approach 
to the problem of the forests. 
  A study made by Lopez himself, titled "Forest Resources in 
Bolivia and Their Utilization," warns of the risk run by the 
forests if rational programs are not adopted. He comments: "The 
forests are subject to major risks. During the 15-year period, 
from 1971 to 1986 alone, the wooded areas were reduced by 21,000 
square km, according to studies conducted by the FAO." 
  As he claims: "The annual volumes of utilization currently 
total about 350,000 cubic meters of trunk wood, but with the use 
of very few species." 
  The CDF director observes that only a few species are being 
exploited, but that there is an immense variety that could be 
used rationally. 
<H5>  Selective Exploitation in the Chiman Forest </H5>
  He notes that what is happening in the Chiman Forest is 
selective exploitation of wood that is putting an end to the 
mara, one of the most precious varieties. He stresses: "It is 
not that the woods should not be exploited; what should be done 
is to maintain equitable treatment and conservation of forest 
resources." 
  According to the director, the CDF resources for curbing the 
illegal exploitation of wood have proven inadequate thus far, 
but there is a willingness to reinforce these agencies. 
  The government authorities have decided to return to the 
former administration in the CDF, which was decentralized in 
recent years. The undersecretary of sustainable development, 
Juan Carlos Quiroga, in turn, declares: "The CDF will be 
subordinate to the Ministry of Sustainable Development and 
Environment, and its administration will not be decentralized 
based on regions." 
  In the undersecretary's opinion, "The former 
decentralization 
of Forest Development Centers has served to allow for many 
irregularities." 
<H5>  Taking Care of What Belongs to Them </H5>
  With those restructuring problems in the CDF, the Beni 
Indian 
peoples have assumed responsibility for taking care of their 
forests with their own resources. "There is among the Beni 
Indian peoples the view that an effective model of sustainable 
development can be achieved, using the Indian communities and 
settlements located in the territory as the main executors." 
This was stressed by the researcher and director of the Research 
and Documentation Center for the Development of Beni 
(CIDDEBENI), Zulema Lehm. "There is also a conservationist 
tendency among large sectors of the Indian peoples, who are 
inclined to reinforce it." 
  Lehm comments: "Meanwhile, the Beni Indian peoples have 
created a Coordinating Board for the Multiethnic Indian 
Territory, with one representative for each people." 
  She explains that this coordinating board has, in turn, an 
Indian technical team, including 20 Indian youths who were 
elected at a meeting of mayors, and are to be trained to assist 
the coordinating board in the administration and management of 
the area. 
  The Indian technical team is subdivided into two groups: one 
for planning and another for protection. They were trained in 
planning, administration, management, and control of resources 
by institutions such as the Beni Biological Station, the 
Institute of Ecology of San Andres Major University, the 
Technical University of Beni, the CIDDEBENI itself, and other 
organizations. 
<H5>  Getting to Work </H5>
  The president of the Beni Indian Peoples' Center, Marcial 
Fabricano, claims that the young people who joined the technical 
team prepared a "Preliminary Plan for Protection and Development 
of the Multiethnic Indian Territory" in 1992. Its purpose was to 
"promote the socioeconomic and cultural development of the 
Indian peoples, and the conservation of natural resources." 
  Fabricano remarks: "The forest's natural resources can be 
used by retrieving traditional techniques." 
  According to Lehm: "The plan is an unprecedented experience 
in the country, because it was devised by the Indian peoples 
themselves, and because it adapted the methodology of the 
Management Plans for Protected Areas (which number few in the 
country) to the needs of the Indian Territory." 
  The CIDDEBENI director stressed that the Indians have 
organized six programs in their territory: for protection, 
productive development, research, social development, 
communication and dissemination, and operations. Each of them 
is, in turn, subdivided into subprograms. 
<H5>  An Indian Forest Warden </H5>
  As part of the protection program, the Indians have trained 
15 forest wardens, who monitor the territory from strategically 
located stations. However, their warnings are not heeded by the 
power saw operators who are numerous in the woods, armed with 
their tools for felling trees. 
  Fabricano admits: "Sometimes there are conflicts, insults, 
and death threats, because the power saw operators pay no 
attention to the forest wardens, and we fear for their lives." 
  The Indian forest warden is recognized by the state, because 
the peoples themselves negotiated for legal support of their 
protective activity. 
  On 9 April 1992, Supreme Decree 23,107 officially created 
the 
Indian Forest Warden, granting him authority to monitor and 
protect Indian territories recognized as social and community 
property; to defend and conserve the flora and all the natural 
resources in the territory; and to direct and support activities 
aimed at the protection, conservation, and sustainable use of 
natural resources on the part of the Indian organizations. 
  And that is not all: The warden is authorized to "confiscate 
all products extracted in violation of the legal regulations for 
protection and conservation of territories; to penalize and 
impose fines on violators; and to have custody of the products 
and species that have been confiscated." 
  Nevertheless, the lumber companies find ways of extracting 
the resources from the forests; and, sometimes, when the Indian 
opposition is very strong, they find ways of winning over the 
communities, by offering them color television sets, radios, and 
money.

  [Text] If urgent measures are not adopted, the Chiman 
Forest, located in Beni, in the country's northeastern section, 
will be destroyed by the plundering activity of the lumber 
companies and sawmills. They are still continuing their 
operations, and no one has succeeded in ousting them, not even 
the decrees on protection signed in 1990 after the march for 
"territory and dignity." 
  The Chiman Forest, considered the area most endowed with 
mara 
or mahogany wood ("Swietenia macrophilla," of the Meliaceae 
family), is facing a process of extinction. Despite this, its 
exploitation is intense, in contrast to the minimal 
reforestation. 
  Experts and ethnic groups warn that the mara will disappear 
here in the Chiman Forest within two or three years, as has been 
confirmed by the director of the Forest Development Center, 
Javier Lopez Soria, an expert on the problem. 
  A total of 80 percent of lumber exports, worth as much as 
$48.8 million per year, consist of mara, produced mainly by 
Beni, followed by Santa Cruz. 
  Every year, the Beni sawmills receive 100,000 cubic meters 
of 
tree trunks. 
  It is calculated that at least 190,000 cubic meters of mara 
are exploited annually throughout the country. A large portion 
of it comes from the Chiman Forest, inhabited by 2,266 Indians 
who led a historic march on foot, from Puerto San Borja to La 
Paz, in 1990. 
  Added to the disappearance of mara is the pollution of 
rivers 
by the wood waste, which is creating upheaval in aquatic life, 
and, finally, the extermination of fauna, to supply an army of 
power saw operators who tour the Chiman Forest daily, felling 
young trees and squandering the wood. 
  Overflights by small planes through the Chiman Forest, and 
tours along the Apare River, with 13 Indian communities and 17 
settlements located on its shores, have succeeded in proving to 
a government committee the danger threatening the Chiman Forest. 
The threat is present despite the legal regulations existing to 
protect it, and the efforts on the part of the Indian peoples 
and private organizations.

  [Text] The SCD-1 (Data-Gathering Satellite), the first 
Brazilian satellite made with national technology by experts 
from the National Institute of Space Research (INPE) in Sao Jose 
dos Campos, Sao Paulo, has caused a more-than-agreeable 
surprise. Launched in Cape Canaveral, United States, on 9 
February 1993, the satellite should have had a one-year useful 
life. But inexplicably, it continues sending meteorological data 
to the INPE, which expects the SCD-1 to have another year of 
useful life. 
  "We are agreeably surprised," said INPE acting director 
Volker Kirchhoff when he reported the accomplishment of the 
SCD-1, which opens the way for the launching of the SCD-2 in 
1995 and, in the future, the SCD-3, which is a communications 
satellite approved by the Brazilian Commission for Space 
Activities (Cobae). The SCD-1 has transmitted reliable 
environmental data on the Amazon region, allowing INPE experts 
to develop meteorological works on the region. 
  Ever since it was launched a year and two months ago, the 
SCD-1 has transmitted daily to the INPE station in Cuiaba, Mato 
Grosso, environmental data being monitored in Cachoeira 
Paulista, Sao Paulo. The first Brazilian satellite is in orbit 
700 kms above the earth and gathers information on atmospheric 
pollution by carbon monoxide and the destruction of the ozone 
layer by CFC gases, besides monitoring the direction and 
intensity of climatic phenomena and the air's relative humidity. 
  The SCD-1's importance is that it is adding environmental 
data to that provided by the U.S. Landsat and Nooa-11 
satellites, which are monitoring burning lands in the Amazon 
region, the Achilles heel of Brazilian environmental policy. 
"Our expectation is that the SCD-1 will last one more year," 
Volker Kirchhoff said, recalling that the success of the first 
completely national satellite opens the skies for the Brazilian 
Space Program.

<F P=106> [Interview with Virgilia de Rodriguez, president of the </F>
Institute for the Ecological Development of the Amazon Region; 
place and date not given] 
  [Text] The Institute for the Ecological Development of the 
Amazon Region of Ecuador (ECORAE) has been engaged in important 
activity in the promotion and development of the population in 
the Amazon region. The ECORAE is doing great work in the 
planning, coordinating, and supervising major projects designed 
to benefit the region. 
  In an exclusive interview, Virgilia de Rodriguez, president 
of the board of the institute, discussed various aspects of the 
work the ECORAE is doing with a view to benefiting the 
communities in the Province of Oriente. 
  EL COMERCIO: What goals is the ECORAE pursuing? 
  Rodriguez: The Institute for the Ecological 
Development of the Amazon Region is working to bring about the 
sustainable and sustained development of the region, with the 
participation of the social partners and action on the part of 
the public and private institutions. In addition, we are 
seeking, among other things, to improve the standard of living 
of the peasants and the Indians, while respecting their identity 
and their methods of production. We are trying to ensure a 
balance between conservation and development and to promote 
ecological tourism and research on and technological generation 
of the native species that contribute to agricultural and forest 
production. 
  EL COMERCIO: From what funds are your activities 
financed? 
  Rodriguez: The ECORAE is supported economically by 
funds obtained from the export of oil. Initially, the allocation 
was 0.01 cents on the dollar, but this sum has been increasing 
annually. We now have a much more modest budget that allows us 
to work on various development projects. The basic purpose of 
the fund is to protect the ecosystem, and we are working 
together with the governments of the sections to develop 
environmental conservation and cleanup projects. In addition, we 
are authorized to seek foreign funds to support our projects. 
  EL COMERCIO: On what projects are you working at 
present? 
  Rodriguez: The ECORAE has the responsibility for 
and is doing the work of promoting productive activity in the 
rural sector, but with full respect for nature. We are currently 
using a part of our budget to provide the farmers in Joya de los 
Sachas and Coca with incentives for the raising of 
nontraditional crops such as black pepper and palmetto. This is 
being done in view of the crisis created for the coffee growers 
by the drop in prices on the international market and the 
attacks made on their crops by infestations and plant diseases. 
  In addition, we have focused support on the craft and mining 
sectors, because we want to create new job opportunities for the 
region's residents. 
  EL COMERCIO: What are the prospects for ecological 
tourism in the Amazon region? 
  Rodriguez: The ECORAE has placed special emphasis 
on ecological tourism. The Amazon region is a favorable area for 
the development of ecological tourism and scientific research. 
One of the projects we are coordinating with the Foundation for 
the Sustained Development of the Amazon Region is the opening of 
the first ecological corridor in South America. This corridor, 
60 kilometers long, will cover and protect a very extensive area 
in the valley of the Sumaco Volcano. Plans call for the 
establishment of two scientific stations there to pursue studies 
of the zone. We now have the total support of the national 
government for the implementation of this project. 
  The ECORAE is working very closely with the Ministry of 
National Defense on some projects designed to strengthen 
national sovereignty in the Amazon region, Virgilia de Rodriguez 
said. 
  She noted that a guided-settlement program is under way in 
the area of the frontier with Colombia, where there is a need at 
present for a larger population of Ecuadorans. 
  The FFAA [Armed Forces] will take possession of the area 
needed to make the guided settlement of citizens possible within 
the Guepi trapezoid area lying between the San Miguel and 
Putumayo Rivers. There are plans to establish a base and a 
harbor-master's office in the port of El Carmen, in Putumayo, 
she emphasized. 
  The entire Amazon region of the country is the ECORAE's 
sphere of activity. It includes the Provinces of Sucumbios, 
Napo, Pastaza, Morona, and Zamora; the districts of Lago Agrio, 
Shushufindi, Gonzalo Pizarro, Cascales, Putumayo, and Sucumbios 
Alto, in Sucumbios; Tena, Archidona, Francisco de Orellana, La 
Joya de los Sachas, Aguarico, Loreto, Quijos, and Chaco, in 
Napo; Pastaza, Mera, and Santa Clara, in Pastaza; Morona, Sucua, 
Palora, Limon Indanza, Santiago, Gualaquiza, Huamboya, and San 
Juan Bosco, in Morona; and Zamora Yanzatza, Yacumbi, El Pangui, 
Chinchipe, and Nagaritza, in Zamora.

  [Text] New Delhi -- The 1993 State of Forest Report, which 
is the fourth assessment of forest cover based on visual and 
digital interpretation of satellite data between 1989 and 1991, 
reveal that the forest cover in India in two years has increased 
by just 22 sq kms. This means an annual increase of just 1100 ha! 
  When the National Wasteland Development Board was set up in 
1985, the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi announced that five 
million hectares would be greened every year. Subsequently this 
target was dropped as too tall and unrealistic an order. At the 
forest ministers conference on Monday, Environment and Forest 
Minister Kamal Nath said only 2 million ha a year could be 
greened. But going by the Forest Survey of India report even 
this is a tall order. 
  This indicates that the survival rate of the new plantations 
is not as glorious as recorded and the amount of forest land 
being diverted for so-called development projects is more than 
what is planted. 
  While the forest cover in Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh 
Karnataka, Kerala, Nagaland, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tripura, Tamil 
Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Andaman and Nicobar islands 
has increased, it has decreased in Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal 
Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa. Daman and Diu, Madhya Pradesh, 
Maharashtra, Manipur, Meghalayas, Mizoram and Orissa. 
  Reports from the seven North Eastern States are in 
particular 
depressing. While the dense forest cover (crown density of 40 
per cent) increased by 31 sq km between 1991 and 1993, there was 
a decrease of 666 sq km in the open forest cover (crown density 
of 10 to less than 40 per cent) area. The worst culprits are 
Assam, which has 243 sq km less of forests, Mizoram -- less by 
156 sq kms, Meghalaya -- less by 106 sq km, Arunachal Pradesh -- 
less by 96 sq km. 
  In all North Eastern states forests continue to be 
devastated 
by shifting cultivation of jhoom [rotational crop planting] 
operation despite the Central government's efforts to stop 
jhoom. While 702 sq km of forests was lost in these states to 
the traditional practise of shifting cultivation, 281 ha was 
lost due to other reasons. However there was regeneration in 315 
ha which had been felled for cultivation. 
  The total forest cover in the country is 6,40,107 sq km 
(excluding tea gardens), which is 19.47 per cent of the total 
geographical area of the country.

  [Text] It was a curious coincidence. Last Tuesday, the 
Indian Express frontpaged a major PTI [Press Trust of 
India] story from Washington reporting how CBS 60 
Minutes (one of American TV's most viewed shows) had 
alleged that India runs the world's most unsafe nuclear plants 
without inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency 
while The Independent frontpaged, on the same day, a 
PTI report from Calcutta that Dr. P.K. Iyengar, Chairman of the 
Atomic Energy Commission and Secretary, Department of Atomic 
Energy in the Government of India had won this year's Jawaharlah 
Nehru Birth Centenary Award for his contribution in the field of 
atomic energy! 
  This is typical of India. 
  Even as one of the world's most respected news programmes on 
television accuses us of the most shocking crime possible, of 
running the world's most contaminated and dangerous nuclear 
power plants, with radioactive leakages and inadequate 
safeguards to protect those who work there, we are busy handing 
over one of the country's most prestigious awards to the very 
person who must be held responsible for the crime. 
  It is no use blaming CBS. The buyers for the `Foreign Hand' 
theory are a vanishing breed today. We are welcoming foreigners 
into India with open arms and we should know that this 
eventually means a more open society in which wrongdoing can no 
longer be brushed under the carpet. Not even when the Government 
does the house-cleaning. 
  Dollars and the free information society come together and 
you cannot have one without the other. You cannot earn millions 
of dollars selling your carpets and, at the same time, hide the 
fact that your carpet industry criminally deploys child labour. 
You cannot welcome foreign tourists to your beach resorts and, 
at the same time, expect them to be blind to the fact that you 
are allowing hotel owners and rapacious commercial interests to 
encroach upon your beaches and destroy them. 
  You cannot expect visitors to come to India and, at the same 
time, hide from them the fact that you run the cruelest and most 
filthy abattoirs in the world, which produce meat that only the 
most insensitive and barbaric people would eat without protest. 
  More and more horror stories about our nuclear installations 
and environmental savagery are bound to hit the headlines 
worldwide and let us, instead of trying to brazenly lie our way 
through, confess to our crimes and set things right. There is 
enough time and opportunity. Let us change our attitudes towards 
crimes committed against nature and people. Let us force our 
government bodies to become more accountable. 
  Research by some of India's finest journalists have 
revealed, 
for instance, the simple and inescapable fact that India's 
atomic energy programme has been a dismal failure. What is 
worse, it has spawned serious and long-term environmental 
problems and it is time to order an open audit of the money that 
has vanished into the programme and the enormous damage it has 
done to our environment and public health. 
  Last month, The Sunday Observer (which has pursued 
the nuclear establishment over the past three years with 
single-minded zeal) revealed how contamination of soil, water, 
flora and marine organisms around our nuclear power plants have 
crossed emergency levels since a decade. Findings based on 
internal documents and public statements issued by the atomic 
energy authorities themselves reveal that hundreds of curies of 
the lethal, long-lived radio-active isotope Caesium-137 (along 
with many other radio-active species) are lying in public areas, 
just outside the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre [BARC]. 
  This poisons underground water. It endangers the milk we get 
from cattle grazing in there. It contaminates marine life in the 
Thane creek and the fish and the crabs you eat have reached 
emergency radio-active levels as defined by bodies like the 
International Atomic Energy Agency and the International 
Commission for Radiation Protection, among others. It is not 
just the press that knows this. The officials know this. The 
government know this. And yet everyone digs his head into the 
sand, ostrich-like and pretends that the crimes will go away if 
we ignore them long enough. 
  Meanwhile, workers in these unsafe nuclear plants, visitors 
and people living in the contaminated zones around them are 
risking fatal cancers and genetic disorders. All because a few 
people at the top are unconcerned about international safety 
standards and are busy wooing the political establishment to win 
awards and accolades at the cost of the nation. CBS 60 
Minutes, reportedly, showed workers with burn marks and 
interviewed an American-trained Indian doctor who confirmed that 
due largely to radio-active contamination children are born in 
areas nearby without ears, with two thumbs and so on. 
  At an international meet some time back, a "responsible 
scientist" from BARC had, in fact, revealed data to show that 
our nuclear power plants were discharging about a hundred times 
the expected safe levels of radio-activity in the environment. 
International experts were aghast and the organisation concerned 
wrote to the Government of India about the disastrous long-term 
consequences of this steady poisoning of the environment by our 
nuclear power stations. 
  But more strange than this are some of the other games that 
BARC plays. Its senior most scientists, for instance, once 
connived to irradiate cheap diamonds to dangerous levels of 
radio-activity in the APSARA [expansion not given] reactor and 
peddled them at home and abroad as costly, natural "black" 
diamonds. While doing this, they were deliberately violating all 
safety procedures for tagging and shielding of radio-active 
sources leaving BARC. These irradiated stones were released for 
uncontrolled transactions in the diamond trade and the public 
would have never known, were it not for the vigilance of the 
press. 
  When caught, senior BARC officials tried to pass the buck to 
each other. Finally, S.D. Soman confessed to The Sunday 
Observer correspondent that using radio-active materials 
for cosmetic purposes was proscribed under international 
standards. 
  When called to Delhi to explain, Soman checked into Sion 
Hospital and did not emerge till the day of his retirement, 
after which he vanished overseas. 
  Huge investments have been made in these power plants -- 
yielding puny returns. Our nukes, starting with the first two 
indigenous reactors at Narora, cost the nation a staggering Rs 
800 crore. That is, Rs 2 crore per installed megawatt. As 
against this, a conventional thermal power station costs Rs 1 
crore a megawatt! 
  The nukes at Karakpur are estimated to cost even more -- Rs 
2.5 crore per installed megawatt, at the last estimate. Newer 
nukes will cost around Rs 3 crore. This means, at a conservative 
estimate, our nukes at Narora, Karakpur, Kaiga and Rawatbhata 
will make us sink in over Rs 4000 crore into nuclear power, 
whereas we could have achieved the same capacity at much less 
than half the price (and, in fact, much faster) had we had gone 
the thermal way. 
  The operating history of our plants is worse. The break even 
point for viability is 62 per cent capacity factor. Our new 
nukes do between 35 per cent to 40 per cent. So, by the Nuclear 
Power Corporation's own yardstick, their power production is a 
grossly losing venture. However, by sheer legerdemain, its 
manifest losses are shown as profits by treating government 
equity as an interest-free grant and by assigning subsidised 
costs to fuel, heavy water and other components made in DAE's 
[Department of Atomic Energy] establishments. 
  Despite such creative accounting, NPC [Nuclear Power 
Corporation] manages to show a profit of only Rs 100 crore per 
year on an investment running into so many thousand crore! Were 
it not run on public money, it would have been forced to roll 
down its shutters a long time back. 
  Even these creative profits come from the older reactors 
obtained from the USA (the Tarapur units) and Canada (the 
Rajasthan reactors) which, despite their vintage, continue to 
deliver cheaper and more reliable power than our indigenous 
white elephants. When these old units are phased out by the end 
of this decade, the financial picture will become even gloomier 
since we may have less effective capacity at that time than we 
have -- and this faltering uncertain output will account for 
less than 1 per cent of the national power generation! 
  Compare this to the enormous damage done to public health 
and 
the environment and you will get a correct picture of what our 
nuclear power programme is all about! 
  The Government has woken up by limiting resources for 
current 
projects and deferring funds for future ones. So the NPC is 
borrowing money from the market through bonds which have to be 
repaid soon -- and for which no sources of money are apparent. 
Even the debt burden of these bonds exceeds the yearly so-called 
profit of the Corporation. This is the typical picture of a 
bankrupt organisation, where liabilities exceed assets and the 
cost of debt servicing exceeds income. 
  Isn't it time that someone called an end to this 
preposterous 
charade instead of allowing awards and accolades to be piled on 
to people who are earning India a bad name all over the world 
and running a dangerous and losing proposition under the 
pretence of leading India into a brave new hi-tech century? 
  The only man who can dare to take on the mighty atomic 
energy 
establishment, which is a law unto itself, is Prime Minister 
Narasimha Rao. The question is: Will he do it?

  [Text] With each passing day, the world's largest case of 
arsenic poisoning assumes even more alarming dimensions as 
tubewells in West Bengal disgorge contaminated water in block 
after block, village after village--this time in Calcutta's own 
backyard: the South 24-Parganas (pop. 5.7 million). 
  Even as the Centre and the State ignore the enormity of 
arsenic poisoning in five other districts of West Bengal, 
surveys conducted by Jadavpur University's School of 
Environmental Studies in the past several weeks have turned up 
shocking evidence of how many more lakhs of people are now 
threatened in areas hardly a few kilometres from the city. 
  On Saturday afternoon, as a team of scientists from the 
school, accompanied by doctors and environmental experts, 
arrived at Purandharpur, a village in Baruipur in the South 
24-Parganas, they were besieged by scores of locals desperate to 
know the results of analysis of water samples taken from 
tubewells in the area by the team a week earlier. 
  Far away from the corridors of power of Calcutta and New 
Delhi, a quiet tragedy unfolded as the villagers, their faces 
shot with anxiety, took in the terrifying news: barring two, all 
the tubewells of Purandharpur had arsenic contents more than 30 
times the recommended level! Water from these tubewells, 
according to the School of Environmental Studies, is unfit for 
cattle, not to mention human consumption! 
  For the school, which until now had been preoccupied with 
arsenic contamination in water elsewhere in the State, the 
finding of the dreaded metalloid in South 24-Parganas tubewell 
water was not something straight out of the blue. 
  Last year, after detecting arsenic in water in a Jadavpur 
locality, the team had taken some random samples from several 
villages in the Baruipur block and found arsenic in three. A 
week ago, the team went back for more samples and the results 
confirmed the team's worst fears: arsenic turned up in alarming 
concentrations in almost 80 per cent of the affected areas. 
  On Saturday at Purandharpur, in the crowd waiting for the 
results of the analysis of tubewell-water samples was Sankar 
Mondal (51), his body dotted with tell-tale signs of arsenic 
poisoning that doctors described as raindrop skin pigmentation. 
Mondal earns a living by playing the tabla, but that has been 
made increasingly difficult in the past few years by lesions on 
his palms and soles, a condition known in medical parlance as 
hyperkeratosis. 
  As the Jadavpur University team weaved through standing 
crops 
and hushed households of this South 24-Parganas village, the 
symptoms that Sankar Mondal bore quickly became a familiar 
sight. Skin afflictions apart, explained Dr. Jayanta Dasgupta of 
SSKM [expansion not given] Hospital as he examined the 
arsenic-affected locals, they were suffering from either 
conjunctivitis, enlargement of the liver or affliction of the 
nerves of the upper and lower limbs. 
  Purandharpur's residents are especially alarmed because the 
tubewell water used by more than 1,500 students of the village's 
educational institutions has been found to contain 35 times more 
arsenic than recommended! 
  Paying the price for human avarice are nearly 32,000 people 
in the South 24-Parganas alone, found till now to be drinking 
arsenic-contaminated water. The actual figure could be 
mind-boggling. 
<H5>  [28 Feb 94 p 1] </H5>
  [Text] Niranjan Das, a resident of gram panchayat Ramnagar 
II in the South 24-Parganas' Baruipur Block, is counting his 
days. Years of drinking arsenic-contaminated water has 
irreversibly damaged his body's vital organs -- a plight common 
to all four members of the Das family. 
  Yet, that's only part of the tragedy. During the past few 
years, Niranjan Das's mother and two sisters died one after 
another -- all victims of arsenic poisoning that, after five 
districts of the State, has now been revealed to threaten lakhs 
of people in the South 24-Parganas. 
  Out of the district's 30 blocks, Jadavpur University's 
School 
of Environmental Studies recently picked two and analysed 
tubewell-water samples from a total of 28 villages. Shockingly, 
not a single village has been found to be safe from the threat 
of arsenic. 
  Till now, the school has found nearly 9,000 villagers with 
arsenic-related skin lesions in the two South 24-Parganas Blocks 
that they have surveyed. However, according to Dr. D.N. Guha 
Majumdar, who heads SSKM Hospital's gastro-enterology 
department, not all who are suffering from chronic arsenic 
toxicity will show skin lesions. "Many might be affected 
internally," he said. 
  Not surprisingly, ignorance about melanosis and 
hyperkeratosis -- arsenic-induced skin afflictions -- is taking 
a heavy social toll in the villages. Wives are being sent back 
to their parents; finding grooms for daughters is proving an 
uphill task; and competent candidates are being turned down for 
jobs. Indeed, arsenicosis-affected persons are being treated not 
unlike leprosy patients in many of the districts. 
  SSKM's Professor Guha Majumdar, who has been collaborating 
with the Jadavpur University team in studying arsenic poisoning, 
says that safe drinking water and a nutritious diet can help 
reverse early damage caused by arsenicosis. 
  Till now, six districts of the State -- Nadia, Burdwan, 
Murshidabad, Malda and the North and South 24-Parganas -- have 
been found to be affected by arsenic-contaminated underground 
water. In all these places, the deadly metalloid has been 
gushing out of underground acquifers through water pumped out by 
tubewells. 
  An ever increasing demand for water -- mainly for irrigation 
and partly for domestic use -- has spurred more and more 
tubewells to be sunk. "This has possibly upset the underground 
geological balance, causing arsenic to leach out of the iron 
pyrite's crystal lattice," said the school's director. 
  The need of the hour, according to him, is to find out and 
isolate all the tubewells in the State spewing 
arsenic-contaminated water. Residents should be told to use only 
those tubewells whose water had tested arsenic-free. 
  "Our studies have shown that tubewells up to even 450 feet 
deep are not safe," said a scientist of the school. Studies 
conducted so far suggest that the deeper the well, the lesser is 
the chance of arsenic contamination. 
  To eliminate the scourge, the School of Environmental 
Studies, which is planning to convene an international seminar 
on arsenic poisoning in the State in January next year, advises 
boring tubewells deeper than 500 feet and monitoring their water 
quality constantly to keep tabs on the arsenic content. 
  Solution in the long run, according to wetlands experts, 
lies 
in proper management of water resources, conservation of rain 
and surface water, and planned utilization of ponds and 
water-logged areas. 
  Unless the Government moves in to stop the profligate 
spending of underground water, the experts warn, the fate of 30 
million people in six districts of the State, could well go the 
same way as that of the more than 7.5 lakh people drinking 
arsenic-contaminated water in these districts now.

<F P=106> [Article by Ole Mathismoen: "New Report From Bellona: </F>
Russian Plans for Nuclear Dumping"] 
  [Text] Russia is considering whether to dump old submarine 
reactors in the ocean in order to solve the waste crisis that 
the START II agreement will lead to. 
  This sensational allegation appears in a new Bellona report 
published yesterday concerning the nuclear situation in 
northwest Russia. The environmental foundation has had access to 
hitherto unknown documents showing how and where Russia intends 
to dismantle 150 nuclear submarines. 
  The documents show that all future decommissioning of 
nuclear 
submarines, including vessels from the Pacific fleet, will take 
place in the shipyard city of Severodvinsk on the White Sea, 
southeast of the Kola peninsula. According to the START II 
agreement, Russia will decommission 150 nuclear submarines 
carrying 278 reactors in the next few years. 
  So far only two nuclear submarines, with four reactors, have 
been completely dismantled. The fuel rods have been removed from 
another 34 vessels, of which 16 come from the Northern fleet. 
According to the Bellona report, nuclear submarines with a total 
of 206 nuclear reactors and 45,000 used fuel rods will be 
dismantled at Severodvinsk. 
  In the Bellona report, which is the first comprehensive 
report concerning the nuclear situation in the region, a 
detailed overview will be published for the first time 
describing how the two enormous submarine yards in Severodvinsk 
will be upgraded in order to handle the huge dismantling job. 
The plan includes, among other things, the building of new dry 
docks, a new installation intended for the removal of fuel rods, 
improvements of the railroad from Severodvinsk to the nuclear 
city of Mayak in Siberia, and the construction of docking 
facilities for the storage of nuclear submarines. 
  "The upgrading of Severodvinsk was to have been carried out 
between 1993 and 1998 in order to receive the many submarines 
that will be decommissioned. However, several of the projects 
that should have been started last year are still in the 
planning stage. The uncertainty as to the responsibility and the 
financing might result in the postponement of the dismantling 
and destruction of the submarines. In the meantime the 
submarines are being stored in bays and fjords along the Kola 
peninsula, among other places," says the two authors of the 
report, Thomas Nilsen and Nils Bohmer. 
<H5>  Full Storage Facilities </H5>
  The definite plans for the improvement of the Severodvinsk 
docks that Bellona has had access to include only pure dock 
functions per se and a small increase in the capacity for the 
interim storage of nuclear waste. As all storage facilities for 
nuclear waste in the Kola region were filled to capacity a long 
time ago, new solutions must be found. The used fuel that is 
most radioactive will be carried to the nuclear city of Mayak 
according to the plan. But there is no place to send the 
reactors, the reactor sections and other solid radioactive waste. 
  "From the documentation we have received and from the talks 
we have had with different people, it has become clear that 
Russian authorities are considering two alternatives. One is to 
dump the waste in the Kara Sea as was done up through 1991. The 
other possibility is to build a new regional storage facility 
for solid waste," Nilsen and Bohmer say. 
  The two men express a great deal of worry over the nuclear 
situation up north: 
  "In addition to the 150 nuclear submarines that will be 
destroyed in accordance with the START II agreement, it is 
assumed that 80 Russian nuclear submarines will be taken out of 
operation because of their age over the next 30 to 40 years. As 
all storage facilities are full and there is no money to build 
an expensive new long-term storage facility, we fear that 
dumping will again become the only alternative. Maybe that is 
why Russia has refrained from signing the final London 
convention against such ocean dumping," Nilsen says. 
  It can be clearly seen from the Bellona report that the 
nuclear waste crisis in northwest Russia in no way has improved 
during the last year. 
  However, Bohmer and Nilsen say that what they fear most is 
the social [repercussions of the] nuclear crisis. 
  "Workers in the shipyard city of Severodvinsk, at the 
nuclear 
power plant, at Atomflot, and at the military Northern fleet are 
paid only rarely. It is not uncommon for them to go three to 
four months without being paid. The result is that they are 
careless with security. I fear that human error might lead to an 
accident long before the technical equipment actually fails," 
Bellona's nuclear physicist Bohmer says. Discarded nuclear 
submarines with intact reactors that are stored in the various 
fjords around the Kola peninsula need just as careful 
maintenance as nuclear submarines that are in operation. 
<H5>  [Box, p 3] </H5>
<H5>  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Thanks Bellona </H5>
  "Bellona has access to channels of communication and 
information that we do not have. That is why they compliment our 
work," Thorbjorn Norendal, the assistant director of the 
Department of Foreign Affairs, says. He is heading the 
preparation of a white paper on nuclear safety in northwest 
Russia. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has given financial 
support to Bellona's work in Russia. 
  "Bellona's new report is a factual and straightforward 
account of the problems," Norendal says. 
  He thinks that Russia probably will not resume ocean 
dumping. 
"However, the fact that this is under consideration shows how 
urgent the problem is. It is news to us that all dismantling of 
old nuclear submarines will take place in Severodvinsk. I fear 
that this will mean an accumulation of nuclear waste in the 
north. Unlike the United States, the Russians have made no plans 
for where to store all the old reactor sections. The thought 
that they will be floating in the water at the docks in the 
fjords around Kola is a frightening one," Norendal says. 
  He states that Norway's resources will not reach far in 
helping Russia. "However, we are prepared to participate in 
creating an international movement in order to help them with 
their disarmament, which will be just as expensive as the 
[original] armament was."

  [Text] Moscow April 20 TASS -- "We should receive fuller 
information on the situation and conduct measures aimed at 
preventing or lessening a radioactive leakage from the 
Komsomolets submarine," said here on Wednesday Sergey 
Khetagurov, deputy minister for civil defence and emergencies, 
defining the main task of a Russian expedition to the area of 
the sunken submarine to be held next June. 
  He spoke at a working meeting of several ministries and 
departments which will participate in the expedition. 
  The mission plans to carry out comprehensive monitoring of 
the radiation, ecological and biological situation in the area 
of the submarine's wreckage with the use of advanced equipment 
and to realise several technological operations aimed at 
minimising a possible leakage of products of plutonium corrosion 
into the environment. 
  It is also planned to implement a unique operation at a 
depth 
of 1,700 meters to seal, with special hatches, six ports in the 
submarine's bow where there are six missiles, two of which are 
with nuclear warheads. 
  This will decrease the speed of water currents and minimise 
the leakage of products of plutonium corrosion. The operation 
on installing hatches will be simulated on the sub's specially 
built full-scale mockup. Meeting participants noted that there 
is no experience of conducting similar operations at such depths. 
  Khetagurov said in conclusion that the expedition is an 
expensive undertaking. Nevertheless, it is necessary for Russia 
and the entire international community. Therefore, it should be 
carried out at a high technological and organisational level.

<F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Historical Sciences Vladimir Burov </F>
under the rubric "Reader's Comment:" "`Why Do We Need a New 
Construction Project of the Century?' Asks Candidate of 
Historical Sciences Vladimir Burov"] 
  [Text] There have been extremely few details given about 
the St. Petersburg-Moscow high-speed rail link. That is why the 
majority of us believe that the issue here concerns the 
modernization of the existing Oktyabrskaya Railroad. This is a 
great error! The high-speed rail link is set to pass through 
conservation areas in Novgorod and Tver oblasts and the Moscow 
region. 
  The high-speed rail link will be protected on both sides of 
the track by a three-meter concrete screen -- a variation on the 
theme of the Great Wall of China. The territory of Russia's 
historic heartland will be divided in two although admittedly 
there will be some small crossing points for pedestrians and 
traffic. A fast highway and power lines will run alongside the 
high-speed track. In the conservation areas the no-go zone will 
be several hundred meters across. To that it should be added 
that according to the planners' scheme the route itself will 
become the axis for the formation of a megalopolis. In their 
fevered minds they have the idea (and it is being studied!) of 
creating a "two-headed capital city" on these ecologically 
fragile lands. The rapid development of these lands between St. 
Petersburg and Moscow will have unpredictable consequences -- an 
ecological and cultural catastrophe. 
  Hundreds of hectares of plowland, meadows, and forests and 
archeological monuments will be destroyed by the scoops of the 
excavators at this construction project of the century. The 
special levees that will be built will upset this unique 
region's hydrology. This is the watershed of the Volga-Baltic 
water system. The blow will be struck at its "solar plexus." 
All these factors would be highlighted by an ecological expert 
appraisal but one has not been held and the construction workers 
are already prepared to begin work. 
  At local level in the oblasts and rayons there is a mounting 
protest from the population, scientists, and ecologists against 
the barbaric destruction of nature, archeological monuments, and 
the historical and cultural landscape. Individual rayons have 
withheld their consent to the laying of the track across their 
lands. The Russian Federation Committee for Land Resources and 
Land Management responded to that by issuing order no. 62 of 22 
December 1993 confiscating lands in the designated area along 
the entire route from St. Petersburg to Moscow for federal needs 
under the high-speed rail construction program. 
  At a session of the State Extradepartmental Expert Review 
Council of the Russian Main Administration for State Expert 
Review of Designs and Budget Estimates for Construction Work on 
25 February an alternative to the high-speed rail link -- the 
modernization of the Oktyabrskaya and Savelovskaya railroads -- 
was proposed but without success. That would have been a 
European approach to the solution of the problem, combining the 
interests of protecting nature and cultural monuments with the 
need for technical progress.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoly Yurkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 19 TASS -- The foreign press is 
accusing the Russian Pacific Fleet of discharging radioactive 
waste into the sea. It is characteristic that these accusations 
coincided with the beginning of the large-scale Russian 
operation "Fishing Season." The purpose of the operation is to 
put a stop to the depletion of fish stock in the Far East, 
particularly off the south Kurils, General Andrey Nikolayev, 
supreme commander of the Russian frontier troops, member of the 
Security Council, told ITAR-TASS. 
  He said that in addition to frontier guards and military 
aircraft, ships of the Pacific Fleet participate in the 
operation. 
  The effort to strenthen protection of national interest 
along 
Russia's eastern boundaries proved effective, as shown by 
communiques of the Supreme Command of the Russian frontier 
troops. A stop was put to ostentatious calls of groups of 
Japanese fishing vessels into Russian territorial waters and to 
large-scale poaching. Highly-maneuverable groups of ships 
promptly react to the situation and prevent violations of state 
border. 
  Far from everybody likes the normalisation of the situation 
in the Far East where Russia's neighbours have been permitting 
themselves lapses from the observance of the international norms 
and rules. Certain forces in Japan and in other countries of 
the region do not want the "thawing of glaciers" remaining from 
the past war. To thaw them by business cooperation and 
development of mutually-advantageous economic relations means to 
increase the might of the industrialised Japan and of the 
fabulously rich Russia. Experts believe that this does not suit 
rivals and that new portions of sensations are fed to the media. 
  The world public is aware that Russia does not discharge 
technological waste into the sea the way this is done by many 
other countries, Japan included. But going by publications, 
also in TOKYO SHIMBUN, this is not the matter of radioactive 
waste but that of its being the product of the operation of 
atomic submarines of the Russian Pacific Fleet. This fleet of 
the Russian Navy is seen as a menace in the Pacific and in the 
world ocean. Some circles are ready to go any lengths to 
present an unfavorable picture of the Pacific Fleet. So they 
speculate on economic and technological difficulties of the 
utilisation of waste of atomic submarines.

<F P=106> [Interview with academician Boris Nikolayevich Laskorin, </F>
conducted by Igor Saltykov: "The Living Water Is Close to Death"] 
  [Text] It was not an argument that erupted in the 
academician's office, more like a little seminar on the subject 
of what it is that threatens our survival. Many countries around 
the world are having fits of ecological irresponsibility. The 
extraction of gold, silver, diamonds, rare metals, timber, oil, 
gas and coal is comparable, in terms of the effects of its 
merciless haste, only with the effects of the Ice Age. Fertile 
soils are being impoverished. 
  But the thing that is most tragic in its unnoticed frequency 
is the increasing absence of living water. Water is dying. And 
the death of water turned this seminar into a lecture/interview 
with Russian Academy of Sciences member Boris Nikolayevich 
Laskorin, chairman of the Russian Academy of Sciences Commission 
on the Protection of Natural Waters. 
  Laskorin: It is hard to believe that, of all the 
other natural resources, it is water that is being subjected to 
cruel and harmful effects on the largest scale. Today it seems 
that it is only being protected in wells. Yet it is being 
recklessly poisoned in rivers, in lakes and even in the seas. 
There are many sad examples of this in countries around the 
world. It is embarrassing to talk about the Aral Sea -- it is 
dying. The rivers of Europe and America are being mercilessly 
polluted from source to mouth, and our own Volga River and the 
limitless Siberian rivers are no exception. True, there is no 
way to cover up individual disasters -- massive discharges of 
industrial waste or fecal sludge. Condemnations are issued and 
resolutions adopted -- urgent in name, indefinite in 
implementation. There have been cases not only of bans on 
drinking the polluted liquid, but even swimming in it. But as 
for the day-to-day, implacable degradation of water's living 
qualities, it is not merely forgotten -- no one even notices it. 
  But the time has come to protect living water as if it were 
our greatest treasure. And to begin using it efficiently and 
conservatively at home and in industry. Otherwise no amount of 
doctors or pharmacies will be able to help us. 
  True, traditionally Moscow's water supply has been among the 
most drinkable as measured by world standards. The water 
supplied to the city is fully in compliance with public health 
and technical standards and not only meets but in several cases 
actually exceeds the quality of aqueous "raw material" in many 
large cities in Europe and America. 
  However, I should note that the standard in use around the 
world includes only a few requirements, and excessively general 
ones at that, regarding the quality of water sources for all 
uses. Thus far nowhere do we find clear definitions, and hence 
no implementation, of standards for two basic concepts: 
household water, consumed for purely natural needs -- washing 
people and clothes, washing dishes, etc. -- and drinking water, 
i.e. water that is suitable for internal consumption. 
Furthermore, at this point there is no clear definition of what 
is "drinkable," nor are there any clear-cut standards and 
criteria, and therefore the concept is sometimes interpreted in 
a rather arbitrary fashion, depending on views, needs, funding, 
etc. 
  I am convinced that the time has come to commence objective 
definition of standards and creation of an appropriate state 
standard for drinking water -- water that is, I reiterate, for 
internal consumption. Whereas in Moscow total household water 
consumption is 500-550 liters per capita per day, drinking water 
consumption is only 2-3 liters. It is clear that that much 
consumption does not require a separate water supply. In order 
to ensure the necessary degree of purification, particularly 
under emergency conditions, I would recommend home 
installations, well, not installations, actually individual 
devices that attach to faucets and guarantee high-quality, truly 
drinkable water every time. And in the event of accidents the 
public should be provided with high-quality bottled water. 
  Saltykov: Which is already being sold at sidewalk 
kiosks and in stores. The price of a one-liter bottle is 
R1,500-2,000 [rubles]. Professor Viktor Doyenin has calculated 
that his pay is insufficient to pay for food and transportation, 
and is not even enough for tea and watery soups. Not for his 
whole family. Not even just for himself. 
  Laskorin: That cannot be! Incidentally, we are not 
selling domestically-produced water. This is obviously imported 
water. Yet transportation overhead is sizable just to transport 
water within Moscow, much less from Europe. The same goes for 
the technical expense of purification, which would not justify 
such high prices. If we were to start up production of bottled 
drinking water locally then it would be affordable not only to 
highly-paid segments of the population, but also to pensioners 
and school children. 
  Saltykov: Then allow me to read this November 
ITAR-TASS report: "Jordan has purchased from Russia devices that 
are without parallel anywhere in the world and which allow 
ordinary water to be used for the most unexpected purposes at 
minimal cost. Tap water processed by a miniature electric 
activator becomes a powerful disinfectant and an effective 
medicine for many diseases, all without the addition of any 
chemicals." Prior to this interview I visited about 10 stores 
here in the capital, and no one had ever heard of these 
"activators." 
  Laskorin: That is unscrupulous, misleading 
advertising. Electrochemical processing simply cannot produce 
that quality of water. Unfortunately, even worse "sleight of 
hand" is being practiced. For example, in Moscow drinking water 
is being used in industry for production-related purposes, and 
in large amounts. Such use has repeatedly been banned, but the 
bans are ignored. Furthermore, many Moscow enterprises -- 
industrial ones, not food-service enterprises -- are drilling 
deep wells without any request for permission or authorization 
whatsoever, pumping artesian well water for industrial needs -- 
the delicious, pure, living water that could serve as our most 
affordable drinking water supply. But even for that purpose we 
would have to calculate precisely how much of it we could use so 
as not to deprive our descendants of their inheritance. 
  Saltykov: So where are we going to get drinking 
water? True, just a quarter of a century ago there was talk 
about using Lake Baikal, and there was some discussion about how 
it could share its unique resources with the European part of 
the Soviet Union. 
  Laskorin: Unfortunately, the struggle to keep Lake 
Baikal pure is not over yet. Yet it represents 20 percent of the 
world's supply of very clean water, and 80 percent of the supply 
in the former USSR. Moreover, it has a unique and literally 
inimitable chemical composition. It could be bottled and shipped 
to Moscow even now. The obstacle is the cost of transportation, 
which is rising faster than inflation. 
  Meanwhile the dispute over the use of a major paper combine 
that pollutes Lake Baikal not only continues, but is actually 
heating up. Over the last 25 years the decision to shut it down 
has been made many times. Yet now it has been privatized and 
continues to successfully pollute Lake Baikal "privately." Plus, 
the "Baikal Commission" was established on the quiet and has 
been granted the right to allow private corporations to develop 
the combine, expanding production rather than curtailing it. 
  Saltykov: And so, Boris Nikolayevich, Lake Baikal 
is not accessible and the cost of bottled water is more than a 
majority of Russia's citizens can afford. Does that mean that 
city dwellers -- and perhaps soon Muscovites as well -- are 
going to have to go to the country and drill wells? 
  Laskorin: There is a solution. The drinking water 
that flows to each apartment should receive additional 
purification. The first steps have been taken with the 
manufacture of Rodnik [Spring] individual filtration units. A 
filter of activated silvered charcoal -- the silver used is in 
very small quantities -- kills hordes of bacteria and completely 
removes organic, toxic and carcinogenic substances and heavy 
metals from water. 
  Saltykov: But they are still beyond the reach of a 
majority of the population. In November a household products 
store not far from your institution was selling the Rodnik 
filter for more than R6,000. 
  Laskorin: But what do 10 eggs cost nowadays? On 
our road to a free market we have run into a storm of 
distortions. But even if you take that madness into account, 
right now, in March, a Rodnik should not cost more than R3,000 
in a state-owned store. And the Moscow government might even 
offer a special price to pensioners, students and impoverished 
teachers and instructors at higher educational institutions. 
There is definitely a need for immediate intervention by the 
Ministry of Health as well in order to perfect these little 
devices, approve them and demand that they be produced by 
state-owned industry immediately, even if only by a couple of 
the 2,000 idled defense plants. 
  The things we have discussed are urgent needs. However, so 
as 
not just to prevent death from dead water but also to lay the 
ground for major efforts on the living sources, deputies in the 
Federation Council and the State Duma should quickly draft and 
approve clear-cut state legislation on preservation of natural 
drinking water resources, the inexpensive production of drinking 
water, and the right of our country's citizens not only to land 
but also to clean water. Primary attention should focus on 
children's institutions, maternity homes, hospitals, schools and 
other educational institutions, and pensioners. And we should 
demand that scientists establish a definition of drinking water 
that is understandable to every citizen, every deputy and every 
administrator.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Leonid Vinogradov] </F>
  [Text] Vladivostok, 19 Apr (TASS] -- The liquid 
radioactive waste from Russian Pacific Fleet submarines may be 
dumped in the Sea of Japan, because it can't be disposed of 
otherwise at present. Tankers, anchored at the moorings of 
"Zvezda" works, are filled up to the rim with the waste and 
cannot take new deliveries of the dangerous shipment. This was 
stated today to an ITAR-TASS correspondent by Vladimir 
Ignatenko, the Russian presidential representative in the 
Maritime Kray. 
  He said that the government should have allocated funds for 
building a waste processing installation. However, not a single 
ruble has been earmarked for this purpose as yet. In the 
meantime, one tanker with 794 tonnes of waste on board urgently 
needs repairing. So, one should either stop the works, in order 
to [word indistinct] the already critical mass of the 
radioactive liquid accumulated here, or dump the liquid in the 
sea. But this can't happen unless agreed by the Russian 
president, Vladimir Ignatenko said.

<F P=106> [Article by Natalya Davydova: "The Ministry Responsible for </F>
the Future"] 
  [Text] Under the new Constitution, we all have the right 
to a healthy environment and reliable information on its 
condition. The president's recent message to the Federal 
Assembly "On Strengthening the Russian State" laid special 
emphasis on the duty of all organs of power to create conditions 
conducive to improving the environment. After all, 
environmental safety is an integral part of Russia's national 
security. For a long time our country fought vigorously with 
nature, subjugated it, and transformed it, and now the time has 
come to settle the accounts. We are paying with our health and 
the future of our children. If we were to calculate the 
monetary equivalent, ecologists estimate that our country would 
need fantastic sums of money to bring the environment up to 
Western standards. Many readers write and ask who exactly in 
Russia watches over citizens' constitutional right to clean 
water, air, and soil. The question is more than relevant. 
Everyone has heard of the "Green" movement, "Kedr," and similar 
social organizations, but we also have state structures. How 
many are there, what do they do, and what are their 
responsibilities? We will discuss this under our new rubric, 
"Nature and Power." 
  The Russian Federation now has an established system of 
bodies responsible for environmental protection: a federal 
ministry, territorial subdivisions for the protection and 
rational use of natural resources, and a number of state bodies 
whose functions include monitoring and inspecting the use of 
certain natural resources and pollution of the environment: the 
State Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Supervision; 
committees for land resources and land management, geology and 
the use of mineral resources, fisheries, and water resources; a 
federal service for hydrometeorology and monitoring of the 
environment; and a federal forestry service. 
  A Higher Environmental Council is being formed in the State 
Duma. In addition, a Council for Environmental Policy has been 
set up under the Russian Federation president, and the Russian 
Federation Security Council has an interdepartmental commission 
for environmental safety. The General Prosecutor's Office has a 
department for supervising implementation of environmental 
protection legislation. In fact, there are special subdivisions 
responsible for environmental protection in the organizational 
structures of every branch of power. 
  We will start by acquainting ourselves with the country's 
main environmental department: the Ministry for Protection of 
the Environment and Natural Resources. 
  It enjoys the status of a federal ministry in the structure 
of organs of executive power approved by presidential edict in 
January. However, the work of the ministry, whose objectives 
are incorporated in its name, is not very well known to a broad 
audience. Moreover, the social status of our environmental 
department does not correspond to the status of similar 
structures in Western countries. 
  The structure of the ministry's central apparatus is as 
follows. The leadership forms the upper level. Below are the 
main administrations: environmental expert assessment; mineral 
reserves; science and technology; environmental safety; use of 
natural resources; environmental programs; nature reserves; 
natural biological resources; international cooperation; legal 
normative regulation; financing and development of materials and 
equipment; protection of the atmosphere; protection of the water 
table; the environmental protection maritime service; protection 
of soil and land resources; and protection of the environment 
from industrial and consumer waste. 
A federal environmental fund and a public reception center are 
attached to the ministry. As a whole, the structure of the 
central apparatus corresponds to the main areas of environmental 
protection activity. There are also shortcomings typical of 
state bodies in our country: the organization and 
administration department, for example, whose staff is more than 
double that of far more important subdivisions. I should point 
out for the sake of objectivity, however, that it is proposed to 
improve the ministry's structure. 
  Protection of the environment is one of the main national 
priorities of developed countries, where state environmental 
services have been in operation for decades. In our country, 
however, the environmental department is still in its infancy, 
as the RSFSR State Committee for Nature Protection was set up 
only in 1988; this was later transformed into a ministry, and 
the law "On Protection of the Environment," which is essentially 
the basis of the ministry's activity, came into effect only in 
1992. Our main environmental protection department has 
undergone several reorganizations in the last five years, 
apparently whenever the ministry has been finding its feet and 
starting to monitor monopolistic departments responsible for 
pollution. Clearly, such reorganizations are not conducive to 
resolving environmental problems at state level and prevent the 
environmental protection department from fulfilling its basic 
tasks. 
  The Ministry for Protection of the Environment and Natural 
Resources should be responsible for general coordination of the 
activity of ministries, departments, enterprises, institutions, 
and organizations in the field of protection of the environment 
and natural resources; conduct an integrated science and 
technology policy in this sphere; develop and improve economic, 
legal, and administrative mechanisms for the use of natural 
resources; organize and set in motion state commissions of 
environmental experts; and much more. 
  The ministry has a sufficiently sound research base: Under 
its jurisdiction it has more than 20 institutes and centers, 
whose main function is to form science and technology policy in 
the field of environmental protection. In addition, it can 
enlist the scientific potential of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences and state universities. 
  The ministry draws up specially targeted environmental 
programs. The best known is the federal science and technology 
program entitled "Russia's Environmental Safety," the drafting 
and implementation of which have had strong repercussions in 
environmental circles. Environmental protection problems are 
also reflected in other major programs: "The Revival of the 
Volga," "The Oka -- a Clean River," "Waste," "Conversion -- 
Ecology," "Radon," "Dioxins," and others. 
  First Deputy Minister Professor A.F. Poryadin has 
highlighted 
the following priority areas of the ministry's activity: First, 
it is vital to secure legislative and normative support for 
environmental protection activity and to adopt a complex of laws 
and legally binding acts in this sphere. The law "On Protection 
of the Environment" has undoubtedly played a positive role, but 
it is impossible to improve the environment in Russia without 
the system of environmental legislation that exists in Western 
countries. Second, there must be financial and economic support 
for environmental protection activity, so that the thin, 
constantly interrupted stream of budget funding is augmented by 
resources received on the basis of the principle "there are no 
free natural resources" and "polluters must pay." Finally, 
optimum organizational and structural support based on Russia's 
specific features will have considerable importance for the 
efficiency of all environmental protection activity in our 
country. There is no developed system of organization and 
collaboration between all the structures functioning in the 
environmental protection sphere. There are no clear 
responsibilities, while at the same time, for example, 
territorial environmental protection bodies are subordinate to 
the ministry, on the one hand, and to the local administration, 
on the other. In such cases there is always "confusion and 
hesitation," financial complications, a lack of responsibility, 
and the possibility of arbitrariness. 
  Ecology is part of the economy and politics, so drawing up a 
strategy in the environmental protection sphere is the state's 
prerogative. In this sense, the recent presidential edict "On 
the State Strategy of the Russian Federation To Protect the 
Environment and Ensure Its Stable Development" is more than 
topical. Having said that, it will require colossal efforts -- 
mainly on the part of the Ministry for Protection of the 
Environment and Natural Resources and territorial environmental 
protection bodies -- to achieve a breakthrough in the 
environmental situation in our country. 
  We will continue to acquaint you with various environmental 
protection structures and talk about their work and the problems 
facing them in coming issues.

  [Text] Moscow April 28 TASS -- Russia and Norway have 
decided to cooperate in the building of a burial ground for 
radioactive wastes in Russia's far north and in organising a 
joint expedition to the sites where radioactive wastes have been 
submerged in the northern seas, ITAR-TASS was informed by the 
press service of the Russian Ministry of Ecology on Thursday. 
  Such decisions were the result of talks between Russian 
Minister of Ecology viktor Danilov-Daninlyan and his Norwegian 
counterpart Thorbjorn Berntsen. Also present during the talks 
were representatives from Russia's Atomic and Transportation 
Ministries. 
  Norway also plans to help Russia modernize the 
"Pechenganikel" metallurgical plant and assess the radioactive 
situation around the "Mayak" nuclear enterprise.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Lashch report: "New `Greenpeace' Action. Finnish </F>
Police Break Up Antinuclear Action"] 
  [Excerpts] The international ecological organization 
"Greenpeace" held a protest action yesterday in the Finnish town 
of Loviza (110 km from Helsinki) in connection with the 
impending transporting to Russia of nuclear waste. The same day 
the Moscow branch of "Greenpeace" circulated a statement on the 
illegal nature of transporting nuclear waste from Finland to 
Russia. [passage omitted] 
  Talking to your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent, Dmitriy 
Tolmatskiy of the Moscow branch of "Greenpeace" clarified some 
of the questions on bringing nuclear fuel to Russia. "The 
agreement on cooperation in the area of nuclear power 
engineering of 14 May 1965 between Russia and Finland contains 
not one word to the effect that the radioactive waste of 
processed fuel is supposed to be buried in Russia. The thing is 
that nuclear fuel becomes totally Finland's property the moment 
it crosses the border, and Russia bears no responsibility 
whatever for it. More, commitments on the return of fuel are 
not stipulated in the agreement." Mr. Tolmatskiy also 
underlined that literally every page in the agreement says that 
nuclear materials may only be used for peaceful means whereas 
the "Mayak" combine (the biggest nuclear waste processing 
enterprise) is a military facility which, up to now, has been 
producing weapons-grade plutonium from used nuclear fuel.

<F P=106> [Roald Fedorov article: "What Danger Threatens Us?"] </F>
  [Excerpts] I recalled the stubborn buttercup when I heard 
Doctor of Biological Sciences I.V. Filyushkin's story about the 
effect of various physical and chemical environmental factors on 
living things. The effects of radiation in particular. Igor 
Vasilyevich runs the Biophysics Institute laboratory at the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Health. The work done by I.V. 
Filyushkin's laboratory involves studying the effects of low but 
constant doses on organisms, the mechanisms whereby these doses 
are administered, and also the level of danger involved. 
[passage omitted] 
  An analysis of data accumulated in specialist scientific 
literature has convinced I.V. Filyushkin that nervous health 
disorders similar to those noted in the descendants of those who 
survived the A-bomb hell of Hiroshima and Nagasaki can be caused 
by other nonradiation-induced factors. For example, similar 
aftereffects lie in store for children born to alcohol-abusing 
mothers. A significant increase in the frequency of congenital 
illnesses, first and foremost of the nervous system, and second 
of the immune system -- which show up particularly noticeably in 
children in the form of various types of allergy -- is linked to 
an increase in environmental degradation in industrial cities, 
primarily those where chemical production facilities are 
concentrated. 
  The similarity between the results of radiation and chemical 
exposure has made it easier to construct a theoretical model of 
the phenomenon. This was how the picture looked to Igor 
Vasilyevich: In addition to the cells of the embryo developing 
in the mother's womb, these harmful agents' main targets are the 
embryo's neural, immune, and endocrine systems. These represent 
a kind of "control center" which sends out signals determining 
the growth and specialization of all the organism's cells in 
accordance with its genetically determined development plan. 
But the impact of harmful agents results in the distortion of 
these signals. Cell growth is retarded and certain deviations 
from the genetic plan occur. At this stage, cells which have 
changed their properties send back signals to the "center" 
saying that its commands cannot be carried out. At this point 
internal restructuring of the "center" itself becomes a 
necessity. The endocrine system plays the most significant role 
in the formation of the three regulatory systems -- after all, 
this is the system which is primarily responsible for carrying 
out the organism's genetic development plan. If this system is 
impaired, the nervous and immune systems are more or less 
suppressed from the outset and remain underdeveloped from the 
embryonic stage. This is the cause of the corresponding 
congenital illnesses which occur when intrauterine development 
seemingly reaches a successful conclusion. 
  The truth of I.V. Filyushkin's theoretical model has been 
confirmed by experiments carried out in his laboratory. Small 
but constant doses of radiation applied to pregnant laboratory 
animals and similar doses of other environmentally harmful 
substances -- heavy metal salts and other kinds of toxic 
chemicals contained in food and drinking water, specific 
contaminants in inhaled air, alcohol, and a number of medicines 
-- produced similar effects on the health of these animals' 
young. No externally visible body defects were observed in the 
laboratory animals' offspring. However, a decreased capacity for 
learning was noted in comparison with identical animals born in 
environmentally normal conditions. Their immune defense system 
also turned out to be weaker. 
  I.V. Filyushkin's work offers convincing evidence of the 
similarity and unity of effect of radioactive and chemical 
contaminants on living organisms. Of course, these results 
certainly do not imply that small doses of radiation are 
absolutely harmless. But they are not the only danger 
threatening us nowadays. Other contaminants in our external 
environment, just like our disregard for our own health, can be 
even more dangerous. This is the basic solution to the problem 
of resettling inhabitants of areas that have suffered 
radioactive contamination in some way or other. Before 
resettlement takes place, we should compare the level of 
contamination and the attendant risk factor with the risk of 
moving to other areas designated for resettlement that are clean 
from the point of view of radiation but which may be 
environmentally dangerous in other ways. We should also bear in 
mind that the stresses associated with resettlement and actually 
waiting to be resettled could prove to be even more detrimental 
to health than exposure to small doses of radiation. 
  However, the research that has been conducted so far should 
be regarded merely as the start of a major task. The laboratory 
workers are preparing for this task with soundly based 
scientific research programs in this sphere. But there is no 
money -- for the equipment, the expensive chemical reagents, or 
even to buy and keep laboratory animals. 
  I.V. Filyushkin's research is directly linked to many 
people's health in a number of industrial regions and other 
environmentally degraded areas. Extensive, profound, and 
intensive research is called for. Otherwise.... At this point 
it seems apposite to recall the following lines by Aleksandr 
Blok: "We will be cursed for centuries by our sickly 
descendants."

  [Text] Vladivostok, 17 Apr -- While attention is being 
focused on the Russian Pacific Fleet in connection with the 
dumping of radioactive waste into the Sea of Japan, at least 
four of its decommissioned nuclear submarines are tied to their 
moorings while being in quite a dangerous condition, because it 
is difficult to extract their nuclear fuel due to explosions or 
problems they suffered while they were in service. This was 
learned by a TOKYO SHIMBUN investigation on 17 April. In giving 
warning, a high-ranking Pacific Fleet officer stated, "The 
failure to deal with nuclear submarines that have previously 
suffered accidents is a more serious problem to safety in the 
Sea of Japan than is the dumping of radioactive waste into the 
sea." 
  These nuclear submarines that have suffered accidents or 
difficulties are three E-II class cruise missile submarines 
which have been moored at the Pabrovsk [name as published] base 
near Vladivostok, and one V-I class attack submarine which has 
been moored at the Kamchatskaya base. Between 1979 and 1985, 
all of them suffered difficulties with or explosions of their 
nuclear reactors due to malfunctions of their cooling systems. 
In August 1985, one of them suffered an explosion in its 
nuclear reactor, which killed 10 of its crew, due to a sudden 
rise in the temperature of its cooling water. 
  Decommissioned nuclear submarines usually are scrapped after 
they have been dismantled. However, these four submarines have 
been moored at their bases because it is difficult to remove 
their nuclear fuel because of the fear of large-scale 
radioactive leaks from their nuclear reactors. Although an 
institute of the Russian Defense Ministry is currently studying 
technology for the safe dismantling of nuclear submarines that 
have suffered accidents, the development of this technology has 
been greatly delayed due to the recent financial difficulties. 
Therefore, the outlook for dismantling these nuclear submarines 
is uncertain. 
  The high-ranking Pacific Fleet officer stressed: "Because 
the radioactive waste that is the focal point in the dumping 
issue is very low-level radiation, it causes no actual problems 
to human beings. However, troubles with nuclear submarines that 
have suffered accidents may cause serious problems affecting 
humans." Also, he added, "If we cannot speed up the development 
of new technology for dismantling them through assistance from 
Japan and other nations, this will have serious consequences."

  [Text] Moscow April 25 TASS -- Preliminary marine pollution 
measurements taken from the sites of radioactive waste dumping 
by the former Soviet Union and Japan in the Sea of Japan did not 
reveal any Cesium-137 radioactive level fluctuations. These 
preliminary conclusions were reached at the end of the joint 
Russian-Japanese-South Korean expedition's first stage, which 
was undertaken with the participation of IAEA (International 
Atomic Energy Agency) specailists from March 18 to April 15. 
  The Russian Navy press centre told ITAR-TASS that the tests 
were conducted on board the Russian hydrometeorological 
scientific reasearch ship "Okean" (ocean). The expedition 
helped obtain information about the real radioactivity and 
ecological situation in the areas of radioactive waste dumping 
by the navy of the former Soviet Union and Russia. 
  Detailed analyses of sea water samples, sea bottom 
sediments, 
animal plankton and organisms living on the sea bottom, will be 
carried out in laboratories of Russia, Japan, South Korea and 
IAEA and published as a complete report within one year at the 
end of the expedition.

  [Text] On Saturday in Vladivostok, a Russian-Japanese 
inter-governmental commission concluded the Russian stage of the 
discussions devoted to the search for ways to solve the problem 
of storage and reprocessing of liquid radioactive wastes which 
is very pressing for the Maritime territory today. The work is 
to be continued in Tokyo. On April 24 the joint delegation is 
to go to Japan. 
  In the course of the conference a concept of a complex 
approach to the selection of different means was presented to 
the Japanese party which proposes to the Maritime territory its 
financial and technological assistance to solve the problem of 
storage and utilization of liquid radioactive wastes. 
  It was proposed to urgently start construction of a complex 
of surface stationary storage facilities for liquid radioactive 
wastes with the capacity 2000 cubic meters on the coast of the 
cape of Sysoyev which would have all necessary systems and 
mechanisms to prevent leakage of liquid radioactive wastes from 
the tankers TNT. 
  The second stage, namely designing and construction of an 
autonomous mobile floating complex to reprocess liquid 
radioactive wastes available and being generated in the Maritime 
territory (which can be dumped into the open sea), is to be 
implemented simultaneously. 
  As head of the Russian delegation Nikolay Yegorov, Russia's 
deputy Atomic Energy Minister and co-chairman of the 
Russian-Japanese committee on nuclear disarmament, underlined, 
the developed approach to the problem of liquid radioactive 
wastes in the Maritime territory expresses a single opinion of 
the Russian party and is proposed as the most acceptable variant 
in case the Japanese party finances the planned works.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Kuznetsov, former inspectorate chief of </F>
the Russian Federal Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Safety 
Central District, with introduction by LITERATURNAYA GAZETA 
special correspondent Kirill Belyaninov, published under the 
heading "Russia May Turn Into a Chernobyl": "Nuclear Power 
Industry Through the Eyes of an Unemployed Nuclear Oversight 
Inspector"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  A Peaceful Atom for Every Home: Alas, This We Have Already </H5>
Achieved 
  I am sick and tired of it all. Of endless competition in the 
speed of printing documents fabricated by one political group in 
order to destroy another; of careful calculation of the arc of 
fire at the headquarters of hostile political groupings and 
pocket-size parties; the national pastime of watching the state 
of the liver of the also nationally elected president and of 
bringing in astrologers to tell us the dates and details of 
future coups. In the endless flak of arguments about how to 
conduct another revolution, we have somehow forgotten that there 
are far more real problems. 
  We have forgotten that in the Far East "friends and business 
partners" from North and South Korea will soon leave 
nothing--not even stumps--in centuries-old taiga; that 150 
companies from America and West Europe are flooding the country 
with toxic waste in exchange for Russian metal; and that, 
finally, because of our own negligence and indifference the 
threat of a new Chernobyl has become far more real than the 
threat of a coup. 
  I am sick and tired of it, because dozens of LITERATURNAYA 
GAZETA materials--and we wrote about it all: the "black market" 
in nuclear materials, the Western radioactive waste coming into 
our country, the catastrophic situation in the domestic nuclear 
power generation--did not elicit any response from our own 
government circles, which are busier attempting to reposition 
themselves in the shadow of the ruling chair. 
  I am sick and tired of it because the almost two-year-long 
struggle of Vladimir Kuznetsov, former Gosatomnadzor [Russian 
Federal Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Safety] inspector, 
fired for his attempt to shut down 10 unsafe nuclear reactors, 
has not produced any results. Among the people he appealed to 
are the first persons in the Russian "ecological" establishment: 
presidential adviser A. Yablokov; Social-Ecological Union 
Chairman S. Zabelin... None of them supported Kuznetsov, while 
the truly horrible information he collected is still gathering 
dust in the safes of highest-level offices. 
  You need facts? There are many of them in the article V. 
Kuznetsov brought to the newspaper. Judge for yourself whether 
coup rumors are more important than something that affects our 
life. 
<H5>  Russia May Turn Into a Chernobyl </H5>
  Last year I had an honor my "colleagues" in the line at the 
employment agency could only dream about. Can you imagine an 
unemployed American being is invited as a consultant to the U.S. 
Senate, let alone the White House? Nevertheless, anything can 
happen in Russia, and an officially registered unemployed 
Russian may work for an equally official presidential adviser. 
There are numerous advantages to this method: If the finished 
report attracts the "highest attention," there is no need to 
introduce the author, who has not gained any status in the 
nomenklatura; in the event of failure, however, one may resort 
to a tried and tested remark: "Well, you know, we have to use 
the services of questionable characters, but after all, we do 
not get any support from ministries and agencies...." 
  This in itself would not be too bad--one can swallow 
personal 
insult if the information you collected literally crumb by crumb 
did indeed bring about at least some result. But time goes on, 
and nothing changes. Presidential advisers shove the material 
you prepared to the back of the desk drawer; ecological 
organizations of the Social-Ecological Union and Physicians of 
the World for Prevention of Nuclear War type shrug their 
shoulders helplessly; and ministerial bureaucrats simply dismiss 
the facts and figures they are shown. 
  It is easy to understand the reason for such attitudes. All 
the reports and memoranda are devoted to the activities of only 
one, albeit very impressive agency--the Russian Minatom 
[Ministry of Atomic Energy], which has always held the status of 
"sacred cow" in domestic industry. Nevertheless, let us try to 
sort out what is hidden behind the polished sign of the 
omnipotent ministry. 
  Radioactive waste disposal is perhaps one of the items at 
the 
top of the list of Russian ecological problems. 
  Existing capacities simply are insufficient, and the size 
and 
safety of storage facilities are limited, while construction of 
new ones involves immense expenditures of technical and monetary 
resources. At the same time, existing plans for dismantling 
nuclear arms and nuclear power generation systems far from 
always comply with the ability to safely store the resulting 
radioactive waste. At the end of 1992 the total area of 
contaminated land amounted to 52,263 hectares. Of them, 16 were 
recultivated over the year. According to official data of the 
Ministry of the Ecology alone, Russian Minatom enterprises have 
accumulated radioactive waste with a total emission power of 1.7 
billion curies, which are kept in 227 storage facilities, and of 
these, 81 have already been sealed. 
  If only the problem were limited to the number of storage 
facilities, though! At some enterprises the waste is kept in the 
open; most solid radioactive waste disposal sites do not meet 
elementary safety standards. And the system of handling solid 
radioactive waste in our country not only does not meet IAEA 
[International Atomic Energy Agency] standards but is contrary 
to the practice of developed countries. 
  The problems of enterprises whose names have been mentioned 
in the world press for many years--Mayak Production Association 
(Chelyabinsk-65) and Siberian Chemical Combine (Tomsk-7)--still 
have not been resolved. 
  In 1992 the maximum allowable discharge of strontium-90 at 
Mayak was exceeded by a factor of 1.8. The waste was dumped into 
the Techa river. At the same time, at the Siberian Chemical 
Combine norms of discharge of phosphorus-32 were exceeded by a 
factor of 1.14. The average annual concentration of this 
radionuclide in the Tom river was 2.9 times higher than the 
allowable level. 
  In 1993 serious accidents involving radiation occurred at 
both enterprises. Serious and very representative commissions 
visited the sites; tonnes of papers were written, but no 
particular conclusions were drawn from the events. Suffice it to 
mention that the already approved program of replacing equipment 
presenting nuclear danger at these enterprises is still not 
being implemented. 
  This, however, is just a concrete case involving only two 
nuclear facilities. Of much greater interest is something else: 
In February of this year the Russian Gosatomnadzor, known in the 
past for the extreme caution of its statements, suddenly 
subjected the state of the Russian nuclear complex to sharp 
criticism. Inspection of practically all domestic nuclear 
installations showed that "the state of nuclear and radiation 
safety in the Russian Federation as a whole cannot be called 
satisfactory. Numerous problems associated with the use of 
nuclear energy are being resolved extremely slowly and are not 
regulated by law..." 
  After such a serious statement, however, which for the first 
time indicated a split between Minatom and Gosatomnadzor, 
information came out which at first glance completely refuted 
the Federal Oversight's conclusions. The Rosenergoatom concern's 
vice president, B. Antonov, representing the main user 
organization, said that on the contrary, the safety of Russian 
AES's [nuclear power stations] has increased: There were 45 
fewer incidents at stations in 1993 than in 1992. 
  For a specialist this is a strange argument, to say the 
least. The decline in the number of incidents is not at all an 
indicator of AES safety. Last year a considerable number of 
AES's were operating at reduced capacity. This happened because 
of the considerably greater length of the repair season at power 
generators of all stations: electric power consumers simply did 
not pay their bills on time, and the AES's did not have the 
money to buy materials and component parts in the needed 
quantities. 
  In addition, controller-imposed restrictions on capacities 
(up to 23.9 percent, plus the restrictions introduced by the 
Federal Oversight--26.1 percent of the rated level) together 
produce a figure equal to a 50 percent loss in power generation 
output. The figures above confirm not only the thesis of 
Rosenergoatom's imperfect--to put it mildly--calculations and 
the resulting conclusion regarding the increased safety of the 
AES's, but also bring up a no less important question: Can it be 
that electric power produced by AES's at the old level of output 
is not needed by the Russian economy, which constantly complains 
about energy shortages? And what has caused these restrictions 
if, in the opinion of Minatom bureaucrats, everything is going 
so well in their industry? 
  Somehow, the No. 2 and No. 3 generators at the Balakovo 
station and the No. 5 Generator at the Novovoronezh station, 
which had been under long-term repair, as well as Balakovo's No. 
4 generator, which was recently brought on line, have 
disappeared from the list of AES's to be inspected. According to 
the results of last year, it was these stations' power 
generators, as well as those at the Kola AES, that were found to 
be the worst in terms of reliability and stability of operation. 
  In June 1993 a "medium-gravity incident" was registered at 
the No. 2 generator at the Balakovo AES--jamming of 11 
regulation devices in the control and protection system; at the 
Novovoronezh AES No. 5 generator in February last year there was 
an incident classified as "insignificant:" the water-chemical 
condition was off balance. At the Kola AES the incident was far 
more serious: As a result of a hurricane, high-voltage lines in 
the Kolenergo system were damaged, which resulted in the 
shutdown of all four of the stations' power generators. 
  As to work on increasing AES safety, this is not even on the 
agenda at this point. Actions in replacing technical channels at 
RBMK [high-power pressurized tube reactor] power generators and 
steam generators at power generators with VVER [water-moderated 
power reactor] reactors do not increase safety as compared to 
the design level--they only remove design faults discovered in 
the process of exploitation. Technical substantiation of safety 
factors at most power generators is still at the stage of 
development; there is no systematic substantiation of planned 
measures with respect to power generators' technical 
retrofitting and modernization. As to exploitation of all 
nuclear reactors and systems without exception, it is still 
being conducted in accordance with safety norms developed at the 
time they were built--that is, 15-20 years ago--and today does 
not even come close to modern standards. As to Minatom's 
contention that an IAEA commission that visited most AES's 
appraised their safety condition as satisfactory, this is no 
guarantee. The conclusions of various IAEA commissions are of a 
purely advisory nature and are not mandatory for compliance. 
  Nothing has changed since then, and our power generation 
industry is still ruled by the kilowatt-hour, not by safety. 
  Speaking of research nuclear installations, the situation 
with respect to them is even more difficult than that with 
nuclear reactors. The reason is not only the extreme 
obsolescence and physical wear and tear of the equipment and 
technological systems, but also the absence of practically any 
norms and safety systems. There is no normative-technical 
documentation; there is no statewide program of utilization of 
research systems, which would allow a definition of the 
necessary volume of work on these systems; there is no system 
for localizing accidents, and no simulator facility for 
personnel training. 
  The situation with respect to spent nuclear fuel at 
scientific research centers that use nuclear reactors is 
critical. In the NII [scientific research institute] of Atomic 
Reactors in Ulyanovsk Oblast, in the Physics and Energy 
Institute in Kaluga Oblast, and in the Kurchatov Institute in 
Moscow, facilities for storage of spent nuclear fuel are filled 
to 80-90 percent of capacity, while the technology for 
reprocessing it simply does not exist. 
  The practice of liquid radioactive waste disposal in the NII 
of Atomic Reactors simply does not have any analogues. Medium- 
and low-activity waste in Ulyanovsk Oblast is simply pumped 
underground into so-called "absorbing collector beds." As a 
result, more than 2 million cubic meters of waste with a total 
activity of 100,000 curies have already accumulated in 
underground storage. By law, however, waste disposal can be done 
only after it is "converted into solid explosion-, fire- and 
nuclear-proof form." In other words, waste must be converted 
into a form that ensures its reliable isolation in a geological 
medium. 
  Fifty years of operations of the Russian scientific center 
Kurchatov Institute produced an extremely difficult problem 
associated with rehabilitation of land set aside for temporary 
storage, and taking off line obsolete research systems. At the 
territory of the institute, which is located in the heart of the 
city of 9 million inhabitants, temporary storage--which, by the 
way, has remained "temporary" since the time it was built in the 
1940's--occupies an area of two hectares. It is estimated that 
it contains more than 200 tonnes of highly radioactive waste. 
  Normative documents, which have been at the development 
stage 
since 1989--nuclear safety rules for research reactors and many 
others--will not come out any time soon. The explanation is 
simple: The Kurchatov Institute is the leading scientific 
organization with respect to almost all Russian research 
reactors, and it is apparently not in its interests to introduce 
stricter safety regulations. This will require considerable 
financial investment and bringing the system to the required 
level or shutting it down. 
  The shortcoming and problems I have enumerated involve the 
activities of only one agency--the Russian Ministry of Atomic 
Energy, as well as of the structures it has set up. But even in 
the new political environment the methods Minatom utilizes for 
solving its problems remain the same old ones. As in the past, 
the atomic industry is trying to "twist the government's arm." 
Otherwise how can one explain the clamor recently raised by this 
agency in the press? (A good dozen newspapers published the 
outcry that nuclear stations are running out of fuel during the 
peak period of fall-winter demand, and soon nearly half of 
Russia will be without heat and light unless a number of 
decisive steps are immediately taken.) But the answer to this 
question is not that complicated: Having bungled things up once 
again, Minister V. Mikhaylov is trying to cover it up by 
grabbing a juicier chunk of state subsidies. It is no secret to 
anyone that both enterprises producing nuclear fuel and nuclear 
power stations are under the roof of one and the same agency, 
and therefore what we have is obviously an elementary 
miscalculation. Neither does Minatom's panicky tone fit with the 
recently signed agreement to sell nuclear fuel to the United 
States. If we cannot provide for ourselves, how can we talk 
about selling it to other countries? 
  Nothing will change unless in the nearest future a package 
of 
legislative acts is adopted on the use of nuclear power 
generation, and a state safety program is drafted and backed up 
by priority financing. 
  Without this first step, nothing will change. And who knows, 
perhaps in just another 10 years Russia will turn into a huge 
Chernobyl zone.

Purity of Seas"] 
  [Text] As has become known from informed sources, Russia's 
Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of Environmental Protection 
and Natural Resources have forwarded to Premier Viktor 
Chernomyrdin a joint statement speaking of the need to resolve 
as soon as possible the problem of liquid radioactive waste in 
the Far East. In order to prevent yet more radioactive dumping 
in the Far Eastern seas, the document suggests that radioactive 
waste processing units be urgently manufactured and delivered to 
the Far East. It is suggested that 5 billion rubles from the 
government's reserve fund be set aside to support these and 
other urgent measures.

<F P=106> [Bjorn Lindahl report: "Russian Nuclear Waste Worries </F>
Norway"] 
  [Text] Oslo -- While a group of Norwegian politicians were 
visiting Russia's Polyarnyye Zori nuclear power station on the 
Kola Peninsula on 5 March a group of technicians rushed in and 
began to screw down the top of one of the reactors. Only a 
month later did the members of the Environment Committee hear 
that there had been a leak of radioactive water. 
  A growing number of worrying aspects of the way Russia 
handles its nuclear reactors and nuclear waste on the Kola 
Peninsula are coming to light in similar ways. 
  "The more we look into the problem of nuclear waste on the 
Kola Peninsula, the more we have come to realize how enormous is 
the cleanup operation that must be carried out and how small a 
role Norway can actually play. An international mobilization is 
needed to solve the problems." 
  So said Norwegian Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore Godal who also 
wants a more dramatic appeal to public opinion. Norway is 
trying to get the rest of the world to take an interest in what 
is happening on the Kola Peninsula which, because it is far from 
the centers of population in Europe, is not being given priority 
in the international work on the environment. 
  As part of this work a Norwegian public report has been 
written on nuclear safety and chemical weapons on the Kola 
Peninsula. The problem can be summarized as follows: 
  -- There are 150 nuclear-powered military vessels in the 
Northern Fleet, the majority with two nuclear reactors on board. 
Some 50 of these have already been phased out, but only on a few 
has the spent and highly radioactive nuclear fuel been removed 
from the reactors. 
  -- There are eight nuclear-powered icebreakers which have 
nowhere to store their nuclear waste. This is therefore being 
stored on board the ships which are docked in major population 
centers. 
  -- Safety at the Russian nuclear power stations is poor. On 
the Kola Peninsula two of the four reactors are of the so-called 
VVER [light water reactor] type. This type of reactor has been 
classified as a high-risk reactor by Western experts. 
  -- Russia has dumped nuclear waste and whole reactors in 
several locations in the Barents Sea. The sunken and damaged 
submarine, Komsomolets, is also on the sea bed off Bear Island. 
  -- Novaya Zemlya is today Russia's only test site for 
nuclear 
weapons. 
  -- According to international disarmament agreements Russia 
must destroy a large part of its chemical and nuclear arms. 
This is an operation which could have major environmental 
consequences if it is not carried out in a manner which ensures 
safety. 
  The Norwegian foreign minister is unable to give any figure 
for how much it will cost to make existing reactors safe, build 
dumps, and clean up after past emissions. 
  "The figure is in any case so large that a Norwegian 
national 
budget would not go far," he said. 
  The report estimates the cost of breaking up the 90 
submarines which are expected to be ready for scrapping in 1998 
at 18 billion kronor. In addition money will be needed to build 
installations to receive, treat, and store the nuclear waste. 
According to information from the Russian authorities, the 
Northern Fleet's storage facility for radioactive waste in Lista 
Fjord is almost full. If this is true, this is a serious 
problem, the report states. Long-term storage alone for the 
reactor sections from the 60 submarines which have been phased 
out requires 40,000 cubic meters of storage space. 
  So far the Norwegian Government has not given more than 36 
million kronor to various environmental projects on the Kola 
Peninsula -- and 20 million of these went to improvements to 
safety at the Murmansk nuclear power station. 
  "This is not a reflection of our level of ambition. Our 
contributions and those of others must be increased many times 
over," he said. 
  In the last two years the Norwegian and Russian authorities 
have mounted two joint expeditions to measure radioactivity in 
the Barents and Kara seas. A third expedition, to the Abrosimov 
Bay on Novaya Zemlya, will now be undertaken after a long period 
in which the Russian authorities refused to grant permission. 
  The investigations carried out so far show, however, that 
radiation in the Barents Sea is very low. It is half the level 
in the North Sea and the level in the Baltic is 18 times higher. 
  The report nevertheless expresses concern that radioactivity 
will leak out from the underground tests that have been carried 
out on Novaya Zemlya. A satellite study which the Norwegian 
Foreign Policy Institute has carried out has shown three craters 
between 75 and 250 meters in diameter left by explosions and in 
another location a whole valley has collapsed. 
  Internal developments in the Soviet Union and later in 
Russia 
have led to greater openness about and more attention being paid 
to the country's environmental problems. But developments have 
also made it more difficult to solve major national problems. 
The economic and political situation is unstable and it is more 
difficult to reach agreement on what priorities are to be 
adopted. The report's depressing conclusion is that not even 
with comprehensive international efforts can any rapid solution 
to these problems be expected.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Bayduzhiy: "Safety: Radiation </F>
Disaster in Norwegian Sea Is Almost Inevitable; Departmental 
Muddle Causing Country To Lose Last Chance To Make 
Nuclear-Powered Submarine Komsomolets Safe"] 
  [Text] In a few days, on April 7, it will be exactly five 
years since the loss of the submarine Komsomolets and 42 of its 
crewmen in the Norwegian Sea. As the tragedy recedes into the 
past, it no longer evokes such keen interest. And this can 
easily be explained: In the time since the Komsomolets went 
down, Russians have witnessed a sizable number of disasters and 
accidents. 
  A brief surge in attention to the Komsomolets problem 
occurred in September 1993, when the fourth expedition to study 
the site where the submarine sunk returned from the Norwegian 
Sea. Its findings were extremely alarming. Using the Mir-1 and 
Mir-2 deep-sea units, it was able to ascertain that the casings 
of two of the Komsomolets's nuclear torpedoes had been almost 
completely eaten away by rust and that they would leak plutonium 
far more quickly that had been expected. The expedition gave 
late 1994 as the most likely date. 
  Despite such bleak forecasts, however, the specialists 
studying the Komsomolets problem were confident that a radiation 
disaster could nonetheless be prevented. They had rather 
compelling grounds for optimism. A Committee for Special 
Underwater Operations (CSUO) was created to coordinate all 
efforts in this area, and a project was devised for sealing the 
submarine and its nuclear cargo right on the seafloor using a 
special substance known as khitozan, which has high sorption 
properties. Repairs on the research vessel Akademik Keldysh were 
completed in Germany, the Mir units underwent repairs in 
Finland, and contracts began being concluded with Russian 
enterprises for deliveries of equipment. In addition, CSUO chief 
Tengiz Borisov managed to do the almost impossible: Financing 
for all operations involving the Komsomolets was included in the 
state order. Preparations for the main operation, scheduled for 
June through August 1994, went into full swing. 
  But the overconfident CSUO officials failed to take one 
thing 
into account. Departmental muddle and bureaucratic ambitions in 
Russia can be far more terrible than any natural disaster or 
technical difficulty. And these two "natural calamities" have 
posed an insurmountable obstacle to solving the Komsomolets 
problem. The CSUO was abolished on January 10, 1994, in 
connection with the establishment of the Russian Federation 
Ministry for Emergencies, and its functions were transferred to 
one of the new structure's administrations. As is often the 
case, the changes took considerable time, during which 
preparations for the expedition itself had to be forgotten. 
While the expedition was the only "headache" for the CSUO, for 
the leadership of the Ministry for Emergencies, with all its 
other concerns, solving problems relating to a submarine on the 
bottom of the faraway Norwegian Sea proved by no means a top 
priority, something that was quick to have negative consequences. 
  In early 1994 the plan for sealing the Komsomolets was 
approved by a session of the Security Council's 
interdepartmental commission on environmental safety (better 
known as Aleksey Yablokov's commission) and forwarded to the 
Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection for expert 
environmental review. However, the fact that the project had 
lost its sponsor led to a situation in which there was no one to 
"push" it, and processing of the document at various levels 
slowed sharply. The first session of the expert environmental 
review group was held only on March 22. Instead of assessing the 
environmental danger or, on the contrary, the dangers of the 
sealing project, the council's members opened a new discussion 
of the operation's expediency per se and other possible options 
for rendering the Komsomolets harmless. The commission promises 
to present its conclusions only by May 25. By that time it 
simply won't make any sense to evaluate anything: Even if the 
recommendation is a positive one, the expedition will no longer 
be able to put out to sea. Preparations for it will take at 
least two to three months, and without the expert environmental 
assessment no financing of expedition-related operations can 
begin. 
  A radiation disaster in the Norwegian Sea is exceedingly 
probable. The countdown is no longer in months or weeks but 
days. Meanwhile, a lack of interest in accelerating efforts to 
prevent it is being shown by not only the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, but 
also by the Ministry for Emergencies. And while one can still 
understand the unhurried actions of the Ministry of 
Environmental Protection, the position of the department that 
now bears full responsibility for the Komsomolets's fate seems 
inexplicable, at first glance. However, the paradox has a simple 
explanation: The leadership of the Ministry for Emergencies has 
all but the greatest interest in scuttling the expedition to the 
shipwreck site! 
  If the Akademik Keldysh, with the Mir units aboard, does put 
out to sea all the same and the operation, God forbid, collapses 
at sea, full blame for the collapse will rest with incompetent 
ministry officials who were unable to think through all the 
details. And that such an outcome cannot be ruled out is borne 
out by several facts. Sergey Khetagurov, former chairman of the 
North Ossetian Council of Ministers, who switched chairs to 
become deputy minister for emergencies, has been put in charge 
of all measures relating to the Komsomolets. What can an 
official who lost an election in a completely landlocked 
republic know about underwater operations? On the other hand, 
three months after the creation of the ministry administration 
in charge of the Komsomolets problem, it has just one 
member--Reserve Rear Admiral Mikhail Tolokonnikov, former deputy 
chief of the old CSUO. But even that specialist was recently 
deprived of his governmental communications link and moved into 
an office with a single city telephone. If the expedition to the 
Komsomolets collapses, ministry officials will be able to blame 
the mistakes and muddling within their own ministry on seemingly 
objective difficulties caused by the delay in obtaining expert 
environmental review and the lack of financing. And so 
departmental interests have proved stronger than the national 
interest. 
  Meanwhile, the problem of making the Komsomolets safe has 
taken on a new, international aspect. It is no secret that 
sizable financial resources are being enlisted for this; having 
caught the scent of money, representatives of the most diverse 
organizations, pursuing their own interests, are descending on 
Russia like moths to light. One such organization is the 
Komsomolets Memorial Foundation, which was created in Holland 
and has announced to the entire world that it is raising funds 
to raise the submarine. In 1993 the foundation managed to raise 
about $140,000. To properly assess this amount, it must be said 
that Russia itself spent an incomparably greater sum--$4 million 
and 1 billion rubles--on operations relating to the Komsomolets 
in that same year alone. But not even all of the money collected 
by the foundation reached Russia in the form of purchased 
computers; part of it stayed behind in Holland. 
  Still, one could only welcome such assistance from a private 
organization--especially considering that the foundation 
promises to make available a further 2 million guilder (just 
over $1 million) in 1994--were it not for the fact that its 
outwardly selfless actions conceal other, far less altruistic 
considerations. Provision of the funds--which, incidentally, the 
Dutch government, not the foundation itself, intends to provide 
as aid to Russia--is contingent on a number of conditions, chief 
of which is that the Dutch firms Smith and Heerem [Kheyerem] be 
hired as the main contractors in operations involving the 
Komsomolets. They are both part of a Dutch consortium that 
carries out underwater operations. In other words, the 
foundation has assumed the role of lobbyist for Dutch interests 
in matters relating to the Russian submarine. However, that is 
not the end of the problems. In the final analysis, in order to 
avert an environmental disaster, we could sacrifice the 
interests of Russian industrialists. Were it not for one "but." 
Hiring for the project Dutch firms that do not have deep-water 
units at their disposal but do own hoisting cranes will most 
likely lead to a fundamental revision of the entire plan of 
action and to replacement of the plan to seal the submarine with 
a plan to raise it. In that case, it will no longer be possible 
to mount an expedition to the Norwegian Sea this season, and an 
environmental disaster will become almost inevitable. In the 
summer of 1995, there will be an underwater Chernobyl at the 
Komsomolets site: By that time the submarine's torpedoes will be 
destroyed completely, and no one and nothing will be able to 
stop plutonium-239 from leaking out. 
  In experts' opinion, the consequences of the impending 
catastrophe will be very grave. The section of the ocean where 
the submarine lies is one of the most productive, accounting for 
80 percent of all fish taken from the Norwegian Sea. The losses 
to Russia from reduced catches alone, as well as from fines paid 
to other countries, above all Norway, will amount to hundreds of 
millions of dollars a year. In addition, rather large suspended 
radioactive particles that can be transported by currents were 
found at the Komsomolets site in August 1993. In the event of 
massive plutonium discharges that will continue for several 
years, the strong underwater currents in the region, which reach 
speeds of 1.5 meters per second and change direction several 
times a day, will lead to the rapid contamination of several 
thousand square kilometers of seafloor. Considering that the 
half-life of plutonium is 24,000 years, the sea in that region 
will be closed to fishing for 600 to 700 years.

<F P=106> [Article by Svetlana Konstantinova: "Caspian Awaits Its </F>
Fate; Hopes Pinned on Nature's Favors"] 
  [Text] Four cities and 109 rural communities that are home 
to 197,000 people are in danger of being inundated by the 
Caspian Sea. The total land area that could be submerged is 
1,072,000 hectares, 473,000 of which are farmland. The projected 
direct economic loss in 1991 prices is 17.2 billion rubles. 
  There have been six major fluctuations of five to 10 meters 
in the Caspian's level in our era. Each one has devastated 
populated coastal areas and caused the destruction of many 
points of civilization. Specialists believe that global climatic 
changes largely determine water levels in the Caspian Sea. For 
example, while for nearly a century, from 1837 to 1933, the 
sea's level fluctuated insignificantly within a range of -25.3 
to -26.5 meters, from 1933 to 1977 its level dropped by 290 
centimeters, from -26.1 to -29 meters. Beginning in 1978 the 
Caspian's level began rising an average of 13 centimeters per 
year, for a total to date of 212 centimeters (-26.9 meters). The 
trend toward rising water levels remains stable. It cannot be 
ruled out that the sea's level will reach its critical mark of 
-25 meters in the next 15 to 20 years. 
  Meanwhile, the ecological, sanitary-epidemiological, and 
medical-biological situation in the Caspian's coastal areas 
continues to deteriorate. Surface and subsurface waters are 
polluted with toxic substances and petroleum products, soil 
salinization is progressing, and infectious diseases and 
outbreaks of skin ailments and allergies are occurring over a 
widening area. Incidentally, this is confirmed by geochemical 
studies of soils, bottom sediments, and surface and subsurface 
waters in coastal cities; their findings have revealed the 
presence of toxic substances in concentrations that are tens of 
times in excess of the maximum allowable levels. Despite an 
unending series of acts and decrees adopted at various levels 
and apparently intended to save the territory from the "deluge," 
ecological conditions in the region are viewed as critical. 
  A federal program for the Caspian, spanning the period up to 
2000, was drawn up in 1993. Researchers at institutes of the 
Russian Academy of Sciences, the Russian state meteorological 
service, the Russian Ministry of Economics, Moscow State 
University, and other leading research and design organizations 
were involved in drafting the program. It must be said that all 
the attempts made to prevent an ecological disaster during a 
three-year period were hindered by inadequate appropriations 
from the state budget and their use for other than the intended 
purposes. Russian Federation government decree No. 37 of January 
19, 1993, set financing sources and volumes for various 
measures; they provide for capital investments of 1,021.45 
million rubles (in 1991 prices) in 1993-1995. The clients were 
executive government agencies of Federation constituent members. 
According to the Russian Ministry of Finance, the following 
amounts of the established ceilings had actually been allocated 
as of January 1, 1994: to Dagestan, 65 percent; to Kalmykia, 49 
percent, and to Astrakhan Oblast, 72 percent. Of these sums, the 
following amounts were expended on urgent measures: by Dagestan, 
75 percent, by Kalmykia, 36 percent, and by Astrakhan Oblast, 25 
percent. 
  The studies' findings allow one to conclude that the level 
of 
the sea will continue to rise up to 2005 to 2010. Scientists 
currently disagree on whether the rate of the rise will stay 
within the range observed in previous years (an average of 13 
centimeters per year) and reach the point of -25 by 2005 to 2010 
or whether it will slow. However, the second scenario is more 
likely, given increased evaporation rates and additional outflow 
from the Caspian Sea into the Kara-Bogaz-Gol Gulf and undrained 
depressions on the territory of Kazakhstan. 
  A promised federal program for solving social, economic, and 
environmental problems relating to the rising level of the 
Caspian was not submitted to the Russian State Construction 
Committee for consideration in January of this year. "Since the 
program is lacking," said State Construction Committee spokesman 
Timashev, "it is wrong to promote any particular hypothesis 
(effluent balance) to the detriment of others, such as the 
geotectonic hypothesis." Mr. Timashev is convinced that such 
"promotion" would overshadow the main issue--the need to 
accelerate efforts to protect the cities and communities. 
  It is hardly appropriate in this situation to speak of the 
adoption of any sort of "urgent measures." There remains, 
contrary to Michurin's well-known saying, to pin our hopes on 
nature's favors.

<F P=106> [Environmental Protection Minister Viktor Danilov-Danilyan </F>
interviewed by Dmitriy Frolov: "Viktor Danilov-Danilyan: I See 
No Grounds for Pessimism"] 
  [Text] Viktor Ivanovich 
Danilov-Danilyan became Minister of Environmental Protection and 
Natural Resources in 1991, immediately after the Soviet Union's 
breakup. SEGODNYA has already reported about the book the 
minister helped write, a book that sets forth a new 
environmental concept for Russia. The concept is based on 
avoiding environmental crimes characteristic of nascent 
capitalism and preserving the natural reserve we inherited from 
the centralized administrative system. A golden mean is always 
desirable but almost never attainable in practice. By contrast, 
the idea of a special Russian path seems forever popular. 
  Frolov: Viktor Ivanovich, can it be that the idea 
of a so-called unique Russian path is attractive to 
environmentalists as well? 
  Danilov-Danilyan: I am absolutely against viewing 
Russia as an exclusive country, in any case in the sense of its 
searching for ways to harmonious coexist with its own nature. 
Everybody has to review approaches of protecting the 
environment--the United States, Europe, Japan, third-world 
countries. Russia's uniqueness consists in that virtually 
one-third of its territory has never been subject to economic 
influences. We are confronted with special problems from the 
standpoint of protecting it, but we will have to solve them. In 
doing so, we should by no means pit ourselves against the rest 
of the world. On the contrary, we must integrate our own efforts 
into the environmental protection efforts of mankind. The Rome 
Club's famous slogan urging people to think globally but act 
locally has become obsolete to a significant extent. In any 
case, there is not a single post-industrial country that has not 
already used this path. Nevertheless, pressures on the biosphere 
continue to mount. 
  Frolov: Why is it that in Russia, with its 
devil-may-care attitude toward the environment, to put it 
crudely, the situation is not as disastrous as commonly thought? 
  Danilov-Danilyan: We are saved only by the 
circumstance that Russia occupies 12.5 percent of the world's 
land mass, while just 2.5 percent of the world's population 
lives on its territory. Meanwhile, Russia's "contribution" to 
the pollutants produced throughout the world is 10 percent, 
which is four times greater than average indices. If other 
countries allowed themselves to do the same, the Earth could not 
withstand it. It is very fashionable to talk about geopolitics 
these days, but most of those who discuss this topic do not 
realize that this in particular is its chief aspect. 
  Frolov: It is equally fashionable to say today the 
Russian population is declining. Wouldn't the reverse process be 
an even greater problem, considering the harm we have caused to 
the environment, and consequently to ourselves? 
  Danilov-Danilyan: Rutskoy and Khasbulatov also 
talked about "genocide" and said the blame for it rested with 
the Gaydar government. Such ignorance may be excusable for a 
military man, but for a doctor of economics? Rejection of the 
principle of high birth rates occurred in the 1920s and 1930s. 
What is happening today was, if not 100 percent, then 90 percent 
foreordained by the preceding development of demographic 
processes. 
  Traditional perceptions of a favorable or unfavorable 
demographic situation are flawed from an ecological standpoint. 
We are now confronted with the need to take into account the 
factor of relative overpopulation. It is not enough to simply 
look at the ratio of the able-bodied to non-able-bodied 
population; we must take into account the possibility of higher 
productivity on the part of the able-bodied segment of society, 
something that will be able to support more "dependents." 
  Our problem is that Russia, while experiencing relative 
overpopulation as expressed in overconsumption of resources, 
does not have an efficient economy or efficient production. 
  Frolov: But modern science-intensive, energy- and 
resource-conserving technologies are the primary means of 
protecting the ecosphere from the onslaught of civilization. In 
this respect Russia doesn't have too many chances. 
  Danilov-Danilyan: Nonscience-intensive production 
is dying out, regardless of what anyone might like. For the 
simple reason that it is worn out. Its continued use is becoming 
either physically impossible or economically ruinous. More and 
more money is needed for repairs, and such production consumes 
more and more raw materials and energy and produces more and 
more wastes, for which we are also having to pay today. In 
addition, it is no longer profitable to produce obsolete 
equipment today--it is extremely materials-intensive, and 
enterprises that produce such equipment are the main ones that 
are failing economically. And so we see here a mechanism of 
natural selection, even though, of course, one might like to 
artificially stimulate it. The claim that nothing is being 
modernized or built in our country is nonsense. Last year alone, 
environmental experts analyzed 64,000 design documents. We sent 
only 4 percent of them back for further work. Not one of the 
others failed to meet environmental-protection requirements. And 
so in contrast to many people, I see no grounds for deep 
pessimism. 
  Frolov: So the current state of our science, which 
is instrumental in the emergence of new technologies, doesn't 
make you pessimistic? 
  Danilov-Danilyan: In recent months all I hear is 
that science is dying. The same thing was said over and over in 
the United States about American science 30 to 35 years ago. At 
that time the USSR launched the first satellites, and the 
Americans panicked. They calculated that we had 10 times more 
people going into science that they did. Then they began talking 
in utter seriousness about the intellectual death of the nation. 
People in our country are saying in horror that scientists are 
going into business. I don't see anything wrong with that. Now 
when they leave the country--that is indeed dangerous. 
  Moreover, we have an enormous backlog of research projects. 
And even if we are experiencing a pause--so what, we'll survive. 
In general, we underestimate the role of social 
self-organization. We are used to regimentation and rigid 
planning, but no society lives like that in a transitional 
period. 
  Frolov: Unfortunately, not only do we have an 
obsession with planning; we have also failed to outgrow our 
passion for classifying anything and everything. We have learned 
the truth about the environmental situation in Russia thanks to 
the fact that many documents have been declassified. Now a 
presidential edict has authorized the Ministry of Environmental 
Protection and Natural Resources itself to be a "classifier." 
How do you intend to exercise that right? 
  Danilov-Danilyan: First, we never petitioned to 
obtain that right. Second, we view it not as an opportunity to 
classify things, but on the contrary, to lift the ban on 
publishing information that does not constitute a state secret. 
For example, we intend to publish the declassified section of 
the Russian register of radiation objects. But it would be 
absolutely naive to think that the text is utterly devoid of 
secrets. 
  In general, environmental information can be used to gather 
a 
great deal of information affecting national security. For 
example, a great deal can be learned from satellite surveillance 
of the behavior of birds carrying sensors about the size of a 
thimble. Naturally, more traditional methods are also widely 
used. So the decision adopted doesn't surprise us in the least.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksey Vladimirovich Yablokov, head of </F>
Interdepartmental Commission of Security Council on 
Environmental Issues, by Vadim Karpov; date and place not given: 
"Aleksey Yablokov: `It Is as If We Are Living in a Garbage 
Dump!'"] 
  [Text] The country is experiencing an exceptionally 
frightening crisis (in addition to all the rest). The world 
around us is expiring. Nature is dying. Are there any rivers 
where the water can be drunk without fear? Are there any meadows 
which have not been ruined by chemicals and acid rain? Is there 
any place at all where we can breathe just one whiff of truly 
clean air? What lies ahead, and what is our present situation? 
These were the questions with which our interview of Aleksey 
Yablokov began. He was B. Yeltsin's adviser on ecology until 
recently, and he now heads the Interdepartmental Commission of 
the Security Council on Environmental Issues. 
  Karpov: It does not seem that long ago that there 
were environmental rallies and demonstrations throughout the 
country. They damned the bureaucratic system and tormented 
administrators. "Hands off," "We will defend".... Now we do not 
hear a thing.... 
  Yablokov: I cannot deny the obvious decline of 
interest in ecology, but why should we be surprised by this? 
People have other problems: prices, crime, political 
instability.... They worry about staying alive, about having 
enough to eat, and about surviving bloody massacres.... 
  Meanwhile, the average lifespan has decreased dramatically 
in 
recent years. It was 70 years in 1986, but now it is 65. One of 
the main reasons is the dismissal of environmental problems, and 
it is sheer insanity--even in these insane times--to remain 
silent. I am already 60. According to Russian standards, I have 
no more than 10 years left, but if I lived in America or in 
Switzerland, I could look forward to another 15-18 years. Is 
this a significant difference? There I would live long enough to 
play with my great-grandchildren, but the people in some cities 
here can only hope to make it to retirement age.... 
  Why is our average lifespan so short by civilized standards? 
I can explain. From 50 to 60 percent of our longevity depends on 
socioeconomic circumstances. Malnutrition and poor eating 
habits, stress, smoking, alcohol.... More people are dying of 
suicide than of ischemic heart disease. Traffic accidents are 
killing more people than cancer. The state of our health is 
20-30 percent dependent on environmental conditions and only 7-8 
percent dependent directly on health care. 
  Are our objectives clear? We have to build highways, improve 
transportation systems, and regulate traffic more effectively. 
We have to fight against alcohol abuse and against the poisoning 
of food with harmful additives. We have to protect ourselves 
from radiation, heavy metals, and dioxins.... 
  Around 16 percent of our territory is in a dangerous 
ecological state, and that is where more than 20 million people 
are living. Now we have another problem: An abundance of toxic 
waste from the West is heading in our direction. It is thousands 
of times cheaper to dispose of it here, and that is why it is 
coming here through legal channels and, in the majority of 
cases, through illegal ones as well. We have no strict laws to 
control this, and the laws we do have are not being enforced.... 
It is as if the whole country is living in a garbage dump and is 
doomed to degeneration and extinction. 
  Karpov: But Russia is on the verge of 
disaster--the non-payment crisis, the endless debts, work 
stoppages, bankruptcies.... Any fine could drive a whole 
industry to its knees. 
  Yablokov: I cannot deny that. If you were to go 
abroad, you would see how clean and neat everything is there. 
Everything is well-kept, without any industrial chaos, because 
each piece of land has an owner, and the owner pays for each 
meter. 
  Obviously, fines would not solve the problem. Not right 
away. 
But there is another option: An enterprise director is asked to 
reduce harmful atmospheric emissions in the next two years. 
Until that time, the payment of the fine is deferred, so to 
speak. He can think about it, ask for suggestions, try different 
solutions.... At the end of the two years, if there are no 
changes for the better, please pay the fine. This is already 
being practiced in hundreds of cities. And it is essential that 
the fines be spent exclusively on environmental projects. 
  These are two methods of control on the governmental level, 
but there is also a third: compensation for damages to property 
and health. In principle, this is a declared right. As usual, 
however, no specific mechanism has been developed for this: 
People do not know how and where to file claims and how to 
calculate the amount of compensation. 
  Karpov: The effectiveness of the "mechanism" also 
seems dubious. How many attempts have been made, and how many 
articles have been published in the press, to prove that the 
most harmful emissions are connected with specific enterprises? 
All of it has been futile. The managers of production units 
always talk their way out of it. 
  Yablokov: Yes, it is true that proving this is 
difficult, but it is not impossible. A few well-publicized 
trials will teach them a lesson. You could say it would have an 
intimidating effect. 
  Karpov: How? 
  Yablokov: By letting them know that each of us, in 
principle, could demand any amount of compensation, and that 
this could absolutely ruin the polluting enterprise. All 
enterprises in the West are living under this Damoclean sword, 
and this forces them to clean up their operations. 
  Karpov: But you are not a foreigner, Aleksey 
Vladimirovich, and you know what people here think of hazardous 
production units. They act upset, but then they go back to work 
in, for instance, the radioactive shops so that they can earn 
higher wages, get an apartment, and retire a few years earlier. 
Women give birth to sick children who suffer from asthma and 
allergies, they also get sick, and then they die prematurely, 
but they have other concerns--the prices of sausage and 
furniture. 
  Yablokov: Yes, sadly enough, that is our 
mentality. In the Chernobyl zone, after decontamination the 
local residents took the radioactive soil home so that they 
could keep collecting "funeral benefits".... All of this calls 
for persuasion, explanation, convincing arguments.... 
  Karpov: By the time we convince them, there will 
be nothing but mutants left in the country.... 
  Yablokov: If we do not want to admit that we are 
living in a pile of crap--excuse the expression--we deserve the 
life we have. We are showing contempt for ourselves and for the 
future of our children and grandchildren. 
  Then why should we worry about the drop in the birth rate 
and 
the reduction of our population? Do you know that almost 60 
percent of our infants are unhealthy?! Only one out of every 
nine or ten adolescents is healthy. 
  How did we reach this point? This happened because the USSR 
acted like a besieged fortress for decades. All of its energy 
and resources were used for defense. Under 20 percent of "their" 
workers are employed in industry, and it is probable that only 
one out of every twenty is working for the "defense 
establishment," but in our country one out of every two workers 
is employed in production and one out of every five is connected 
with the "defense establishment." Only 18 percent of our labor 
force works in the service sector, but "over there" it employs 
half of the labor force. 
  Karpov: It seems as if the Aral and Caspian seas 
were forgotten after the breakup of the USSR.... 
  Yablokov: Not quite. As soon as the CIS was 
formed, the republics concluded an ecological agreement. They 
reached an agreement on monitoring and the exchange of 
information, and also on mutual financial support. At that time, 
in 1991, they decided to conclude separate agreements on the 
Aral and Caspian seas. The agreement on the Aral Sea was signed, 
and the agreement on the Caspian is being negotiated. Lake 
Baykal has not been forgotten either: A large representative 
commission has been set up on the governmental level. 
  The Azov Sea has become a sewage pit in recent years. More 
and more beaches have been closed, and the fish are dying. We 
cannot do anything about the Azov Sea without the cooperation of 
Ukraine.... An agreement is being drafted at this time. An 
international agreement was concluded by Turkey, Bulgaria, 
Ukraine, Russia, and Georgia to save the Black Sea. 
  The move to the market has already made some changes for the 
better, if only because administrators now have to count their 
money. Not long ago, several chemical combines were using 
petroleum-based paraffin in the production of protein and 
vitamin concentrates. There was public indignation.... 
  Karpov: I remember how the CPSU Central Committee 
used to convene journalists for meetings with branch managers 
and how they would use charts and diagrams to prove that 
criticism was unfounded, that there was no danger, and that all 
of this was a figment of the reporters' imagination. 
  Yablokov: Yes, all of the proof boiled down to the 
argument that our agriculture and animal husbandry would 
collapse without these concentrates. Now the market has forced 
them to calculate their costs and realize that it is more 
profitable to sell the paraffin. The receipts from a tonne of 
raw material can pay for two tonnes of soybeans. A tonne of 
paraffin, meanwhile, produces only 700 kilograms of protein and 
vitamin concentrates. In addition to everything else, however, 
there was the departmental factor, and there was always the 
strategic defense objective of absolute self-sufficiency, so 
that we would never need help from anyone else. In the 1960s the 
Politburo ordered the development of agriculture for the 
satisfaction of all of our own food requirements, and that was 
the start of the reliance on protein and vitamin concentrates. 
They were supposed to lift agriculture out of the pit. 
Incidentally, nuclear power engineering also began to be 
developed here as a "by-product," because we needed nuclear 
weapons. We needed plutonium for bombs, and it comes from the 
irradiated fuel of nuclear power plants. 
  In the 1950s they started telling us how important 
pesticides 
were for heightened productivity. By 1988 they had increased 
pesticide applications to 2 kilograms for each hectare of plowed 
land. We know the results: bare store counters and millions of 
tonnes of imported grain. Now we cannot afford to buy 
pesticides. Applications are only one-fifth or one-sixth of the 
previous amount, but this has not reduced the yield. 
  We do not plan to buy any grain this year. Better storage 
methods have reduced the amount of waste products in the garbage 
heap. The economy works. Just five or six years ago we never 
even imagined anything like this. 
  All of this is good for the environment. We do not have to 
use as much land for crops or to flatten marshes and country 
roads with tractors for the augmentation of our plowed areas. We 
can start restoring our forests, creeks, and springs. 
  Karpov: Meanwhile, the land is also becoming 
private property. Do you have any fear that it will be sold to 
rich people with no intention of plowing the land or planting 
anything? 
  Yablokov: Of course I do. In the Security Council 
we recently discussed the threat posed to national security by 
the depletion of soil fertility. We discussed the more 
intelligent use of land resources. Today the restoration of the 
fertility of our anemic soil is our number-one objective. A 
presidential directive on this is being drafted. 
  Karpov: But you cannot go into a private forest or 
reach the sea on a closed beach.... 
  Yablokov: You are wrong. You can go into any 
forest in Europe or America, sometimes even without the consent 
of the owner (as in Switzerland). There are restrictions, of 
course: You cannot chop wood or build fires.... Some of these 
restrictions extend to the owners of the forests. As far as the 
sea coast is concerned, the shore in most countries is public 
property, and there are laws against building anything on the 
beaches or making them inaccessible. 
  Karpov: You were the president's adviser on 
ecology. Did you have many meetings with Boris Nikolayevich? 
  Yablokov: Unfortunately, they were too infrequent 
last year. That is one of the reasons I asked the president to 
release me from my duties as an adviser and give me more freedom 
to take action. 
  Karpov: Did you get this freedom? 
  Yablokov: I think so--as the chairman of the 
Interdepartmental Commission of the Security Council on 
Ecological Security. Our commission can discuss any aspect of 
environmental security, and it is our job to analyze the state 
of the environment in the country and draw the proper 
conclusions. We have already drafted some interesting proposals 
in conjunction with the Ministry of Defense on the creation of 
ecological forces. In conjunction with the Russian Federal 
Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Security and the Ministry of 
Atomic Energy, we drew up proposals on the improvement of 
radioactive waste handling and disposal. There are also 
proposals on the prevention of ecological terrorism and all 
types of accidents and disasters. 
  Karpov: The president recently published an edict 
on the state strategy of environmental protection. Will it help 
in improving the situation? 
  Yablokov: The new Constitution grants the 
president the authority to define the basic guidelines of 
domestic and foreign policy. The edict was compiled in 
accordance with this. It is of colossal importance: It defines 
the principal guidelines of Russia's actions to secure 
ecologically safe development under market conditions and to 
protect the human living environment. It assigns priority to the 
restoration of environmentally distressed regions and to 
Russia's participation in the resolution of global environmental 
problems. 
  Now it is the government's turn--it is supposed to propose a 
specific plan of action in two months. 
  Karpov: What are you hoping for? 
  Yablokov: I hope we can use new technology and new 
economic relations to climb out of the environmental quagmire. 
You know that the whole world views us as a slovenly neighbor. 
We are dirty, and we are polluting everything around us. We have 
no choice at this time: If we do not surmount our environmental 
problems, we will die. I still think we can surmount them.

<F P=106> [From the "Pacific Ocean" program] </F>
  [Text] The dumping of radioactive waste from Pacific Fleet 
submarines might be forced by the fact that there is nowhere to 
store the waste. Tankers with waste docked near the factory 
wharf of Zvezda in Bolshoy Kamen are filled to capacity, and can 
contain no more dangerous cargo. An ITAR-TASS correspondent was 
told this by Vladimir Ignatenko, representative of Russian 
president in the Maritime Kray. He said the government should 
have allocated funds to build a facility for processing the 
waste, but not a single ruble has been allocated for this 
purpose so far. Meanwhile, one of the tankers, which contains 
794 tonnes of waste, is in a dilapidated condition. Either the 
factory has to be stopped so that the already critical mass of 
radioactive liquid will not increase, or else it has to be 
dumped at sea. However, this may take place only after 
coordinating it with the Russian president, said Vladimir 
Ignatenko.

  [Text] There are adverse environment conditions over as 
much as 20 percent of Russian territory, Environment Minister 
Danilov-Danilyan said in Moscow on Wednesday. He said his 
ministry demanded a special resolution to prevent Russia from 
further dumping of liquid nuclear waste into the Sea of Japan. 
  He said the Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations was not 
entitled to issue licences for imports of nuclear waste from 
other countries until after the go-ahead from environmental 
experts. However, the minister said that much too often, nuclear 
waste was imported into Russia under the guise of materials 
intended for reprocessing as evidenced by a recent incident in 
Orenburg. 
  The minister denied media accusations that Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin signed a deal on imports of liquid nuclear 
waste from Hungary for reprocessing in Russia. He blamed Atomic 
Energy Minister Viktor Mikhaylov for signing this deal instead. 
  The minister said the agreement did not go through an 
ecological safety study and "is therefore illegal." 
  Danilov-Danilyan called for a review of all previous 
international agreements on nuclear waste disposal in Russia to 
be followed by parliamentary ratification.

  [Text] The administration of Primorsky Territory has 
accused commanders of the Pacific Fleet and management of a 
local factory of failing to comply with safety standards for 
storing nuclear waste. 
  Its statement says that more than 2,000 cubic meters of 
liquid nuclear waste was kept in fleet and factory-owned tankers 
moored in the Bolshoi Kamen bay, most of them unfit for durable 
storage. 
  As a result, radiation levels in the region have risen, 
according to findings by an interdepartmental commission of 
inquiry. The commission said radiation levels had doubled in 
the engine department of a TNT-5 tanker which was written off 
two years ago and were several times in excess of background 
radiation in the bay itself. 
  The regional authorities have given the fleet command and 
factory management until April 25 to comply with safety 
standards for nuclear waste storage. 
  Earlier, the commission had agreed to the dumping of a load 
of liquid nuclear waste held in the TNT-5 tanker into the Sea of 
Japan.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Pavlov, under rubric "Sensation": "Russia </F>
-- The Country of Sighs"] 
  [Text] According to data obtained from the RF [Russian 
Federation] Academy of Sciences, the domestic flora absorbs more 
carbon dioxide than is produced on the entire Russian territory. 
It follows from this that our country, with all its antediluvean 
industry and its smoking transportation is doing its best to 
save mankind from the greenhouse effect. These unexpected 
results that were achieved after prolonged experiments and 
miscalculations, are apparently capable of giving trumps not 
only to our industrialists in the fight against the "Greens," 
but also to the politicians who are discussing ecological 
problems on an international level. 
  Sergey Kurayev, chief of the Climatic Programs Department of 
Rosgidromet [Russian Hydrometeorological Service], states: 
  "The chief contribution to the global warming of the climate 
is made by carbon dioxide. It is not by accident that the 
developed countries have pledged to stabilize emissions of this 
gas. The United States, for example, `blow' into the atmosphere 
22 percent of the worldwide emissions of carbon dioxide, which 
is more than Russia (11 percent) and China (10 percent) 
combined. But, in our opinion, the crux of the matter is not how 
much you emit, but, rather, how much you take back. Currently at 
the negotiations dealing with the convention, a question that is 
being raised sharply is whether one should employ the 
balance-sheet approach: to require a country to report on the 
difference between emission and absorption. Otherwise, in 
accordance with the currently accepted methodology for making 
computations, the largest polluter of the earth's atmosphere is 
Luxembourg: the country is minuscule, there are no forests, but 
there are a tremendous number of motor vehicles." 
  As became known recently, 4.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide 
"goes into the sky" annually from the territory of Russia, and 
4.62 billion tons is absorbed. The total result is that 420 
million tons of carbon dioxide is absorbed annually by our 
forests. (Although there are other opinions on this score.) The 
most interesting thing is that there are few people who can 
venture a guess about our negative balance with regard to carbon 
dioxide. In any case. when I mentioned this at a recent meeting 
with officials from the German Ministry of Ecology, the Germans' 
eyes bulged out. I shall quote a few lines from a report written 
by RF Academy of Sciences academician Zavarzin: "The obtained 
results definitely indicate the role played by Russia and other 
countries in the humid zone of the Northern Hemisphere as being 
the Earth's lungs. Contrary to the generally accepted opinion, 
the countries in the tropic zone are not absorbers of carbon 
dioxide on a world scale."

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Bayduzhiy, under rubric "News" and </F>
subrubric "Carte Blanche": "Forget About the Ecology?: Clean Air 
as Payment for Economic Survival"] 
  [Text] Not too long ago the pages of NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 
were the arena for heated polemics between Viktor 
Danilov-Danilyan, minister of environmental protection and 
natural resources, and Aleksey Yablokov, chairman of the 
Interdepartmental Commission (MVK) for Ecology, of the Security 
Council. If one discards the mutual personal dislike that is 
typical of Russian administrators, the essence of the 
differences of opinion expressed by the two respected ecologists 
and ex officio state figures can be summarized as 
opposing evaluations of the state of the natural environment -- 
which is almost apocalyptic, according to Yablokov, or one that 
suggests restrained optimism, according to Danilov-Danilyan. 
Accusing each other of incompetency, the learned gentlemen, who 
indisputably occupy, in today's ecological table of ranks, the 
first and second places (I shall not undertake to make a 
judgment about who occupies which place), cite extremely weighty 
arguments as the basis of their positions. And it would scarcely 
be worthwhile for a journalist to interfere in this almost 
scientific discussion if it had not revealed an underlying 
natural law that it would be a mistake to ignore. Despite all 
the difference of the views expressed by the administrators of 
Minprirody [Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural 
Resources] and the MVK, they completely coincided in the view 
that the resources available to their departments and, in 
particular, the executive power's vertical line in general for 
resolving or at least mollifying the ecological problems are 
obviously inadequate, and that new steps are necessary here. 
  Being consistent individuals, neither one delayed in putting 
his words into action. Viktor Danilov-Danilyan, as a member of 
Russia's Choice, continued his march into power and, intending 
to achieve the development of civilized environmental-protection 
legislation, added to the title of minister the rank of deputy 
to the State Duma. Aleksey Yablokov, on the contrary, declared 
politics to be an unworthy matter and, as a sign of protest 
against President Boris Yeltsin's ignoring of ecological 
problems, submitted his resignation from the position of his 
advisor on ecology and the protection of health, while reserving 
the right, even after leaving the MVK, to concentrate completely 
on the creation of a broad ecological movement. 
  The opposing nature of the actions taken by people who 
possess in Russia ecological power to the highest degree only 
seems to be such. Actually it attests to a situation when a few 
ecologists, professionals and amateurs, have been completely 
deprived of public attention and support, while remaining 
one-on-one with numerous problems. The hopes shared by the 
optimists, among whom Danilov-Danilyan himself was included, 
that, after the upsurge of the ecological movement in the second 
half of the 1980's and its damping as a result of the economic 
and political crises in the early 1990's, the population that 
had adapted to the new realities of the democratic market would 
turn its gaze to the mess in the ecology, were not justified. 
The results of the recent election serve as the best 
confirmation of this. The "Green" party, which united the 
activists of the ecological organizations, having failed to 
collect the necessary 100,000 signatures, came crashing down as 
early as the registration stage. The Cedar bloc, which made 
statements under ecological slogans, despite an intensified 
advertising campaign, suffered as a result a no less impressive 
defeat and, with 0.1 percent of the votes, ended up in last 
place. Incidentally, as for Cedar, whose voter list included 
just about anyone, so long as he was not an ecologist, that 
movement, which had been created shortly before the beginning of 
the election campaign, did not recommend itself by anything in 
particular, other than tinsel advertising posters with elements 
of ecology, and, after its defeat, went back into the 
underground, presumably until the next election. 
  Such a crushing defeat for the ecological bloc cannot be 
explained simply by its fractionation or lack of organization. 
Both situations, of course, exist, although one of the leaders 
of the Socioecological Union, enraged at an item published in 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the eve of the election, did attempt to 
prove otherwise, ascribing to his movement nonexistent merits 
and accusing the press of doing no more and no less than 
unleashing an informational war against the "Greens." However, 
even the small size of the ecological organizations -- which lay 
as the basis of these shortcomings -- actually only reflects 
another, much more serious tendency. Its essence lies in the 
fact that the chief antiecological center, that previously used 
to be located somewhere at the summit of the 
party-nomenklatura-departmental pyramid, has today 
shifted sharply downward, and the person who acts as the 
ecologists' chief opponent is no longer the state official, the 
director corps, or the "new Russian" businessman who is chasing 
profit at any cost, but actually that very same 
average-statistical Russian man in the street who, not too long 
ago, demanded the closing of practically all the dirty 
production entities and the establishment of strict ecological 
order. 
  According to Minprirody data that was cited in the summer of 
1993, the precise following of the already enacted laws and 
statutes governing the protection of the environment would lead 
at that moment to the bankruptcy of more than 60 percent of the 
Russian enterprises. A year later, the economic crisis has 
definitely not loosened its embraces, and today the number of 
enterprises that guarantee their survival, including those doing 
so thanks to the ruthless exploitation of nature, is even 
greater. They can be made ecologically safe only by investing 
tremendous amounts of money in environmental-protection 
measures, which, either as a result of an increase in cost, will 
convert their output into something that is completely 
uncompetitive not only in the world market, but also in the 
domestic market, or will force the compensating of the 
environmental-protection costs at the expense of people's wages. 
Either of these situations will have an immediate negative 
effect on the population's standard of living. That is why the 
ecological slogans that previously seemed to be a reflection of 
man's legal right to have a normal environment, are evaluated 
today by the same population as green extremism. 
  Incidentally, one should not think that the problem of the 
price of ecology is pertinent only for Russia. A few years ago 
in Germany, a country that is ecologically favorable as compared 
with us, in response to a compliment concerning rabbits that 
were running across the lawns, the burgher who was giving me a 
ride only slapped the pocket in which his wallet was presumably 
located and, with a rather sour face, said that he would gladly 
trade all the rabbits for a new BMW. But whereas the West 
Europeans who have achieved a certain level of prosperity have 
to pay for the preservation of a normal living environment by 
rejecting a part of their welfare in the form of a second car or 
a country home, for Russians, 60 millions of whom live in areas 
with unfavorable ecological conditions, the alternative is much 
harsher. The smog that hangs over the city and the growing 
figures in the disease rate seem a much lesser evil than the 
much more tangible threat of unemployment, poverty, and fuel 
crisis. 
  As a result, the resolution of the most painful 
environmental-protection questions, with increasing frequency, 
comes up against not the inactivity of the executive authority, 
an economic depression, or imperfect legislation, but the 
population's elementary unwillingness to sacrifice anything at 
all for the sake of the ecology. There are more than enough 
examples of this: from the small Karelian settlement of 
Nadvoitsy, the residents of which, in exchange for their 
economic welfare, have reconciled themselves to ecological 
misfortunes, to the cities around the Caspian, where the local 
authorities took the money that had been allocated to combat 
flooding and diverted it to other purposes.

<F P=106> [Interview with Andrey Demin, by Svetlana Sukhaya: "Don't Be </F>
Afraid of Mirrors: Russians Must Know the Truth About the 
Nation's Health"] 
  [Text] Every day I hear and read about new programs 
that are aimed at improving the nation's health. Various 
foundations and associations are springing up like mushrooms. 
Meanwhile the situation with health of Russians is getting 
closer and closer to the concept of "catastrophe." A. Yablokov, 
chairman of the Interdepartmental Commission for Ecological 
Security, of the RF [Russian Federation] Security Council, 
provides an even more tragic formulation: "Ecocide in action." 
He stated recently, "I have ceased hoping that the government, 
caught up in the burning issues that face society today, will 
itself recognize the terrible danger of ecocide. Society as a 
whole must force the authorities to act!" That was the topic of 
our discussion with Andrey Demin, a consultant in the MVK 
[Interdepartmental Commission] apparatus. 
  Demin: So far, we do not have any broad public 
movement for health. The organizations that basically engage in 
these questions are rather narrow organizations of 
professionals, primarily medical doctors. But no one is 
coordinating their activities. The "Green" -- ecological -- 
movement is developmentally two to three years ahead of the 
"White" movement for health that is being born today. In 
analyzing what is occurring, we attempt not simply to confirm 
the tragedy, but also to seek an answer to the question, "What 
should we do?" I would answer that question in this way: the 
only path is to build health into the country's socioeconomic 
development. The crux of the matter is to assure that health 
actually becomes the chief priority for the state, and to assure 
that every decision is made with a consideration of its 
consequences for people's health. 
  Sukhaya: What are the first steps in the "White" 
movement? 
  Demin: It is necessary first of all to at least 
collect the information and to unite the organizations that 
already exist. One of our first projects is the preparation and 
publication of an atlas, entitled "Health and the Environment." 
It contains a scientifically substantiated picture of the state 
of health of the population of Russia over its entire territory. 
The task is to depart from the impersonal average figures and 
provide specific information. Because the first report on the 
health of Russians did not appear until late 1992. We are just 
beginning to make our way out of the fog. All the base figures 
and indicators used to be hidden and classified. For example, a 
document on the problems of alcoholism at Goskomstat [State 
Statistics Committee] was prepared for the leadership in only a 
few carefully numbered copies. It used to be felt that some 
"chief administrator," issuing commands from Moscow, could 
change the entire situation in the country. 
  Recently I was at a seminar in Canada. I kept hearing the 
term "a society that is moved by information." That is, a 
society not moved by somebody's will, not by fraud, not by 
slogans or an attractive idea, but by objective information. By 
having that information, people are capable of understanding and 
changing a lot. If, of course, they still have hope... 
  The information about health was too frightening, and too 
obviously pointed the finger of responsibility at the system, so 
it was "classified." But in recent years the authorities, who 
have begun everything "from a clean slate," have taken the risk 
of declassifying the situation. And thank God that the job has 
been brought to its end. The first report was a purely 
informational one. We were given the task of creating a mirror. 
The mirror appeared. Russians looked into it and they were 
terrified. But they learned the truth about themselves. 
Moreover, the President's Edict and the government's decree 
stating that similar reports are a mandatory annual procedure 
were enacted. 
  Sukhaya: Let's hope to God that, with every 
passing year, this mirror will frighten us less and less. But it 
is also important that that mirror should not be "curved." 
  Demin: The first experience has indicated that we 
can no longer deal only with average figures. There used to be 
indicators for the mortality rate and the birth rate for the 
entire Soviet Union. But with the tremendous difference between, 
say, Central Asia and the Baltic republics, they lost any real 
sense. They were all leveled off. It is impossible to change or 
resolve anything by orienting oneself on them. 
  In 1992 joint research was carried out in Karelia by local 
specialists and their neighbors from Finland. They studied the 
people who were living right next to one another -- on identical 
land, under the same sky, amid the same forests and lakes. But 
how different the situation proved to be with our neighbors' 
health! For example, on the Russian side the overall mortality 
rate in the 33-64 year age group was almost twice as high, and 
the mortality rate from cardiovascular diseases was almost 67 
percent higher. 
  We should have realized long ago that health is not simply 
something that is "God-given." It directly depends upon, for 
example, whether the city has a normal water-supply line. 
  Sukhaya: It would seem that "omnipotent" Moscow 
answered for the average figures. Does the specific data also 
presuppose actions taken locally? 
  Demin: Of course a lot can be done by people's own 
efforts, but some things require federal support. We plan to 
send out our atlas for all the territories, and to make the 
objective picture known to the local population. 
  Quite recently a group of specialists on the initiative of 
and under the leadership of A. Yablokov prepared a report 
entitled "The Population's Health and the Chemical Pollution of 
the Environment in Russia." Once again, this was the first 
attempt, on the basis of a tremendous amount of factual 
material, to compile the proof of the pernicious influence that 
specific chemical factors have upon various indicators of 
people's well-being. By having that information, everyone is 
free to decide how to avoid the threat to life -- his own, and 
that of his children and grandchildren: whether he should leave 
a dangerous area or, by uniting with other victims, to force the 
polluter (including by way of the court) to stop his poisonous 
emissions. The report was a compilation of hundreds of 
scientifically proven figures and facts. We shall quote only a 
few of them. 
  The industrial emissions from our enterprises are counted in 
the millions of tons. The annual amount of pollutants for every 
inhabitant of Russia is approximately 300 kilograms. The cities 
that head this sad list of leaders are Norilsk, Nikel, 
Novotroitsk, Angarsk, Monchegorsk, and Novokuybyshevsk. And, as 
compared with Moscow, Samara, or Arkhangelsk, the indicators are 
higher by tens of times! 
  In Moscow the highest level of pollution of the atmospheric 
air is typical of the center, the northwest, and the northeast. 
The level of the disease rate for bronchial asthma among 
children here is higher by a factor of three or more than in the 
city's relatively clean rayons. 
  In the children who have been subjected to the effect of the 
polluted air, health problems arise even before the moment of 
birth. For example, in Moscow the weight of newborn infants born 
to mothers living in the area influenced by the emissions from 
the Motor Vehicles Plant imeni Likhachev is an average of 400 
grams less than in the cleaner control rayon. 
  The causes of childhood disability today include in first 
place affections of the central nervous system. The frequency of 
such diseases constitutes, on the average, 38 per 1000 children, 
but in ecologically serious rayons that figure jumps to 50 or 
more. 
  In Russia there is a constant increase in the number of 
pregnancy pathologies, primarily in the major industrial 
centers. In Ufa the indicator for various complications in 
pregnant women during the past 20 years increased from 8.9 to 
20.1 per hundred births -- this is almost three times more than 
the average republic level. The reason is that a tremendous 
number of women work in enterprises of the petrochemical 
complex. In Bratsk 40 percent of the women who have decided to 
have children have a premature cessation of pregnancy, and 51 
percent have a pathology in childbirth. So just think about how 
many chances a future mother who lives here has for carrying and 
giving birth to a child without any complications. 
  The serious ecological situation increases the risk of 
having 
cancer. The highest indicators for lung cancer are recorded in 
the major industrial oblasts: Leningrad, Nizhniy Novgorod, 
Saratov, and Chelyabinsk oblasts. The cities that are especially 
dangerous are those where aluminum plants that use obsolete 
technology are located (Krasnoturinsk, Kamensk-Uralskiy, 
Shelekhov, Bratsk). There is increased oncological mortality 
among the population of cities where enterprises for the 
smelting of copper and nickel are located (Rezh, Ufaley, and 
Karabash in Sverdlovsk Oblast, and Nikel in Murmansk Oblast). In 
Magnitogorsk in the atmospheric air the concentration of the 
very dangerous carcinogen benzapyrene exceeds the PDK [maximum 
permissible concentration] by as much as a factor of 90. There 
is increased danger to people's health in many cities with a 
well-developed chemical or petrochemical industry. For example, 
in "chemical" Sterlitamak the oncological disease rate is twice 
as high, the stillbirth rate is six to seven times higher; the 
frequency of congenital defects in development is three times 
higher; and the disease rate for bronchial asthma is six times 
higher. 
  It was not too long ago when information such as this 
probably would have been classified. Today we are attempting to 
publicize it as rapidly and as widely as possible. Not in order 
to frighten people, but in order to get them to take action. 
  Sukhaya: Do you believe in my favorite saying, 
"Forewarned is forearmed?" 
  Demin: Definitely, a person can wave a warning 
aside and fail to pay any attention to it. But he must have the 
right to receive this kind of information. 
  This is a bitter truth. But there is no need to be afraid of 
mirrors. As I have already said, by having information, people 
are capable of understanding and changing much in their lives, 
if, of course, they still have hope...

<F P=106> [Interview with Nikolay Martinovich Morkovskiy, deputy </F>
chairman of the "state committee for the elimination of the 
consequences of the Chernobyl catastrophe in Belarus," by 
Dietmar Ostermann: "Therefore, This Must Never Be Forgotten"] 
  [Text] Ostermann: Eight years after the 
reactor accident at Chernobyl, many have done with the maximum 
credible accident or take it as a proof that the world also 
overcomes such catastrophes. Belarus was among those who 
suffered most from the consequences. Is all that already 
forgotten and over? 
  Morkovskiy: Twenty-two percent of our territory 
is still radioactively contaminated. One-fifth of the 
Belarusian population lives there. An area of the size of your 
Saarland cannot be used; 130,000 people were resettled. We had 
to build new apartments, outpatients' departments, schools, and 
whole cities. The program is being continued. Belarus is 
spending 12 percent of its state budget on the elimination of 
the consequences of Chernobyl. And that after eight years! 
  I do not think that one can say that we have forgotten 
Chernobyl. 
  Ostermann: Nevertheless, many affected persons 
are complaining about a lack of support; 45,000 Belarusians are 
still living in highly contaminated areas. 
  Morkovskiy: Not all of them want to leave. In 
May 1986, one week after the catastrophe, I myself organized the 
first evacuations in the rural district of Narovlya. At that 
time, we were not properly briefed ourselves. And the people 
did not believe in the danger and wanted to stay. Then they 
nailed up their doors and windows with boards and said: We will 
come back in three weeks. 
  Out of the 320,000 inhabitants of the district, 12,000 still 
live there, although half of the district is still part of the 
"prohibited zone" with a radiation of more than 15 curie per 
square kilometer and everyone has the right to free 
resettlement. This also applies to the city of Narovlya itself, 
where 12,000 people lived before. Out of the 7,000 inhabitants 
who stayed there, only 1,000 applied for resettlement. The 
others wanted to stay. 
  Ostermann: Former helpers after the catastrophe 
and radiation victims are threatening a hunger strike, in order 
to draw attention to their disastrous situation, among them 
there are also Belarusians. Are all of them to blame themselves? 
  Morkovskiy: I have not heard anything of that. 
Perhaps you are right that the situation is deteriorating. I 
also belong to the categories of liquidators. The diseases from 
which I am suffering need not come from radiation. They may 
also be due to the nervous strain that was so great in all those 
years. One looks at oneself and asks oneself: How come? In a 
poor country there are many problems, also without Chernobyl. 
  Ostermann: Nor can you say that to a mother whose 
child has increased levels of radioactive iodine in its thyroid 
nor to a person suffering from cancer who has to wait for 
treatment for months. 
  Morkovskiy: Many things were planned, but the 
money is lacking. In 1989, the Soviet Parliament adopted a 
program for the elimination of the consequences. But the Soviet 
Union does not exist any longer. Today, the means that are 
available to us suffice just for a quarter of the planned 
measures. If we were to implement everything, we would have to 
spend half of our state budget. This would ruin us. 
  Ostermann: Does this mean that the other 
republics abandoned the program? 
  Morkovskiy: Ukraine refrains from helping us in 
any way, although an agreement provided for it. Last year, 
Russia supported us with 8.5 billion rubles. We bought medicine 
and medical equipment with the money. 
  Ostermann: Russia and Ukraine have again taken a 
fancy to nuclear power. Moscow is planning new nuclear 
reactors, Kiev does not switch off Chernobyl despite numerous 
incidents. What does Belarus think of it? 
  Morkovskiy: If some have the advantages and some 
the damage, one comes to different opinions. Two-thirds of the 
areas that were contaminated in the Soviet Union at that time 
are in Belarus. Chernobyl is in Ukraine and supplies the 
Ukrainians with electricity. Our parliament called for the 
shutdown of the power plant in a resolution. From our point of 
view, this is probably justified. 
  Ostermann: Kiev argues that it cannot afford to 
switch it off. 
  Morkovskiy: Perhaps it is better to be a little 
afraid than to die of cold and hunger. This cannot be 
definitely said, there are pros and cons. In Belarus the 
situation is clear: We do not have nuclear power plants. But 
we have the consequences of the Chernobyl catastrophe. And 
nuclear power plants are everywhere at our borders -- in 
Smolensk, Chernobyl, near Rivne and Ignalina. 
  Ostermann: Western experts remembered Chernobyl 
punctually on the anniversary of the catastrophe and they are 
warning against a new catastrophe. Are you alarmed? 
  Morkovskiy: I think that there would not have 
been an explosion if rules had not been violated at that time. 
Irresponsibility and the violation of norms led to it. However, 
I am an agronomist, not a nuclear physicist. There should be 
projects that are completely safe. In this way, however, the 
danger to the people remains. Therefore, one must never forget 
what happened here.

  [Text] As follows from the results of radiation tests, 
this year the concentration of tritium in the topsoil on the 
territory of Kiev is largely lower than admissible. However, in 
some places, it was tens of times the normal value and a hundred 
times the norm in subsurface waters. The sources of tritium 
contamination have not been determined.... 
  At the same time, in the Chernobyl zone, over the last year, 
the content of strontium and cesium in almost all the water 
ducts has increased by a factor of between one and a half and 
two. 
  In the water of the reclaimed land on [the Dnieper's] left 
bank, it is four times the admissible concentration. Over the 
last year, the transfer of cesium with Prypyat River water to 
the Kiev reservoir has increased approximately fivefold and of 
strontium -- sevenfold. Even though the content of these 
radionuclides in the drinking water of the towns of Prypyat and 
Chernobyl is below the norm, it has also increased by a factor 
ranging between one and a half and seven.... 
  Incidentally, last year, just one and a half percent of the 
Chernobyl fund was invested in the decontamination of the land; 
this fund accounts for 12 percent of the state budget.

<F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Anton Vernitskiy; from the </F>
"Novosti" newscast] 
  [Text] Today, an international conference on the problems 
of the Chernobyl nuclear electric power station began in Vienna, 
which is being held under the aegis of the IAEA. Experts from 
that organization who made an inspection of that station in the 
Ukraine came to the conclusion that at the present time the 
state of the nuclear power station does not correspond to the 
generally accepted international standards. 
  [Vernitskiy] It was proposed that this conference should be 
held by IAEA General Director Hans Blix. At the beginning of 
April he visited the Chernobyl nuclear power station with a 
group of experts for the purpose of checking how safe it is. 
The conclusions of the experts were not comforting. According 
to Blix' statement, the safety norms at the station do not 
correspond to even the least stringent international standards. 
First and foremost, the state of the sarcophagus on the 
destroyed reactor of the fourth power unit gives cause for 
concern, as well as the shortage of modern equipment and spare 
parts. Besides this, the funds allocated for the elimination of 
the consequences of the radioactive contamination are constantly 
being reduced. 
  In their turn, the Ukrainian authorities think that the data 
given in the IAEA representatives' report are somewhat 
exaggerated, although according to Valentin (Kupnov), who is 
responsible for the safety of the Chernobyl zone, the best 
solution would be the mothballing of the Chernobyl nuclear power 
station. However, Ukraine cannot simply close down the nuclear 
power station. An extremely acute shortage of energy resources 
threatens the Ukrainian economy with complete paralysis. 
  It is most likely that at the conference in Vienna, Ukraine 
will be offered help in financing the development of the atomic 
industry in exchange for shutting down the Chernobyl atomic 
power station. [video shows interior and exterior of station]

<F P=106> [Interview with Anatoliy Panov, member of the Green Party of </F>
Ukraine, by Valentyn Smaha, commentator on ecology for VECHIRNIY 
KYYIV: "The Bitter Truth Is Better Than a Sweet Lie"] 
  [Text] 
  Smaha: Anatoliy Mykhaylovych, we've known each 
other for a long time. The next round of the pre-election 
struggle is fast approaching, and everybody has suddenly started 
mentioning ecology. Are the candidates just making eyes at a 
fashionable topic? Or do you have a different interpretation of 
this matter? 
  Panov: No. That's the way it has been and always 
will be in all countries, not only in our young Ukrainian state. 
Populism, demagogy--neither you nor I made up these words. The 
world, unfortunately, is unfinished and imperfect. 
  Smaha: That's true, Anatoliy Mykhaylovych, but do 
you recall how the Green Movement began in Ukraine? That first 
meeting near the Central Kiev Stadium on 13 November 1988, the 
First Congress of the Green World [Zeleniy svit] Association 
with the dazzling greetings by Oles Honchar, the first 
election--as it were--to a democratic parliament. That "rebuilt 
euphoria"--what was it that brought it all to an end so suddenly? 
  Panov: In my opinion, it was the profound crisis 
in the environmental-protection movement. 
  Smaha: But what caused this? Because for nearly 
seven years you were the deputy chairman and executive director 
of the Green World Association, and so--to a certain extent--you 
must have felt responsible for what happened in this country's 
environmental-protection movement.... 
  Panov: That's true. Nor do I shirk my 
responsibility in this matter. But understand me correctly: From 
the very beginning our movement has included forces that can be 
characterized--so to speak--as centrifugal and centripetal. Some 
persons (a typical example would be Serhiy Konev from 
Dniproderzhynsk) who emphasized the political aspects of the 
cause. Others (and here i could cite Alla Shevchuk from Odessa) 
regarded the coordinating organ as something to provide help in 
solving small-scale, regional problems--things live saving the 
well-know Kulyanyk Estuary near Odessa. The "politicians" and 
the "practioners" persisted in taking very different stances in 
their attitude toward the environmental-protection movement. 
Enthusiasm really did exert a substantial influence on the fate 
of the Green World Association. 
  Smaha: Just what did happen? Was it something 
similar to the former Society for Environmental Protection? 
  Panov: No, come on now Valentyn Ivanovych! People 
were making careers, and the cause stood still. I don't want to 
publicly name those persons who made careers for themselves 
based on the phraseology of environmental protectionism. Nor do 
I wish to enumerate the "beetles" who became rich on Western aid 
or various kinds of speculative ventures. What I want to do here 
is to list the problems which Green World has done some 
organizational work on. The public can solve them or not, as it 
sees fit.... 
  Smaha: What specific problems do you mean? 
  Panov: First, there should be a moratorium on 
building new units at nuclear-power stations, and the 
continuation of operations at the Chernobyl AES [Nuclear-Power 
Station] should be revoked. These continued operations threaten 
Ukraine with a catastrophe in the very near future. They will 
not bring the energy crisis to an end, but rather deepen the 
economic crisis. The whole trouble is that Ukraine lacks a 
machine-building and raw-material base for nuclear-power 
engineering. All the talk about the effectiveness of our 
nuclear-power stations is a bluff. We do not have such 
possibilities as Beria had for maintaining order in the 
atomic-power industry. Nor will we ever have them. It would mean 
that one out of every three citizens would have to be condemned 
for the absurd Article 58. What nonsense.... 
  Smaha: Does that mean that the aggressive plans to 
use nuclear power for Ukraine's future electric-power 
engineering are basedon nonsensical principles? 
  Panov: Of course! Chernobyl in its present-day 
guise is potentially hazardous. We "Greens" have officially 
demonstrated that Kiev lies within the zone which suffered from 
the accident at this AES. People from Narodnychi have been 
resettled. But there are districts in Kiev where the level of 
gamma-type radiation is higher. Why, then, are Kievans not being 
resettled? Because the Supreme Council has blocked this 
decision. The reason is a simple one: They don't have the money 
to do this. 
  Smaha: If they don't have the money, where did it 
all go? 
  Panov: We must speak honestly about the conditions 
under which Ukraine's capital is now living. The state cannot 
help--the world community must come to its assistance! But we 
seem to regard it as best--during these times so trying to our 
souls--to conceal our illness within. It's as if we fail to 
understand that future generations will have to pay for this. 
  Smaha: But could not all this likewise be 
understood as inflaming the passions? 
  Panov: Certainly. But why, then, are the people 
who are most competent in these matters leaving Ukraine. 
Mykhaylo Sorokin has become director of the Kursk AES, after 
having left the Chernobyl AES. The deputy general director of 
Ukratomenergonaglyad--Heorhiy Kopchynskiy--has quit working 
there. And the director of the Ukryttya facility--Mykola 
Sherbyna--has also left his post. These people are professional 
experts in the nuclear-power field! They understand better than 
anyone what is going on. But we--either because of stupidity or 
willful negligence--continue to keep millions of people in 
ignorance. 
  Smaha: There's a great deal of talk nowadays about 
a new isotope--americium. Its appearance will compel us to 
rethink the entire strategy of eliminating the consequences of 
the Chernobyl accident. What's your attitude toward this? 
  Panov: I view it as a great deal of speculation on 
a fashionable topic. Carrying the weight of authority for me are 
the words of Academician Dmytro Grodzynskyy to the effect that 
americium will not be any safer that the hot sections in the 
core of Energy Unit No. 4 at the Chernobyl AES. And the presence 
of material from these sections has been ascerained even as far 
away as California.... Therefore, let me repeat the following: 
The declaration of Kiev as a place which suffered from the 
Chernobyl AES is a central question in the politics of 
eliminating the consequences of the accident there. 
  Smaha: Let me make sure that I've understood you 
correctly: You're saying that the bureaucrats who are shutting 
their eyes to the obvious truth are knowingly condemning our 
capital to die out gradually? 
  Panov: I would not use the word "knowingly." It is 
more through stupidity and ignorance. The central question is up 
to the strength and possibility of the state 
environmental-protection organ with strong support from the 
public. So far our Ministry of Environmental Protection has been 
producing ambassadors: in Israel and in Romania. Now Mykola 
Korobko is a functionary in Krivoy Rog. But when he was a 
deputy, he at least set to work and made an active initiative. 
The ministry, however, as soon as this project started to gather 
momentum, has cut it off at the roots by an administrative 
reduction of personnel. Just think: We are reducing a department 
which could enable us to survive! Nothing more absurd could be 
thought up. Everything is perishing in the debates on 
environmental protection. A typical example is Mykola 
Fedorynchyk, who is the present executive director of Green 
World. Words, words, words.... There are no people who do 
anything--that's the whole trouble. 
  Smaha: As I understand it, the key question is 
reforming the political system. Are you taking part in the 
election struggle? 
  Panov: Yes, I am. The collective of the Kiev 
Polytechnical Institute has put me up as a candidate for the 
office of deputy from the Radyanskyy Election District. I am 
participating in the election as a citizen, and I have a calm 
attitude toward my possible defeat. 
  But the "Greens" are people with intense feelings. The 
stormy 
disputes within the Association are turning some truly 
intelligent persons away from us. The Association is becoming 
impoverished of intellect and enriched with careerism. This is 
hardly to the benefit of our cause. I left Green World because 
of its political intrigues. I consider that the main thing is to 
achieve effective work by the environmental organs. 
  Here's a simple example. An inspector closes down the 
Mariopol Sintering Plant as being too harmful to the health of 
the population there. But the minister opens it up again, citing 
its "importance" for the Ukrainian economy.... 
  Smaha: And just how will things develop? 
  Panov: As of now, parallel structures are emerging 
within the environmental-protection movement. They have lost 
faith in things as they presently exist. I can cite as an 
example the "Mama-86" organization--an association of young 
Kievan ecologists. Matters simply cannot go on as they are now. 
  I think that--with some help from VECHIRNIY KYYIV--the Green 
World Association will achieve a new life. I am opposed to the 
political bent in its work, and--indeed--I am against 
politicking as such. Let's try to help the readers of this 
newspaper to analyze and understand such vitally important 
questions as the true safety of americium, the ecological time 
bomb under Kiev, the so-called polygon in Pyrogova, and 
defective production. Let's give some thought to how to regulate 
the chaotic building of dachas near Kiev and to accord our city 
the status of a sufferer from the accident at the Chernobyl AES. 
There are many other unsolved problems, the solutions to 
which--I anticipate--we will be seeking with the help of 
VECHIRNIY KYYIV's readers.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Amsterdam To Have Europe's Largest </F>
Solar Energy Project"] 
  [Text] Amsterdam -- By next year Amsterdam will have the 
largest public housing solar energy project in Europe. 
Commissioned by the Amsterdam Energy Company [EBA], 66 homes in 
the district of Nieuw-Sloten are to be provided with 
photovoltaic cell systems. Danish, Italian and Spanish partners 
are following the progress of this large-scale, European 
Community demonstration project with great interest. 
  The recent promise of financial support from the European 
Community and Novem (Netherlands Organization for Energy and the 
Environment) has helped the Amsterdam project a great deal 
along. "Certainly because it concerns the first, large-scale 
project in Europe in which solar energy is wholly included in 
home architecture," says project leader J. Cace, of the 
management department of the EBA. She points out the fact that 
there will be no orange roof tiles on the roofs, but only dark 
blue solar boards. The total surface of the photovoltaic cell 
systems is 2,500 square meters, and the capacity of the solar 
cells is 250 kW. The foundations for the project will be laid 
in September of this year; the completion of the solar houses is 
planned for May 1995. 
<H5>  Public Network </H5>
  Another striking part of the project is the fact that the 
electricity which will be produced will not go directly to the 
occupants of the houses but to the public network. Via the 
medium and low voltage network the current will go back to the 
district. "This way even houses that do not themselves contain 
solar cells will profit from the clean solar energy," says Cace. 
Through the use of solar energy, the inhabitants are able to 
reduce the amount of pollution in the atmosphere by 135 tonnes 
of CO[.sub]2[/], 300 kilograms of SO[.sub]2[/], and 376 
kilograms of NOx. 
  The solar cells are made by R&amp;S Renewable Energy 
Systems in 
Helmond and BP Solar in Leatherhead (United Kingdom), each of 
which is responsible for half of the cost. In addition to the 
commissioner, EBA, Ecofys is also taking part in the project. 
The project has also drawn the attention of other EC countries, 
which have similar plans. Participants are the PV Applications 
Center in Newcastle, Sermasa from Madrid, Miljokontrollen of 
Copenhagen, and the Institute Cooperatieve per Innovatione in 
Genoa. Case again: "Finally, it is an important demonstration 
project for Europe because it will, for instance, provide more 
insight into increases in scale, and the economic advantages of 
full integration of solar cells in the construction and power 
supply by district."

  [Text] As far as the environment is concerned, Belgium 
presently has over 7,000 cubic meters of low radioactive waste. 
This waste is stored in safe locations in the Mol area [Mol is 
know for its nuclear plant]. However, 50 years from now, more 
locations will have to be found as it is expected that the 
quantity of such waste will grow to 150,000 cubic meters. The 
organization responsible for storing radioactive waste, the 
ONDRAF [National Office for Nuclear Waste], has set up a list 
with 100 zones spread over 50 communes where dumping sites for 
low radioactive waste could be located. The final decision will 
be made in 1997, but Greenpeace already has denounced the ONDRAF 
plan as "unreliable." Sabine Breulet reports: 
  [Breulet] Low radioactive waste originates from nuclear 
plants, research institutes, and hospitals. It is estimated 
that their half-life lasts approximately 30 years. The ONDRAF 
project is to build a concrete storage house on clay or 
schistous ground covering 30 hectares. The site should make it 
possible to store 100,000 cubic meters of processed waste. A 
total of 98 zones spread over Flanders and Wallonia meet the 
criteria required for this dumping site. Fifty communes are 
being considered for this site, but only one will be designated. 
The final choice should be made by 1997 and then be followed by 
the approval requests. Thus, the dumping site for this type of 
waste will not be built until the year 2000.

<F P=106> [Article by Steen Voigt: "Denmark's Global Scrub Brush"] </F>
  [Text] As part of the effort to follow up on the United 
Nations' global environment and development summit in Rio de 
Janeiro, the Folketing resolved on 18 December 1992 to increase 
global environmental and catastrophe aid. The goal is to use 
half a percent of gross national income (GNI) for the purpose in 
2002 -- probably around 6 billion kroner. Half of this will go 
directly to environmental efforts. 
  Denmark has allocated more than 600 million kroner for 
global 
environmental aid in 1994 to meet its international commitments. 
The investment, which will be close to 3 billion kroner annually 
in 2002, is expected to set an example for other donor nations. 
  Denmark's global scrub brush will pick up speed in the years 
ahead. 
  And it will go to work in East and Central Europe, Southeast 
Asia, southern Africa, the Arctic region, and many other places 
around the world. 
  The government's recent approval of a long-term 
environmental 
strategy from the Environment Ministry and the Foreign Ministry 
makes it possible to move fairly quickly to follow up the 
statements from the environmental summit in Rio de Janeiro in 
1992 and the meeting of European environment ministers in 
Lucerne last year with massive economic action. 
  The money will be taken primarily from the environmental and 
catastrophe aid fund that a Folketing majority decided to set up 
on 18 December 1992 to strengthen our efforts with respect to 
international environmental problems. 
  The environmental part of the fund involves 500 million 
kroner this year and will increase by 200 million kroner a year 
until 1998. The goal is to provide a total of 0.5 percent of 
national income by the year 2002, around 6 billion kroner, half 
of which will go to the environment. 
  In addition the Foreign Ministry will channel a nine-digit 
sum annually, 145 million kroner this year, primarily to UN 
organizations where the money, along with the contributions from 
other countries, will be used for environmental projects. 
  For the first few years the Foreign Ministry will also 
finance distinctly environmental projects in the poorest 
selected countries in Southeast Asia, Vietnam, Cambodia, and 
Laos, through its general development aid. But later on, in 
1996, these countries will also come under the fund. 
<H5>  Unique </H5>
  This joint long-term strategy means that Denmark is the 
first 
donor nation in the world to put its international environmental 
aid in a fixed framework. 
  "The environmental and catastrophe fund is unique on the 
international level and I definitely think it will set an 
example for like-minded donors in the UN circle, i.e., countries 
like Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, Canada, and the United 
States, and perhaps Germany as well," said Leo Larsen, assistant 
administrative director of the Environment Agency. 
  He is head of the department of the Environment Agency that 
takes care of environmental aid, which is currently in the 
process of being expanded. The department will have almost 30 
employees. 
  The four individual parts of the environmental strategy 
designate the countries and their environmental problems that 
the Danes feel especially qualified to tackle. Also with 
reference to the sale of Danish environmental technology and 
know-how and thus more jobs and additional technological 
advances in this country. 
<H5>  From Europe to Asia </H5>
  More than half the money will be used close to home: in the 
three Baltic countries, Poland, and the heavily polluted and 
polluting Russian areas around Kaliningrad and St. Petersburg. 
In addition, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary also have 
a high priority. 
  A somewhat smaller nine-digit sum will go to Thailand and 
Malaysia in Southeast Asia where, as mentioned above, the 
Foreign Ministry will initially support the neighboring 
countries through development aid. 
  The special developing countries department is also 
considering aid for countries in southern Africa, but so far no 
recipients have been designated. 
  "This is mainly because we were working so hard to formulate 
a program for Southeast Asia that there was no time for anything 
else. And plans for Africa will not be relevant this year. At 
most there will be some preliminary soundings," Larsen said. 
  The reason why the Environment Agency specifically chose the 
five developing countries in Southeast Asia is that it was 
seeking a single contiguous region and that emphasis was placed 
on going into a growth area. 
  Thailand and Malaysia are experiencing rapid economic 
development. It appears that Vietnam will follow suit within a 
fairly short time and the countries' purchasing power in the 
commercial environmental market obviously played a part in the 
selection. 
  "It is clear that environmental considerations are the most 
important for all this. But it is also obvious that we are 
drawing on the vast Danish knowledge in this context. Therefore 
the selection also reflected the fact that the Danish state and 
its business sector are telling these countries: `This is what 
we can offer. What do you need?' Where these two things 
coincide, things happen. And I think this is quite legitimate," 
Larsen said. 
  He foresees that Danish businesses can participate in about 
half of the fund's environmental aid in the form of supplying 
environmental technology and knowledge. But an investment must 
be made, among other things, through product development. 
  "There are big perspectives for the Danish environmental 
industry in the countries of Southeast Asia. With all respect 
for our funding, the countries' own investments in combating 
pollution are enormous in relation to the small amount of aid 
they receive. I would guess that they receive less than 10 
percent from outside sources, the rest they pay themselves," 
said Larsen. 
  Apropos money and industry, the world market for 
environmental technology is big and growing. In 1990 it amounted 
to a good 1.2 trillion kroner and will rise to an estimated 2 
trillion kroner by the year 2000. 
<H5>  To the Poorest </H5>
  The environmental strategy designates four investment areas 
in Southeast Asia, namely cities, forests, coastal zones, and 
the protection of biological diversity, i.e., animals, plants, 
habitats, ecosystems, and genetic variation. At the same time an 
effort will be made to provide the aid to the poorest areas of 
the country and the poorest sections of the cities because there 
is a clear connection between their pollution, health, and 
poverty problems. 
  And just as in the eastern nations, conservation will be 
given its "natural" place because Denmark has a lot of 
experience with sustainable management and protection of nature 
preserves. 
  Environmental aid for the Arctic region also comes under the 
developing countries section, with the emphasis on Greenland. 
Especially monitoring and conducting research into ocean and air 
pollution, climatic changes, and the thinning of the ozone 
layer. But part of the aid will probably be used to help Russia 
monitor its long coastal stretches along the enormous ocean 
areas. 
  "It is necessary to give the Russians some kind of 
assistance 
in providing environmental data from their region for otherwise 
the picture we get of the total stress on the ocean will be 
incomplete. At present we have no clear impression of how much 
pollution, including radioactive pollution, they have there," 
Larsen said. 
<H5>  Environmentally Correct </H5>
  As mentioned above the Foreign Ministry is in charge of the 
fourth part of the joint strategy, namely multilateral aid. 
  Environment Ambassador Erik Fiil, who heads the ministry's 
environment secretariat, expects that the largest amount will be 
given to the so-called global environmental facility (GEF). This 
is controlled by the World Bank and the two UN organizations for 
the environment and development, the UN Environment Program 
(UNEP) and the UN Development Program (UNDP). 
  The ministry has just started a biogas project in Tanzania 
in 
cooperation with the GEF, which has been selected as the 
financial mechanism for the Rio summit's four main areas: 
climatic changes (with the climate convention that goes into 
effect on 21 March), biological diversity, ocean pollution, and 
the depletion of the ozone layer. Forest and desert projects may 
also be considered. 
  In addition, multilateral Danish environmental aid will 
continue to go directly to UNEP, UNDP, and a number of 
international environmental organizations, including private 
ones, for example the World Wildlife Fund and Nepenthes, the 
rain forest group. 
  Incidentally, the Foreign Ministry's environment secretariat 
was set up last September to follow up on the Rio summit's 
principle that environmental protection should form an integral 
part of development policy, among other things. 
  "Thus it is also our task to constantly remind our 
colleagues 
in DANIDA [Danish International Development Authority] that 
their development projects must also be environmentally correct, 
so that all our international aid will now hang together," said 
Erik Fiil.

  -  Air pollution: Combating local and multicountry air 
pollution in the East European nations and in the cities of 
Southeast Asia through support for increasing efficiency and 
purifying heat and energy production, promoting alternative 
energy sources, and improving mass transit. 
  -  Ocean pollution: Support for treating waste water from 
industries and cities in East Europe, which will benefit the 
Baltic Sea. In Southeast Asian cities it will benefit the 
important ocean areas along the coast, which function among 
other things as a development area for young fish. Agricultural 
advice on fertilization to reduce the nutrient load in oceans, 
for example the Baltic Sea. 
  -  Nuclear power plants: The goal is to continue to improve 
safety, especially at the Ignalina nuclear power plant in 
Lithuania and at Sosnovy Bor near St. Petersburg (both of the 
Chernobyl type) through aid for improving control systems, fire 
protection, and communications. The aim is to make the plants 
superfluous through aiding other energy sources. 
  -  Ozone layer/greenhouse effect: Aid to Greenland under the 
Arctic program for compliance with international conventions. 
Aid for reducing CO[.sub]2[/] emissions and the use of 
substances that destroy the ozone layer in East European 
countries, for example, through improving energy efficiency, 
making traffic more environmentally friendly and phasing out the 
harmful substances. 
  -  Hazardous waste: Aid for limiting and eliminating hazardous 
waste from industries in the East European countries and in 
Southeast Asia, for improving local household waste systems, and 
for the environmentally correct location and establishment of 
incinerators and recycling plants. 
  -  Environmental technology: Environmental efforts include the 
transfer of (Danish) environmental technology to recipient 
countries -- which will also benefit employment and the further 
development of environmental knowledge and technology in 
Denmark. Danish firms, authorities, and institutes have a great 
deal of knowledge in the key areas of handling waste, water 
treatment plants, protecting ground water, cleaning smoke, and 
combating ocean pollution. 
  -  Conservation: Aid for preserving the large untouched natural 
areas that still exist in East Europe -- in spite of everything 
-- along with their animal and plant life by expanding preserves 
and restoring and including consideration for nature in 
agricultural and forestry methods. In Southeast Asia aid for 
regenerating forests and preserving biological diversity, among 
other things. Aid to safeguard the delicate ecological balance 
in the Arctic. 
  -  Environmental training: Support for developing environmental 
and conservation regulations, the training and education of 
personnel, and building up both central and local environmental 
and nature authorities. Providing advice on regulation in the 
environmental area via both rules and taxes. Support for 
improved supervision of the environment and nature.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- In possible coalition negotiations 
with the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] after the 
Bundestag election, the Alliance 90/Greens will insist on the 
abandonment of nuclear energy, possibly within two years. It 
will not be easy to push this through, but it is economically 
and technically possible, Ludger Volmer, spokesman of the 
Federal Executive Committee, said before journalists in Bonn on 
Tuesday on the occasion of the eighth anniversary of the nuclear 
catastrophe at Chernobyl. One can build on the 1986 SPD 
decision to abandon nuclear power within 10 years. 
  Volmer and his party friends Klaus-Dieter Feige and Manfred 
Busch affirmed the call for the immediate shutdown of all 
Chernobyl-type reactors, which are the most dangerous timebombs 
in Eastern Europe. Retrofitting measures that cost billions 
[currency not specified] would not reduce the risk of a new 
catastrophe. New energy policy priorities have to be set. The 
abandonment of nuclear energy in Germany can break existing 
barriers and initiate an energy policy throughout Europe that is 
oriented toward ecological restraint, it was stated.

  [Text] In the province of Savona, 11,000 drums containing 
dangerous toxic waste have been discovered in the town of 
Borghetto Santo Spirito. Alfredo Livi reports: 
  [Livi] These drums, which have been crammed into this 
immense 
concrete cistern, contain 13,000 tonnes of hazardous waste. 
They were buried in this pit in Borghetto Santo Spirito, which 
is on the Ligurian Riviera in the province of Savona. This is 
the largest find of this type in northern Italy, perhaps in the 
whole of Italy. The hazardous material, contained in 11,000 
drums which have been reduced to scrap, was leaking into the 
water table. 
  At this immense illegal tip, the men behind this trade in 
hazardous waste accepted material which certain industries 
wanted to get rid of in a hurry. Acting on the complaint made 
by a brave mayor, a team of judges from Savona uncovered the 
trade and the illegal tip. However, technicians from Castalia, 
the state- controlled environmental company which is cleaning up 
the site, have discovered that the situation is far worse than 
at first thought. 
  It will cost the local authorities 10 billion lire to clean 
up this ecological timebomb. It is estimated that the men 
behind the illegal trade made 50 or 60 billion lire. 
  The dump discovered in Borghettto Santo Spirito is just the 
tip of the iceberg.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Whaling"] </F>
  [Text] In the run-up to the annual meeting of the 
International Whaling Commission (IWC) in less than a month's 
time the war of nerves has begun again. While the British 
Sunday newspaper, THE OBSERVER, reports that leading countries 
in the IWC -- led by the United States and Great Britain -- have 
ready a draft agreement which means that the way is being paved 
for a reintroduction of whaling quotas, it is reported from 
Washington that there is nothing to indicate that the U.S. 
Government has changed course on the whaling issue. 
  In the United States and several of the EU [European Union] 
countries public opinion has some very strong feelings against 
whaling, and it is probably less than likely that it will prove 
possible in the short term to reach agreement in the IWC on a 
resumption of commercial whaling. It looks, however, as if the 
United States is on its way toward accepting the principle of 
the scientifically based management of whale stocks. Even 
though there will still be some way to go before it is possible 
to achieve agreement on whaling quotas, a change in the U.S. 
stance represents an admission that there is a scientific 
foundation for exploiting whale stocks in some waters. This can 
quite rightly be interpreted as a decisive breakthrough for the 
arguments on which Norway has stood firm since the government 
gave the green light for 300 minke whales to be caught. 
  It is important for the future of the commission that such 
agreement on scientifically based resource management is 
achieved. If the whaling nations and the other countries in the 
IWC remain divided in the views they take on this point, there 
is a great likelihood that the IWC will split. Nations that 
have produced documentary evidence that there is a scientific 
base for whaling could resign from the organization -- and this 
would mean that the IWC would be turned into a purely 
conservationist organization.

<F P=106> [Article by Paul Stokes: "First Marine Protector for </F>
Coastline Under Threat"] 
  [Text] A Scotsman has been recruited as Britain's first 
marine conservation officer, responsible for protecting the 
threatened coastline of Wales. 
  Simon Reddy, 27, an ecologist, will work to save threatened 
birds, fish and animals along one of Britain's wildest and most 
beautiful shorelines. 
  Environmentalists say the quantity and range of sea life in 
the region makes it one of the most important marine habitats in 
Europe. 
  Mr Reddy's area of responsibility includes the whole of 
Cardigan Bay, home to a family of about 100 bottle-nosed 
dolphins and one of only two permanent locations the sea mammal 
populates in the Europe's northern waters. 
  Killer whales can frequently be seen basking in the bay on 
their way to and from their breeding grounds. 
  Naturalists also have evidence that larger whales are 
arriving in the area, with one confirmed sighting of a fin whale 
which can grow to 80 ft long and weigh up to 80 tons. 
  Other breeds of dolphin and porpoise also use the bay as 
well 
as the occasional pilot whale and basking shark. Seals are a 
common sight around the rocky shores of the mainland and islands 
where the bird life includes puffins, gannets, guillemots and 
razor-bills. 
  The sheltered nature of the Cardigan and Carmarthen bays 
means wildlife is threatened by pollution. Only three beaches 
along the whole of the Welsh coast -- at Cefn Sidan, near 
Llanelli, Whitesands, at St Davids, and the North Beach in 
Tenby, Dyfed -- carry European "blue flag" status for 
cleanliness. 
  The environment is also under threat from noise pollution 
from jet skis and boats. 
  According to the Dyfed Wildlife Trust many of the wild 
dolphins they have photographed have scars caused by the 
propellors of speeding boats they try to race. 
  Mr Reddy, who was educated at Aberdeen University and has 
worked for Greenpeace on its campaign ship, Solo, said: "It is a 
wonderful stretch of coastline but it is obviously in need of 
our help to address the various problems it now faces." 
  His work is aimed at helping the long-term objective of 
having the coastal waters designated a Marine Protected Area. 
  His appointment and associated work is initially funded for 
two years through &pound;50,000 raised by the Dyfed Wildlife 
Trust 
and the same amount of EC grant money. It is hoped the post will 
become permanent.

<F P=106> [By Amanda Brown, Health Correspondent, PA News] </F>
  [Text] An early warning system aimed at identifying a 
nuclear accident abroad was unveiled today - the eighth 
anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster. 
  Rimnet, the Radioactive Incident Monitoring Network, can 
identify raised levels of nuclear fall-out, enabling UK-based 
emergency services to spring into action. 
  Environment Minister Robert Atkins told a London news 
conference: "Any significant increase in radiation levels 
detected by the monitors will raise an alert on the Rimnet 
system and trigger alarms in continuously manned offices at my 
department." 
  "If Rimnet had been operating at the time of the Chernobyl 
accident, it would have indicated clearly where levels of 
radioactivity in the UK rose above normal background variations." 
  The system, which has monitoring stations across the 
country, 
can track radiation clouds by using sophisticated data and 
mapping equipment, while Government departments could alert 
water companies, local authorities and firms in the event of an 
accident. 
  The system will record measurements of radioactivity levels 
in air, water, food and people and store them on a database.

  [Text] Debt-for-nature swap schemes may become the in 
thing for member-countries of the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) as APEC environment ministers okayed a 
proposal which open APEC countries to innovative approaches in 
mobilizing financial resources for the environment. 
  An official from the Department of Environment and Natural 
Resources (DENR) said the proposal is aimed at awakening the 
interest of APEC member-countries to debt-for-nature swap 
arrangement. 
  At present, only Mexico and the Philippines are taking part 
in the program among APEC member-countries. 
  Robert Jara, project coordinator of DENR foreign assisted 
special project director, told BUSINESS WORLD the 
debt-for-nature swap scheme remains one of the more creative 
financing mechanism a Third World country can avail of in 
preserving its environment. 
  He disclosed that during the recently concluded meeting of 
APEC's environment ministers in Vancouver, Canada, the proposal 
was adopted as one of the "framework of principles" approved by 
the APEC body. 
  The principle specifically states that APEC member-economies 
should cooperate in exploring "innovative approaches to 
fund-raising scheme and mechanisms" in protecting the 
environment. 
  The debt-for-nature swap program, however recently came 
under 
attack from various sectors claiming the arrangement had become 
virtually impractical because of the rising cost of the 
Philippine debt papers. 
  The debt-for-nature swap arrangement is based on the 
principle that part of the foreign debt of severely indebted 
country is "canceled" by rechanneling it to a national currency 
fund directed to finance environment programs. 
  Specifically, the program involves the purchase and 
subsequent cancellation of part of a country's foreign debt in 
exchange for the funding of local conservation efforts and a 
government commitment to protect the environment. 
  Mr. Jara claimed the arrangement even has finance Secretary 
Roberto F. de Ocampo's endorsement. 
  In a brief presented during the meeting of APEC's finance 
ministers last March, Mr. de Ocampo proposed debt-for-nature 
swap deals as one of the concerns which countries should adopt. 
  Based on the copy of the brief obtained by BUSINESS WORLD, 
Mr. de Ocampo praised debt-for-nature swap arrangement as a 
"win-win" scheme which can allow the Philippines to address both 
its debt and environment protection problems, specifically in 
relation to fund lack. 
  Mr. Jara admitted, however, that the program will not solve 
the country's debt problem as the amount of money involved is 
just too small to make a dent in the country's total foreign 
debt. On the other hand, he said it can help a long way in the 
country's conservation efforts. 
  The country's debt-for-nature swap program is currently 
supporting biodiversity projects in the El Nido Marine 
Reservation and St. Paul River Subterranean National Park, both 
in Palawan, and in Mt. Pulog in Northern Luzon. 
  The Foundation for Philippine Environment is overseeing the 
program in coordination with the Philippine Business for Social 
Progress. 
  Earlier, Environment Secretary Angel C. Alcala, who 
represented the country during the APEC environment ministerial 
meeting, explained the discussions mainly focused on integrating 
environment issues with the economy or industrialization. 
  It is an initial discussion on potential cooperation among 
APEC member economies in the area of environment and sustainable 
growth, he added. 
  The meeting was held last 23-25 March and was attended by 
150 
delegates, representing APEC's 18 member-countries. 
  APEC was formed in 1989 in response to increasing calls for 
closer economic cooperation among countries in the Asia-Pacific 
through increased intra-regional trade and investment flows.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a roundup of recent 
environmental reports monitored from media in FBIS Abidjan 
Bureau and EAU coverage areas from 30 March to 18 April. 
<H5>  CONGO </H5>
  Dakar PANA in English, in a Brazzaville-datelined item at 
1415 GMT on 11 April reports that "Congo now fears for the 
future of its surface waters and pressures brought on its 
forests." In a paper on the "forest climate and ecosystem" in 
Impfondo, Likouala Region, Jose Djoni Bourges, regional director 
of the Forestry Commission underlined the adverse effects of the 
forest destruction. He said "the large destruction of forests 
leads to the lowering of the output of streams," citing the case 
of the Sangha and Obangui Rivers, on the border between Zaire 
and the Central African Republic. "Bourges said there was a 
risk of the desert now threatening Chad encroaching on its 
forest. He added that countries separating Chad and Congo -- 
Cameroon and the Central African Republic in particular -- are 
among those which are mostly threatened with desertification. 
"According to official figures, Congo loses between 15,000 and 
20,000 hectares of forest a year. Agricultural practice not 
friendly to the environment is considered the first cause of 
deforestation in the country." 
  London BBC World Service in English at 1515 on 18 April 
reports that due to the effects of the violence in the country 
last November, authorities are now planning to conduct a major 
hygiene operation in Brazzaville. This operation will involve 
digging up and properly reburying the bodies of those killed in 
the recent ethnic violence. Opposition and presidential 
supporters thought to have been responsible for the bloodshed 
will be called upon to help locate the cemeteries or shallow 
pits which were used as common graves for hurriedly-buried 
bodies. At least 200 people are known to have been killed during 
the clashes in Brazzaville. 
<H5>  GHANA </H5>
  Accra Ghana Broadcasting Corporation Radio Network in 
English 
at 1300 GMT on 18 April in its press review column says the 
GHANAIAN TIMES carries the assurance by the Environmental 
Protection Council that a strange substance in River Ankorbra 
and its tributary is not harmful to human and animal life. The 
columnist quotes the Western regional program officer of the 
council as telling a meeting of fishermen in the communities 
along the river that a substance which emits a bad odor does not 
pose any danger to the health of the people. The chief of the 
area disputes the claim saying that the "presence of the 
substance in the river is scaring away fishermen from fishing 
because the substance damages their nets and affects their 
catch." The paper supports a decision by the Ministry of Food 
and Agriculture to provide fishing communities with basic needs. 
They quote the deputy minister of the ministry in charge of 
fisheries of telling some fishing communities in the Dangbe West 
and Dangbe East districts that landing facilities at the beaches 
"would be provided to improve lighting systems and smoking sheds 
as well as tax-free concessions." 
<H5>  NIGER </H5>
  Niamey Voix du Sahel Network in French at 1200 GMT on 31 
March reports that the Goulbi River, the main water reserve 
which crosses the southern end of Maradi Region, is in danger. 
It is threatened by the construction of a dam in neighboring 
Nigeria. People and experts have been mobilized to find a 
suitable, lasting solution that would enable Niger to retain the 
waters that irrigate vast lands along the Goulbi River valley. 
Agricultural activities have slowed down in the Goulbi River 
valley because the river is drying out. Experts have studied 
the issue and decided to implement four water projects. The 
first one is a pilot project that is being tried out in a 
village located 6 km from Maradi. Once completed, the project 
will enable the flooding of about 17 hectares even during the 
dry season and will refill the Goulbi Basin. 
  Niamey Voix du Sahel Network in French at 1200 GMT on 4 
April 
reports that the people of Goudoumaria, rendered powerless by a 
natural phenomenon, have found an easy alternative, but not 
necessarily the best. Sand dunes have encroached on their farms 
so they have begun a rural exodus. According to a Voix du Sahel 
correspondent in the region, "Goudoumaria covers an area of 
9,500 square km for a population of 30,000 comprising Fulanis, 
Manga, Tubus, and Tuaregs who practice farming and animal 
husbandry." He goes on to say that the frequency and intensity 
of the wind which moves tons of sand from one place to another 
have forced people to leave their homes. A regional 
administrative official explains that because the people no 
longer have farming land they often go to Nigeria where they 
stay for months. He stresses that "theirs is a problem of 
survival because they have no money to buy food and some of 
their homes are totally buried in the sand." Commenting further 
on the situation of the people of Goudoumaria, the regional 
official suggests the creation of local jobs so that they could 
remain at home and support their families. 
<H5>  NIGERIA </H5>
  Paris AFP in English at 0509 GMT on 30 March in a 
Lagos-datelined item says: "Lake Chad has shrunk tenfold in the 
past three decades as a direct consequence of global warming, 
Nigeria's Minister for Water Resources Alhaji Isa Mohammed said 
here Tuesday. The lake has gradually shrunk from about 26,000 
square kilometres (10,400 square miles) in 1962 to its present 
2,500 square kilometres (1,000 square miles), Mohammed told an 
international workshop on the impact of global climate change on 
energy development. 
  The adverse phenomenon is the direct impact of global 
climatic change brought about by increased global warming caused 
by depletion of the ozone layer, Mohammed said. He welcomed the 
admission of the Central African Republic last week as the fifth 
member of the Lake Chad Basin Commission, meeting in Abuja, 
Nigeria, which could pave the way for a transfer of water from 
the Upper Oubangui river to the Chari river in Chad to increase 
the flow into the lake. 
  Lagos NTA Television Network in English at 2000 GMT on 11 
April carries a report in which the Administrator of Anambra 
State, Colonel Mike Attah says erosion is being tackled within 
the limited resources of the state, adding that representation 
has been made to the Federal Government on the issue. He made 
the observation while on a familiarization tour of Anaocha local 
government area of the state. In a report, NTA correspondent 
quotes the administrator as remarking that "with intensified 
revenue drive and prudent financial management, each local 
government council should be able to pay staff salaries promptly 
and embark on capital projects." He commended Anaocha local 
government for the various development projects. The reports 
says the chairman of the council drew the attention of the 
government to the "devastating effects of erosion in the area, 
the lack of motorable roads and health facilities within most 
communities."

  [Text] Hefei, April 16 (XINHUA) -- An initial survey of a 
large-scale Sino-U.S. joint investigation of the impact of 
environment and occupations on people's health was recently 
concluded in East China's Anhui Province. 
  It has produced a large body of data for experts to process 
and analyze. 
  The survey was sponsored by the International Research 
Center 
of Environmental Epidemiology, an institution jointly founded by 
Anhui Medical Sciences University and the U.S. Harvard 
University. 
  The four-month initial survey began last August 1 among 
almost 60,000 residents near Anqing City. 
  Each survey form contained more than 2,300 items of 
information. It focused on two subjects: natural history of 
respiratory system diseases and the relations between pesticide 
pollution and disease. 
  Regular follow-up surveys will be carried out among the same 
group of people in the next 15 years and will occupy generations 
of experts to research and find solutions to problems.

  [Text] Shenyang, April 29 (XINHUA) -- Northeast China's 
Liaoning Province has channeled billions of renminbi yuan toward 
fighting against air and water pollution. 
  As one of China's major heavy industry bases, Liaoning has 
many industries that cause serious pollution, including the 
metallurgy, chemical, paper-making and mining sectors. 
  To raise sewage disposal capacity, Liaoning plans to invest 
two billion yuan to launch the "clean water" project, which was 
initiated in 1992. 
  A pollution control program was framed to tackle industrial 
pollutants in the province's main rivers and all reservoirs. 
According to the program, some 157 enterprises in the province 
would put about one billion yuan into building 218 sewage 
treatment projects. 
  When they go into operation, these projects will be able to 
handle additional 300 million tons of waste water every year. 
  Early in 1988, the province carried out a "Blue Sky" project 
to curb air pollution in the region, which involved 14 cities, 
35 counties and 3,800 enterprises, with a total investment of 
770 million yuan. 
  All aspects of the project were completed and went into 
operation in June 1990. During the ensuing three-year period, 
nearly 20,000 boilers and furnaces were upgraded and 200 
projects for industrial pollution control were completed. 
  Shenyang city, once labeled by the world environmental 
protection organization as one of the ten most seriously 
polluted cities in the world, began to issue licenses for 
airborne emissions in 1991. 
  So far, air pollution in the city has been brought under 
control. Ash and smoke content in the air has dropped remarkably.

  [Text] Beijing, April 25 (CNS) -- According to the State 
Bureau of Oceanography, China has seen increasing damage of its 
resources in its coastal areas, posing a danger to the original 
coastal scenery and to the ocean ecology and leading to an 
adverse affect on tourism and economic development there. 
  It is reported that Xiamen, a coastal city in Fujian 
Province 
has seen excessive removal of sand along its coastline and 
unplanned construction of buildings and real estate development, 
with the result that a bathing beach near Xiamen University is 
suffering sand loss with the sand cover there becoming thinner 
from the original depth of more than 10 centimetres to less than 
one centimetre while 3.8 kilometres of beach there is now almost 
totally filled with rubbish and waste. 
  Such conditions are now also seen in Hainan with over 70,000 
mu of beach area in Lushui County being severely damaged by 
rampant mining of titanium, leaving many hillocks and hollows 
there. On February 19, a beach near the Xinhai forestry centre 
was found to have been damaged by illegal removal and selling of 
sand, and such destruction, if it continues, will endanger the 
whole coastline there, posing a safety problem to the nearby 
coastal road. 
  A circular recently issued by the State Bureau of 
Oceanography pointed out that the ocean environment and 
resources was the base for people's lives. Recovery of the 
damaged environment and resources are very difficult to redress 
and will pose a direct and potential threat to the economic 
development and people's livelihood there.

  [Text] Beijing, April 25 (XINHUA) -- A geographical 
information industry is taking shape in China as the country's 
survey and mapping research institutes and universities have in 
recent years achieved research breakthroughs. 
  These advances have come in the fields of surveying 
resources 
and monitoring the environment and natural disasters by using 
high- and remote-sensing technologies, including satellite 
sensing. 
  Official sources have said that China has established a 
dozen 
large-scale geographical information systems, including a 
national territory survey, flood forecast on the lower reaches 
of the Yellow River and anti-disaster measures. 
  Others include a monitoring information system for the 
"three 
norths" (north, northeast and northwest China) forest belts and 
environmental development, one for Shanghai's urban 
construction, one for the underground pipe network in urban 
Beijing and one for the basic land conditions in northeast 
China's Liaoning Province. 
  Speaking at today's inaugural meeting of the China 
Geographical Information Association, director of the State 
Bureau of Surveying and Mapping Jin Xiangwen said that China's 
construction of a geographical data bank has gone into high gear. 
  He said that a data bank on the primary geographical 
conditions of the national territory has been built up at the 
scale of one to one million, adding that a new one at one to 
250,000 is in the pipeline. 
  Meanwhile, he said, China has started building a 
high-precision data bank of the earth compiled from satellite 
information. 
  A digital survey and mapping system is being constructed to 
gradually integrate aerial and remote-sensing surveys and the 
information system for the national territory integrated into a 
whole, according to the official. 
  Jin said that his bureau has set up digital production bases 
in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Xian, Chengdu and Harbin. 
  Meanwhile, China has set up a key national lab for resources 
and environment information, a key national lab for surveys and 
mapping using remote-sensing data and a research institute for 
mapping and geographical information systems.

  [Text] Beijing, April 21 (CNS) -- In order to take joint 
action with the international community in controlling chemical 
pollution and minimizing losses resulting from such pollution, 
the National Environmental Protection Agency, the General 
Administration of Customs and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Cooperation recently jointly issued regulations on 
environmental administration over the importing for the first 
time of chemicals and the importing and exporting of toxic 
chemicals. According to the regulations, from May 1 of this 
year, chemicals without registration for importation will not be 
allowed to be imported into China. 
  It is reported that over 38,000 varieties of chemicals are 
now produced in China and a great amount of chemicals are 
imported into the country and since there has been a lack of a 
complete set of regulations and necessary technological measures 
on their administration, some problems have been appearing in 
their production, use, transportation, storage and waste deposal. 
  According to the regulations, the National Environmental 
Protection Agency will be in charge of unified environmental 
supervision and administration over the import of chemicals and 
the import and export of toxic chemicals in line with the 
"London Standards" stated in an international pact. The agency 
will issue a list of toxic chemicals subject to prohibition or 
strict restriction by the country. Chemicals to be imported 
into the country and those chemicals included in the list of 
toxic chemicals will be subject to registration and approval 
procedures for a permit to be given for their importation and 
exportation. 
  The General Administration of Customs and the Ministry of 
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation will be respectively in 
charge of the inspection of such chemicals and the examination 
and the making public to the outside world of the list.

  [Text] Lanzhou, April 19 (XINHUA) -- The vicissitudes of 
lakes on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau have been reflecting climatic 
and environmental changes since ancient times. 
  This conclusion was drawn by a team of Chinese geologists 
who 
recently completed extensive scientific studies on this highest 
plateau in the world, situated in western China. 
  The geologists found that the bulging movement of the 
plateau 
has had a great influence on the change of water level of the 
lakes. 
  For example, Qinghai lake was a shallow saltwater lake only 
ten m deep in its early stages. At one time, the level was 20 m 
higher than the present level. 
  The dropping of the water level started only 3,000 years 
ago, 
and the change of lake water temperature began 2,500 years ago. 
  By way of satellite reconnaissance the scientists discovered 
that the alternations of time, geological region and climatic 
conditions all produce changes in the lake.

  [Text] Beijing, April 20 (XINHUA) -- The Sino-Australian 
Mine Waste Research and Management Project, a cooperative 
science and technology program between the two governments, 
started here today. 
  According to an official from the Chinese Ministry of 
Foreign 
Trade and Economic Cooperation, the aim of the project, the 
memorandum of understanding of which was signed in 1992, is to 
assist China in mitigating environmental degradation caused by 
the depositing of mine waste through introducing suitable 
technology from Australia. 
  Another purpose is to develop rehabilitation plants at mine 
sites, and make policy on mine waste management, the official 
said. 
  She added that the Australian Government has supplied 3.5 
million U.S. dollars and technology for the project. Australian 
experts have inspected the project facilities, some of which 
have already been set up. 
  The Beijing General Research Institute of Mining and 
Metallurgy, the Zhongtiaoshan Nonferrous Metals Company of north 
China's Shanxi Province and the Tongling Nonferrous Metals 
Company in east China's Anhui Province are participating in the 
project. 
  Among those present at today's inauguration ceremony were 
Qin 
Zhongda, vice-chairman of the Environmental and Resources 
Protection Committee of the National People's Congress, He 
Boquan, deputy president of the China National Nonferrous Metals 
Industry Corporation (CNNC), and Sam Gerovich, minister of 
Australian Embassy. 
  He Boquan told the ceremony that over the past decade 
China's 
production of ten nonferrous metals has tripled, with a total 
output of 3.29 million tons last year. However, the volume of 
mine waste is also on the rise. 
  Each year, he said, CNNC affiliates generate a total of 60 
million tons of mine tailings, accounting for 89 percent of the 
sector's industrial solid waste. 
  So far, he added, the accumulated mine tailings amount to 
one 
billion tons, taking up two million ha of land, and with only a 
small portion reutilized. 
  Gerovich expressed the hope in his speech that the project 
would become a catalyst for future two-way investment in the 
field, and further the cooperation between the two countries in 
various aspects. 
  According to him, the Australian investment in China totals 
one billion U.S. dollars, encompassing 1,200 projects. He added 
that Chinese investment in Australia currently stands at 350 
million U.S. dollars.

  [Text] Bandar Seri Begawan -- ASEAN senior officials 
yesterday completed the draft of the Bandar Seri Begawan 
Resolution as a guideline for closer cooperation on the 
environment among member countries. The resolution will be 
proposed to environment ministers of Asean during the sixth 
ministerial meeting on the environment in Brunei's capital 
tomorrow. 
  Representing Thailand will be Deputy Minister of Science, 
Technology and Environment Pricha Musikun. 
  On the agenda are: 
  -- The Asean plan of action on the environment; 
  -- The launching of Asean Environment Year 1995; 
  -- The quality standards for air and river water; and 
  -- Regional cooperation for the management and control of 
transboundary movements of hazardous wastes into and within the 
region. 
  It was initially agreed that some significant framework and 
guidelines be established under the Asean strategic plan of 
action, the officials said. 
  "The member countries are working to develop a common stand 
on some international forums like the biodiversity and Basel 
conventions," a Thai delegate said. 
  The strategy encompasses such issues as the implementation 
of 
the so-called Agenda 21, the development of policy directions 
and the extension of operational and technical cooperation on 
the environment. At the same time, there will be a study on the 
implementation of the Asean Free Trade Area on the environment. 
  Senior officials endorsed the Asean Environment Year -- 
Asean 
Green and Clean -- at the meeting. 
  Asean Environment Year, which is the initiative of Thailand, 
aims to promote public awareness of environmental protection, 
according to a Thai delegate. He said the year would be 
officially inaugurated on January 1, with a wide range of 
regional and national activities in each member country. 
Promotion campaigns, however, will start this year. 
  He said most regional activities would be held in the form 
of 
seminars or workshops while national activities depended on 
arrangements of individual countries. There will probably be a 
study camp for young people or a trade fair and an exhibition on 
green products. It was agreed member countries must achieve set 
air and river water quality standards by 2010. 
  The standard for air in urban and industrialised areas must 
be lower than 200 on the Pollutant Standards Index (PSI), one 
official said. 
  The quality standards for river water, were set as follows: 
6.0-8.5 for pH, two milligrammes per litre of dissolved oxygen 
or more, 10 milligrammes per litre of biochemical oxygen demand 
(BOD) or less, and 200 milligrammes per litre of total suspended 
solids (TSS) or less. 
  The officials also discussed a proposal of the Philippine 
delegates that Asean adopt its own version of the Basel 
Convention which regulates the management and control of 
transboundary movement of hazardous wastes. 
  However, many delegates voiced disagreement with the idea. 
  "Asean should adhere to the existing convention. Adopting a 
new one is time consuming," they said. 
  One official said he thought the Basel Convention was 
comprehensive enough in controlling the export of toxic wastes 
from developed to developing countries. "I don't think we need 
another version." He said the issue would be further discussed 
at a meeting of the working group on the transboundary movement 
of hazardous wastes which will be held in Bangkok next year. 
  Each country, he said, would work out its measures to deal 
with the issue before next year's meeting. "In fact, whether 
the toxic wastes will be a problem depends on each country's 
management and control system. The convention is just a broad 
outline," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 30 KYODO -- Japan has told the 
International Whaling Commission (IWC) that it plans to begin 
next year catching some 100 minke whales in the northern Pacific 
for scientific research purposes, government sources said 
Saturday [30 April]. 
  Japan notified the plan to the IWC's scientific committee, 
which will meet in Mexico from 2 May, the sources said. 
  The program calls for catching 100 minke whales in waters 
south of the Kamchatka Peninsula in a three-month period from 
June to September 1995, to be followed by similar operations in 
the coming three to five years, the sources said. 
  An official of the Fishery Agency said Japan will reconsider 
the plan if the IWC adopts a resolution of opposition or urges 
Japan to have second thoughts. 
  The IWC is a 34-nation international forum for coordinating 
policies on whale conservation and consumption. The forum has 
adopted resolutions almost every year urging Japan and Norway to 
halt or rethink its research whaling. 
  The government sources said Japan decided to advance the 
latest plan as it needs to collect information on the number of 
minke whales in the waters and about their genes. 
  The Tokyo-based institute of cetacean research, commissioned 
by the Fisheies Agency, will oversee the research whaling 
conducted by Kyodo Senpaku, a private joint venture grouping 
various corporate whale catchers, they said. 
  Researchers aboard a fleet of whaling boats will investigate 
the length of minke whales, their gender, the ingredients in 
their stomachs, while analyzing their genes and the density of 
organic chlorinated chemicals accumulated in their bodies, they 
said. 
  The whale meat from the annual catches will be sold later 
for 
domestic commercial consumption, they said. 
  The convention governing the IWC authorizes research 
whaling, 
while keeping a ban on commercial whaling. The Japanese fleet 
has been catching an annual quota of 300 whales under the 
category of research whaling since 1987. 
  Many IWC member states and environmentalist groups have 
asked 
Japan and Norway to halt what they call research whaling, saying 
the two countries have been catching whales for commercial 
purposes under the pretext of scientific whaling. 
  Japan has asked for the IWC's authorization of its request 
to 
catch 50 minke whales a year in order to secure an international 
endorsement of its plan to resume its traditional coastal 
whaling. 
  However, its plea went nowhere in the face of opposition 
from 
opponents of whaling within the IWC. 
  An official of the Fishery Agency said, ``the government 
submitted its minke whaling plan to the IWC scientific committee 
as information of minke whale stocks in the north pacific is 
scarce.'' 
  ``Japan will continue to demand authorization of an annual 
catch of 50 minke whales for the sake of a resumption of coastal 
whaling as a separate request from the latest program for the 
north Pacific,'' he said. 
  Coastal whaling by Japan has been suspended since 1988, when 
Japan withdrew its protests against the IWC resolution to put a 
moratorium on commercial whaling. 
  A minke whale measures an average 8 to 9 meters, and weighs 
10 tons. Japan and Norway have argued that minke whale stocks 
have not been depleted as they have not been subjected to 
extensive catching in the past. 
  Japan has argued that its demand for an annual catch of 50 
minke whales is legitimate as its claim to coastal whaling by 
fishermen is essentially identical to those by the Inuit Eskimo 
Community in Alaska as well as other whaling communities. 
  Environmentalists have argued that the amount of whale meat 
available on the Japanese market is much greater than the amount 
of meat provided from research whaling. 
  ``Because whale meat becomes available as the result of 
research whaling, it provides a cover to whale meat provided by 
smuggling and poaching,'' said an official of the Japan branch 
of the World Wildlife Fund.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 6 KYODO -- The world would face a 
constant energy shortage and serious air pollution if China were 
to continue its economic growth without improving its energy 
efficiency, the Japanese trade ministry warned in a report 
Friday [6 May]. 
  The report said China is generating 2.5 to 24.5 times more 
carbon compounds and 2.5 to 184 times more sulfur oxides than 
Japan to produce the same amount of steel, electric power, 
cement, paper and pulp. 
  The report was compiled by the International Trade and 
Industry Inspection Institute at the Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry and China's State Statistical Bureau, in 
cooperation with Keio University in Tokyo. 
  It said Japan and other industrial nations should cooperate 
with China to help control air pollution. 
  Carbon compounds are known to contribute to global warming 
and sulfur oxides are believed to cause acid rain. 
  The report said China depends on coal for 80 percent of its 
primary energy supplies but has no system for recycling energy. 
  To produce the same amount, steel mills in China used 3.0 
times more energy than in Japan, power utilities 1.6 times more, 
cement plants 1.8 times and pulp mills 1.3 times more in the 
second half of the 1980s, the report said. 
  Few Chinese production facilities have desulfurization 
equipment and China generates 70 percent of Asia's sulfur oxides 
and 40 percent of its carbon compounds, it said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- The Economic Planning Agency 
[EPA] on Monday [9 May] called for effective measures to control 
pollution such as introducing an environment protection tax and 
product recycling systems. 
  The agency made the appeal in releasing the results of a 
survey on environmental protection measures, including a deposit 
system for recyclable resources such as cans and bottles. 
  The survey showed that it is possible to make environmental 
preservation and economic activities compatible through the 
implementation of various measures, such as the introduction of 
an environmental protection tax and regulations under the 
existing law, the agency said. 
  The EPA said the survey centered on the merits and demerits 
of pollution control measures, including a levy on environmental 
protection and penalties against pollution. 
  The taxation and penalty method will be effective for 
environmental protection depending on tax rates and penalty 
fees, but it will raise the possibility of boosting prices of 
products, leading to a decline in consumer demand, it said. 
  The agency said government subsidies will be effective in 
helping factories install pollution control equipment, but it 
creates a problem of how to secure necessary funds. 
  A U.S. system which allows factories to purchase the right 
to 
discharge harmful carbon dioxide is effective in controlling 
pollution but it entails high costs for working out such a 
system, it said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 7 KYODO -- Japan plans to take the 
initiative in setting up guidelines on environment and labor for 
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum to defuse a 
North-South squabble over the issues, a Japanese Government 
source said Saturday [7 May]. 
  The guidelines are expected to urge APEC members to enhance 
antipollution measures and improve labor conditions like wages, 
the source said. Japan aims at presenting the draft for the 
guidelines to 17 APEC members in preparatory work for the annual 
ministerial meeting to be held in Jakarta in late November, he 
said. 
  The APEC, established in 1989, groups Japan, Malaysia, 
Canada, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand, China, South Korea, 
Taiwan, Hong Kong, Brunei, Indonesia, the United States, 
Philippines, Singapore, Papua New Guinea, and Mexico. 
  The guidelines will include protection of tropical forest, 
introduction of a minimum wage ceiling system and enforcement of 
compulsory education with their medium-and long-term targets, 
the source said. 
  The camp of industrialized nations, led by the U.S. and 
France, calls for tightening trade curbs on such countries where 
preservation of environment and labor conditions remain below 
international standards, while developing countries fear such 
measures would risk their economic development.

<F P=106> [By So Song-mun: ``Offices Worse Than Streets''] </F>
  [Text] Watch out for those stoves and cooking ranges. 
While the heat is warming our bodies, our bronchi are battling 
with nitrogen dioxide. 
  According to research on nitrogen dioxide density conducted 
by the Paedal Environmental Federation, upon the request of SISA 
JOURNAL, higher rates were shown in office buildings, offices 
with gas stoves, and areas closer to stoves than those shown in 
streets, offices without gas stoves, and areas further away from 
stoves. 
  On 25 March, the nitrogen dioxide density of an office near 
Socho high school in Socho-tong was 79.2 ppb [parts per 
billion]. This is the second highest reading among over 400 
areas inspected. The reading on streets and a subway station 
near the same area on the same day was 32 and 64 ppb, 
respectively, lower than the one in the office. 
  During the first inspection, a heating system was on in the 
office. In order to measure the effect of heaters, we took a 
reading a second time on 14 April. A stove was on that day and 
the nitrogen dioxide density reached 110.7 ppb. 
  The density of nitrogen dioxide was higher when the stove 
was 
on because the flame produces more pollutants. The stove in the 
office was using liquefied petroleum gas. The density was 96 
ppb beside the stove, 67 ppb a little further from the stove, 
110.7 ppb and 99.8 near the windows, and 38.4 ppb at the 
entrance. 
  It was understandable that the density reading next to the 
stove was high, but it was unexpected that the highest reading 
was next to the window. It is believed that the pollutant 
produced by the flame expanded in the form of nitrogen monoxide 
and later it combined with the oxygen near the window to become 
nitrogen dioxide. Nitrogen monoxide is an unstable material. 
  On the other hand, the nitrogen dioxide density was the 
lowest at the entrance. This was because the entrance was far 
from the stove and the air circulated whenever the door was 
opened. 
  Contrary to this example, three points distant to each other 
in one office without any stove showed a much lower and even 
density at 43, 51, and 52 ppb, respectively. This was because 
there was no particular pollutant source such as a stove. 
However, the office still showed an equal or higher density 
than the ones in the streets nearby. This means that nitrogen 
dioxide pollution is more serious indoors. 
  The research illustrates the importance of air circulation 
in 
order to keep indoor air clean. However, this is meaningless 
when the air outdoors is polluted. Air has no bounderies and 
indoor air is eventually affected by air pollution. Therefore, 
the alternative is to widen exhaust ports and use fans to 
circulate indoor air. Using an air cleaner to filter pollutants 
from outdoor air is also a good idea. 
  However, there is a limit to air cleaners. When not properly 
managed and watched, they may have reverse effects by 
accumulating dust or pollutants full of bacteria in the outlets 
or in filters. This is the same reason why the nitrogen dioxide 
density in subway stations are twice as high as the streets 
above. 
  The research focused on nitrogen dioxide but there are 
various pollutant and pollution sources of indoor air. There 
are countless sources and pollutants around us: gas ranges and 
gas stoves which produce nitrogen dioxide, oil burners which 
produce sulfurous acid gas and cancer-causing (?forum) aldehyde, 
briquet holes and briquet heaters which produce carbon monoxide, 
radon and asbestos from construction materials, and (?forum) 
aldehyde from furniture and clothes. Nevertheless, studies or 
measures on this are far from sufficient. 
  Advanced countries have been aware of indoor pollution since 
the early seventies. Studies and regulation of such pollutants 
are active. In some countries, there are even departments fully 
in charge of indoor environment. According to Professor Kim 
Yun-sin, head of the Environmental and Industrial Medical 
Science Center of Hanyang University, in the United States, 
Congressman Joseph Kennedy submitted a bill on indoor air last 
year strengthening various regulations on indoor pollutants and 
detailing preventive and substitute measures.

<F P=106> [By Rosemarie V. Francisco] </F>
  [Text] Environment officials and ministers of the 
six-member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian 
Nations (ASEAN) recently approved the implementation of a 
strategic plan of action on the environment (ASPEN) over a 
four-year period. 
  The approval of the plan was a major achievement of the 6th 
ministerial meeting on the environment since it harmonized 
environmental quality standards in the region, said Department 
of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) Undersecretary 
Benjamin Bagadion, Jr. who headed the ASEAN Senior Officials on 
the Environment (ASOEN), the technical group which drafted the 
action plan. 
  Also, the ASEAN-member countries gave their go-signal to the 
proposal allowing the Philippines to house the ASEAN 
biodiversity center. This facilitates the release of the U.S. 
$19 million funding for the center which will be provided by the 
European Union, since the funding was hedged on whether the 
ASEAN will approve the proposal. 
  The approval of the action plan took less than a year. The 
plan, which has 10 strategies and 27 specific actions spelled 
out the countries' commitments with regard to sustainable 
development. 
  Mr. Bagadion said the environment officials from Indonesia, 
Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Brunei 
Darussalam which hosted the 6th ministerial meeting on the 
environment, all lent their full support to the action plan, 
thus, the speedy approval. 
  The ASPEN's objectives are the following: 
  -- respond to the specific recommendations of Agenda 21, the 
action plan adapted by the United Nations Conference on 
Environment and Development (UNCED), which required priority 
action in the region; 
  -- introduce policy measures and promote institutional 
development that encourage the integration of environmental 
factors in all developmental processes both at the national and 
regional levels; 
  -- establish long-term goals on environmental quality and 
work towards harmonized environmental quality standards for the 
ASEAN region; 
  -- harmonize policy directions and enhance operational and 
technical cooperation on environmental matters, and undertake 
joint actions to address common environmental problems; and 
  -- study the implications of ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) on 
the environment and take steps to integrate sound trade policies 
with sound environmental policies. 
  During the meeting, the ASOEN formed six working committees 
on six environmental issues such as transboundary pollution, 
nature conservation, environment conservation, marine 
environment, environment management, and information and public 
awareness in order to fully discuss the region's specific 
concerns. 
  The action plan calls for the implementation of the 
following 
10 strategies: 
  -- support the development of a regional framework for 
integrating environment and development concerns in the 
decisionmaking processes; 
  -- promote government-private sector interactions that lead 
towards the development of policies that mutually support the 
thrust of each sector; 
  -- strengthen the knowledge and information data base on 
environmental matters; 
  -- strengthen institutional and legal capacities to 
implement 
international agreements on the environment; 
  -- establish a regional framework on biological diversity 
conservation and sustainable utilization of its components; 
  -- promote the protection and management of coastal zones 
and 
marine resources; 
  -- promote environmentally sound management of toxic 
chemicals and hazardous wastes and control of transboundary 
movement of hazardous waste and their dispersal; 
  -- develop a system for the promotion of 
environmentally-sound technologies; 
  -- promote regional activities that strengthen the role of 
major groups in sustainable development; and 
  -- strengthen the coordinative mechanism for the 
implementation and management of regional environment programs.

  [Text] Taipei, May 3 (CNA) -- Thirty-seven more Chinese 
medicine shops around the island were found illegally selling 
rhino horn or tiger bone during the second half of April as the 
Council of Agriculture continued its crackdown on the illicit 
trade. 
  Members of the council's special wildlife protection group 
visited 5,623 Chinese medicine shops in 23 cities and counties 
from 19 April through 30 April, the council announced on Tuesday 
[3 May]. 
  The task force seized 349.8 grams of rhino horn and rhino 
horn powder in 15 stores and 4,424.7 grams of tiger bone in 22 
stores. 
  ``The move is to display Taiwan's sincerity to protect 
endangered species,'' a task force member said. 
  Disguised as customers, police visited 519 herbal medicine 
shops out of 8,000 on the island in mid-March in Taiwan's first 
nationwide crackdown on the trade. In those raids, 34 stores 
were discovered to be selling tiger bone and rhino horn. 
  According to Article 33 of the revised Wildlife Conservation 
Law, those found guilty of illegally importing, exporting, or 
trading in endangered wildlife or the products gotten from those 
animals can be sentenced to up to five years in jail or a fine 
of up to NT$ [new Taiwan dollars] 1.5 million (U.S. $56,820). 
Repeat offenders could be sentenced to up to seven years or 
fined up to NT$2.5 million. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton on 11 April issued an order 
prohibiting the import of legally traded wildlife specimens and 
products from Taiwan in retaliation for Taiwan's failure to stem 
the trade in rhino horn and tiger bone. 
  The sanctions will result in an estimated U.S. $20 million 
to 
U.S. $25 million in annual losses for Taiwan and will limit 
exports of farmed crocodile and snake skins, orchids, and coral, 
local trade officials said. 
  The sanctions will take effect on 11 May and will continue 
until December 1994, when the U.S. will review Taiwan's 
conservation efforts and decide whether to extend the import 
prohibition.

<F P=106> [Interview with Erno Rozsa, chairman of the Environmental </F>
Protection Committee of the Slovak Parliament, by Peter Andor 
Balazs; place and date not given: ``Erno Rozsa Interviewed on 
the Bos Power Station''] 
  [Text] 
  Balazs: You are the chairman of the Environmental 
Protection Committee of the Slovak Parliament. What is your 
opinion about Mr. Binder's generous declaration, according to 
which he would gladly pump water into the Szigetkoz area? 
  Rozsa: Mr. Binder also made such spectacular 
declarations before, as if he could solve the problem. These 
proposals would only be a patchwork, because they do not change 
the basic problems. The basic problem is that if the two states 
recognize the fact that the Danube is a border river, they have 
to also jointly bear its blessings, consequences, and threats 
alike. It is impossible to divide water up; it is only possible 
to do something in this direction if one of the sides gives up 
his share by common agreement. When Julius Binder made his 
proposals, he did so for the benefit of the common property, but 
even if his plan succeeded, it would only be a sham solution. 
  Balazs: The Bos-Nagymaros issue disturbs 
Hungarian-Slovak relations considerably. However, the Hungarian 
Green Party is urging the construction of the power stations at 
Dunakiliti and Nagymaros. What is your opinion of this, as the 
chairman of the Environmental Protection Committee and as a 
member of the Coexistence Movement? 
  Rozsa: The recognition of differences is one of 
the major principles of Coexistence. A given country is trying 
to make use of this within its legal system for the benefit of 
the recognition of national minorities. Therefore, allow me not 
to interfere in the party struggles and the party concepts of 
another country. We will only get the guarantee of national 
minority recognition if we find the proper tone with the 
government at the given time and the given moment. If I speak 
about any of the political parties in Hungary, I will reopen the 
alleged or real wounds that threaten the constitutional 
guarantees of recognition of the ethnic Hungarians living here, 
because we would again be accused of looking at Hungary and 
being led by Hungary. We could achieve results in the current 
political situation by not mentioning the facts and events 
outside the country. We are now preparing a law according to 
which large-scale projects cannot be carried out without the 
opinion of the public. The Slovak and Hungarian citizens living 
in the proximity of the dams should be the ones to express their 
opinions about the construction projects at Dunakiliti and 
Nagymaros and, according to these opinions, one could say 
whether the project is good or bad. I detect a slight lack of 
responsibility in the fact that the Hungarian Green Party made 
declarations without being aware of these opinions. 
  Balazs: What are the harmful environmental effects 
of the Bos power station on the Csallokoz area? 
  Rozsa: Opinions differ on the level of the ground 
water at Csallokoz. Some people say that the level has 
increased; others say that the level has decreased. It is 
impossible to find this out in such a short time. 
  Balazs: Do you find it unfair that while the 
drinking water of 47,000 people in the Szigetkoz area is 
endangered, no noticeable damage whatsoever has emerged at the 
Csallokoz? 
  Rozsa:We warned the Hungarians in time that the 
Slovaks would carry out the C version of the power station. You 
did not believe us at the time. The Slovak leadership made an 
issue of prestige out of this, and it mobilized all its power to 
carry out this plan. With the construction of the power station 
at Dunakiliti, the distribution of water would have been in the 
Hungarians' hands. But the Hungarians rejected the idea, and 
thus they are now at the mercy of the Slovak side. 
  Balazs:What chances of a joint solution do you see 
in the current situation? 
  Rozsa:The basic concept of a broad coalition on 
this issue is that we must settle the conflict with our 
neighbors. We must negotiate. You must understand that our 
broad coalition is so diverse that it will be difficult to carry 
out this process. It is not easy for the right and the left to 
come to a consensus. The solution can only be found in 
something similar to what was recently said in Prague, with the 
participation of the environmental protection committees of nine 
Central-European countries. National parks should be set up in 
natural areas divided up by borders, and the affected countries 
would share the responsibility for them.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on environmental issues monitored through 5 May: 
  ARGENTINA 
  The Naval Prefecture reported on 25 April that more than 
20,000 liters of diesel oil spilled into the sea after the 
Capitan Rey tug collided with the Alvamara II fishing vessel at 
the port of Ingeniero White, in Bahia Blanca. (Buenos Aires 
NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS in Spanish 1904 GMT 25 Apr 94) 
  BOLIVIA 
  The Titicaca Lake Subregional Organization has reported that 
the Peruvian city of Puno is responsible for 80 percent of the 
Titicaca Lake contamination. It stated that despite efforts, 
the pollution level continues to increase, and many species of 
birth and fish could die out. (La Paz PRESENCIA in Spanish 14 
Apr 94 p 6) 
  The Oruro Development Corporation will clean up the Uru-Uru 
and Poopo Lakes, which have been contaminated by mining 
activities for many years. Agronomist Jaime Ramirez Velazques, 
the Fishing Development Center deputy director, said that the 
intense mining activity has completely destroyed the flora and 
fauna through the indiscriminate dumping of chemicals into the 
lakes. (Cochabamba LOS TIEMPOS in Spanish 26 Apr 94 p A10) 
  BRAZIL 
  The first aeolic power plant will begin operation on 27 
April 
in Serra do Camelinho, in the municipality of Curvelo, Recife,

  Brazilian and National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
experts detected in October that the level of gas concentration 
in the ozone layer dropped between 15 to 20 percent over Santa 
Maria, Rio Grande do Sul State. Previous studies conducted by 
the National Institute of Space Research, INPE, showed that the 
ozone layer concentration was high in Brazil. (Sao Paulo FOLHA

effective 90 days after its publication in the official gazette. 
It states that importation will be allowed only ``in extremely 
necessary cases.'' (Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in

  [Text] The historic global conference on Sustainable 
Development of Small Island Developing States [SIDS] continues 
to be plagued with controversy. One of the environmental groups, 
Greenpeace, currently attending the conference, says the SIDS 
conference is not addressing important environmental issues. 
Anna (Toney), the head of the Greenpeace delegation, now in 
Barbados, spoke with Michelle Arthur about this matter. 
  [Begin recording] Arthur:According to 
Miss (Toney), the [word indistinct] conference is not adequately 
dealing with environmental issues. She says that the real 
conference promises were made to host the conference on 
sustainable development [words indistinct], but what is 
happening is Barbados is another talk shop. 
  Toney: Two years later, we come here to Barbados, 
and yet again a lot of rhetoric, and I really do believe that 
there be threats of environment [words indistinct] development 
are so big that they can no longer wait, so [words indistinct] 
action plan do germinate some of the issues with very much 
concern such as climate change, such as [word indistinct] 
(bleaching), fisheries and others, we really hope the developed 
countries will try to give in much more on the international 
side of the action plan because it is all very well to tell the 
small developing states what they should be doing at home when 
you know that they do not really have to contribute too much for 
the environmental problems they are now facing [as heard]. 
  Arthur: The Greenpeace delegate is also concerned 
about the amount of paper and plastic materials used at the UN 
conference. She said the number of press releases and plastic 
cups and plates being used should be reduced. Greenpeace also 
plans to meet with the Barbados fishing community within the 
next few days. Miss Toney says there are many common problems 
facing the fishing communities all over the world. The 
Greenpeace ship is now docked in Barbados. [end

  [Text] ANF -- At an international antinarcotics conference 
that has been under way in Quito, Ecuador, since last week, 
Social Defense Secretary Mario Soliz said that the Colombian 
cartels, and mainly the Cali cartel, are establishing themselves 
in Bolivia to produce cocaine on a large scale. 
  ``We could be facing the imminent and increasing transfer of 
foreign criminal drug organizations to Bolivia,'' said Soliz, in 
a speech before the 12th International Drug Enforcement 
Conference (IDEC). 
  He said that the drug trafficking organizations, and 
especially those from Colombia, are able to subjugate the most 
important indigenous organizations in gaining control over the 
entire drug circuit, from producing coca to cocaine paste, 
refined cocaine, and the export and marketing of pure cocaine. 
  He added: ``The Colombian drug rings hope to establish their 
own supply system for the chemicals they need, as it is known 
that they want to complete the circuit by refining their own 
production.'' 
  Soliz said that to estimate the presence of illegal 
chemicals 
in Bolivian territory ``is a frightening exercise, as the huge 
border regions shared with our neighbors are the natural habitat 
for unique species of animals and plants, with rivers full of an 
impressive variety of fish, and with fertile land suitable for 
all manner of cultivation.'' 
  Soliz added: ``This entire habitat where ancient ethnic 
groups live, forming a natural ecosystem, alive and without 
contamination, is now in danger due to the voracity of drug 
traffickers and their suppliers of chemicals.''

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Deborah Berlinck in Geneva] </F>
  [Text] Brazilian Ambassador Luiz Felipe Lampreia was 
yesterday elected chairman of a group of countries that will 
propose a number of recommendations on trade and environmental 
issues to the future World Trade Organization (WTO). These 
issues could generate a great many controversies for the future 
organization, as several countries, Brazil included, are afraid 
that some countries, like the United States, could use 
environmental protection to erect new protectionist barriers. 
  The WTO, which will start functioning in January 1995, will 
regulate all of the agreements reached during the Uruguay Round 
of the GATT talks and approved this month in Marrakech, thus 
putting an end to the most ambitious global GATT negotiations to 
liberalize world trade in history. The idea of the group led by 
Brazil is to pave the way for the WTO to reach an agreement to 
reconcile the requirements contained in the many environmental 
protection treaties, including those approved in the Rio-92 
Conference, with trade regulations. 
  This will not be an easy task: American environmentalists, 
for instance, do not want the issue discussed at the WTO, 
claiming that trade interests will prevail and that 
environmental standards will suffer. It is the pressure of 
these environmentalists that is forcing shrimp catchers in the 
Brazilian northeastern region to install a new device in their 
fishing nets to avoid the risk of killing turtles while catching 
shrimp. A U.S. law protecting turtles enables the U.S. 
Government today to ban imports of Brazilian shrimp. 
  In 1991, the United States banned imports of Mexican tuna 
fish over the use of inappropriate nets that were risking the 
lives of dolphins. The case was taken to GATT, but Mexico 
itself withdrew the case later when it was trying to join NAFTA.

<F P=106> [Report by Hernan Cisternas Arellano in Valparaiso] </F>
  [Text] Chilean President Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle last night 
announced the government's decision to propose initiatives that 
would enhance Chile's presence on the high seas and would give 
credence to the government's intention to protect marine areas 
falling within the national jurisdiction. 
  Frei said that the government is aware that the sea is one 
of 
the bases for national development, and he thus wants to act 
accordingly in that area. 
  He noted that the government will decisively support the 
modernization of the Navy, which plays a key role in 
safeguarding Chilean sovereignty, in effectively patrolling the 
sea, and in protecting Chilean rights on the high seas. 
  Frei said that he would continue to develop a comprehensive 
fishing policy, which at this stage should reinforce its 
administrative mechanisms to promote equitable access to these 
resources and make rational use of them. 
  Frei announced publicly that he is committed to creating the 
conditions for and facilities to bring about the adequate 
improvement and development of the ports, which he characterized 
as the backbone of Chile's maritime presence. In this regard, 
he emphasized the decision to incorporate the private sector in 
developing these ports. 
  Frei was the only speaker last night at the opening ceremony 
of the Month of the Sea celebration. He thus became the first 
chief executive to open this celebration since it was instituted 
20 years ago by Admiral Jose Toribio Merino, retired. 
  Attending the ceremony, which was held at the Playa Ancha 
naval auditorium, were Defense Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma; 
Secretary General of the Presidency Genaro Arriada; Transport 
Minister Narciso Irureta; Chamber Speaker Jorge Schaulsohn; Navy 
Commander Jorge Martinez Busch; General Richard Quass, 
representing the Army; General Jose de la Fuente, representing 
the Air Force; General Fernando Cordero, representing the 
Carabineros; and members of the Navy high command, among other 
officials. 
  Frei stated that there have been contradictory 
interpretations of the right to fish on the high seas, which 
have led to the abusive depredation of resources and 
environmental degradation. 
  He called for an international regulation process to prevent 
this sort of abuse without affecting the fundamental freedom to 
fish or the high seas laws, and without aspiring to an extension 
of the national maritime jurisdiction. 
  Frei pointed out that the Convention on Sea Rights grants 
the 
country having the coastline the sovereign rights to explore, 
exploit, preserve, and administer natural resources within its 
exclusive economic zone. 
  He added, however, that regarding the shared fish species, 
these rights lose their validity because the country having the 
coastline has no ability to preserve and administer the said 
resources found beyond the 200 mile zone. 
  Frei explained that in order to improve the legislation on 
the high seas, which are conceived of as an asset for the public 
good, the objectives of Agenda 21 approved at the Rio-92 summit 
must be taken into account. 
  On this basis Frei pointed out that Chile has a five-point 
proposal which, as its first step, calls for international 
acceptance of the UN Convention on Sea Rights, which has been 
paralyzed as a result of disputes over ocean mining. 
  The said proposal considers first of all the negotiation of 
an international convention on the preservation of fish species 
that live in various zones and are highly migratory.

Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina also held bilateral 
meetings with members of the delegations from Trinidad and 
Tobago, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, and Guyana; and in all 
cases, the support of Cuba and the rejection of the blockade 
have prevailed. Likewise, the delegates conveyed positive 
expressions of support to Cuba's entry into the Association of 
Caribbean States. 
  At the conclusion of the first day of work by the 
highest-level members of the conference delegations, the path to 
the Declaration of Barbados and the action plan has been paved. 
These documents will be approved at the closing of the 
conference's debates. 
  The need to defend our natural resources and to establish 
policies to enhance the environment, and the quest for ways that 
lead to the survival of the small insular states are the main 
prevailing proposals in this conference. 
  According to the agenda, the first Global Conference on 
Sustainable Development will conclude tomorrow. This conference 
has been going on in the capital of Barbados since 25 April. 
Over the past two days, several chiefs of states and of 
governments have joined experts and active members of various 
organizations participating in this conference.

  [Text] There cannot be sustainable development for a part 
of the world, and underdevelopment for the rest. This was said 
by Cuban President Fidel Castro on 5 May at the First 
International Small Island Nations Conference. In his address to 
the plenum of the summit, comprising approximately 50 
delegations in Barbados, Fidel pointed out that the problem of 
sustainable development will not be solved unless there is a 
more equitable distribution of the world's wealth. 
  Fidel added: We are islands a few meters above sea level. We 
ask ourselves what will happen when the water level rises, and 
whether we will be able to withstand the droughts, hurricanes, 
and other weather disasters awaiting us. Fidel also pointed out: 
We are not responsible for this; others colonized and exploited 
us. Consumer societies have destroyed the environment. 
  Commander in chief Fidel Castro today emphasized that while 
annual per capita income of Switzerland is $34,000; Bangladesh, 
with over 100 million habitants, and in danger of disappearing 
underwater, has a per capita income of barely $210. Castro said 
this during the 5 May session of the First International Small 
Island Nations Conference being held in Bridgetown, Barbados. 
  Castro added that the arms race continues, weapons sales are 
on the increase, the most powerful nations sell the most 
weapons, and do not mind profiting from the deaths of others. 
Why should they care about the environment and the fact that 
islands are sinking underwater? 
  All the heads of state and government present in Barbados 
are 
participating in today's meeting; they are scheduled, on 6 May, 
to approve a program for action on sustainable development for 
small island nations.

  [Text] ``Is clean air a luxury we can't afford any more?'' 
That was the plaintive question raised by a citizen's body, 
People United for Better Living in Calcutta (PUBLIC), in its 
posters and hoardings on the eve of Earth Day last fortnight. 
The answer may already be a resounding ``yes'' as a startling 
new study by the renowned School of Environmental Studies at 
Calcutta's' Jadavpur University reveals. 
  The study released last month clearly establishes that 
Calcutta's air is the most poisonous in India. In the process 
it demolishes the widely held view that Delhi's air is more 
polluted than Calcutta's. Now the levels of noxious sulphur 
dioxide and nitrogen oxide in Calcutta are at least four times 
more than those of the country's capital. The overall suspended 
particulate matter in Calcutta's atmosphere is three times more 
than that present in Delhi. 
  For Calcuttans, to whom choking comes as naturally as 
breathing, this dubious distinction may come as no surprise. 
There are 11,516 factories, both small and large, spewing 
poisonous gases into the city's air. And adding to the lethal 
cocktail are the exhaust fumes of some 5.25 lakh automobiles. 
Yet, remarkably, the most serious source of urban atmospheric 
pollution may well be a `traditional' one: the coal burning 
chullahs on which about 70 percent of the city's population rely 
for their cooking. 
  For the past 10 years, a team of scholars from Jadavpur 
University's School of Environmental Studies led by its 
director, Dr. Dipankar Chakraborti, have been studying air 
pollution in Calcutta during the peak winter months--from the 
end of October to February--when the city turns into a veritable 
gas chamber. 
  The study found that the concentration of most pollutants 
(such as sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide) 
had shot up alarmingly over the past seven years, but the rise 
in the level of one indicator--suspended particulate matter--was 
particularly sharp. This rose from 800 micrograms per cubic 
metre (mpcm) in 1987 to 1,325 mpcm in 1994. Researchers were 
particularly disturbed to find that a significant proportion of 
the particulate matter count was made up of benzene soluble 
organic matter (BSOM), which can be highly toxic and 
frighteningly carcinogenic. 
  Calcutta's pollution counts are all the more alarming when 
compared to those of the world's other smog capitals. In the 
winter of 1993-94, the average concentration of benzene in 
Calcutta's air was found to be more than 500 mpcm as against Los 
Angeles' figure of only 80 mpcm. While Los Angeles' vehicular 
concentration is unparalleled, Calcutta's chullahs more than 
make up for this. ``The dangerous benzene source is not the 
automobile exhausts alone,'' says Dr. Chakraborti. ``This is 
also due to the rampant coal burning in the city.'' However, 
another alarming revelation--the abnormally high organo-lead 
concentration in the city's air which is more than four times 
that of Los Angeles or London's, has been linked to 
Tetraalkyllead used in petrol. 
  While the noxious substances lacing Calcutta's air are known 
to be harmful, no studies have so far been conducted to 
determine the effect of atmospheric pollution on public health 
in the city. And perhaps many Calcuttans would rather spare 
their nerves than hear about the long term risk of cancer, or of 
the teratogenic (gene altering) pollutants they breathe. But 
there's no escaping the rising levels of asthma and other 
bronchial disorders that are already plaguing the city's 
residents. 
  The only silver lining in this dark pall is the fact that 
Calcutta's air pollution levels dip sharply during the monsoons 
when wind and rain scrub the skies clean for a while. But given 
the extent of the pollution in the five months after October, 
this is little consolation. 
  Clearly, it's time for panic stations, and the March for 
Clean Air by Calcuttans last fortnight was a timely effort. But 
before the city of palaces and gardens turns into a permanent 
gas chamber, the citizens and the Government need to combat the 
menace on a war footing.

<F P=106> [Interview with V. A. Bakunin, chairman of the Oblast </F>
Committee on Ecology and Rational Use of Nature, by M. Fonotov; 
place and date not given: ``Ecology of Decline''] 
  [Text] 
  Fonotov: Vasiliy Aleksandrovich, in line with 
established tradition we must make our fourth summary of the 
ecological year, this time for 1993. In order to start a fire it 
is necessary to toss in some statistical firewood. Please give 
us some figures for last year. Let us start with the atmosphere. 
Is the air we breathe cleaner? Are discharges into the air basin 
of industrial enterprises decreasing? Please. 
  Bakunin: I will cite some figures not just for 
last year, but for the five-year period--our committee was 
created five years ago. 
  Thus, in 1993 discharges from stationary sources went down 
13.9 percent, or by 256,000 tonnes. That is the highest index in 
recent years. 
  Here are more details: Some 2,624,000 tonnes of harmful 
substances were discharged into the atmosphere in 1988, whereas 
in 1993 it was 1,883,000 tonnes. Over five years the decrease 
amounted to 741,000 tonnes. 
  Fonotov: That is almost as much as was discharged 
five years ago by Magnitogorsk. This is impressive! But let us 
return to 1993. Interpret the discharges in that year. 
  Bakunin: The following picture appears. Out of 
256,000 tonnes--that was the decrease in discharges last year, 
only 40 percent was accounted for by implementation of measures 
for the protection of nature. 
  Fonotov: What about the rest? 
  Bakunin: The other 60 percent was accounted for by 
curtailment of production. 
  Fonotov: For example? 
  Bakunin: For example, Magnitogorsk, which was 
mentioned. Last year enterprises in the city discharged 434,000 
tonnes into the atmosphere. If one recalls, it used to be 
856,000 tonnes. The Sintering Plant No 1, Open-Hearth Shop No 3, 
and open-hearth furnaces No. 3, 5, 30, and 31, as well as blast 
furnace No. 3 along with the coke furnace batteries, and other 
facilities were closed down. 
  Fonotov: What about Chelyabinsk? 
  Bakunin: The decrease in discharges in Chelyabinsk 
last year was limited. Just 49,000 tonnes. Only 4,600 tonnes of 
which was accounted for by measures for the protection of the 
air. The rest also resulted from a cutback in production 
  Fonotov: The notorious ESPTs-1 [Electronic Steel 
Smelting Shop-1] at the metallurgical combine has finally been 
stopped. 
  Bakunin: Yes. It was mothballed as of 15 February 
of this year. 
  Fonotov: What does mothballing mean? 
  Bakunin: It means that operation was halted but 
the equipment was not removed. What happens with the shop in the 
future is up to the combine. 
  Fonotov: How about the workers? 
  Bakunin: The workers were transferred to other 
sectors, but apparently even the ChMK [Chelyabinsk Metallurgical 
Combine] will not be able to avoid manpower cuts. 
  Fonotov: Something else has closed in Chelyabinsk? 
  Bakunin: Of course. Some of the equipment at the 
ChEMK [Chelyabinsk Electrometallurgical Combine], the tube 
rolling-plant, the Stankomash, the abrasives combine, the 
Kolyushchenko Plant, and elsewhere has been taken out of 
operation. At the same time emissions increased at the TETs-1 
[Heat and Power Plant] and TETs-2 as natural gas is replaced 
with coal. The consumption of gas also went down in the city as 
a whole because of production cuts. That is why the city and 
oblast administration appealed to the government with a request 
to increase the delivery of gas to the power engineers, but 
Moscow is yet to respond. 
  Fonotov: Can you also name some other cities? 
  Bakunin: I can. The Troitsk GRES [State Regional 
Electric Power Station] diminished discharges by 63,000 tonnes, 
but unfortunately, also through a decline in the generation of 
electric power. The volume of emissions decreased in Satka and a 
number of other cities. 
  Fonotov: What about Karabash? 
  Bakunin: Karabash decreased its discharge tenfold 
last year and even more now. In essence that combine has been 
stopped. The city was left with no work to do. 
  Fonotov: About the ecology of 1993 it will 
probably be possible to say that this was the ecology of 
production cutbacks. The closing down of furnaces, shops, and 
entire plants, of course, promoted a healthier environment. At 
one time, however, we were not counting on that kind of 
``success.'' You must remember, of course, how strongly 
Chelyabinsk workers demanded the closing of the ESPTs-1 at ChMK. 
So many angry words were spoken, so many accusatory petitions 
were compiled! The ESPTs-1 is now closed but no rejoicing 
because of that is heard. 
  The decrease in production blunted the problem of ecology 
but 
did not eliminate it, merely postponing it. The best solution 
probably lies in the replacement of old manufacturing methods 
with new ones. Vasiliy Alkesandrovich, how do you and your 
committee view the idea supporting a revival of Karabash as 
proposed by the Klyuch Joint-Stock Company? 
  Bakunin: It is a good idea. We reviewed the 
proposed manufacturing methods and approved them. They are 
suitable not only for Karabash but for all of the other 
metallurgical centers which have accumulated mountains of waste 
products. But there are no funds. It would seem that only 
limited funds are needed to start but even that is not 
available. The oblast administration and the oblast ecological 
fund appropriated some money but without government help such a 
project is apparently impossible. 
  Fonotov: I want to ask you about another 
``famous'' facility--the ESPTs-6 at the ChMK. As we all know the 
construction of that shop was received by city residents in a 
rather ambiguous manner. Then interest in it vanished. What is 
its fate? Is it being built or was it ``frozen?'' 
  Bakunin: The working committee accepted ESPTs-6. 
In the immediate future the facility should be accepted by the 
state commission. In other words, the shop is ready. However it 
is difficult to predict its fate under the new conditions. It is 
apparently a complex situation. 
  Fonotov: Last year only a few scrubbers, filters, 
and other installations for the protection of the environment 
were built. That is understandable. The economy is concerned 
with other matters. Does this mean that ecology will be of 
secondary concern this year as well? 
  Bakunin: In the course of the year it was 
necessary to carry out 41 measures. We are speaking about such 
cities as Plast, Verkhnii Ufaley, Vishnevogorsk, Satka, and 
Bakval. 
  Fonotov: And in Chelyabinsk? 
  Bakunin: In Chelyabinsk practically nothing was 
completed. It is sufficient to say that a gas scrubber for 
ESPTs-3 furnaces has been under construction for many years at 
the ChMK. The reason for that is a lack of funds. 
  Fonotov: But it is said that enterprises are 
paying a lot for polluting the environment? 
  Bakunin: That depends on the viewpoint. What does 
``a lot'' mean? The standards were introduced in 1991, before 
August 1993 they were merely doubled. This year it is expected 
that they will be increased tenfold. During that period, 
however, the cost of production went up by a factor of over a 
thousand. 
  Last year enterprises paid around two billion rubles into 
the 
oblast ecological fund. A fourth of that was transferred by us 
into the federal fund. About another three billion rubles went 
into city and rayon funds. Judge for yourself whether that is a 
lot or not. 
  We spent over a billion rubles on the financing of 
facilities 
for the protection of the environment. The rest was spent on 
scientific research work and ecological propaganda. We helped 
the agricultural engineering and state universities establish 
departments of ecology. 
  Fonotov: The enterprises, however, are idle and it 
is awkward to pressure them. 
  Bakunin: It is, nevertheless, necessary to apply 
pressure, of course, when there is a real possibility of 
decreasing harmful emissions. If we did not pressure and fine 
managers the results would be different. 
  Fonotov: Now another traditional question about 
monitoring. I am talking about an automatic air quality 
monitoring system in Chelyabinsk and other cities. Is there any 
progress? 
  Bakunin: There is. The first monitoring station is 
located on our committee building--the sensor is on the roof of 
the building. Hourly monitoring of radiation is carried out. We 
also receive data on radiation conditions at Chelyabinsk-65 and 
in Kyshtym. Kaslinsk, Kunashaksk, and Argayashsk rayons are next. 
  Furthermore, the administration of Chelyabinsk established 
three chemical air-quality monitoring stations at the expense of 
its ecological fund. They are now being adjusted and calibrated. 
  As commonly known this work is being done by the KBM [Miass 
Design Bureau] of the city of Miass. 
  Fonotov: We have said something about the air. It 
is necessary to mention the water as well. 
  Bakunin: Work on purification of wastewater has 
not stopped but is being carried out with a lag in the 
fulfillment of the program. A circulating system was created at 
the Ashinskiy Wood-Chemical Plant. The intake of water from the 
Sim River was decreased. A circulating water supply system is 
under construction at the Kyshtym Machinery Plant. 
Reconstruction of purification structures at Kartaly has been 
delayed. Afterpurification structures on the right bank at 
Magnitogorsk have not been completed. It is time to place into 
operation purification facilities at the settlement of 
Fershamlenhuaz, at the Kragayskiy Bor rest home. 
  There is only one reason which is a lack of money. 
Nevertheless we shall strive for the introduction of those 
facilities in 1994. 
  Fonotov: How did we protect the forests last year? 
  Bakunin: We are devoting every effort in order to 
preserve forest resources because the forest in the Ural is not 
only raw material but first of all, pure air and clean water. 
Five years ago 2,200,000 cubic meters of timber were felled, 
while last year it was 1,500,000 cubic meters. We achieved such 
a decrease in felling through the creation of water reservoir 
and river forest shelter belts for water conservation. Two 
national parks, the Taganay and Zyuratkul parks, were opened 
with our cooperation. In addition to that, on the basis of our 
order the Yekaterinburg Forestry Institute studied the question 
concerning optimal age for coniferous forest clearing. It turned 
out that pine trees in the Ural should be felled starting with 
their 121st year, and not 20 years earlier. All that made it 
possible to substantially decrease felling and preserve the most 
valuable forests in the mountainous portion of our oblast. 
  Fonotov: You mentioned new national parks. How is 
their development progressing? 
  Bakunin: The directorate of the Taganay Park has 
started functioning. The decision regarding opening of the 
Zyuratkul Park was adopted at the end of last year but no funds 
have been allocated thus far. Initially our ecological fund 
allocated eight million rubles. One must hope that this year the 
forestry committee will initiate the financing of Zyuratkul Park. 
  Fonotov: Contradictory reports have appeared in 
the newspapers that the Ilmensk Preserve and the institute of 
mineralogy are being merged. What is the position of the 
committee with respect to that matter? 
  Bakunin: This is a sore subject. The thing is that 
the Ilmensk Preserve has always been a preserve and was never 
renamed while the Ural Branch of the Academy of Sciences decided 
to create the Ilmensk Preserve Scientific Association. In doing 
so it committed a number of legal blunders. By registering the 
association the administration of the city of Miass deprived the 
Ilmensk Preserve of its status as a preserve. Now it is an 
association governed by its own laws. The danger is that we 
might lose the Ilmensk Preserve. 
  Fonotov: So the dispute boils down to some finer 
points of the law? 
  Bakunin: Yes, but these are very important points. 
The issue was discussed at various levels a number of times but 
no final solution has been found. As far as I know the legal 
service of the oblast administration plans to appeal for 
arbitration requesting repeal of the decision of the Miass 
administration. On its part our committee has appealed to the 
Ministry for Environmental Protection with a request to 
``accept'' the Ilmensk Preserve into its agency. We proceeded 
from the fact that out of the 47 preserves in Russia, 41 are 
under the jurisdiction of our ministry. 
  In other words the Academy of Sciences had no right to 
reorganize the preserve. That can be done only by the government. 
  Fonotov: As I understand it neither side wishes to 
harm the preserve and, quite on the contrary, all are concerned 
for its well-being--why the conflict? 
  Bakunin: It is necessary to be very cautious with 
respect to this issue in order to avoid a mistake. The bylaws of 
the scientific association states that taxes on entrepreneurial 
activity will go into the budget of Miass. But what sort of 
entrepreneurial activity is that if preserves are not permitted 
to engage in it? At the same time there is some information that 
there is already trade in stones. Plans are being made for the 
building of ski runs and for construction of some kind of a 
laboratory with 25 residents, without our knowledge, on Miassovo 
Lake. 
  Fonotov: If the government refuses to maintain the 
preserve perhaps it should make some effort on its own in order 
to survive? 
  Bakunin: That is what we are telling the 
scientists--if you do not have the money to maintain the 
preserve, transfer it to our ministry. 
  Fonotov: It appears that the preserve might be 
lost because of the word ``association.'' 
  Bakunin: Exactly. The preserve belongs to the 
government and cannot be privatized. At the same time an 
association can be privatized and it could be, for instance, a 
joint-stock company. 
  At any rate, the question concerning the preserve must be 
resolved by the government. 
  Fonotov: Our conversation is coming to an end. It 
is possible to think that the public has lost interest in 
ecology. Is that good or bad? 
  Bakunin: Of course that is bad. In former years 
the public raised and helped to resolve many questions dealing 
with protection of the environment. That is not the case any 
longer. Everyone is concerned with day-to-day worries and does 
not look too far ahead. Our committee, however, will continue to 
work on improving the environment. Particularly since in the 
difficult time of reforms the tendency toward its improvement is 
preserved. Revival of the economy, in turn, will create 
conditions for renovation of equipment and assimilation of 
modern ecologically clean manufacturing methods.

  [Text] Seoul, May 2 (YONHAP) -- Russia is reportedly poised 
to include an environmental conservation provision as well as 
human rights protection in its new logging agreement with North 
Korea amid criticism over serious environmental depletion at 
Pyongyang-administered logging camps in Siberia, a Foreign 
Ministy official here said Monday. 
  International environmental groups have revealed that 
forests 
in the area have been severly damaged due to poor afforestation 
by the North Korean logging camps, the official said. 
  Russia will therefore push for a provision toughening 
environmental regulations as well as human rights protection in 
its new logging contract with North Korea, he said. 
  Pyongyang and Moscow are negotiating renewal of the 
contract, 
which expired at last year's end, but North Korea's 
unwillingness to accept the human rights protection provision is 
posing a hurdle. 
  ``International environmental groups are warning that if 
logging continues in Siberia, there will be major environmental 
problems since the Siberian forests are one of the world's major 
oxygen suppliers,'' the official said. 
  Greenpeace International says more than 15,000 North Korean 
workers at the logging camps randomly kill wild animals, 
including bears. 
  The current North Korea-Russia logging agreement has a 
provision on afforestation after logging, but Moscow wants to 
toughen regulations, the official said.

  [Text] Russia has no agreements on the import of 
radioactive waste generated at the nuclear power plants built 
with the help of the former USSR, Russia's Environment Minister 
Viktor Danilov-Danilyan told a news conference in Moscow. The 
minister pointed out that the law on environmental protection, 
brought into effect at the beginning of 1992, categorically bans 
the import of radioactive waste for dumping. He denied 
speculation that at the recent talks with his Norwegian 
counterpart, Thorbjorn Berntsen, agreement was reached to build 
a repository for radioactive waste from Norway in the Russian 
north.

  [Text] Vladivostok April 29 TASS -- Russia and Japan 
decided to build facilities in the Maritime Territory to store 
and utilise liquid radioactive waste. The decision was taken as 
a result of work by a Russian-Japanese intergovernment 
commission on settling one of the most pressing far eastern 
problems: storage and processing of liquid radioactive waste in 
the Maritime Territory. 
  Commission Member Yevgeniy Stomatyuk, chairman of the 
territorial committee on natural resources, told a news 
conference in Vladivostok on Friday that the two sides reached 
agreement to build a mobile facility in Japan in the near future. 
  It will store liquid radioactive waste from Russian 
nuclear-powered submarines till a stationary system for 
utilising waste is built. 
  The final discussion of the two projects will be held in 
Moscow and Tokyo at the top level. Their bilateral 
implementation will start in the latter part of May.

<F P=106> [Article under the ``Ecology'' rubric by Candidate of </F>
Economic Sciences Igor Dubov, President of the `Ekoresurs' 
Intersectoral Economic Association: ``Would That I Had 
Mountains of Gold and Tax Concessions. More than A Billion 
Tonnes of Solid Waste Poisoning the Environment''] 
  [Text] An inadvertent misprint once revealed surprisingly 
accurately the nub of the problem: The words ``ash waste'' 
[``zoloshlakovyye otkhody''] had been replaced by the words 
``gold waste'' [``zolotoshlakovyye otkhody'']. Indeed, if the 
solid waste of thermal electric power stations is divided into 
its different elements and projected onto Mendeleyev's table 
they would cover it so comprehensively that some gold-bearing 
veins might seem a lot poorer. These waste products contain 
gold, silver, and such rare metals as germanium, vanadium, 
strontium, scandium, and lithium. Around 96 tonnes of gold alone 
could be extracted from the waste produced at our thermal 
electric power stations! 
  Prior to 1989, when the problem of recycling ash waste was 
under the state's control, the curve showing the volume of 
recycling rose constantly, reaching a figure of 16.3 million 
tonnes for the USSR as a whole or 15 percent of annual 
production (the figure abroad is around 55 percent). This work 
was included in our national economic plan and centralized 
capital investments were allocated to the development of 
reprocessing capacities. 
  In recent years, however, because of the lack of effective 
rules governing market mutual relations, the curve showing the 
recycling of ash waste in Russia has begun to steadily decline. 
Last year just 3.0 million tonnes or around 7 percent of annual 
output was reprocessed. In all there are more than 1 billion 
tonnes of solid waste accumulated in waste dumps at thermal 
electric power stations, which occupy over 20,000 hectares of 
land. 
  When the discussion turns to state regulation, many people 
for some reason take this to mean a return to the old ways, to a 
rigid system of planning, to the budget financing of all and 
sundry, strict executive discipline, and so forth. State 
regulation as we understand it (for the transitional period) 
means movement toward full-fledged market relations in which the 
system of direct economic benefit works faultlessly. But for 
this system to begin operating the state and the local 
authorities must adopt the necessary legislative and legal acts. 
  For example, the corresponding taxation must be used to 
practically close off access to natural resources if they can be 
replaced by ash waste without causing a deterioration in the 
technical characteristics of output. Preferential taxation and 
credit can be introduced for enterprises which reprocess those 
waste products. State regulation or, more accurately, state 
participation would also include an insignificant proportion of 
budget financing, which the state would use for scientific 
research and experimental design work of a problematic 
intersectoral character, and in the sphere of capital investment 
for the creation of pilot projects for the reprocessing of major 
quantities of these waste products measured in tonnes. 
Statistical accounting and the radiation safety of the use of 
ash waste must be kept under state patronage, as must other 
questions affecting society's interests. 
  The conclusion is obvious: The problem must be resolved at 
federal level and the interests of the components of the 
Federation must be taken into account. The ``Ekoresurs'' 
Intersectoral Economic Association, founded at the end of 1990 
by the USSR Energy Ministry, the Moscow City Soviet Executive 
Committee, and energy and science-and-production associations, 
produced a number of proposals which it put to the government in 
August 1992. They formed a basis for the study of the 
subprogram ``Reprocessing of thermal electric power station ash 
waste products'' within the federal targeted program ``Fuel and 
Energy.'' This is where regional and federal interests were 
brought together. 
If the regional measure envisages the construction of a 
reprocessing enterprise with a capacity of over 500,000 cubic 
meters of waste a year, it is the opinion of the authors of the 
subprogram that it has the right to expect the support of the 
federal authorities -- in the form of budget financing or 
preferential taxation. Only the urgent creation of multitonne 
reprocessing capacities can halt the catastrophic accumulation 
of waste products and reduce their negative impact on the 
natural environment. 
  As for economic efficiency, in a cost-based economy where 
the 
cost price of materials was included in the volumes of work and 
affected the fulfillment of the set plan, trying to force the 
construction industry to use cheap ash waste materials instead 
of costly materials (sand, ballast, or gravel) was virtually 
impossible. It is only now, even with only local tax 
regulators, that it is possible to implement a policy for the 
extensive replacement of natural inert and bonding materials 
with ash waste products. 
  In December 1993 the government approved the draft federal 
targeted program ``Fuel and Energy.'' The Russian Ministry of 
Fuel and Energy was defined as the state client of the 
subprogram ``Processing of thermal electric power station ash 
waste products'' with the ``Ekoresurs'' Intersectoral Economic 
Association defined as the executor and at the same time its 
author. The subprogram does not envisage state dependence. No 
more than 15-20 percent of the total volume of expenditure 
should be borne by the federal authorities. All the rest is to 
come from non-budget funds, first and foremost ecological funds, 
from bank credits, and from enterprises' own resources. The 
final say in this matter should belong to the Federal Assembly, 
which is empowered not only to ratify the indicators in the 
subprogram but also to adopt the law ``On solid waste resulting 
from production and consumption,'' which Russia urgently needs.

<F P=106> [Article by Anton Trofimov under the heading ``Experience'': </F>
``Payment for Fear: The Problem of How To Transport Radioactive 
Materials Exists Both in Russia and in the West''] 
  [Text] The issue of how to safely transport uranium and 
other radioactive substances is a timely one and, contrary to 
popular opinion, not just for Russia, though for fairness' sake 
it should be noted that the problem is more acute here. This was 
the subject of discussion at a seminar entitled ``Transportation 
of Uranium,'' sponsored by European Union experts and the 
Uranerz Consortium. The seminar was held at the Voronovo Resort 
near Moscow and was the second in a series, with the first held 
at the same site in later June and early July of last year. 
  Western experts, concerned with the state of affairs in 
Russia, are attempting to demonstrate how they are solving the 
problems involved in ensuring safe transportation of ionizing 
sources, to understand what Russian specialists can do in that 
direction right now and, eventually, to find a way to integrate 
our country's safety system (which remains to definitively take 
shape) with the Western system. 
  The corresponding agencies in the West, both national and 
international, pay particular attention to the development of 
monitoring measures to prevent incidents during transport and to 
mitigate their effects. Among those measures are development of 
design standards both for the means of transportation and the 
transportation routes. Standards have also been developed for 
special transport containers which, as is well known, can cause 
the greatest unpleasantness if they are not built according to 
the necessary standards. In the West these ``packages'' undergo 
appropriate testing. For example, drop tests, compression, depth 
testing, resistance to physical damage, heat resistance and 
water resistance. Our country's containers currently undergo the 
same tests, but as of the fourth quarter of this year Russia 
will have new regulations specifying container standards. 
Furthermore, Russian experts are of the opinion that current 
standards should be stricter than those approved by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency in 1985. 
  However, these issues are more specific than general. The 
latter type of issue includes things like the creation of a 
unified system to ensure safe transportation of radioactive 
materials in Russia and development of procedures to be used in 
the event of the worst-case scenario: a transportation accident. 
Even though fortunately thus far neither Russia nor any other 
place in the world has experienced a single serious incident, 
the danger is always there. Toward this end Western specialists 
have drawn up accident plans regulating actions by all 
organizations at every stage of clean-up efforts. Now Russian 
specialists have had an opportunity to familiarize themselves 
with those plans, and one would hope that Russia will soon have 
such an essential unified ``accident system'' as well. The first 
step in that direction was taken in Moscow when efforts by 
almost 30 various agencies working on this issue were combined 
under the Ministry for Emergency Situations [Ministerstvo po 
chrezvychaynym situatsiyam (MChS)]. 
  Also participating in discussion of all these issues, 
together with Russian participants (of which there were 26, plus 
specialists from Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Kirghizia and Uzbekistan) 
were specialists from the companies that comprise the Uranerz 
Consortium. They had only one complaint: the seminar was not 
attended by any specialists from the MChS, the Russian Ministry 
of Atomic Energy's Main Administration for Emergency Situations 
or similar agencies. However, according to the sponsors a 
special seminar for that type of structure will be held in the 
near future.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Yegorov report: ``Norwegian Minister Is Not </F>
Afraid of the Komsomolets''] 
  [Text] A meeting has ended in Moscow between Viktor 
Danilov-Danilyan, Russian Federation minister of environmental 
protection and natural resources, and Thorbjorn Berntsen, 
Norwegian environment minister, pertaining to the widening of 
bilateral and multilateral cooperation in the field of 
environmental protection. 
  The ministers stated at a press conference that they share 
the public concern over the threat of the Barents Sea region's 
being polluted by radioactive waste, its pollution from across 
the border by nickel-producing enterprises located in the border 
regions, and from accidents at nuclear facilities. They 
therefore think that it is necessary to carry out without delay 
cooperation projects planned by both sides, the most important 
among which is modernization of the Pechenganikel combine. In 
the final analysis, modernization is expected to result in 
cutting dioxin emissions to 40,000 tonnes against the 250,000 
tonnes emitted in 1992. 
  It was noted at the press conference that the combine 
reconstruction concept submitted by a consortium of two 
Norwegian firms and one Swedish firm has been recognized as the 
winner in an international contest for the right to develop it. 
The ``Norilsk Nickel'' concern together with the Russian 
Economy Ministry are currently preparing a draft government 
decree on financing the modernization taking account of the 
share provided by the Norwegian side (about $40 million). 
  To the question on Norway's stance on an alleged plutonium 
leak from the damaged hull of the lost Komsomolets 
nuclear-powered submarine, Minister T. Berntsen answered: ``We 
keep a close watch on the situation. We are convinced that the 
submarine should not be disturbed needlessly. And there is no 
such need, our experts believe.''

  [Text] The collegium of Russia's Environment Ministry has 
approved a draft program called Waste, worked out in accordance 
with government instructions and designed to a formulate a 
unified national policy toward handling production and 
consumption waste. 
  To be implemented before the year 2000, the program will 
require financing worth more than one trillion rubles (over 800 
million dollars). The funds are to come from the federal 
budget, from the Federal Ecological Fund, from regional budgets 
and ecological funds, as well as from enterprises and commercial 
structures. 
  About 7 billion tons of waste is formed in Russia annually, 
with only 28 percent put to use. The total quantity of the 
accumulated toxic and ecologically dangerous waste has reached 
1.6 billion tons. 
  The program provides for utilizing the waste containing 
mercury, one of the substances most dangerous to human health. 
This waste will be processed at the smelting plant of the 
Krasnodar mercury mines--the only facility of this kind 
functioning in Russia. 
  According to the authors of the document, one of the gravest 
problems is to utilize the waste of chromium-related production, 
no country in the world has resolved yet. According to last 
year's data, Russia has accumulated 9 million tons of this kind 
of waste, which is stored at the Khrompik plant in Sverdlovsk 
Region and at the Novotroitsk chromium combinations plant in 
Orenburg Region. As the authors of the program said, should the 
reservoirs containing such waste get damaged because of wear or 
natural disaster, the toxic chromium may create in the basin of 
the Rivers Chusovaya, Volga and Ural a catastrophic situation 
comparable with the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear-power 
plant. 
  The authors believe that the problem of utilizing the waste 
of chromium-related production in Russia can be partially 
resolved by means of introducing special technology, which makes 
it possible to transmute chromium into a non-toxic substance and 
obtain from it building materials for covering floors and 
tiling. This method was devised by a research center in 
Yekaterinburg. 
  Furthermore, the Waste program provides for processing and 
utilizing some other kinds of production and consumption waste, 
particularly zinc-containing waste and the waste of the 
cellulose and timber industries.

<F P=106> [S. Litus video report; from the ``Dalniy Vostok'' program] </F>
  [Text] What is to be done with the radioactive waste which 
has accumulated in great quantities in our kray is an ominous 
issue which does not seem to leave newspapers and television 
programs these days. The tanker TNT 5 filled with radioactive 
water is still moored at Zvezda in Bolshoy Kamen. Furthermore, 
the condition of the vessel is such that there is no guarantee 
the death-dealing contents will not spill out into the bay in 
the near future. This would be an ecological catastrophe. 
[video shows a nuclear submarine in dry dock, a rusty 
tanker, a person testing radioactivity in the presence of a 
naval officer, and a group of people inspecting the tanker] 
  Until recently, the liquid radioactive waste was simply 
poured into the sea. Now, thanks to the active protests of the 
world community, such dumping is forbidden. What are weto do? 
The Japanese Government is offering to help us solve this 
problem. Representatives of the neighboring states arrived in 
the Maritime Kray, and together with our government 
representatives and specialists they visited Bolshoy Kamen, 
after which they held a meeting at the kray administration. 
However, this conference gave rise to a strange feeling. The 
sensation was that the terrible misfortune hanging over the 
Maritime Kray concerns the Japanese Government far more than the 
Russian Government. The Japanese say they are prepared to try 
various approaches, allocate millions of dollars, and build and 
assemble installations to process the radioactive waste. 
However, they need assurances. Where, when, and what will be 
the degree of Russian participation? From Russia there is only 
incomprehensible haggling and no assurances. [video shows 
a meeting of Japanese and Russian officials, then cuts to show 
Litus interviewing Ye.I. Nazdratenko, leader of the Maritime 
Kray administration] 
  [Begin Nazdratenko recording] You know very well 
that the people of the Maritime Kray have voted overwhelmingly 
for the new Constitution. They set a Russian Federation record; 
72 percent of Maritime Kray voters cast a ballot. No other part 
of the country did that. Maritime Kray once again proved its 
maturity and citizenship. Maritime Kray residents once again 
underscored that there should be integrity in Russia as stated 
in the Constitution. The representatives of the federal 
authorities here today said: you are here, it is your problem 
and you have to solve it. I get the impression that the 
Maritime Kray residents are like a dog which is kind and devoted 
to its master. No matter how much the master abuses, 
humiliates, or hurts it, this dog always crawls back to its 
master. It crawls and crawls to prove its devotion to the 
master. The master, who is in an inexplicable state at that 
moment, simply kicks it in the face with his boot and pushes it 
away, saying I do not want you, so go away. The situation here 
strongly reminds me of this analogy. Just look for yourself! 
The problems here are your problems, they keep saying. 
  At the same time, they have weighed us down with customs 
duties, tariffs, and all kinds of conditions on maritime 
operations. Here we have to implement the state system, laws, 
and all the rest of it. This worries me very much and makes me 
guarded, although naturally we will continue to fight for 
Russian integrity and unity. I am for one president and one 
political authority in the Russian Federation, and that all 
territories should have completely equal rights as subjects of 
the federation in accordance with the Constitution. Presently 
this is not happening at all. [end Nazdratenko 
recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Ivanidze: ``Greenpeace More Worried </F>
About Russia than Atomic Energy Ministry''] 
  [Excerpts] Apparently, a train carrying the spent nuclear 
fuel from the Finnish nuclear power station has now arrived 
successfully in notorious Chelyabinsk-65, despite all the 
efforts by members of the international environmental 
organization Greenpeace to prevent it from doing so. [passage 
omitted] 
  ``We will take it and bury it. If we fail to fulfill the 
agreements concluded by the government no one will speak to us. 
We are obliged to take spent nuclear fuel from the Finnish 
nuclear power station (not waste) until 14 May 1999. The 
agreement does not stipulate burial, but the USSR pledged to 
take the fuel and it was up to it what it did with the fuel,'' 
Mr. Vishnevskiy [Yuriy Vishnevskiy, chairman of the Russian 
Federation Federal Inspectorate for Nuclear and Radiation 
Safety] said. 
  Strange as it may seem, the date of expiration of the 
agreement, as indicated by the Federal Inspectorate chairman, 
does not coincide with the one announced last year by Finnish 
Trade and Industry Minister Seppo Kaariainen. According to him, 
shipments of spent nuclear fuel to Russia would cease in 1996, 
when the agreement expired. Who is telling the truth? 
  Nonetheless, no agreement has ever committed Russia to 
taking 
waste from other countries, according to Viktor 
Danilov-Danilyan, Russian Federation minister of ecology and 
natural resources. France and Britain, the main processors of 
nuclear fuel in Europe, ship all the nuclear waste to the 
countries that placed the orders for processing, thus creating 
the waste. But, incredibly, nuclear waste from other countries' 
fuel is being buried in Russia. 
  Incidentally, some days ago Mr. Danilov-Danilyan handed over 
an engineering project to his Norwegian colleagues for them to 
study and finance. A large part of it relates to the 
construction of a burial site on the Kola Peninsula. 
  ``The burial site is intended primarily for radioactive 
waste 
produced in Russia itself, and for the waste that has already 
accumulated. In particular, on the Kola Peninsula. It is 
stored in such a way that it can in no way be regarded as 
satisfactory from the ecological viewpoint,'' the minister told 
IZVESTIYA. 
  Answering my question about the possibility of importing and 
burying nuclear waste from other countries in the future, Viktor 
Ivanovich suddenly stopped choosing his words carefully and 
ominously stated: ``Who knows?'' 
  The specter of the Atomic Energy Ministry that lay behind 
this ominous statement manifested itself on television screens 
at the end of last week in the shape of Georgiy Kaurov, who made 
the following statement: ``The Greenpeace organization is 
trying to impose its own, non-Russian viewpoint on us. It is an 
international viewpoint, that of the mafia that engages in 
antinuclear lobbying.'' 
  It appears that the officials from the Federal Inspectorate 
have finally lost touch with reality and are treating everyone 
as a complete idiot. One of Finland's Swedish-language 
newspaper, in its 20 April 1994 issue, cites Mikhail Sharov, 
representative of the ``Mayak'' Production Association, who went 
to Finland to monitor the loading of the train with spent 
nuclear fuel. 
  ``In 1993 Finland paid $400 for each kilogram of spent 
nuclear fuel taken by Russia,'' the representative of the 
``Mayak'' Production Association, or Chelyabinsk-65, told 
Finnish journalists. 
  So the Atomic Energy Ministry received $11.6 million for the 
latest trainload alone. For similar processing in Britain the 
Finns would have paid two and one-half times as much, as prices 
stood two years ago. In addition they would have gotten back 
all the solid and liquid waste from the processing of their 
nuclear fuel, including contaminated equipment, instruments, 
means of personal protection, packaging, special clothing and 
footwear for workers, and many other almost new items. 
  Incidentally, if the Atomic Energy Minuistry were ever to 
curb its greed and try to return the nuclear waste, even then 
some of it would remain in Russia. The nuclear fuel processing 
technology at the ``Mayak'' Production Associaiton is such that 
practically all the medium-active liquid waste is still 
discharged into nearby reservoirs.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First 
Channel Network in Russian at 0800 GMT on 5 May, in the 
``Novosti'' newscast, carries a 2-minute report over video by 
correspondent Aleksandr Korovkin in which he claims that last 
year's expedition to the Komsomolets submarine, sunk in the 
Norwegian Sea five years ago, showed that ``the process of 
destruction of the protective casing of nuclear warheads is 
proceeding considerably faster than has so far been supposed by 
experts. The analysis of the results of underwater research has 
prompted some scientists to say that the Norwegian Sea could 
become polluted with radioactive elements as early as next 
year.'' 
  Korovkin recalls that the submarine's warheads contain 
plutonium, with a half-life of 24,000 years. This 
extraordinarily toxic element is 10,000 times more toxic than 
arsenic. 
  The submarine is lying at a depth of 1,700 meters and the 
plankton which is to be found here is consumed by fish. ``It is 
obvious that a sudden discharge of plutonium will rapidly cause 
an ecological disaster,'' Korovkin says, adding that a disaster 
of this kind can be averted and that Russia's Ministry of Civil 
Defense, Emergencies, and Natural Disasters is preparing a new 
expedition to the sunken submarine, charged with ``filling the 
nose section and the torpedo tubes with a special sorbent, 
capable of preventing the escape of plutonium.'' 
  Deputy Minister Sergey Valentinovich Khetagurov says that 
the 
science ship Akademik Keldysh is due to leave Kaliningrad on 15 
June with two bathyscapes on board. ``All the operations that 
have been planned are to be carried out in the space of 50 
days,'' Khetagurov says. 
  The report includes video footage of the sunken submarine.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Pimonov, department prosecutor in the </F>
Volga Interoblast Nature Conservation Prosecutor's Office: 
``Who Will Be Frightened of a Fine?''] 
  [Text] Checks by nature conservation prosecutor's offices 
in the Volga basin have shown that the Statutes on Water 
Conservation Areas of Rivers, Lakes, and Reservoirs in Russia 
are being breached all over the place. Take the Nizhniy 
Novgorod Oblast Soviet, for example, Back in 1989 it approved a 
list of rivers, lakes, and reservoirs in which conservation 
areas were to be set up before the year 2000. The planning was 
supposed to be completed this year. But none of the work is 
being monitored, so one cannot expect any early results. 
  The riverbank situation in the Volga basin is no less 
lamentable. There are piles of scrap metal, domestic garbage, 
and dung. At the moment there are around 3,000 livestock units 
in the vicinity of the Volga basin rivers discharging effluent 
and waste directly into rivers because they have no treatment 
plants. 
  But the saddest thing of all is to see the small amounts of 
money allocated by the state for ecological purposes being 
squandered and plundered. For instance, in Aktanyshskiy Rayon, 
Republic of Tatarstan, as a result of the erosion of the banks 
of a stream called the Syun, three livestock burial grounds are 
in danger of being exposed, and one of them is infected with 
anthrax. The money that was intended for riverbank reinforcement 
work and for the removal of the livestock burial grounds to 
sites outside the conservation area has been used by the rayon 
administration for other purposes. 
  What can change the situation, I believe, is the elaboration 
of new statutes on water conservation areas

<F P=106> [Article by Irina Nikolayeva: ``How To Make Ecological </F>
Concerns a Business Subject''] 
  [Text] Between 15 April and 5 June, ``Ecological 
Safety Days'' are being held in Russia; our city and oblast are 
actively participating in this event. 
  In particular, the recently created public organization--the 
Ecological Equilibrium foundation--opened its first 
self-financing structure in April, the bureau of environmental 
evaluation, whose primary business will be putting together 
normative documents for enterprises regarding maximum allowed 
discharges into the atmosphere. They will do it in cooperation 
with the foundation's partner--the Logos scientific-industrial 
foundation. 
  The bureau plans to offer other types of evaluation as well. 
I would remind that the Ecological Equilibrium foundation 
presented itself to the public on 1 March, describing as its 
goal development of environmental business. This organization 
intends to turn money-losing ecology into a zone of profitable 
and stable business. The bureau will conduct independent 
evaluation and project appraisal and bring it to a ``working'' 
condition by bringing in a broad range of specialists, including 
economists. 
  The first business project the foundation is already working 
on will be waste utilization at the Kudryashevo swine-breeding 
complex--one of the four largest animal husbandry complexes in 
Russia. Liquid waste will be processed into a solid 
substance--organic fertilizer. Remarkably, this requires minimal 
equipment, while productivity is quite high--as high as the 
demand for organic fertilizer. 
  The next step earmarked for implementation this year is the 
creation of a minicomplex: a parking lot, a gas station offering 
a skeleton set of repair and maintenance, and a car wash. Of 
course, there are quite a few such facilities in the city, but 
none meets ecological safety standards. The new one, which is 
envisaged to be built in the Krasnoobsk area, will be fitted 
with a closed-loop purification system. This brings up a 
question: Why was it necessary to set up a public organization 
if the problems of ecological equilibrium are worked on one way 
or the other by state structures--the oblast and the city 
committees on ecology and natural resources. 
  ``Briefly, I can answer it this way: State ecological 
organizations spend taxpayers money on liquidating the 
consequences of poor management. How successfully--you judge for 
yourself. Our foundation is trying to attract the public that is 
in some way or the other concerned over the unhealthy 
environment, earn money, and invest it in economically 
profitable projects and programs, in, as they say, `high 
technology,''' replies foundation President Oleg Nikolayevich 
Kolmakov. ``At the same time, we work in close--one may say, 
brotherly--contact with the oblast and city committees.''

<F P=106> [Unattributed report under the rubric ``Panorama'': ``EU </F>
International Conference in the Caspian Sea Problems''] 
  [Text] Several days ago Baku was visited by a delegation 
from the Hydrological Institute of Denmark, which is doing 
preparations for a project to deal with the Caspian Sea problems 
within the framework of the European Union's (EU) TASIS program, 
which provides technical assistance to CIS countries. As Fikret 
Dzhafarov, the chief of the department of planning for natural 
resource utilization of the Azerbaijani State Committee on 
Ecology, told ANS-PRESS, this project envisages beginning in the 
nearest future work on organizing an international conference on 
the Caspian Sea problems, in which CIS member countries will 
participate. According to Fikret Dzhafarov, a preliminary 
agreement already has been reached on Azerbaijan's participation 
in this forum. Baku is a possible site for the conference. The 
staff of the Azerbaijani State Committee on Ecology refuted 
information that Armenian leadership intends to insist on 
holding this conference in Yerevan, as well as ensuring 
participation of this country, along with the Caspian coastal 
countries, in this forum. However, as ANS-PRESS learned from 
reliable sources close to the Russian Government, such 
initiative on the part of Armenia has indeed taken place and it 
has been prompted by the fact that the EU underwrites all 
expenses on organizing and conducting this event. 
  At the same time, at the recent press conference Paolo 
Lembo, 
head of the UN Development Program in Azerbaijan, remarked that 
it is Baku that should become the center of research on the 
Caspian Sea problems. On 2 May, William Nikoff [as 
transliterated], a UN Development Program adviser, is expected 
to visit Azerbaijan; he will also look into the Caspian problems 
reflected in the London report of the UN Development Program.

Resources [Goskomekologiya], there is still no official answer 
from the president's staff and the republic's Cabinet of 
Ministers on the Goskomekologiya proposal regarding 
authorization for this organization to conduct negotiations 
within the UN Ecological Biodiversity Program--UNEBP. This 
problem is aggravated even more by the fact that the Azerbaijani 
parliament has not ratified the UN Convention on Biodiversity. 
However, the agency learned that the republic's Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs has requested through the UN temporary 
representation in Baku a package of international conventions on 
global ecological problems in order to submit them for the 
consideration of the National Assembly. It should be noted that 
in the event Azerbaijan does not join these conventions, this 
precludes the republic's participation in a number of programs 
of international ecological foundations.

  [Text] Representatives of Kazakhstan's Ministry for Ecology 
and Biological Resources fear that the shortage of money causes 
delays in commissioning (late 1994) of the first stage of the 
republic's system of utilization and burial of radioactive 
waste. A spokesman for the Ministry said that the program may 
be hampered by the negative attitude towards it by the heads of 
the regional administrations. For example, only the leadership 
of the Akmolinsk Region gave its consent for burial sites of 
radioactive waste on its territory. 
  This year it is also planned to devise maps of the burial of 
radioactive waste and its sources on the territory of 
Kazakhstan, to take photos and start research studies in the 
area of the Semipalatinsk test ground. The Ministry plans to 
spend 12.04 million tenges (over 414,000 U.S. dollars) 
  Last year the volume of investments constituted 1.82 million 
tenges (over 384,000 U.S. dollars as of the date of the 
introduction of the national currency in the republic). 
However, the general contractor responsible for the fulfillment 
of the radio ecological works, the National Nuclear Center of 
Kazakhstan, could not cope with the planned volume of research 
work due to the lack of funds. 
  At present the republic has a total of 900 enterprises 
polluting the environment and over 75,339 other sources of 
radioactive pollutants.

<F P=106> [Report by V. Semenchenko: ``What Do Statistics Know?''] </F>
  [Text] Out of 7,927 surveyed industrial enterprises, 12 
percent exceed the permitted levels of exhaust and hazardous 
waste dumping. Over the past year, 30 emergency cases of waste 
dumping were reported, most of which ended up in the Black Sea 
basin. The ``Tsentrolit'' oil refinery and the pulp and paper 
mill in Ismail remain major contaminators of the environment. 
  However, this cloud of exhaust has its own silver lining. 
The drop in production spared us 17,500 tonnes of dirty 
emissions into the atmosphere and some 115,000 tonnes of toxic 
waste. 
  Vast damage has been inflicted by illegal logging. The 
growing number of hotbeds of disease and pestilence has 
obliterated 36 hectares of forest. However, employees of 
``Odessales'' do not just sit around twiddling their thumbs. 
Already concluded prevention measures covered an area of 12,100 
hectares--more than in the previous year. Unfortunately, there 
were fewer saplings planted this year. The reason remains the 
same: deficient fuel supplies. 
  The oblast's 37 hunting enterprises work to protect, breed, 
and control the quantity of wild animals and birds. In the 
``Dunayskiye Plavni'' reserve, rare species of wildlife and 
flora are watched and protected.

<F P=106> [Volodymyr Dupak report from Zaporizhzhya: ``The </F>
Zaporizhzhya Atomic Electric Power Plant [AES] Will Not Be 
Halted?''] 
  [Text] Thanks to this week's delivery from Novosibirsk of 
nuclear fuel to the 61st-assembly Zaporizhzhya AES, the problem 
of fuel provision has been resolved for about one year. 
  As reported by the Information Center of the Zaporizhzhya 
AES, in summer, each one of the operating power units will be 
halted for a scheduled overhaul involving the reloading of fuel. 
This work will be started with Power Unit 1, which is presently 
under repair. 
  However, do not hasten to answer in the affirmative to the 
question posed in the heading. Under the pressure of the 
``Greens,'' sessions of the local councils of people's deputies 
of Kamyanka Dniprovska in Zaporizhzhya Oblast and of Nikopol in 
Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, adopted a decision to hold, on 26 June, 
local referendums on building storage facilities for dry used 
nuclear fuel on the territory of the Zaporizhzhya AES. 
  We hope that residents of these towns and adjacent rayons 
will trust the conclusions made by atomic specialists--not only 
ours, but also those from the United States, Germany, Sweden, 
and Canada, where the system for dry-storing used nuclear fuel 
is already used. If the construction work takes one or one and 
one-half years longer, the Zaporizhzhya AES will have to start 
closing down power units next [1995] summer. 
  The reasons are that used nuclear fuel has not been 
evacuated 
from the plant for a long time, but accumulates in the 
reservoirs inside the sealed shells of the units. They cannot 
stretch indefinitely.

<F P=106> [Interview with ``minister of environmental protection Yuriy </F>
Spizhenko'' by Oleh Nesterenko: ``Crime Due to Ignorance''--name 
and title of minister as published; bureau records show Yuriy 
Kostenko as minister of environmental protection and Yuriy 
Spizhenko as Ukraine's minister of health] 
  [Text] Every passing year slightly lowers the acuteness 
with which we perceive the Chernobyl disaster. We buried those 
who were among the first victims of the radiation freed by the 
accident and we reconciled ourselves to their death, but we fail 
to see that people continue to perish near us and that children 
are born handicapped. We just attribute this to fate. We even 
seem to begin to get used to the phrase that our nation is dying 
out. For three years already the death-rate has prevailed over 
the birth-rate--the population of whole towns is disappearing, 
and we do not want to see this and even reproach those who are 
telling the truth--do not add salt to the wound, do not let it 
fester or it will never heal. However, I am sure that people 
must get information and know the truth, no matter how bitter it 
might be. In this, Ukraine's minister of environmental 
protection Yuriy Spizhenko [as published] agrees with me: 
  Minister: Once, when the USSR was still alive, 
these secrets were faithfully guarded by the State Committee for 
Atomic Supervision. People did not know anything about the 
terrible accident in Chelyabinsk-40 [in Russia], about the 
explosions and discharges of huge amounts of radioactive 
elements into the environment at other atomic plants, which, on 
our territory, have no protective shells. However, we in 
Ukraine built a similar structure and allowed those who are only 
interested in the thoughtless exploitation of natural resources, 
to exercise control over nuclear safety. As soon as our 
ministry declared its right to tackle this problem and created a 
special administration, director of the Chernobyl AES Mr. Soroka 
started writing letters to all power structures openly demanding 
that the administration be abolished. Do you think that he will 
not get support? The powerful nuclear lobby is capable of 
anything in maintaining its positions. It may remove the 
Ministry of Environmental Protection from control over the 
nuclear monster, although our ministry is the only objective 
body in Ukraine that is free from known limitations and stands 
up for the interests of the majority of the people. 
  Nesterenko: Incidentally, rumors have spread in 
Kiev about barges and ships that took part in the clearup after 
the Chernobyl accident and that are now in navigation and about 
containers in which radioactive sand was transported. 
  Minister: I do not know where they are now, in 
whose yards they stand, or who is using them. Do you know why? 
This is due to this legal chaos, organizational confusion, and 
because we have too many controlling organizations that remove 
this right from the Ministry of Environmental Protection. 
  Nesterenko: What other Ukrainian regions have also 
been ecologically contaminated? 
  Minister: According to the results of objective 
studies, the greater part of our country has been contaminated 
to one degree or another. These are chemical pollutants due to 
the incompetent use of means of protection of green plants and, 
of course, radioactive contamination. The territories of the 
Donets-Dniester [as published; possibly Donets-Dnieper] Region, 
where heavy industry prevails and areas affected by the 
Chernobyl accident are in a particularly bad situation. Of 
course, a gradual decrease in the levels of radioactivity is 
taking place, but, at the same time, increasingly larger 
territories are subjected to contamination. These are physical 
processes and there is no escaping them. 
  Nesterenko: I heard that you are advocating the 
idea of closing down atomic electric power plants? 
  Minister: This is not quite so, I am in favor of 
closing down the Chernobyl AES, or, more specifically, of 
closing down reactors of the Chernobyl type not only in Ukraine, 
but throughout the world. 
  Nesterenko: Where else do they operate? 
  Minister: Eleven in Russia, incidentally, not far 
from the border with Ukraine, and one in Lithuania.... 
  Nesterenko: Those without protective shells? 
  Minister: Yes, but the point is that, in civilized 
countries, such reactors have many different protection systems, 
and the last of these is the hermetic shell. In our country, 
you see for yourself. 
  In view of this situation, it is necessary to raise the 
question at an international level and resolve it by joint 
efforts. A single state will not be able to do this. 
  It is an entirely different problem--whether Ukraine can do 
without nuclear power engineering. I answer--it can't! First, 
natural resources are being exhausted at a fast rate, primarily 
such energy sources as coal, oil, and gas. They are becoming 
more expensive, and the price of electricity grows. In the 
future, thermal plants will gradually become less numerous, and 
nuclear energy must go through its second birth. However, it 
will be based upon safe types of reactors after the problem of 
utilizing radioactive waste is resolved. Besides, there must be 
uranium. If all of this does not prove to be economically 
profitable, society will look for other sources of energy 
provision. 
  Nesterenko: How would you use our nuclear weapons 
for peaceful purposes? 
  Minister: Nuclear warheads contain highly enriched 
uranium and plutonium, and it might be good to use them for the 
needs of our power engineering. For this, according to the 
State Committee for Atomic Energy, it is necessary to proceed to 
a different type of reactor, and then the raw materials will be 
sufficient for us for the next 150-200 years. This is better 
than to receive heat-generating cassettes from Russia over two 
or three years and then again to be confronted with today's 
problem: Either to develop our own production or to depend upon 
our northern neighbor. That is why I am saying that it is 
better to use the nuclear warheads for our own purposes: To 
repair them and stockpile. We have facilities for storing them 
for a long time. 
  Another variant is to sell these materials at their true 
price, rather than to barter--warheads in exchange for fuel for 
atomic plants. If we had formulated the issue in such a way, 
the United States might have supported us, but now.... 
  ... Now we present our losses as an achievement by saying: 
It is good that Russia will provide us with fuel for our AES's. 
  Nesterenko: Excuse me, but this is a game of 
hide-and-seek with our own people. 
  Minister: That is why we should not be afraid of 
hurting people by telling them the truth. 
  We must speak more frequently on these matters, at least in 
order to make our people ecologically conscious. When one looks 
at the people, the impression is as though there are only 
ignoramuses, both at the top and at the bottom. From this 
situation there is just one step to crime.

  [Text] Maya Ganiyeva, our correspondent in Uzbekistan, once 
again returns in her reportage to the program's theme of spring 
floods, but the report is much more alarming than those from 
Nizhniy Novgorod and Rostov-on-Don. The fact is that, 
specifically because of heavy flooding, the threat of 
radioactive pollution hangs over the heavily populated Fergana 
Valley of Uzbekistan. Let us hear from Maya Ganiyeva: 
  Ganiyeva: I am bringing you this report from the 
shores of the mountain river Mayli-Say. The town with the same 
name in Kyrgyzstan is situated not far from here. It was 
founded in the 1930's following the discovery of uranium ores. 
Its processing capacities--an enrichment factory and a 
hydrometallurgical works--were soon built. In 1968, when all 
supplies were exhausted, they were simply destroyed. Traces 
remained, however, just as the burial grounds of radioactive 
materials also remained. What is interesting is that there is 
radioactive waste in the ground from everywhere, even from 
Czechoslovakia. 
  Following the mudslides, heavy rain, and landslides, there 
was a real danger of poisonous substances finding their way into 
the river. It is swollen to an incredible size here. At any 
moment, the water sweeping all around may also wash away the 
radioactive tombs. There below is the Fergana Valley. The most 
alarming thing is that this whole area, the Syr Darya River that 
runs through it, and large regions of Central Asia may become 
polluted. That is why the Governments of Uzbekistan and 
Kyrgyzstan and the public have sounded the alarm. Even now a 
government commission has been set up, and there has been rapid 
strengthening of the banks. Hydrological facilities that may 
absorb the waters are being planned. 
  I flew in here with a special international group headed by 
Ecosan, the Uzbekistan ecology and health fund. The Ecosan 
international fund has brought aid--medical supplies and 
disposable syringes--to those hit by the landslides. 
  My companion is Yusuf Shedemetov, president of the Ecosan 
international fund. Yusuf Shedemetovich, what is being done to 
avert a disaster? 
  Shedemetov: The main task is to bring it to the 
attention of the world community, the leaders of the Central 
Asian states, and the governments of this region--all 
governments. In addition, it is also necessary to ask the 
Russian Federation for help. Many specialists and many leaders 
of the ministry of that time worked in this region. They left a 
lot of traces. Also, our research here shows that there is 
still a lack of technical documentation that would be very 
useful today for deeper scientific research. That is why the 
Academy of Sciences of the Russian Federation and many 
ministries, departments, and state committees could render 
practical aid. 
  Ganiyeva: Yes, it would be a very great mistake if 
these blossoming pistachio and apricot orchards were turned into 
a mini-Chernobyl. One would like to hope that the efforts of 
ecologists and the public will not be wasted and that the valley 
will be preserved for life to the full.

<F P=106> [Bjorn Lindahl report: ``Nuclear Waste Dump To Be Built </F>
Close to Swedish Border''] 
  [Text] Oslo -- Despite protests from local authorities on 
both sides of the border the Norwegian Storting yesterday 
decided that a dump for radioactive waste will be built in 
Himdalen, 30 km from the Swedish local authorities of Eda and 
Arjang which lie on the border with Norway. 
  It is waste from Norway's two research reactors which is to 
be stored here, together with low- and medium-level radioactive 
waste from hospitals. A cavern will be constructed under a 
ridge 170 meters above sea level in an area where rock types are 
full of cracks and where drainage water runs out into a river. 
  Environmental organizations and Norwegian Geological 
Investigations, where the foremost geological expertise is to be 
found, have criticized the planned facility and think that there 
is a risk that the radioactive waste will leak out into the 
ground water. The International Atomic Energy Agency has also 
asked to see the Norwegian plans. There was tough criticism of 
Norwegian Industry Minister Jens Stoltenberg during the Storting 
debate. 
  ``I have never seen so important a question put before the 
Storting with such inadequate information,'' Environment 
Committee chairman Ragnhild Queseth Haarstad (Center Party) said. 
  Paul Chaffey from the Socialist Left Party wondered where 
the 
negative comments from the experts had been concealed. 
  ``Why has the industry minister not included the comments 
made by Sweden's National Nuclear Inspection Board?'' he asked. 
  The Storting was divided across party boundaries, but the 
Labor Party won enough support from the Conservative Party and 
the Progress Party for a decision to be reached by 71 votes to 
57. Industry Minister Stoltenberg defended himself by saying 
that it is not the rock around the facility which is to prevent 
radioactive leaks. 
  ``The barrels will be cast in concrete casings and these in 
their turn will be place in a concrete sarcophagus. If we 
notice that the concrete does not come up to standard or if, 
contrary to expectations, radioactivity does leak out we can 
take the barrels out again,'' he said. 
  Hitherto the waste from the two research reactors at Halden 
and Kjeller has been stored in 1,000 barrels buried underground 
at the Institute for Energy Technology at Kjeller. A further 
1,500 barrels are in a temporary storage facility. As well as 
low- and medium-level waste, small quantities of plutonium--with 
a half-life of 24,000 years--will also have to be stored.

<F P=106> [Report by Andreas Anzenberger and Dieter Holzweber: </F>
``Special Referendum on EU Defense Alliance?''] 
  [Text] With ``Greetings from Villach'' Pro-European Union 
[EU] activities welcomed the 168 delegates on Saturday morning 
[30 April] for the federal European congress of the Greens. On 
fliers, which referred to the activities of Freedom Party of 
Austria [FPOe] Chairman Haider in Carinthia, the common 
rejection of EU membership by the Greens and the FPOe was 
criticized. 
  In Goldegg Castle (Salzburg) the Greens decided with 87 
percent of the votes that they will definitely vote against 
membership. EU advocates, such as Environmental Spokeswoman 
Lanthgaler and Vienna City Councilor Chorherr, remained in the 
minority. 
  It was clear from the very start that the speeches by 
Foreign 
Minister Mock and EU State Secretary Ederer, who were invited as 
guests, would not be able to change the mood. The government 
members pointed not only to the advantages of membership but 
also voiced praise: The Greens have essentially contributed to 
the development of an awareness for the environment. 
  Mock stressed that neutrality will not be restricted even 
after the EU's institutional reform, which is planned for 1996. 
There are two possible scenarios: If the Western European 
Union [WEU] (the EU's defense alliance) develops into a 
collective security system along the lines of the United 
Nations, membership in this alliance will be possible also as 
neutral state. Otherwise, a special referendum on neutrality 
would be necessary before joining the WEU. 
  This statement caused displeasure at the coalition partner 
Social Democratic Party of Austria. Chancellor Vranitzky told 
KURIER: ``Austria will actively participate in the establishment 
of a collective security system in Europe. However, there is no 
coercion to join the WEU. Therefore, the discussion about a 
special referendum on neutrality is superfluous.'' 
  The reaction by Greens Federal Spokesman Pilz: ``The 
Government has already worked out a two-step plan for abolishing 
neutrality. The first step is joining the EU.''

  [Text] Vienna, May 9 (CTK) -- Representatives of the 
Austrian section of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) warned 
today of the pollution of the Danube flood plain forests by the 
Slovak Gabcikovo water project. 
  The area, which is located on a large gravel subsoil, is the 
second biggest European source of drinking water. 
  The WWF, which is now launching a campaign to establish a 
national park in the Danube flood plain forests between Vienna 
and Slovak border, demonstrated the adverse effects of the 
regulated water flow on nature to journalists from Germany, 
Austria, and the Czech Republic during a several-day educational 
excursion. 
  The self-purification of the flood plain forests as well as 
the heterogeneity of its fauna and flora depend on the changing 
level of the river. Regular floods in this unique landscape are 
a precondition of its existence, Alexander Zinke from the WWF 
said. 
  By diverting 80-90 percent of the Danube water into an 
insulated channel, the old riverbed receives only a minimum 
amount of water, which will soon entirely change the natural 
character of the landscape. 
  The Austrian environmentalists have proposed a ``tender 
variant'' which entails letting 65-75 percent of the Danube 
waters flow in the old riverbed. 
  At least three years will elapse before the Hungarian-Slovak 
dispute at the International Court of Justice at The Hague is 
settled. In the meantime, many species will be exterminated, 
the WWF stressed.

<F P=106> [Wouter Dambre video report] </F>
  [Text] NIRAS, the national office for radioactive waste and 
enriched nuclear fuels, will soon be responsible for two new 
plants, costing 4.5 billion Belgian francs, half of which is to 
be paid by electricity producers. The plants include a central 
processing unit for low-radioactive waste and a storage place 
for medium- and high-radioactive waste. 
  [Begin recording] Dambre: [video 
shows outside of processing units; containers on rolling mat; 
hydraulic press and compressed containers; general view of 
inside of plant] Here is CILVA, the central infrastructure 
for low-radioactive solid waste. It is a highly modern plant 
where low-radioactive waste is processed. The waste comes 
mainly from nuclear plants, hospitals, and laboratories. 
Belgo-Process, the industrial subsidiary of NIRAS, will 
simultaneously take delivery of the processing unit at the end 
of May. 
  NIRAS General Director Decamps: This is a unique 
project in Belgium, and also in Europe. It is the most 
up-to-date plant of this type for the processing of 
low-radioactive waste. The waste is processed in such a way so 
as to confine the radioactivity in a safe container. 
  Dambre: Containers with low-radioactive waste are 
compressed by a hydraulic press to reduce the volume of the 
waste. What is left goes into large casks in which concrete is 
cast. The radiation thus stays inside. Each year 250 tons of 
low-radioactive waste also can be burnt here. The ashes are 
then refined, compressed, and end up in containers in which a 
layer of concrete is cast. 
  NIRAS also has built a new storage place for 
high-radioactive 
waste. Starting in 1995, the nuclear waste from spent fuel from 
Belgian nuclear plants will end up here. 
  Decamps: The waste will have to be stored here at 
least 40 to 50 years until it possibly can be stored, for 
example, in clay layers deep in the sea. [end

<F P=106> [Interview with French Environment Minister Michel Barnier </F>
by Jerome Strazzulla; place and date not given: ``Michel 
Barnier: `Our Culture of Nuclear Safety''' -- first paragraph 
is LE FIGARO introduction] 
  [Text] On the eighth anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster, 
the upsurge of nuclear safety problems in eastern Europe, the 
``long march'' to Paris by opponents to the Superphenix [fast 
breeder reactor], and a national debate on energy initiated by 
the government for the first time in 10 years: Spring looks 
like it will be dominated by the atom. Environment Minister 
Michel Barnier explained the government's policy and its 
prospects in the area of nuclear energy. 
  Strazzulla: You are the environment minister of 
the world's most nuclearized country. Do you get comments from 
your counterparts, especially the European ones? 
  Barnier: At no time within the Council of 
Environment Ministers of the European Union [EU) has France's 
policy been called into question in front of me. Every country 
has chosen its strategy; we are not the only country which opted 
for nuclear energy, even though in France it covers 75 percent 
of our electricity requirments. 
  I think that other countries know our culture of nuclear 
safety, the rigorousness of our inspections, and the quality of 
our companies. This does not stop us from talking about it. 
  Whatever the atom's share in energy production, we have all 
experienced common problems: especially with safety, 
electricity lines, and nuclear waste. 
  Strazzulla: As far as the choice of energy is 
concerned, what kind of maneuvering room does the environment 
minister have? 
  Barnier: The environment minister assumes a 
special responsibility which he shares with the minister of 
industry: nuclear safety. This is an issue to which I am 
personally committed. The government is working in a 
homogeneous manner. 
  In the end, we ask ourselves the same questions, albeit with 
different approaches. The most important signal, an initiative 
by the prime minister, can be found in his desire to see an 
open, national discussion on energy and the environment. 
  I have the feeling that this debate will raise greater 
interest among local and national operators than we might 
expect. Within the government, I feel quite easy saying, for 
example, that in France we must revive diversification in energy 
production and move toward hydroelectricity, renewable energies, 
and biofuels, among other things. 
  Strazzulla: Should we expect major changes in the 
national energy policy following this debate? 
  Barnier: There is no use telling stories; it will 
not call into question our electronuclear strategy and choice. 
However, what might emerge from this debate is a greater 
understanding and a better control over this choice. It should 
also help revive the energy conservation policy, which we 
inexcusably dismantled 10 years ago. I would add a concern to 
this, namely a concern for greater transparency and greater 
control over energy policy by Parliament. 
  This is why I raised the idea of a law on nuclear safety. 
Lastly, this debate is linked to the law on regional 
reorganization and decentralization, especially as far as 
transport policy and the rebalance between road and rail 
transport are concerned. 
  Strazzulla: The alleged greenhouse effect is the 
new argument used by the nuclear lobby. Does this seem credible 
to you? 
  Barnier: The current debate between scientists is 
focused more on the seriousness of the greenhouse effect than on 
its existence. In addition, I am organizing the third ``Segur 
Talks'' on this topic on 16 May. While waiting to know the 
truth, we have to apply the principle of caution. It is 
essential to limit greenhouse gas emissions, especially carbon 
dioxide. 
  From this point of view, nuclear energy is actually a clean 
energy. However, it raises other problems, the most serious of 
which is waste. 
  Strazzulla: The West seems to want to mobilize to 
help Ukraine decommission its plant in Chernobyl. What are the 
main options considered? 
  Barnier: The shutdown of the two most dangerous 
reactors in Chernobyl is something desired by both the West and 
Ukraine. The prime minister asked us to prepare a specific 
initiative to bring about this shutdown, in liaison with the 
other countries of the European Union and the G-7. 
  This point will be one of the main elements in the Naples 
summit. Apart from the reactors, a new sarcophagus has to be 
built in Chernobyl and there are still the major problems of 
radioactive waste and water protection. 
  In order to meet Ukraine's energy needs, we could bring two 
or three new reactors on line. That would assume a new culture 
of nuclear safety in that country, as well as exceptional 
support from all the Western countries. Lastly, in all the new 
democracies, there is an enormous amount of energy waste. 
Helping them better manage their networks and resources is a 
big part of the solution to their problems. 
  Strazzulla: After 40 years of operation, the 
problem of nuclear waste has emerged in France. What do you 
think of it? 
  Barnier: I believe that the operators and the 
bodies in charge of nuclear energy have demonstrated a lack of 
foresight by putting this issue off until later. Yet, very few 
political decisions affect future generations to the same extent 
as the production of long-life nuclear waste lasting 10,000 
years or more. The issue was finally raised--rightly--in the 
late eighties. 
  The beginning of a solution was provided by the law of 1991 
and the work of the Bataille mission concerning the setting up 
of underground laboratories for studying deep storage. 
  Strazzulla: From the point of view of lack of 
foresight, can we dissociate nuclear waste from other industrial 
waste? 
  Barnier: All industries produce waste. In the 
past, industrial waste was often stored or buried in any manner 
and anywhere. It is true that the industries which produced 
this waste had no more foresight than the nuclear industry. 
  One of my first actions upon arriving in government was to 
launch an in-depth inquiry in each department in order to draw 
up a comprehensive and prioritized list of polluted sites. Once 
this list is drawn up, we will have to find the resources to 
treat these sites. I do not want anything to do with a 
``contaminated earth'' case. 
  Nuclear energy also produces end waste. It must be made 
quite clear that no matter what type of reprocessing is used, we 
must have underground storage sites for long-life radioactive 
waste. 
  As for the processing of slightly radioactive waste, this 
process must be more stringently managed. 
  Strazzulla: Nuclear physicists assure us that the 
waste problem will not be resolved with an incinerator. So what 
were the government's real motivations in deciding to reactivate 
the Superphenix reactor? 
  Barnier: Superphenix will not be built to destroy 
all the waste produced by France's 57 nuclear reactors. 
  The prime minister made a basic decision, namely to stop 
fast 
breeding operations in Creys-Malville in two years' time, in 
other words, to stop producing plutonium. 
  The facility will make it possible to carry out experiments 
aimed at gaining better knowledge of the means of reducing the 
volume of the most dangerous nuclear waste. 
  I therefore have some trouble understanding the attitude of 
certain ecologists vis-a-vis Superphenix at this time. 
  Bearing in mind the mass of money, research, and expertise 
invested in this site, it would have been inconceivable to write 
it off. This decision is in line with general interest.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: ``95,000 Tonnes of Nuclear Waste Have </F>
Been Dumped Into the Seas''] 
  [Text] According to the Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD], approximately 95,000 tonnes of nuclear waste have been 
dumped into the world seas. 
  This was announced by the environmental spokesman of the SPD 
Bundestag group, Michael Mueller. The Federal Government dealt 
with a corresponding inquiry by the SPD late in the evening 
yesterday. 
  ``Military enterprises are the main culprits,'' particularly 
in former USSR, but also in Western countries, Mueller stressed. 
  Mueller called for a worldwide agreement against the dumping 
of nuclear material and a ban of nuclear-powered submarines. 
  The member of the Christian Democratic Union, Klaus Harries, 
suggested controlling the draining of radioactive waste water 
from the reprocessing plants in Sellafield (Great Britain) and 
La Haque (France). 
  The Federal Government sees no need to speak of a ``general 
contamination of the world seas'' because of the dumping of 
radioactive waste resulting from the civilian and military use 
of nuclear energy. The European coastal waters (North Sea and 
Baltic Sea) are not directly endangered.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: ``Eastern Clean-Up To Cost Up To 270 </F>
Billion DM''] 
  [Text] Enormous sums are required to clean up the extensive 
environmental damage in the former GDR, concludes a study 
commissioned by the Industrial Initiative for Environmental 
Protection in the New Laender. 
  Most of the environmental damage in the ex-GDR was caused by 
planned economy considerations. The GDR wanted to increase 
industrial output at all costs, and was never genuinely 
concerned about a clean environment. 
  The Institute of German Industry says major investments are 
required to clear the damage. The lowest estimate is 82.8 
billion marks [DM], the highest is DM521 billion. The widest 
range of estimates concerns the removal of old waste. The cost 
of performing this operation is estimated at between DM3 billion 
and 270 billion. The operation would entail either the 
elimination of acute dangers, for instance by erecting fences 
around contaminated lakes, or comprehensive cleaning-up work, 
such as the excavation, cleaning, and recultivation of soil. 
  In the GDR, enterprises were supplied with quantities of 
energy equal to the quantities they had consumed during the 
previous period of reckoning, a practice that led to senseless 
waste. Therefore, an enterprise that consumed its coal supply 
sparingly could expect to receive less coal for the following 
period. 
  In this way, energy was wasted without regard to the 
environment, says the report. Therefore, private households 
also felt no encouragement to economize on energy.

<F P=106> [Halvor Tjonn report: ``Berntsen Dissatisfied With </F>
Environmental Progress on the Kola Peninsula''] 
  [Text] Moscow -- Thorbjorn Berntsen is seeking new Russian 
initiatives in the environmental work on the Kola Peninsula. 
  The Norwegian environment minister has said there is no 
reason to express satisfaction with the progress in the work to 
clean up the nickel works on the Kola Peninsula. For the last 
two days he has been discussing this issue, among others, with 
his Russian counterpart, Viktor Danilov-Danilyan, in Moscow. 
  ``I had been hoping that we would have made greater progress 
in the work to finance the rebuilding of the nickel works on the 
Kola Peninsula,'' Thorbjorn Berntsen said. ``The Russian 
environmental authorities are working on the matter. It is 
impossible to find fault with their work. But they are meeting 
with resistance at home, not least because of the difficult 
economic situation. You have to remember that the project has a 
budget framework of 1.5 to 2 billion Norwegian kroner, of which 
Norway will contribute 300 million. That is a lot of money in 
today's Russia.'' 
  Berntsen also stressed that we must nevertheless not give up 
hope of a breakthrough on the Kola Peninsula soon. ``I have 
been discussing this matter for several years with the Russian 
environmental protection authorities. We will solve the 
problems as quickly as possible,'' he said. 
  At a press conference at the Russian Environment Ministry 
Berntsen's Russian counterpart got into a heated exchange with 
journalists present. Danilov-Danilyan said that it is 
impossible for money to be allocated to the Kola project this 
year. Berntsen in turn said that its serves no purpose to make 
a drama out of a crisis. The cooperation between Norwegian and 
Russian authorities remains constructive, and the Norwegian side 
is concentrating on one step at a time. 
  As well as the question of Nikel, Berntsen has also 
discussed 
the question of building a storage facility for radioactive 
waste in northwestern Russia. ``Everyone has the aim of 
building this facility. But where it will be sited is as yet an 
open question. It is desirable that transport routes should not 
be too long, whether it is on the Kola Peninsula or Novaya 
Zemlya. But I would stress that the budget framework is so huge 
that this will be a major effort. There must therefore be 
further discussion of financing,'' Berntsen said. 
  He thinks that there is every reason to follow closely what 
is happening at the storage facilities for liquid nuclear waste 
near the town of Chelyabinsk in Siberia. At present there are 
floods in this area. At worst the liquid waste could run out 
into the River Ob, then the Kara Sea, and eventually reach the 
Norwegian coast and fishing waters. ``This is a permanent 
problem, and Russian and Norwegian authorities are working 
together on the matter the whole time,'' Berntsen said. 
  On Thursday [28 April] Berntsen met with Russian Atomic 
Energy Minister Viktor Mikhaylov. According to what has leaked 
out from the meeting, the shape the meeting took was that 
Mikhaylov launched into a long monotonous monologue directed at 
Berntsen about the blessings of nuclear power. According to 
those present at the meeting, Berntsen remained ``surprisingly 
calm,'' given the claims the Russian minister was making. 
  ``I have to say that one rearely meets a person with so 
devoted a relationship to nuclear power. To me it seems 
unsubtle and uncritical. But I would like to stress that when 
it comes to cooperation on concrete problems, there is nothing 
to be said against Russia's willingness to cooperate,'' Berntsen 
stressed.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a roundup of recent 
environmental reports monitored from media in FBIS Abidjan 
Bureau and EAU coverage areas from 30 March to 18 April. 
<H5>  CONGO </H5>
  Dakar PANA in English, in a Brazzaville-datelined item at 
1415 GMT on 11 April reports that ``Congo now fears for the 
future of its surface waters and pressures brought on its 
forests.'' In a paper on the ``forest climate and ecosystem'' in 
Impfondo, Likouala Region, Jose Djoni Bourges, regional director 
of the Forestry Commission underlined the adverse effects of the 
forest destruction. He said ``the large destruction of forests 
leads to the lowering of the output of streams,'' citing the 
case of the Sangha and Obangui Rivers, on the border between 
Zaire and the Central African Republic. Bourges said there was 
a risk of the desert now threatening Chad encroaching on its 
forest. He added that countries separating Chad and 
Congo--Cameroon and the Central African Republic in 
particular--are among those which are mostly threatened with 
desertification. ``According to official figures, Congo loses 
between 15,000 and 20,000 hectares of forest a year. 
Agricultural practice not friendly to the environment is 
considered the first cause of deforestation in the country.'' 
  London BBC World Service in English at 1515 on 18 April 
reports that due to the effects of the violence in the country 
last November, authorities are now planning to conduct a major 
hygiene operation in Brazzaville. This operation will involve 
digging up and properly reburying the bodies of those killed in 
the recent ethnic violence. Opposition and presidential 
supporters thought to have been responsible for the bloodshed 
will be called upon to help locate the cemeteries or shallow 
pits which were used as common graves for hurriedly-buried 
bodies. At least 200 people are known to have been killed during 
the clashes in Brazzaville. 
<H5>  GHANA </H5>
  Accra Ghana Broadcasting Corporation Radio Network in 
English 
at 1300 GMT on 18 April in its press review column says the 
GHANAIAN TIMES carries the assurance by the Environmental 
Protection Council that a strange substance in River Ankorbra 
and its tributary is not harmful to human and animal life. The 
columnist quotes the Western regional program officer of the 
council as telling a meeting of fishermen in the communities 
along the river that a substance which emits a bad odor does not 
pose any danger to the health of the people. The chief of the 
area disputes the claim saying that the ``presence of the 
substance in the river is scaring away fishermen from fishing 
because the substance damages their nets and affects their 
catch.'' The paper supports a decision by the Ministry of Food 
and Agriculture to provide fishing communities with basic needs. 
They quote the deputy minister of the ministry in charge of 
fisheries of telling some fishing communities in the Dangbe West 
and Dangbe East districts that landing facilities at the beaches 
``would be provided to improve lighting systems and smoking 
sheds as well as tax-free concessions.'' 
<H5>  NIGER </H5>
  Niamey Voix du Sahel Network in French at 1200 GMT on 31 
March reports that the Goulbi River, the main water reserve 
which crosses the southern end of Maradi Region, is in danger. 
It is threatened by the construction of a dam in neighboring 
Nigeria. People and experts have been mobilized to find a 
suitable, lasting solution that would enable Niger to retain the 
waters that irrigate vast lands along the Goulbi River valley. 
Agricultural activities have slowed down in the Goulbi River 
valley because the river is drying out. Experts have studied 
the issue and decided to implement four water projects. The 
first one is a pilot project that is being tried out in a 
village located 6 km from Maradi. Once completed, the project 
will enable the flooding of about 17 hectares even during the 
dry season and will refill the Goulbi Basin. 
  Niamey Voix du Sahel Network in French at 1200 GMT on 4 
April 
reports that the people of Goudoumaria, rendered powerless by a 
natural phenomenon, have found an easy alternative, but not 
necessarily the best. Sand dunes have encroached on their farms 
so they have begun a rural exodus. According to a Voix du Sahel 
correspondent in the region, ``Goudoumaria covers an area of 
9,500 square km for a population of 30,000 comprising Fulanis, 
Manga, Tubus, and Tuaregs who practice farming and animal 
husbandry.'' He goes on to say that the frequency and intensity 
of the wind which moves tons of sand from one place to another 
have forced people to leave their homes. A regional 
administrative official explains that because the people no 
longer have farming land they often go to Nigeria where they 
stay for months. He stresses that ``theirs is a problem of 
survival because they have no money to buy food and some of 
their homes are totally buried in the sand.'' Commenting 
further on the situation of the people of Goudoumaria, the 
regional official suggests the creation of local jobs so that 
they could remain at home and support their families.

  Paris AFP in English at 0509 GMT on 30 March in a 
Lagos-datelined item says: ``Lake Chad has shrunk tenfold in 
the past three decades as a direct consequence of global 
warming, Nigeria's Minister for Water Resources Alhaji Isa 
Mohammed said here Tuesday. The lake has gradually shrunk from 
about 26,000 square kilometres (10,400 square miles) in 1962 to 
its present 2,500 square kilometres (1,000 square miles), 
Mohammed told an international workshop on the impact of global 
climate change on energy development.'' 
  The adverse phenomenon is the direct impact of global 
climatic change brought about by increased global warming caused 
by depletion of the ozone layer, Mohammed said. He welcomed the 
admission of the Central African Republic last week as the fifth 
member of the Lake Chad Basin Commission, meeting in Abuja, 
Nigeria, which could pave the way for a transfer of water from 
the Upper Oubangui river to the Chari river in Chad to increase 
the flow into the lake. 
  Lagos NTA Television Network in English at 2000 GMT on 11 
April carries a report in which the Administrator of Anambra 
State, Colonel Mike Attah says erosion is being tackled within 
the limited resources of the state, adding that representation 
has been made to the Federal Government on the issue. He made 
the observation while on a familiarization tour of Anaocha local 
government area of the state. In a report, NTA correspondent 
quotes the administrator as remarking that ``with intensified 
revenue drive and prudent financial management, each local 
government council should be able to pay staff salaries promptly 
and embark on capital projects.'' He commended Anaocha local 
government for the various development projects. The reports 
says the chairman of the council drew the attention of the 
government to the ``devastating effects of erosion in the area, 
the lack of motorable roads and health facilities within most 
communities.''

    The following is a roundup of recent environmental reports 
monitored from media in FBIS Abidjan Bureau and EAU coverage 
areas from 22 April to 2 May. 
<H5>  GHANA </H5>
  Accra Ghana Broadcasting Corporation (GBC) Radio Network in 
English at 0600 GMT on 25 April reports that in order to check 
overdepletion of fish resources, the government has placed a ban 
on the importation of trawlers into the country. The radio says 
that the Ministy of Food and Agriculture is also taking steps to 
ensure that the ban on the use of undersized nets, dynamite 
sticks, and the fishing practice popularly called atidsa, where 
tree branches are place in water to serve as shelter for fish, 
is strictly enforced. According to the GBC, the deputy minister 
of food and agriculture in charge of fisheries announced this 
during a tour of some fishing communities in the Volta Region. 
A correspondent quotes the minister as telling the fishermen 
that the government is greatly worried about the high depletion 
rate of fish resources and is taking steps to check the 
situation. 
  Accra Ghana Broadcasting Radio Network in English at 0600 
GMT 
on 28 April states that delegates from five African countries 
are meeting at Aburi to work out a system of supporting 
environmental education initiatives in the subregion. The 
delegates are from Ghana, the Gambia, Nigeria, Sierra leone, and 
Kenya. A correspondent report states that the course is being 
organized by the University of Bradford in the United Kingdom 
and the May Day Rural Project, a nongovernmental organization 
supported by the Overseas Administration of Britain. This is a 
follow-up to similar seminars in Ghana and the United Kingdom 
where participants call for more training schemes to enhance 
dissemination of environmental education. The course aims to 
acquaint participants with the definition and historical 
evolution of environmental education by discussing the education 
strategy for Ghana and planning mechanisms to support the 
implementation of environmental initiatives in the subregion. 
<H5>  NIGER </H5>
  Niamey Voix du Sahel Network in French at 1200 GMT on 22 
April reports that in several areas of Filingue District there 
are large numbers of plants like acacia, albida, or gao, in the 
southeast which are being threatened by farmers and herdsmen. 
Most of the 30,000 inhabitants in the area are pastoralists and 
during the past agricultural season, a significant amount of 
grazing ground was used. This has created a phenomenon of 
environmental deterioration. The animal breeders have used trees 
to feed animals. According to an environmental officer, this 
phenomenon is growing and if this practice continues there will 
be no environmental regeneration. The environment department is 
finding it difficult to find alternatives for the animal 
breeders, but until they do there is a need to alert the farmers 
and herdsmen to the importance of natural regeneration for the 
environment. 
  Paris AFP in French at 1120 GMT on 1 May reports ecologists 
in Niger have sounded the alarm about increasing usage of the 
plastic packings which pollute the country's main cities and 
have begun to threaten the health of human beings and livestock. 
On 23 April, Ecologica, an nongovernmental organization, 
launched a campaign called Plastic Packing-Free Environment 
Operation. Ecologica promised to supply schools with teaching 
equipment in exchange for the nonbiodegradable wastes they would 
collect. Ecologica has also called on beggars in urban centers 
to participate in the collection of plastic packings for 
recycling. 
  The Ministry of Environment has admitted the severity of the 
problem, while confessing its inability to face it. According 
to highway services, plastic packings now account for half of 
household waste in the cities. In Niamey, the City Council put 
in place trash cans exclusively for plastic packing waste, but 
since the cans are poorly protected they are emptied by the 
first gust of wind. 
  Sheep, goats, oxen, and asses wandering in the streets 
sometimes feed on this plastic waste. The veterinary clinic in 
Niamey says that in one month 30 animals suffered indigestion 
due to plastic packings. Human beings are also in danger since 
some people think that they can use the plastic waste as source 
of energy and inhale highly toxic substances. 
<H5>  NIGERIA </H5>
  Lagos Radio Nigeria Network in English at 0600 GMT on 28 
April reports the administrator of Adamawa State, Group Captain 
Gabriel Agbonene, has expressed concern over the problem of 
desertification. He was speaking in Lola when students of the 
Administrative Staff College of Nigeria, ASCON, called on him. 
Capt. Agbonene also highlighted some natural hazards which, he 
said, had affected the state. They include the (Logdo) Dam 
which neighboring Cameroon usually opens with devastating 
effects on lives and property. 
  Earlier, the leader of the delegation, Mr. Adeyemi Yekini, 
said they were in the state to study the environmental problem 
with a view to recommending to the Federal Government how best 
to solve it. 
  Lagos Radio Nigeria Network in English 1500 GMT 25 Apr 94 
reports that the Anambra State Government will undertake an 
experiment aimed at reducing the menace of soil erosion on some 
selected roads in various parts of the state. The state 
administrator disclosed this while exchanging views with 
representatives of a construction company at Government House. 
He told them his administration would welcome cost-effective 
ideas in dealing with the problem of infrastructural facilities. 
He noted that the nature of the soil in Anambra State had 
created enormous ecological problems, especially soil erosion. 
He said it was necessary to try a new technology that had won 
international recognition. 
<H5>  TANZANIA </H5>
  Dar es Salaam Radio Tanzania Network in Swahili at 1700 GMT 
on 26 April states two Chinese nationals have been arrested by 
police after they were found in illegal possession of 135 pieces 
of ivory valued at more than 4 million shillings at a Kinondoni 
District house in Dar es Salaam. The Dar es Salaam regional 
police commander, Ndugu Tryphon Maji, identified the Chinese as 
(Shen Wen Hou) alias (Chieng Chen) and (Niyaw Huwau Wen), both 
residing at 102, Victoria House. He said the Chinese were also 
found in illegal possession of an assortment of minerals, 
including rubies. The police commander said the value of the 
minerals, weighing 100 kg, has so far not been determined. 
  Ndugu Maji said one of the Chinese offered the police about 
1 
million shillings as a bribe to avert arrest, but the police 
declined the offer. He said the money had also been handed over 
to the police. [passage omitted]

  Kinshasa Voix du Zaire in French 1800 GMT on 29 April 
reports 
the rehabilitation of the Luki biosphere reserve in the 
Bas-Fleuve area has been launched by Benoit Kena Muauki, 
secretary general for environment. The reserve, which is 
confronted with serious environmental deterioration, abounds in 
natural resources which represent various economic, scientific, 
and esthetic interests. It is even recognized as part of the 
world network of biosphere reserves. In fact, for many months 
now, the Luki reserve has been confronted with deforestation 
problems as a result of extensive agricultural activities, 
illegal exploitation, and indiscriminate occupation of forest 
zones. To minimize damage, the authorities have decided to 
demarcate the reserve, repair bridges, and ensure the 
maintenance of roads. They have also decided to erect 105 
boards to ensure the protection of this ecosystem.

  [Text] Guangzhou, May 8 (XINHUA) -- South China's Guangdong 
Province recently passed a new forest law, which is to come into 
effect soon. 
  The forest protection and management regulations, a revision 
of 1987 regulations, divides Guangdong's forests into ecological 
and public forests and commercial forests, to which different 
rules will apply. 
  The ecological and public forests include those for wind 
shelter, water and soil conservation, recreation and 
sightseeing, and protection of plants and animals. 
  This area of forest land must account for no less than 30 
percent of the total forest area and will be maintained under 
the government budget. It will be free from commercial felling, 
the new law reads. 
  Forest resources, including timber, fuel and economic 
forests, fall under the category of commercial forests. 
  According to the new regulations, the felling of commercial 
trees will be controlled by quotas and a licensing system. 
Commercial forests could be subject to rent, transfer and 
mortgage. 
  The new law encourages the development of forests through 
means other than governmental investment, such as the use of 
overseas funds or stock companies. 
  The publishing of the new law was preceded by the province's 
announcement last year that its forest coverage had reached 53.7 
percent. 
  Forest officials said the new law is aimed at consolidating 
and expanding the province's achievement in afforestation, and 
establishing a new forest management system that fits with a 
market economy. 
  The new law stipulates that the province will keep its 
forest 
coverage above 50 percent and that all cities and towns allow 
for 30 percent of urban areas to remain green land. 
  The new law also contains detailed articles on punishment 
for 
offenses.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yevgeniy Tkachenko] </F>
  [Text] Chelyabinsk May 5 TASS -- Russian greens picketed 
the building housing the Chelyabinsk regional admnistration 
today in protest against the chemical plant ``Mayak's'' 
continuing processing of used fuel from atomic reactors. The 
activists from the social movement ``for nuclear safety'' were 
particularly incensed by the arrival of another train shipment 
of such dangerous materials from Finland. 
  The environmentalists say that the processing of nuclear 
waste is worsening the none-too-bright environmental picture in 
Russia's Ural Mountains and demand that ``Mayak'' stop accepting 
shipments for processing. 
  But spokesman for the plant Yevgeniy Ryzhkov told ITAR-TASS 
that ``the plant's current load in processing used nuclear fuel 
does not even reach half-capacity and causes no harm to the 
environment.'' 
  He added that ``the Russian authorities have to fulfill 
contracts signed yet by the USSR and, what is more important, 
the processing is the main financial source for the 
implementation of large-scale environmental programmes in the 
region.'' 
  According to Ryzhkov, the Soviet and Russian nuclear 
industry 
produced a huge amount of liquid radioactive waste in their 
45-year old history. It is difficult and dangerous to store it 
for long periods. The only solution, he said, is to turn them 
into compact, solid wastes. 
  The appropriate technology for such operations, the 
specialist explained, ``has been created and is operating in our 
plant. It is necessary only to increase the machinery's 
capacity and build a few new furnaces. All this is being done 
at our own expense, and the main source of money for `Mayak' has 
become the regeneration of used fuel which is transported here. 
One must take into account that the fuel contains from 90 to 95 
percent uranium, which we put back into nuclear energy. And 
fuel regeneration produces much less waste than the production 
of nuclear fuel,'' he said. 
  Ryzhkov added that the shipment of used nuclear fuel, which 
caused such a commotion among the ``greens'' in Finland and 
Russia, had been successfully delivered to ``Mayak,'' unloaded, 
and was being processed ``in a safe way.''
