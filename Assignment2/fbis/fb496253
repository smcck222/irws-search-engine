  [Text] The central government plans to crack down on 
rapidly increasing pollution and reinforce environment laws in a 
sweep of 10 provinces next month. 
  The probe is being organized by the Environmental Protection 
Committees of the National People's Congress (NPC) and the State 
Council. 
  All violators will be punished and their actions released to 
the media, said Wang Bingqian, vice-chairman of the NPC Standing 
committee. 
  Wang said some people still work against State laws and 
stipulations on environmental protection. 
  New industrial projects have been built without reporting to 
the local environmental departments and some have caused large 
amounts of pollution. 
  The poaching, killing and sale of endangered animals under 
national protection is still rampant in some places. 
  And inspectors will be looking to get rid of small cement 
plants, paper mills, petrochemical works and smelting furnaces 
that have been banned but are making a comeback. 
  The new effort will target 10 provinces and autonomous 
regions: Hebei, Jilin, Zhejiang, Fujian, Henan, Hunan, Sichuan, 
Guizhou, Inner Mongolia, and Guangxi. 
  The inspections will check on law enforcement, environmental 
controls and wildlife protection, in addition to the 
implementation of STate regulations on forestry, water and soil 
preservation. 
  Song Jian, Director of the State council's Environment 
Protection Committee, called for changes in the law to include 
criminal penalties as severe as those faced by smugglers and 
drug traffickers. 
  Such penalties should include jail, he said. 
  Xie Zhenhua, director of the National Environmental 
Protection Agency (NEPA), reported the illegal poaching, killing 
and smuggling of protected wild animals had survived despite 
repeated government sweeps. 
  Some hotels and restaurants still make a fortune out of 
dishes based on rare animals. 
  Xie said some regions have brought in foreign projects that 
fall short of Nepa requirements, while others have imported 
harmful waste. 
  Technologically poor equipment and a lack of 
counter-pollution measures in many rural enterprises account for 
severe pollution and ecological disturbance in a wide range of 
areas, he said. 
  City residents most often complain about pollution from 
waste 
water, waste gas and trash and noise. 
  Some areas have eagerly launched high energy and 
pollution-prone projects at the expense of the environment as 
they greedily pursue short-term economic benefits, the official 
said. 
  Air quality in only a few of the 500 major cities has 
reached 
the State's first-grade standard, he added, and acid rain has 
spread from South China to some hinterland districts.

<F P=106> [Article by Xi Mi: "NEPA Struggles to Find Funds for </F>
Environment" 
  [Text] To make sure that the sky is blue and 
rivers are clean, China's investment-frustrated 
environmentalists are trying hard to change the grim picture 
painted by the State's protection plans. 
  The environmental situation in China is more serious than 
most people might have realized, says Zhang Kunmin, 
vice-director of the National Environmental Protection Agency 
(NEPA). 
  Pollution is particularly severe in some 
economically-developed and densely-populated regions; and city 
pollution has been worsening and spreading to the rural areas. 
  The pollution caused by rural enterprises is also more 
serious as indicated by a survey conducted by NEPA. 
  Environmental pollution and ecological damage have become a 
barrier for economic development, social stability and reform 
and opening to the outside world. 
  "Insufficient investment, outmoded production facilities, 
and 
lax law enforcement are responsible for the current 
environmental problems," said Yang Zuojing, deputy director of 
NEPA's pollution treatment department. 
  China spends 20 billion yuan ($2.30 billion) on environment 
protection every year, which is 0.7 percent of its annual gross 
national product. 
  Such a percentage is low. But in a time when the country is 
thirsty for development funds, it is not easy for the government 
to rapidly increase investment for protection. 
  How to protect environment effectively without much 
financial 
investment has been analyzed and reanalyzed. 
  Their are many options including the introduction of clean 
production methods, better management of environmental 
investment and stricter law enforcement. NEPA is considering 
setting up a national environmental protection methods, better 
management of environmental investment and stricter law 
enforcement. 
  NEPA is considering setting up a national environmental 
protection fund, combining government environmental spending, 
overseas investment as well as enterprises' licence fees for 
emitting pollutants. 
  Based on this fund, a national protection investment 
corporation can be established to deal with transprovincial 
environmental problems and help the central government implement 
international treaties. This will make better use of investment. 
  An experiment in Shenyang, capital of Liaoning Province, has 
proven effective. 
  In 1988, with the support of the NEPA, the Shenyang 
Environmental Protection Investment Corporation was founded to 
oversee the design, bidding and management of environmental 
projects. 
  Part of the local government's old allocation was 
transformed 
into the environmental fund, which the Corporation then gave out 
as loans. 
  By the end of 1992, the corporation handled more than 162 
million yuan ($18.6 million) of environmental loans. The sum of 
environmental funds also tripled to 30 million yuan ($3.5 
million). 
  With more money, problems are easier to solve. 
  The corporation is supposed to be responsible for its own 
losses and gains, but it still retains some administrative power. 
  It receives guidance from the city's environmental 
protection 
bureau and its loans, to a certain extent, are still government 
allocations. 
  If the receivers of the loans use them efficiently, they do 
not return the principal; if not, they will have to repay part 
of the investment and interest. 
  But the fund managers have their headaches. Because the 
interest rate of the loans is much lower than that of the banks, 
some enterprises would rather delay in repayment. This has 
affected the flow and growth of the funds. 
  If a national investment corporation is to be founded, the 
government's environmental allocation to enterprises should be 
transformed into loans and the interest rate of the loans should 
be raised, NEPA sources suggested, adding that the enterprises' 
licence fees for emitting pollutants should not be used freely. 
  Besides a better management of the investment, the NEPA has 
also tried to introduce clean production methods. 
  In clean production, manufacturers select the best treatment 
programme after examining possible pollution sources in each 
production procedure. 
  According to Yang, with the aid of the World Bank, NEPA 
started clean production programmes in Beijing, Yantai, in 
Shandong Province, and Shaoxing, in Zhejiang Province in 1993. 
  The programme aims to establish model clean production 
bases, 
introduce clean production technology and give technical 
training classes. 
  Up to now, about 50 Chinese people have attended clean 
production classes given by foreign experts. 
  With little investment, 51 pollution reduction packages have 
been adopted in six enterprises in Beijing, altogether 203 tons 
of COD were reduced and some 6.3 million yuan ($724,000) was 
saved. 
  Yang has high hopes for the investment bank and clean 
production programme, but he is less optimistic about the 
prospects of law enforcement improvement. 
  The awareness of environmental laws is low. More often than 
not laws are not strictly observed and enforcement is lax. 
  Some officials, especially the senior ones, let power and 
opinion overrule laws, Yang said. 
  Many times the environmental protection agencies find 
themselves lacking the authority to solve the problems facing 
them. 
  "There is no clarified legal articles stipulating the kind 
of 
punishment for the law violators," Yang said. 
  Some environmental protection departments in enterprises and 
local governments have been merged or cancelled. And some local 
environment protection chiefs have been replaced when they try 
to do their job. 
  Theoretically speaking, enterprises and projects seriously 
breaking anti-pollution laws should be shut down. But it will be 
a difficult decision to make because the State has to consider 
the benefits of the unemployed workers--most of whom would from 
State factories [as published]. 
  Yang urged that relevant laws and regulations be amended. 
  Now some enterprises would rather pay fines for emitting 
pollutants than treat pollution, which costs many times higher. 
  Statistics from GUANGMING DAILY indicated that the fines for 
environmental pollution in 1992 and 1993 totalled 5.05 billion 
yuan ($580 million), but during the same period, the money 
invested to treat the pollution reached 5.57 billion yuan ($640 
million). 
  To keep up with the new realities of the market economy, the 
State plans to upgrade a series of environmental laws this year, 
including those concerning the air and water protection.

<F P=106> [Report by reporter Liu Ruichang (0491 3843 1603): "China </F>
Supports Establishment of Partnership Relations for Sustainable 
Development"] 
  [Text] Bridgetown, 5 May (XINHUA) -- At a high-level 
meeting of the UN "global conference on sustainable development 
of small island developing countries" held in Bridgetown, 
capital of Barbados, Liu Chengguo, leader of the Chinese 
Government delegation, pointed out that the principle of 
establishing partnership relations for sustainable development 
as defined in this conference should become the foundation of 
international cooperation in the fields of environment and 
development. 
  Liu Chengguo held: The sustainable development of small 
island developing countries is an important component of global 
sustainable development. Small island developing countries' 
efforts to develop the economy and protect the environment 
constitute a contribution to realizing the goal of global 
sustained development. 
  Speaking on how to establish such partnership relations for 
sustainable development, Liu Chengguo said that such relations 
should be characterized by mutual respect and equality in 
treating each other. He said: Large or small and strong or 
weak as they may be, all countries are equal partners in 
international cooperation. Only in this way, can they have the 
foundation for cooperation. If a country criticizes others at 
every turn, always tries to force certain patterns or the 
policies and methods suitable to some countries on others, and 
even regards money and technical aids as political counters and 
puts forward unreasonable demands on the internal affairs of the 
aided countries, partnership relations will be out of the 
question. 
  Liu Chengguo said: In such partnership relations, the 
endeavor to solve global environmental problems should also be 
closely combined with the endeavor to solve the specific 
problems that small island developing countries are faced with, 
and small island developing countries should be helped to attain 
the two goals of sustained economic development and 
environmental protection, which supplement each other. 
  Liu Chengguo pointed out that such partnership relations 
should manifest the principle of "common and yet different 
responsibilities." He said: Changes in weather, rise of the 
sea level, pollution of seas and coasts, and other environmental 
problems are not created chiefly by small island countries, but 
small island countries are the first to suffer the damage. Many 
problems left from colonial or trusteeship periods are still 
restricting their social and economic development. Therefore, 
to effectively solve the environmental problems of small island 
countries and enable them to achieve sustainable development, 
the international community, especially developed countries, 
should shoulder more duties. 
  In conclusion, Liu Chengguo said: As a developing country, 
China has a deep understanding and sympathy toward the 
difficulties small island developing countries encounter. China 
has established friendly cooperative relations with many small 
island developing countries and is willing to actively probe and 
strengthen multiform and multi-layered South-South cooperation 
to realize common development and prosperity. 
  The UN "global conference on sustainable development of 
small 
island developing countries" opened on 25 April. Government 
delegations from 100 member countries of the United Nations, 
including China, attended the conference. The conference was 
held particularly for the purpose of addressing the special 
problems regarding the environment and development of small 
island countries after the 1992 UN conference on environment and 
development.

<F P=106> [Report by China Radio International reporter Chen Yong; </F>
from the "Current Affairs" program--recorded] 
  [Text] China's economic reform has made tremendous progress 
but the country is facing a resources shortage, environmental 
pollution, and overpopulation. Vice Minister of the State 
Planning Commission Chen Yaobang says future development will 
pay more attention to sustainable development of the resources 
and the environment. He says China's National Agenda 21 aims at 
bringing industrial pollution under control by the year 2000. 
The National Agenda 21 covers the economic development, natural 
resources, environmental protection, agriculture, population, 
and education. The plan is China's response to the World Agenda 
21 endorsed by the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. All 
participating countries agreed to do their best to protect the 
environment. Premier Li Peng attended the Earth Summit and 
promised to implement the resolution on behalf of the Chinese 
Government. Vice minister Chen Yaobang says China's National 
Agenda 21 was approved by the State Council in March this year. 
  Chen Yaobang says China's National Agenda 21 considers the 
country's actual conditions and the relationship between the 
population, environment, and development in the next century. 
Chen Yaobang says the plan is the guiding principle for the 
nation's long and medium term social and economic plans. The 
formulation of the National Agenda 21 has involved over 300 
Chinese experts and has drawn the attention of the United 
Nation's Development Program [UNDP]. The UNDP has worked with 
the Chinese Government for making Agenda 21. Chen Yaobang says 
Agenda 21 will be implemented in three phases. Sixty three 
projects are included in the first phase of the plan. The 
projects are aimed at obtaining international cooperation. Chen 
Yaobang says the preferential project will give a boost to 
China's sustainable development. He believes the implementation 
can have some influence over global development. However, he 
says the implementation is a huge amount of investment. 
  Chen Yaobang says the first stage of implementation needs 
$3.7 billion. The Chinese Government will cover 60 percent of 
the cost. The other 40 percent will be obtained through 
international donations. China is to hold an international 
donor conference in July to gain financial and technical 
assistance.

<F P=106> ["Stipulations on Management of First Import of Chemicals </F>
and the Import and Export of Toxic Chemicals"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Chapter I -- General Principles </H5>
  Article 1: In order to protect the health of human beings 
and the ecology, to strengthen management over the first import 
of chemicals and over the import and export of toxic chemicals, 
and to implement the "London Code on Exchange of Data on the 
International Trade in Chemicals (1989 amended version)," 
(London Code for short) these stipulations are drafted. 
  Article 2: Activities in the import and export of chemicals 
within the areas administered by the PRC must abide by these 
stipulations. 
  Article 3: These stipulations apply to the first import of 
chemicals, and to environmental management regarding the import 
and export of chemicals listed into the "Category of Toxic 
Chemicals Banned or Strictly Restricted in China" (the Category 
for short). 
  Food additives, medicines, drugs for use in animals, 
cosmetics, and radioactive materials need not follow these 
stipulations. 
  Article 4: The terms used in these stipulations have the 
following meanings: 
  1. "Chemicals" refers to chemical materials made by man or 
obtained from the nature, including the chemical materials 
themselves, chemical mixtures, or compenents of chemical 
compounds, as well as the substances used as industrial 
chemicals and pesticides. 
  2. "Banned chemicals" refers to chemicals that are 
completely banned because they harm health and the environment. 
  3. "Strictly restricted chemicals" refers to chemicals that 
are banned because they harm health and environment, but still 
can be used under special circumstances and with authorization. 
  4. "Toxic chemicals" refers to chemicals that, after 
entering the environment, cause harm to health and the 
environment through environmental accumulation, biological 
accumulation, biological transformation, chemical reaction, and 
so on, or which cause serious harm and potential danger to human 
beings through contact. 
  5. "The first import of chemicals" means the export to 
China, by a foreign businessman or his agent, of a chemical that 
has not been registered in China by him. Even if the same kind 
of chemical has been registered in China by another foreign 
businessman or his agent, the former case will still be viewed 
as a first import of chemicals. 
  6. "Approval granted upon prior knowledge" means that 
international transportation of banned and strictly restricted 
chemicals -- banned and strictly restricted for the purpose of 
protecting mankind's health and the environment -- must be 
carried out with the approval of the state-level department 
assigned the administrative duty by the importing country. 
  7. "Export" and "import" refer to the activities of 
performing formalities for the entry and exit of chemicals 
through the PRC's customs departments, not including transit 
shipments. 
<H5>  Chapter II -- Supervision and Management </H5>
  Article 5: The State Environmental Protection Administration 
practices overall environmental supervision and management 
regarding the first import of chemicals and the import and 
export of toxic chemicals, takes charge of the thorough 
implementation of the procedure for granting approvals upon 
prior knowledge according to the "London Code," announces 
China's list of banned chemicals or strictly restricted toxic 
chemicals, registers the first import of chemicals, approves and 
manages the import and export of those toxic chemicals listed in 
the "Category," signs and issues "Environmental Management 
Registration Certificates for the Import/Export of Chemicals" 
and "Environmental Management Note of Advice on Allowing the 
Import/Export of Toxic Chemicals To Pass Through," and issues 
public notices on registering chemicals that are imported for 
the first time. 
  Article 6: The PRC's customs departments examine the import 
and export of toxic chemicals listed in the "Category," and 
allow them to pass on presentation of the "Environmental 
Management Note of Advice on Allowing the Import/Export of Toxic 
Chemicals To Pass Through" issued by the State Environmental 
Protection Administration. 
  The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, 
pursuant to its duties, assists the State Environmental 
Protection Administration in examining the relevant contents of 
applications for environmental management registration regarding 
the first import of chemicals and the import and export of toxic 
chemicals, and announces the "Category of Toxic Chemicals Banned 
or Strictly Restricted in China." 
  Article 7: The State Commission for Assessing Toxic 
Chemicals, to be established by the State Environmental 
Protection Administration, is responsible for the work to 
comprehensive appraise those chemicals for which applications 
for environmental management registration are lodged for the 
purpose of import and export, and will advise the State 
Environmental Protection Administration on technical matters 
relating to the implementation of these stipulations. 
  The State Commission for Assessing Toxic Chemicals will 
consist of the management personnel from the departments in 
charge of the environment, health, agriculture, the chemical 
industry, foreign trade, commercial inspection, customs, and the 
relevant quarters, as well as technical experts; they will serve 
a three-year tenure. 
  Article 8: Following these stipulations, the local 
environmental protection departments at various levels will 
carry out environmental management and supervision of the first 
import of chemicals and the import and export of toxic chemicals. 
<H5>  Chapter III -- Registration Management </H5>
  Article 9: When a foreign businessman or his agent exports 
to China any chemical that has not been registered in China 
(except for pesticides), he must file an application with the 
State Environmental Protection Administration for environmental 
management registration regarding the first import of chemicals, 
fill out the "Application for Environmental Management 
Registration Regarding the First Import of Chemicals" according 
to the regulations, and provide a test sample (generally not 
less than 250 grams) free of charge. 
  Registration and management of pesticides sold by foreign 
businessmen to China for the first time, will continue to be 
carried out according to the "Regulations on Registering 
Pesticides," and the Ministry of Agriculture will exchange 
registration information with the State Environmental Protection 
Administration according to a fixed schedule. 
  Article 10: When the State Environmental Protection 
Administration examines and approves applications for 
environmental protection registration regarding the first import 
of chemicals, it will grant environmental management 
registration permits to chemicals that meet requirements, and 
will issue the "Environmental Protection Registration 
Certificates for Import/Export of Chemicals," to allow their 
import. No registration will be performed for the chemicals 
that, on examination, are found to be unsuitable for import into 
China, and the applicants will be so notified. 
  For a chemical that is imported for the first time, and on 
examination is deemed to require more testing and a longer 
period of observation in order to determine its degree of 
danger, temporary registration can be performed, and a temporary 
registration certificate can be issued. 
  The chemicals that have not obtained environmental 
management 
registration certificates for the import of chemicals, or 
temporary registration certificates, cannot be imported. 
  Article 11: The environmental management registration 
obtained by a foreign businessman or his agent during the first 
import of a chemical to China will be valid for five years; if a 
request for extension of the registration is required before the 
valid period expires, the original applicant should file an 
application to renew the registration six months ahead of the 
date of expiration. 
  A temporary registration is valid for one year, and a 
decision should be made before the date of expiration on whether 
to grant formal registration. Under special circumstances -- 
and with approval from the registration department -- an 
extension can be granted, but not for more than one year. 
  Article 12: Each time a foreign businessman or his agent 
exports to China any industrial chemicals or pesticides listed 
in the "Category," or when someone inside the country imports 
such chemicals from a foreign country, he must file an 
application for environmental management registration regarding 
the import of toxic chemicals with the State Environmental 
Protection Administration. For those chemicals that are allowed 
to be imported, the administration will issue the "Environmental 
Management Registration Certificate for Import/Export of 
Chemicals" and the "Environmental Management Note of Advice on 
Allowing Import/Export of Toxic Chemicals To Pass Through" (the 
"Note of Advice" for short). The "Note of Advice" follows the 
system of one note for each batch, and each "Note of Advice" can 
be used for customs clearance only once within its period of 
validity. 
  Article 13: To apply for the export of chemicals listed in 
the "Category," one must file an application with the State 
Environmental Protection Administration for environmental 
management registration regarding the export of toxic chemicals. 
  After receiving the application, the State Environmental 
Protection Administration should notify the department in charge 
in the importing country, and after receiving a notice of 
approval for import from the department in charge in the 
importing country, will issue to the applicant the 
"Environmental Management Registration Certificate for 
Import/Export of Chemicals," which allows the export of toxic 
chemicals. Concerning chemicals for which the department in 
charge in the importing country does not give import approval, 
no registration will be performed, no export will be allowed, 
and the applicant will be so notified. 
  Article 14: The "Environmental Management Registration 
Certificate for Import/Export of Chemicals" signed and issued by 
the State Environmental Protection Administration must have a 
stamp from the PRC State Environmental Protection Administration 
approving environmental management registration regarding the 
import and export of chemicals. A green "Environmental 
Management Registration Certificate for Import/Export of 
Chemicals" is granted to an applicant who wants to import or 
export a toxic chemical listed in the "Category." A pink 
"Environmental Management Registration Certificate for 
Import/Export of Chemicals" is granted to a foreign businessman 
or his agent who wants to export a chemical to China for the 
first time. A temporary registration certificate is white. 
  Article 15: The first page of the "Environmental Management 
Note of Advice on Allowing Import/Export of Toxic Chemicals To 
Pass Through" will be kept by the State Environmental Protection 
Administration. The second page (the original) will be given to 
the applicant for customs clearance purposes. The third page 
will be sent to the State Administration for Import and Export 
Commodity Inspection. 
  Article 16: The verification period for an application for 
environmental management registration regarding the import and 
export of chemicals begins from the day the application is filed 
with information meeting the requirements for registration. The 
verification period for an application for registering the first 
import of chemicals will not exceed 180 days; the verification 
period for an application for registering the import and export 
of the toxic chemicals listed in the "Category" will not exceed 
30 days. 
  Article 17: When the State Environmental Protection 
Administration examines and approves an application for 
environmental management registration regarding the import and 
export of chemicals, it has the power to question the applicant 
and to ask him to supply more relevant information. 
  The State Environmental Protection Administration should 
keep 
the technological secrets concerning the information and sample 
provided by the applicant. 
  Article 18: The State Environmental Protection

  [Text] Tokyo, May 18 KYODO -- Japan may accept a French 
proposal to create a whale sanctuary in the Antarctic Ocean if 
it will exclude minke whales, Fisheries Agency officials 
suggested Wednesday [18 May]. 
  Japan expects a compromise to be made on the proposal to be 
put to a vote at the International Whaling Commission (IWC) 
annual conference in Mexico from May 23 to 27. 
  "It is natural to protect more than 10 kinds of large whales 
as resources but (the IWC) can set up a sanctuary by limiting 
its term and its scope," a senior official of the agency said. 
  He suggested that minke whales, which Japan wants to hunt 
commercially, be excluded from the proposed sanctuary. 
  Japan is opposed to the French proposal to designate 
Antarctic waters south of the 40th parallel as a sanctuary for 
whales for 50 years. 
  The last IWC conference, held in Kyoto, western Japan, 
failed 
to gain enough votes to adopt the proposal due to opposition 
from nations supporting commercial whaling such as Japan and 
Norway. 
  Antiwhaling groups including Greenpeace International have 
said the proposal is likely to be adopted at next week's Mexico 
meeting. 
  The 46th IWC General Assembly meeting will be held in the 
Pacific coast resort town of Puerto Vallarta. 
  Japan stopped commercial whaling in 1988 following an IWC 
ban.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 18 KYODO -- An Environment Agency panel 
has drafted a new long-term program calling for greater 
involvement by individuals, businesses and the government in 
efforts to protect natural surroundings from industrial 
pollution. 
  KYODO NEWS SERVICE obtained a copy of the draft program 
sketched out by the agency's central environmental council, 
headed by University of Tokyo Professor Emeritus Jiro Kondo. 
  The draft says, "the expansion of human social and economic 
activities...led to the excessive use of natural resources so as 
to nullify the environment's ability to restore original levels 
of the resources, while depleting wildlife and reducing its 
ability to survive." 
  "It also triggered pollution of the environment by expanding 
the discharge of unnecessary waste," it said. 
  "It is also important to defend and preserve the environment 
by conquering the sort of environmental destruction attributable 
to modern lifestyles in cities," it said. 
  The draft urged the public in developed countries to 
"question the current mode of civilization where prevailing 
values have encouraged mass production, huge consumption and the 
subsequent vast discharge of waste into the environment." 
  The report also urged individual members of Japanese society 
to "take action" useful in staving off environmental 
deterioration. 
  However, it stopped short of setting numerical targets and 
specific timetables that could be referred to as yardsticks for 
attaining the cleanup of contaminated areas. 
  The report also urged the government and local communities 
to 
step up efforts to preserve and protect small forests in cities 
that have survived the rapid urbanization of Japan. 
  It cautioned that such forests, beaches and paddy fields in 
mountainous areas are on the brink of losing their natural 
capabilities to provide shelter to small animals and to clean up 
contaminated water. 
  The draft also urged efforts to prevent wildlife not native 
to Japan, like the black bass, from damaging Japan's ecosystem. 
Such wildlife have infiltrated the Japanese environment 
following their intentional or unwitting importation, the report 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- Japan will "do its utmost" 
to bloc a proposal for a whale sanctuary in the Antarctic Ocean, 
the head of Japan's delegation to the May 23-27 International 
Whaling Commission (IWC) annual conference in Mexico said 
Thursday [12 May]. 
  Kazuo Shima, who is deputy director of the Fisheries Agency, 
told a group of 400 whaling industry supporters dining on whale 
meat at the Parliamentary Museum in Tokyo that the antiwhaling 
movement has no "scientific basis." 
  He said Japan will rely on established scientific facts to 
push its case at the 46th IWC General Assembly meeting in Puerto 
Vallarta on the central Mexican Pacific coast. 
  "The arguments put by the antiwhaling movement lack any 
scientific basis," Shima said. "You might as well say they are 
a religion." 
  "If the proposal for a sanctuary is adopted, this sort of 
thing will spread to all oceans around the world," he said. "If 
this is introduced, we will have to think from basics about our 
relationship with the IWC. We will do our utmost to block it." 
  Participants at the meeting, convened by the "society to 
protect whaling tradition and cuisine," included members of 
opposition and governing coalition parties, officials from the 
Japan Whaling Association and the Institute of Cetacean 
Research, as well as writers and entertainers. 
  The society's members want the IWC to permit a resumption of 
commercial whaling by Japan. 
  Japan stopped commercial whaling in 1988 following an IWC 
ban.

<F P=106> [Report on a joint air pollution test in Seoul conducted by </F>
SISA JOURNAL and the PAEDAL Environmental Union on 24-25 March] 
  [Text] Seoul is the second most polluted city in the world. 
This is a result of the WHO's examination of air pollution in 
the 20 largest cities in the world. The entire domestic press 
was astonished at this unpleasant news reported in December 
1992. However, that was all. This serious fact has been 
forgotten by the government, the press, and the people as a year 
and four months have passed since the news was reported. When 
the phenol incident occurred, and when rotten water was 
collected in the upper waters of the Naktong River, a tap-water 
source, people were concerned about the contamination of the 
"visible" water. They, however, did not worry about the 
contamination of the "invisible" sky. 
  At least in the ROK, air pollution does not attract people's 
attention or the environmental authorities' measures against it, 
compared with water pollution. There is a particular reason why 
the air pollution in metropolitan cities such as Seoul can avoid 
the keen eyes of today's people who are sensitive to health. 
This is because the weather of those cities changes rapidly. 
The air pollution rate of each time zone of a day is different 
due to a big gap between day and night temperatures. Snow or 
rain clears smog in the air no matter how thick it is. 
Contaminating materials do not stay in one place because of the 
ceaselessly blowing wind. In fact, a report says that a 
contaminating material created in Inchon at 0600 arrives on the 
coast of the East Sea at 2200. 
  Paradoxically, however, air pollution is more dangerous and 
fatal than water pollution because of these attributes. 
Scholars say: "Post-measures can be taken for water pollution, 
but not for air pollution because the latter can kill a large 
number of people all of a sudden. The moment when an air 
pollution-related incident occurs is the moment of ruin." If 
various contaminating materials exceeding environmental 
standards drift in the air for a certain period of time one day 
without snow, rain, or wind, a disastrous incident may occur in 
front of us. The 1952 "London Smog" incident, in which more 
than 4,000 people were killed over a few days, thus astonishing 
the world, is a good example. 
  This is why SISA JOURNAL conducted an air pollution test in 
Seoul. The magazine believes the customs like locking the 
stable door only after the horse is stolen that were repeatedly 
confirmed whenever frequent incidents involving water 
contamination took place must not repeated in coping with air 
pollution. The trial-and-error principle is not applicable in 
handling air pollution. We have not heard any report on the 
refreshment of air in Seoul since the city disgracefully ranked 
as the second most polluted in the world. Instead, we only hear 
the uneasy news that contaminating materials of a backward 
country are blowing from China. Therefore, SISA JOURNAL decided 
to examine the actual status of air pollution in Seoul with all 
possible means. 
  Carbon nitrogen and sulfuric acid gas, which are major air 
pollutants, were intensively measured in the recent test. 
Ammonia gas, which is not very harmful to the human body but 
annoys people with its bad smell, was also measured. Currently, 
carbon nitrogen, sulfuric acid gas, ozone, and ammonia can be 
measured with simple meters. Accordingly, all major air 
pollutants that are measurable with simple meters, except zone, 
were measured in the recent test. 
SISA JOURNAL could not make a survey of all contaminating 
materials in the air. Therefore, this survey had to be subject 
to limitations in that civilian organizations had conducted it. 
  The survey team of SISA JOURNAL set the 24-25 March as the 
date for jointly examining the air pollution situation 
throughout Seoul in cooperation with Paedal Environmental Union. 
It had, however, conducted many preparatory surveys to examine 
the air pollution situation in Seoul before 24-25 March. At 
ten o'clock on the evening of 24 March, approximately 100 survey 
team members from the SISA JOURNAL began to set up 400 simple 
measuring instruments on the selected areas throughout Seoul, 
but it took 24 hours to complete them because of snow that fell 
that night. Therefore, it could examine the air pollution 
situation only after the contaminating materials were removed by 
snow. According to a master's thesis released by Kim Chong-ku, 
student of the Graduate School of Environment at Seoul National 
University, in February 1994, the density of carbon nitrogen in 
air can be greatly decreased between 5 ppb [parts per billion] 
and 20 ppb depending on the amount of snow or rain (1 ppb equals 
0.001 ppm [parts per million]). 
  As a result of the survey, it is reaffirmed that the key 
contaminators of air pollution has changed. The amount of 
sulfurous acid gas in air -- which has been so far regarded as a 
key contaminator of air pollution throughout cities, small or 
large -- has been greatly decreased to below the environmental 
standards drift, while carbon nitrogen -- which is produced from 
car exhaust pipes -- has gradually increased. This is the 
current situation throughout the cities. Although the survey was 
conducted in the clear weather of that day, the sulfurous acid 
gas drift (average environmental standards drift is 80 ppb per 
day) given by the survey showed the lowest point was 65.9 ppb, 
while the highest point was 8.2 ppb from a total of 186 
measuring spots. Also, the carbon nitrogen value given by the 
survey showed that the highest point was 83.6 ppb, while the 
average point was 42.9 ppb from a total of 340 measuring points. 
<H5>  Carbon Nitrogen Can Produce Materials Causing Cancer </H5>
  These drifts could be also found in the documents recently 
issued by the Ministry of the Environment, which has examined 
the air pollution situation throughout cities over past several 
years. The houses built for coal briquet [yontan] purposes have 
been changed into ones that can use gas. The number of cars has 
greatly increased every year. Because of these factors, air 
pollution in Seoul has been further aggravated. The model of 
the air pollution condition in Seoul is similar to that of 
developed countries by escaping from the framework of 
underdeveloping countries. However, we cannot express relief 
only because the air pollution situation in Seoul is similar to 
that of developed countries. This is because there is nitrogen 
oxide in the air -- which is similar to carbon nitrogen -- which 
produces photochemical smoke [kwanghwahak sumogu], thus reacting 
to sunlight. 
  Considering carbon nitrogen alone, the air pollution 
situation in Seoul has not reached a point that we need to 
worry. However, the average drift of the carbon nitrogen 
density in Seoul that was examined on 24-25 March reached 42.9 
ppb. This drift is far below the average environmental standard 
drift (80 ppb). The area of Chongyang-ri station in Seoul is 
the only one that exceeded the environmental standards drift of 
carbon nitrogen. 
  However, this result can be greatly different only if we 
apply it to Japan's environmental standards drift. Some 
Japanese local groups have regarded 40 ppb as their average 
environmental standard drift in a day, while regarding 60 ppb as 
their highest value. It is not right to simply compare the air 
pollution situations in Seoul to that of Japan, but it is a 
problem if the environmental standard drift of carbon nitrogen 
in Seoul exceeds that of Japan. Furthermore, considering the 
drift of the survey, which was conducted in clear weather after 
heavy snow fell, we can easily guess how the air in Seoul is 
seriously polluted on a normal day. There is no study that the 
Koreans are stronger than the Japanese in overcoming air 
pollution. 
  One can suffer pain in his throat when one is exposed to 
carbon nitrogen between 200 and 700 ppb for 20 minutes. Except 
those who work in a special working place, ordinary people will 
not suffer pain from the carbon nitrogen of those drifts. 
However, if carbon nitrogen reacts with other chemicals in the 
air, unpredictable and difficult situations may occur. In other 
words, it is possible that nitro-chemicals that cause cancer can 
be produced as a result of the combination of carbon nitrogen -- 
which is produced from car exhaust pipes -- and hydrocarbon, 
such as benzol. It seems that carbon nitrogen has increased the 
rate of cancer growth as a result of such chemical reactions. 
The reason we set the environmental standard drift is due to 
our apprehension over air pollution throughout the country. 
<H5>  Is the Government's Automatic Measuring Network Reliable? </H5>
  In Seoul, there are 10 automatic air pollution measuring 
spots operated by the Ministry of Environment and another 10 by 
the Seoul Municipal Government. Environmental groups have 
persistently raised the issue of the fact that data from these 
automatic measuring networks are the only source for the 
government to study and manage air pollution. The question is 
whether the data from the automatic measuring networks 
accurately reflect the level of air pollution. 
  On the night of 24 March, SISA JOURNAL installed a number of 
simple measuring instruments near 15 of the 20 spots where 
automatic measuring networks are located. (Five of the 20 
measuring spots are constantly not operating because of regular 
checks.) This was to check whether the results from the 
automatic measuring networks represent the level of air 
pollution in that area. The density analysis of nitrogen 
dioxide collected by simple measuring instruments was 
significantly different from the value given by the automatic 
measuring networks. 
  The nitrogen dioxide value given by the automatic measuring 
networks on 25 March showed the lowest point was registered in 
Kwanghwamun (12 ppb) and the highest in Sinsol-tong (33 ppb) 
while the result from simple measuring instruments in 
Sinsol-tong was 37.2 ppb and in Kwanghwamun 41.8 ppb. 
Pulkwang-tong was the only area where the value registered by 
the simple measuring instrument was lower than that of the 
automatic measuring network. In other 14 areas, results from 
the simple measuring instrument were higher than those of the 
automatic measuring network by 1.13 to 4.62 times. The 
difference of nitrogen dioxide value from the simple versus the 
automatic measuring instruments by area is in the following 
order: Taechi-tong (60:13), Kwanghwamun (41.8:12), Songsu-tong 
(38:14), Kuui-tong (56:21), Ssangmun-tong (48.2:18), Sillim-tong 
(33.9:14), Chamsil-tong (41.4:23), Pangyi-tong (36.1:21), 
Hwagok-tong (33.6:23), Mapo (34.6:24), Namgajwa-tong (38.8:27), 
Myonmok-tong (37.2:29), Panpo-tong (37.2:31), Sinsol-tong 
(37.2:33), and Pulkwang-tong (26.6:32). 
  How can we explain the maximum 4.6 times difference? Since 
"the low in difference" principle can be applied to the air 
pollution value, in format theory, either one of the two 
measurings was correct or both were incorrect. 
  The statistical advantage of the simple measuring instrument 
is that it can measure pollution in places where measuring is 
difficult and it can gather various data in a certain area. Of 
course, some people question the accuracy of the simple 
measuring instrument. However, it is difficult to accept the 
fact that the nitrogen dioxide value of Kwanghwamun, where 
traffic is one of the busiest, was the lowest in Seoul. 
  Therefore, the management of the automatic measuring 
networks 
should be checked. Maybe the problem was that the automatic 
measuring instruments are not being properly maintained rather 
than that the instruments have their own defects. For instance, 
the notch on a balance must be at zero in order to accurately 
measure the weight. Keeping the notch of a pollution measuring 
instrument at zero is called "revision." If an automatic 
measuring instrument's record becomes drastically high after 
revision when there is no specific weather change, that means 
that the automatic measuring instrument was not normal before 
the revision. 
  This problem was shown in the statistics regarding the trend 
of nitrogen dioxide monitored by an automatic measuring 
instrument in Taejon city in January 1994. The revision date 
was 23 January. The pollution density of nitrogen dioxide was 8 
ppb on 22 January, 3 ppb on the 23d, but drastically increased 
to 31 ppb on the 24th, 58 ppb on the 25th, and 57 ppb on the 
26th. The fact that the values before and after the revision 
have such a significant difference makes the function of the 
automatic measuring instrument doubtful. If the government 
continued to use such incorrect automatic measuring networks, 
this means, as far as air pollution is concerned, the government 
has provided incorrect information to the people to avoid 
condemnation. 
  Usually, the causes of pollution are considered to verify 
the 
geographical characteristics of a certain pollutant. In this 
survey, the average pollution rate of nitrogen dioxide, which is 
produced during the process of cars burning fuel, thermal power 
plants, heaters, and gas stoves, was 49.5 ppb in subway 
stations, 38.7 ppb in street shops, 38.3 ppb on roads, 34.3 ppb 
in residential areas, 32.3 ppb at parks, and 28.6 ppb in 
schools. Chongnyangni station area recorded the highest at 83.6 
ppb, followed by an office in Socho-tong, Socho-ku (79.2 ppb), a 
hill in Pongchon-tong, Kwanak- ku (78.4 ppb), and City Hall 
subway station (78 ppb). 
<H5>  Apkujong Subway Station Twice as Polluted as Streets </H5>
  One notable point of this survey is that subway stations 
were 
shown to have been more polluted than the streets. It is 
difficult to find a particular pollutant source that might 
produce nitrogen dioxide in subway stations. However, they 
showed a higher rate than streets, which are constantly being 
polluted by automobile exhaust. For instance, the average ppb of 
10 spots in Mukyo-tong, Chung-ku was 35.1 while that of the 
underground arcade in the same area was 45.9. Streets near 
Apkujong station in Kangnam-ku was 37 ppb while the subway 
recorded as high as 70.4 ppb. Figures monitored from inside 
subway stations were 1.5 to two times higher than upper streets. 
The reason is simple. Ventilation problems. Nitrogen dioxide 
produced in the streets is sent to underground spaces through 
inlets and is accumulated there due to poor ventilation 
equipment. 
  Nitrogen dioxide pollution rates in the streets vary from 8 
ppb to 83.6, but are generally high. The big difference 
reflects the difference between high-traffic and jammed main 
roads and low-traffic alleys. 
  Another notable point is that inner spaces with gas stoves 
had a higher rate. SISA JOURNAL conducted another test in one 
office on 4 April and discovered different results in one office 
depending on the measuring point. A certain point showed 38.4 
ppb while another point showed a rate as high as 110.7 ppb, much 
higher than the standard environmental figure. 
  Ammonia is excluded on environmental check lists because it 
is not too harmful to humans, but is a pollutant with a strong 
odor. Because it can be easily detected by simple measuring 
instruments, SISA JOURNAL installed the instruments at 290 spots 
along with nitrogen dioxide measuring instruments. The result 
shows very high pollution rates in sewage, manholes, trash cans, 
and markets near the measuring spots. Among the measured areas, 
residential areas in Amsa-tong, Kangdong-ku had the lowest rate 
at 15.5 ppb, while streets in Pongchon-tong, Kwanak-ku had a 
pollution rate as high as 254 ppb. 
Air pollution is not visible, cannot be felt, and has a 
characteristic of being chronic when even a very small amount is 
accumulated in the human body. People say that if they wear a 
shirt even for just one day in the city it gets dirty. 
Therefore, they say that "the air has worsened" based on such 
an experience. However, they do not know why and how much it has 
worsened. The government does not know either. We call this 
the so-called `Seoul- type smog,' but we have not yet found the 
cause for this. Since symptoms do not appear immediately, there 
is a high possibility that polluted elements will slowly 
accumulate in our bodies, thus leading to a chronic disease. 
  There are only two ways to deal with air pollution. It must 
be measured accurately and its exhaust must be controlled. 
However, we are still far off from controlling exhaust under 
the current situation. It is possible to control power stations 
and industrial facilities. The problem is automobiles and 
domestic heating. These are responsible for from 70 to 80 
percent of all the carbon dioxide pollution. 
  Of all the automobiles, 36 percent are run by diesel, the 
`cause of pollution.' This is the highest percentage in the 
world. This is because the restriction for emitting gas is too 
lax and the price of diesel oil is much cheaper compared with 
gasoline. Another reason is because the management of domestic 
heating is not being carried out well. Moreover, the main cause 
of air pollution is now due to nitrogen oxide. This is truly 
due to the trend of the times. In a survey, a `horrible' study 
was made in which 50 people out of 100,000 who live in a city in 
Germany, where there are much less diesel automobiles than the 
ROK, will suffer from cancer due to diesel pollution. 
  Therefore, under the current situation, we must at least be 
accurate in `measuring.' This is the same as the proverb: We 
can become the chief of a town only when we know what the duties 
are. The government's announcements on the matter of air 
pollution is difficult to believe. This is because the state 
has almost no materials at all about this. During an interview 
with a professor studying air pollution in the process of 
gathering news on this matter, he said: "The government will 
pay attention to this matter only after an incident occurs 
regarding air pollution." 
Work investigating the "nationality" (origin) of air pollutants 
is currently under way in Korea. The Environmental Research 
Center of KIST (Korea Institute of Science and Technology) and 
Cheju National University began joint research work on 11 March 
by measuring the long-distance movement of air polluting 
substances. The investigation is being conducted at the Alpine 
Observation Station on Suwolbong located at Hankyong-myon, 
Puk-Cheju-gun, Cheju Province, on a three-year schedule. 
  The Alpine Observation Station on Cheju Island was selected 
as the measuring point because it is located in a typical "clean 
air area" of Korea, with easy access to meteorological data from 
the nearby radar of the Meteorological Observatory. In the 
capital area, including Seoul, the air pollution degree is so 
severe that it is impractical to distinguish whether pollutants 
are of native or foreign origin. 
  This research of ascertaining the source of air pollutants 
provides very essential data and materials needed by the 
government in establishing its environmental policy. Dr. Sim 
Sang-kyu of the Environmental Research Center, who is 
participating in the survey, said that "the research will be a 
great help, particularly in assessing how much influence China 
has on air pollution here in Korea." 
  China depends on coal for approximately 75 percent of its 
energy consumption. Of the world total coal production of 4.5 
billion tons, about 1 billion tons are produced in China. Over 
90 percent of its coal consumption is for fuel. It is evidently 
clear that the emission of sulfurous acid gas is estimated at 16 
million tons (on a 1991 basis), which is more than 15 times the 
figure in Korea. Even the National Environmental Protection 
Bureau of the PRC once expressed its concern in these words: 
"In China, the discharge of sulfurous acid gas is bound to grow 
sharply with the boost in its coal production, and the hazards 
of it may spread to neighboring countries." (SISA JOURNAL, Vol. 
175) 
  At one point, Japan published the result of research which 
claimed that more than 50 percent of acid rain fall in that 
country is influenced by China. Korea has only estimated the 
influence at about 30 to 50 percent, but has been unable yet to 
present any research result to back it up. The general interest 
and concern in the phenomena of yellow sand, which had been 
taken as just a natural phenomena repeated each year over 
several centuries, has abruptly risen, coinciding with the rapid 
progress in China's industrialization. There are even some 
expressing concern that some heavy metal pollutants may fly into 
this country as they are mixed with yellow sand. 
  The air pollution in the skies of Northeast Asia, such as in 
Korea, China and Japan, is now in a very serious state. Last 
March, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) 
and the Pacific Area Environmental Research Institute of Nagoya 
University of Japan jointly conducted a survey on the degree of 
pollution in the skies of the Pacific Ocean. According to the 
survey, it was found that the density of pollutants in the skies 
of the west Pacific region, such as China and Japan, was from 
five to 10 times higher than in the skies of the east Pacific. 
The survey teams have estimated that these pollutants 
originated from mainland China. 
  In determining movement courses of air pollutants under this 
plan, not only Korean institutions, but also Japan's Natural 
Environment Research Institute and Kyushu University as well as 
American universities (in California) will jointly participate. 
So much is the target of interest among many countries to 
scientifically and accurately ascertain the origin, ingredients, 
and quantities of pollutive substances. 
  Various countries in Europe already concluded the "agreement 
on long-distance movement of air pollutants" in 1979. The U.S. 
and Canada also signed the agreement on reducing acid 
rain-causing substances in 1991. The data and materials being 
made available through this survey that began this year, will 
provide valuable data for environment-related agreements by 
Korea, China and Japan in the coming days. 
  The Korean research team plans to devote their energy first 
on ascertaining the courses of movement, kinds, and distribution 
of air polluting substances. Ascertaining their chemical 
ingredients or poisonous character will be of a secondary 
consideration. The United States and Japan have steadily 
accumulated the related research data for a long time, but Korea 
has almost no data accumulated in that respect. 
  It is as important to ascertain the vertical and horizontal 
distribution of air polluting substances as it is to learn their 
course of movement. This measurement work is also being 
promoted for the first time this year. The results of this 
survey will be used for basic data required for long-range 
planning. 
  The aircraft used in the measurement work is the four-seater 
light plane called "Changgong 91," developed by Korean Air. This 
light plane is scheduled to fly over the west coast areas, 
centering around the Taean peninsula in South Chungchong 
Province, twice on days when the yellow sand phenomena occurs 
and once on the other days. 
  This study is conducted under the research plan "concerning 
the influence of yellow sand and long-distance moving pollutants 
on Korea," of which a contract order was given by the Ministry 
of Environment last October. This study will chiefly 
investigate the effect of yellow sand from China. O Sung-nam, 
director of the Earth Environmental Information System 
Laboratory of the Systems Engineering Research Institute, says: 
"The prevailing westerlies always blow in Korea. The country, 
therefore, is bound to be affected by the China continent. We 
have to distinguish the original source of the polluting 
substances at the earliest possible date. Otherwise, there is 
concern that Korea may be mistaken for a major source of air 
pollution." 
  The survey team expects that they will be able to learn not 
only the yellow sand distribution and total volume of it in the 
skies of the East Sea and Seoul, but also the kinds and 
influence of air polluting substances migrating with yellow 
sand. Dr. O said, "This aerial measurement will provide 
momentum for continuing our comprehensive and systematic 
research." 
  There are some, however, who contradict the "presumption" 
that yellow sand carries toxic pollutants of the industrial 
districts of mainland China to this country. Dr. Sim Sang-kyu 
of KIST says, "Since the courses of yellow sand and air 
polluting substances are different from each other, the story 
that yellow sand transports heavy metal lacks credibility." Sim 
maintains that what they have mistaken for heavy metal refers to 
the extremely small quantities of heavy metal contained in 
yellow sand. 
  He says: "Yellow sand rather plays the role of blocking air 
pollution. Positive ions, such as calcium and magnesium 
contained in earth, work to neutralize acid rain." Prof. Yi 
Tong-su of Yonsei University in his dissertation once disclosed 
that the quantities of yellow sand that falls in Korea are large 
enough to completely neutralize acid rain. 
  At any rate, through the aerial measurements, the 
correlation 
between the yellow sand phenomena and air pollutants will be 
unveiled. The measurements this year will likely have more 
symbolic meaning as "the first attempt ever made in Korea" than 
as any substantive research results. It is because the 
equipment mobilized and budget funds earmarked by the 
Environment Ministry are not sufficient enough to obtain 
reliable research. 
  The flight duration of "Changgong 91" is limited to three 
hours, and the flight altitude ceiling barely reaches 2 km. As 
such, the aircraft is considered unfit for measurement of air 
pollution. The sample gathering equipment on the plane is 
better than that used by the National Environment Research 
Institute, but it takes very long to accumulate samples needed 
for making a complete specimen set. 
  "In the United States and Japan, a medium-size airplane is 
usually used for measurement over 20 hours. As compared to 
them, we are just in a rudimental stage of study. It might be 
hard to expect any satisfactory results through this measurement 
project," Dr. O said. 
  The government is also taking seriously the influence of air 
pollution in China on this country. The "meeting of earth 
environment-related ministers for countermeasures to cope with 
the situation," held on April 11 demonstrates this fact well. 
At the meeting, they said that the government would study some 
plans to expand the environmental cooperation between Korea and 
the PRC to reduce air polluting substances coming from China. 
Korea signed the Environmental Cooperation Agreement with the 
PRC last October, but concrete measures have yet to be 
established. The study on the air pollutant movement, which 
began last March, and the aerial measurement of yellow sand, 
which will begin shortly, will mark the initial steps toward 
working out countermeasures. 
  The Yokkaichi incident was a typical example of the courses 
taken in solving the problems of environmental pollution after 
Japan's industrialization and economic growth. Yokkaichi is 
where Japan's first petrochemical industry complex was 
developed. Because of noxious gases belching out from chimneys 
in the complex, the inhabitants of the nearby areas came to 
suffer severe respiratory diseases, such as asthma. 
  It was in 1959 when the damage from noxious gases and 
soot/smoke from those chimneys first surfaced as a social 
problem. The Federation of Self-Government Associations in 
Shiohama, a village adjacent to the industrial complex, filed a 
petition with the Yokkaichi City authorities. "Because of the 
noises and soot/smoke from the industrial complex, we just 
cannot sleep at night," the petition said. Despite such 
petitions, damage from air pollution grew increasingly serious 
day after day. In July of that year, Yokkaichi City inaugurated 
the Yokkaichi Antipollution Committee as an advisory board to 
the mayor. The committee requested the Medical Department of 
the Mie Prefectural University to conduct a survey on causes of 
the damage. 
  Based on the results of this survey, the antipollution 
movement by the inhabitants began on a full-fledged basis. The 
occupant industries' emission of air polluting substances 
continued, however. For instance, Mie thermal power plant 
established its incinerator, the largest of its kind in Japan, 
which is exclusively used for heavy oil. Mitsubishi 
Petrochemical sharply increased the production scale of its 
products. As manufacturing activities stepped up at their 
facilities, which are equipped with no proper antipollution 
equipment, the damage suffered by the populace in the nearby 
areas grew even more. Their movement designed to get assurances 
for human health, life and safety continued even more strongly. 
  As a result of such endeavors, the Japanese Government in 
1963 launched its surveys by designating Yokkaichi areas as 
those subject to the application of the "Soot and Smoke 
Regulation Act." On the basis of this survey, the Japanese 
Government proclaimed that Yokkaichi was subject to the law. 
  The Yokkaichi Antipollution Committee, consisting of experts 
in the area, has contributed greatly to solving the problems by 
accurately pointing out the following major problems: namely, 
that the petroleum fuel ratio in the industrial complex is 
extremely high as compared to other industrial complexes, that 
the pollution damage suffered by the populace is severe because 
factory and residential areas are mingled together, that 
managers of those factories have made almost no effort to 
prevent pollution, and that the plant layout had been made 
totally ignoring the seasonal wind changes. 
  In the last analysis, the inhabitants in the areas took the 
lead; the group of experts ascertained problems and presented 
some scientific plans for solution. In so doing, the 
government, local autonomous bodies, and businesses came to 
participate in resolving the problems. As a result, the air 
pollution level in the Yokkaichi area could be brought down 
below the permissible standards. 
  In the United States, exhaust fumes from automobiles chiefly 
in Los Angeles emerged as a great social problem in 1950. 
Exhaust fumes containing carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, and 
nitric acid compounds themselves are harmful substances. By 
reacting with sunlight, they generate large-scale photochemical 
smog. 
  To cope with this, President Nixon in 1970 proposed a plan 
to 
reduce exhaust gas from automobiles. Senator Nelson proposed 
even more powerful measures to prevent air pollution. 
Democratic Senator Muskie's bill was a compromise between the 
proposals made by Nixon and Nelson, and was formally adopted in 
1975 to reduce harmful substances in automobile exhaust fumes by 
90 percent. 
  In Japan, the Central Antipollution Measures Council in 1972 
established its plan to reduce exhaust fumes from automobiles, 
centering around details of the Muskie bill. This plan was 
designed to drastically reduce the discharge of nitric acid 
compounds from passenger cars by 1976. It was an almost 
unattainable goal with Japan's automobile production 
technologies at that time. Japanese automakers, such as Toyota 
and Nissan, filed petitions, asking for a postponement of 
enforcement of the regulations. As a result, the Japanese 
Government decided to put the regulations into force beginning 
in 1979. 
  Two major characteristics could be seen in the development 
of 
Japan's automotive industry technologies during the 1972-78 
period. The first point is that the rigid environment policy 
actually led to development of its high technologies. How to 
cope with the regulation of exhaust fumes eventually boils down 
to technological developments. It could not but be increasing 
the engine efficiency of combustion. Japan eventually succeeded 
in developing low fuel-ratio engines with high power output, and 
came to sweep over the world automobile market. 
  As compared with this example in other countries, Korea has 
been rather backing away from an environmental policy, for what 
is professed to be an economic revival. This suggests a lot 
about how our way of thinking is shortsighted. Some rigid 
environmental policy helps develop high technology and clean 
environmental technologies. We must realize that such a policy 
can be the most positive way of effectively coping with 
environmental barriers, such as the upcoming Green Round 
negotiations. 
  A certain industrial size facilitates the permeation of the 
environmental policy of the state. For instance, in the early 
1970's, the automobile industry of Japan lagged far behind the 
world's technology level, and it could not take any significant 
position in the Japanese economy. Its automobile exports to the 
United States barely accounted for about 15 percent of 
production. At that time, in the Japanese economy, the steel, 
chemical, nonferrous metal, and other basic resources-type 
industries were at the height of prosperity. 
  Therefore, when the Japanese Government established a policy 
for the rigid control of exhaust gas from automobiles, the Japan 
Automobile Industry Association lacked enough power to reject 
it. The only choice left for the industry was to develop its 
technology to cope with the situation. This sharply contrasts 
with the fact that around that time, the American Automobile 
Industry Association could successfully have postponed the 
enforcement of the Muskie bill, and that the Japanese Steel 
Industry Federation succeeded in having the environmental 
standards on nitric acid discharged from steelworks relaxed. 
  At that time, the Japanese automobile industry was too weak 
in terms of industrial scale and productivity, to reject the 
government's environmental policy, but still had enough strength 
to barely manage to develop new technologies. On the other 
hand, in our case, the scale of the automobile and other 
industries has grown too large, and the government's 
environmental policy is not readily accepted by them. Before it 
is too late, we have to do something to resolve this air 
pollution problem. To this end, the Korean Government will have 
to unfold even more powerful, rigid environmental policies. 
Yet, such policies should not lean only towards regulation. 
The government should provide various favorable conditions so 
that the businesses themselves may develop their own clean 
environment techniques. 
  What measures to reduce air pollution does our government 
have at present? First, for reduction of exhaust fumes from 
automobiles, the government has been studying the following 
measures: to reduce smoke and soot from diesel-fueled vehicles 
and develop low-pollution autos, improve the quality of 
automobile fuels, and enforce the aggregate-amount regulation of 
exhaust gas from automobiles. For reduction of sulfurous acid 
gas, it has been promoting the compulsory use of clean fuel, 
expansion of the areas where low sulfuric acid gasoline is 
supplied, as well as the collective energy supply facilities, 
and the introduction of the aggregate-amount regulation of 
sulfuric acid gas. 
  In order to reduce dust, the following plans are now under 
discussion: to regulate businesses that generate flying dust 
and reinforce the standards for installation of dust collecting 
equipment, and a master plan for reducing dust in major cities. 
It also plans to guide industrial facilities emitting 
pollutants in large quantities in establishing desulfurization 
equipment, to efficiently control industrial facilities 
discharging air pollutants, and encourage private organizations 
to participate in the guidance for and checking of pollutant 
discharging facilities. It has also been hastening the work in 
the area of expanding the air pollution gauge networks and 
improvement of the control system. 
  The problem, however, lies in the definite willingness of 
the 
government and its authorities concerned and in the possibility 
of translating policy into practice, and the transparency of the 
policy, most of all. How can air become clean when the 
government has no willingness, lacks budget funds, and has a 
shortage of necessary human resources? 
  There are many ideas to resolve the air pollution issue. 
According to Kim Chong-tal, director of the Energy Management 
Industry Research Laboratory of the Energy Economic Research 
Institute, the following measures are needed to fundamentally 
resolve the problem. In the industrial sector, which accounts 
for 53.8 percent of the total energy consumption, efforts must 
be made to build low energy-consumption types of industrial 
structures, develop technology for improvement of energy 
efficiency by type of industry, and step up the development of 
new energy-saving products. 
  In the control of demand in the transportation industry 
sector, the measures proposed include building energy-saving 
types of transportation, establishment of composite cargo 
terminals, and formulation and enforcement of plans for 
energy-saving types of land utilization. 
  According to the results of research conducted by Pak 
Yong-hun, director of the Urban Traffic Research Institute, the 
transportation systems should be built chiefly centering around 
railways and mass transit. Other alternatives suggested include 
the development and supply of low-pollution vehicles, supply of 
small automobiles, construction of bicycle roads and expanded 
supply of bicycles, construction of roads in consideration of 
ecology, and absorption of the traffic demand by the information 
and communications industry. 
  The Paedal Environment Federation, which is a private 
environment organization, has been regularly conducting 
simplified air-quality measurements. This work is considered a 
new attempt to ensure the joint ownership of information on the 
environment, which has been hitherto monopolized by the 
government, upgrade the citizens' participation in the 
antipollution drive, and supplement the automatic air pollution 
gauge networks, which are currently in an absolute shortage 
across the nation. 
  Practically, there is no way of easily resolving the air 
pollution issue. The best possible way will be to gradually 
reduce pollutants from the very sources, such as industrial 
plants, thermal power plants, automobiles, and household heaters 
and air conditioners. To this end, individual citizens are 
encouraged to actively economize on energy consumption and 
participate voluntarily in the "car-holiday system according to 
the last digit of the license plate number" (if the last figure 
is 0, the system calls for keeping the car in the garage on the 
10th, 20th and 30th days of each month). Business corporations 
for their part should endeavor to develop and adopt clean 
environment technologies. The government on its part should 
make even more strenuous efforts to supply clean fuels on an 
expanded scale, strengthen the air environmental standards, and 
regulate even more rigidly exhaust gas from automobiles.

  [Text] President Kim Yong-sam yesterday called for active 
preparation for the world trend to link environmental protection 
with trade. 
  Kim said, "The structure of industry has to be transformed 
into one which consumes less energy." 
  The Chief Executive made the remarks during a report from 
the 
Advisory Council for Science and Technology at Chongwadae 
[presidential offices]. 
  After the report, the President hosted a lunch for the 10 
council members and seven related Cabinet ministers on the 
occasion of the first anniversary of the council inauguration. 
  President Kim also said that products which do not 
contaminate the environment much have to constitute the 
mainstream of exports, calling for added efforts to foster 
people's awareness of environmental protection and energy 
conservation. 
  Pointing out the fierce confrontation between the United 
States and France during the Uruguay Round negotiations, 
President Kim accented that a comprehensive plan should be 
mapped out to sharpen the national competitiveness of the 
domestic video industry in preparation for the coming multimedia 
era. 
  "Our video industry, in fact, has been lagging far behind 
those of advanced countries chiefly because of a lack of 
creative ideas and financial shortcomings. This problem should 
not be left unattended," he said. 
  He emphasized the fact that the video industry is a more 
value added one than manufacturing and will become promising in 
the coming century. 
  Kim added that national leap into the ranks of advanced 
nations is possible only when science and technology backs, 
calling for development of Korean technology. 
  Prof. Pak U-hui of Seoul National University said that 
government officials' understanding of science and technology 
development remains low in terms of budget allocation and law. 
  He also said that officials are not catching up with the 
change of times. President Kim said that the officials have to 
change their way of thinking in the era of the World Trade 
Organization.

  [Text] Korea Resources Recovery and Reutilization 
Corporation (KORECO) was founded Sept. 11, 1980 to promote the 
reutilization of wastes and the preservation of natural 
environment, thus opening the first chapter in Korea's waste 
recycling program. 
  Since its inception, KORECO has continuously endeavored to 
overcome a common concern of mankind, resource problems, and to 
preserve a cleaner natural environment, and has spared no 
efforts in developing and disseminating waste reutilization 
technology. 
  In particular, the 1991 revision to the law on waste 
management allowed KORECO to take a central role in the 
country's efforts toward waste reutilization. 
  Fortunately, public concern over environmental preservation 
and waste reutilization has been on the rise for the past few 
years, and the KORECO has taken on a greater responsibility than 
ever before. 
<H5>  Role and Function </H5>
  United in harmony and cooperation and in the spirit of 
excellence, KORECO has been commissioned to contribute to the 
development of national economy through waste reutilization and 
technological development. 
  Since its founding Sept. 11, 1980, KORECO has systematically 
collected and treated the main pollutants of the agricultural 
environment such as used vinyl and used agricultural chemical 
bottles, thus gradually becoming a leader in preserving the 
agricultural environment. 
  As the size of the national economy expands and the level of 
the industrial structure advances, however, there has been a 
dramatic increase in the volume of wastes. Moreover, an 
increase in the proportion of special wastes which have either a 
higher chance of second-phase pollution or other particular 
characteristics has not only called for the safe treatment and 
reduction of waste volume, but has reminded us of the importance 
of waste reutilization. 
  All of these have not only put an emphasis on the role of 
KORECO in collecting reusable goods, but have precipitated 
KORECO's assumption of a central role in a variety of waste 
reutilization programs such as operation of the waste management 
fund, creation of the Center for Waste Flow Information, 
research and development (R&amp;D) on all aspects of waste 
reutilization, and operation of reutilization plants. 
<H5>  Treatment of Used Vinyl </H5>
  The development of synthetic resins has dramatically changed 
human life. The extensive use of synthetic resins, however, has 
naturally increased the volume of used synthetic resins, whose 
treatment becomes an urgent task. 
  In particular, the development of farming technology has 
contributed to an increase in the use of vinyl in the 
countryside, such as in preparation of rice seedbeds or for cash 
crop cultivation. The resultant pollution of the agricultural 
environment is also one of the corporation's major concerns. 
  Used vinyl, when burned, generates toxic gas; when buried in 
the farmland, affects the growth of plants by interdicting the 
flow of water. If used vinyl is not properly treated, it 
creates an array of problems of reclamation, resources and 
environmental pollution. 
  In order to render the agricultural environment more 
affluent 
and cleaner, KORECO has maintained a coherent used vinyl 
management system from collection to reutilization, and has 
regularly visited villages in the countryside. 
<H5>  Used High-Density Vinyl Reutilization Plant </H5>
  For the first time in Korea and as a culmination of 
reutilization efforts, used vinyl reutilization plants have been 
set up in Chongju and Andong, with a combined annual capacity of 
over 10,000 tons. The vinyl is processed into an intermediate 
resource, pellets, which are supplied to private companies. 
  In the past, KORECO paid for the collection of used 
high-density vinyl in rural areas. Those collected vinyl, 
however, could not be reutilized and was stored in the KORECO's 
branch offices nationwide, due largely to its lack of economic 
value and the low level of technology of private reutilization 
companies. 
  Recognizing that the reutilization of used vinyl would be a 
vital task in maximizing the use of available resources and 
preserving the environment, KORECO conducted R&amp;D on the 
reutilization technology of advanced countries and set up 
Korea's first reutilization plant in Chongju, North Chungchong 
Province. 
<H5>  Collection and Treatment of Used Bottles </H5>
  Agricultural chemicals are often called "economic poison" in 
that depending upon whether they are used safely or not, they 
can do good or harm. In order for agricultural chemicals, an 
indispensable element in farming, to be most useful, attention 
must be paid to their usage. Equally important, however, is 
what to do about them after their use. 
  Shards of used bottles would not only do harm to the people 
or cattle, but are one of the main culprits contaminating the 
agricultural environment and destroying the ecosystem. 
  In parallel with its efforts to collect used vinyl, KORECO 
collected and recycled between 1987 and 1992 a total of about 
253 million bottles with a cash value of 3.2 billion won, and 
has contributed to the preservation of a cleaner agricultural 
environment. 
<H5>  Separate Garbage Collection and Treatment of Reusable </H5>
Resources 
  A variety of trends associated with rapid economic growth, 
including a more consumptive pattern, increasing use of 
disposables, and shorter lifespan of durable goods, have all 
contributed to an ever-rising amount of household wastes. 
  It should be remembered, however, that the earth has limits 
in its self-purification capacity, and so do the resources. It 
is these considerations under which the nationwide separate 
garbage disposal and collection system has been implemented so 
that the public can dispose and separate the reusable resources, 
other waste, and coal ash according to their respective 
end-forms. Separately disposed garbage can be more effectively 
collected and reused and can contribute to the saving of 
resources and the creation of a far better and more comfortable 
environment.

<F P=106> [Article by staff reporter Yi Song-yol] </F>
  [Text] No other government agency has recently gained more 
weight than the Ministry of Environment as Koreans are becoming 
more and more environment-conscious with the aggravating water 
and air pollution. 
  In a bid to enhance the ministry's authority to control tap 
water for example the ministry recently absorbed three sections 
from the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs and the 
Construction Ministry. 
  Now the Ministry of Environment is responsible for the 
maintenance of clean water from reservoirs to the tap of each 
household. 
  The measure has been taken as the government has come to see 
more than ever before the importance of supplying clean water 
after the nationwide shock over contamination of the Naktong 
River and several other important sources of drinking water. 
  But as purifying water for potable use is a very expensive 
business, the ministry has decided to transfer it to the private 
sector and industrial companies will gradually be directly 
responsible for treating their own waste. 
  It means that the government will allow state-run 
corporations or private companies to participate in the 
operation of water purification plants, ministry official say. 
  Sophisticated equipment will be installed at filtration 
plants at the lower streams of the Naktong and three other 
rivers to supply safer tap water, according to a ministry 
project. 
  As Environment Minister Pak Yun-hun has put it, the measure 
to allow state-run corporations and private firms to participate 
in running water purification plants is intended to permit more 
experts to manage water quality. 
  Presently, water filtration plants are under the control of 
the government. Most of the state-run water purification 
facilities are manned by about 15 government employees, of whom 
only two to three have the qualifications to be classified as 
professional technicians. 
  "It is of utmost importance that qualified manpower be 
assigned to deal with water treatment processes and the only way 
that this can be financed is by transferring the business to the 
private sector," Minister Pak says. 
  He hints, however, that this will likely increase the 
charges 
for tap water and that there's no other way to deal with the 
situation since the government is suffering from a huge deficit 
by carrying out the purification on its own. 
  The delegation of the business to private sector will only 
be 
effectuated on condition that the management structure is 
completely overhauled so that no additional monitoring will be 
required to ensure the highest rate of potability. 
  At the same time, the ministry is to map out plans to 
introduce environmental taxes, issue bonds and instant lottery 
tickets as a means of raising funds necessary to finance various 
environmental improvement projects. 
  On the issue of waste treatment, industrial facilities 
across 
the nation will be told to equip themselves to deal with their 
own waste instead of relying on government-run treatment plants. 
  At the same time, both individuals and enterprises failing 
to 
conform to regulation on the dissipation of garbage in public 
places will be subject to heavy fines on the spot, the ministry 
has decided. 
  But the ministry is to relax various regulations on the 
installation of related facilities, including incinerators, so 
that the industrial companies can cope with their waste and 
reduce pollution at the point of its generation. 
  On the private side, greater efforts will be made to 
encourage residents to actively participate in the separate 
waste disposal system for maximizing the rate of recycling. 
  The initiation of garbage collection and treatment charges 
in 
accordance with the amount generated, which started in April, 
plays a powerful role in enhancing the awareness of the public 
in the role that they must play in protecting the environment, 
ministry officials note. 
  Minister Pak has said his ministry will help government 
officials and civic groups to jointly monitor the quality of 
water. The ministry also plans to support campaigns sponsored 
by the environmental groups to protect clean water. 
  "Also of substantial importance will be the launching of 
joint surveillance groups among the government and civic 
organization to maintain close watch on the quality of water," 
Pak says. 
  He says his ministry plans to invest about 30 billion won 
this year to develop environmental technology, and will also 
work out steps for the Green Round of multilateral talks, which 
is expected to impose tougher environmental regulations on 
Korean businesses. 
  He says the government seeks to sign agreements with 
advanced 
countries such as the United States, Japan and France to launch 
joint research into environmental technology. 
  A ministry task force has visited the United States and 
other 
advanced countries in February to study recent trends in 
environmental protection in those countries. 
  The ministry will also provide training programs on 
environmental technology to officials from Asian countries like 
China and Thailand.

  [Text] Since 1987, the experts of Environmental Management 
Corporation (EMC) have used the latest technologies to 
administer and operate various treatment plants including plants 
for industrial wastewater, hazardous wastes, urban waste 
incineration, and metropolitan landfill sites. 
  EMC has designed and supervised the construction and 
operation of water treatment plants at various locations 
throughout the country, and has provided technical assistance 
and loan programs to small and medium enterprises for the 
building of their environmental facilities. 
  Lately, the corporation has started constructing various 
kinds of facilities on behalf of the government and local 
agencies, and has raised funds for research and development of 
environmental technologies. 
  EMC will continue to serve the public and private sectors 
with much better and more efficient antipollution programs. The 
corporation is also going to expand its capacities and services 
as an institution of professional skills and commitment. 
  In a bid to preserve the environment through the operation 
of 
modern facilities and high technologies, EMC has operated and 
constructed facilities entrusted by the government, local 
agencies or private sectors: wastewater treatment plants, 
landfill sites, hazardous waste treatment plants, night soil 
treatment and urban waste incineration plants, and industrial 
liquid waste treatment plants. 
  The corporation has financed the construction of 
antipollution facilities for small and medium companies. It has 
provided technical assistance in the design, construction and 
operation of various environmental facilities, and educated the 
public on environmental preservation. 
<H5>  History of EMC </H5>
  May 21, 1983: Legislation forming the Environmental 
Antipollution Corporation is instated 
  Dec. 31, 1986: Enforcement Regulations are passed 
  March 23, 1987: The initial body of the present EMC is 
formed 
  Nov. 28, 1987: The corporation is renamed Environmental 
Management corporation 
  Oct. 15, 1993: Headquarters of EMC is rearranged for 
innovative management, with nine departments including the 
Metropolitan Landfill Site, 11 plants and 14 regional offices 
  In general, the effluent of the industrial complex is highly 
contaminated. EMC's plants were constructed to collect all the 
waste discharged from the industries in the complex and to treat 
them all together thereby saving the treatment cost, reducing 
the pollution of nearby river. Seven plants are under operation 
at each of the corresponding industrial complexes. The above 
plants are to be enlarged and the new ones constructed to make 
the rivers clean. 
  Whasong plant treats 60 tons a day of industrial waste 
generated in the metropolitan area, thereby contributing to 
clean air, water, and earth. 
  The plant is equipped with incinerators which treat 
polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) and organic phosphorus, in 
addition to the physical chemical treatment facilities which 
treat acid and base wastes and a sanitary landfill site for 
their solidification, landfill of the waste sludge containing 
heavy metals. 
  Onsan plant treats about 100 tons of hazardous waste daily 
generated in the Youngnam region thus going far toward the 
preservation of the regional environment. It is prepared with 
an incinerator treating waste oil and organic sludge, a 
physical/chemical treatment facility treating concentrated 
hazardous liquid waste, a solidification unit, and a landfill 
site. 
  The waste carried into the plant is weighed on the weighing 
bridge, laboratory-tested for analyzing the concentration of the 
ingredients, and is conveyed to the treatment processes. 
  Various waste oil, organic sludge, PBC or phosphorous 
compounds are heat-dissolved in the rotary kiln first, and 
re-incinerated in the secondary incinerator at the temperature 
of 1,200 degrees C. The exhaust gas generated during the 
incineration is treated through the detoxication tower and the 
electrostatic precipitator. 
  Waste acid and base are neutralized, processed by 
coagulation 
and sent to the sedimentation basin for the settling. Liquid is 
ion-exchanged finally and the dehydrated sludge cake is sent to 
the landfill site after solidification. 
  The sludge bearing heavy metals mixed with cement and 
chemicals is solidified and cured in a molding box for several 
days and sent to the landfill site finally. 
  The landfill site is sealed with a membrane to protect the 
secondary contamination of the underground water by leachate. 
The collected leachate in the collection well is treated in the 
chemical/physical treatment facility. 
  In particular, the EMC has been pushing ahead with a 
long-term project related to the operation and maintenance of 
the sanitary landfill site for metropolitan areas from September 
1989 through December 2014. 
  Landfill works will last for 25 years from February 1992 
through December 2015. The reclaimed coastal zone is located at 
Komdan-myon County, Yangchon-myon County and Inchon City. 
  The landfill site will be covering a total area of 6.3 
million pyongs or about 22 million sq. meters. Its landfill 
capacity will amount to 278 million tons. With the main 
facilities of two disposal plants (3,500 tons a day each), the 
landfill site will cover 20 cities or countries in Kyonggi 
Province. 
  The bid project will bring in expected effects: an actual 
solution for the wastes generated in the metropolitan area, 
protection of the environment by sanitary landfill and 
development of advanced waste treatment system. 
  Another reclamation project is under way, though its 
construction period ended as of November 1991. Landfill period 
will last through December 1992. 
  With a total landfill capacity of 47 million tons, the huge 
project worth 87 billion won specifies the 11,312-meter road 
construction, 10,690-meter embankment, three bridges, a leachate 
treatment plant, leachate collection facility, waste ingredients 
test stand, office building, weighing facilities, car washes, a 
maintenance camp for the landfill equipment and landscaping. 
  On behalf of the small industrial complexes in the rural 
area, EMC is engaged in the design, construction supervision and 
operation of waste treatment plants. 
  In a move to minimize the contamination by those small 
complexes established for the balanced development between 
cities and the country and the increase of new income sources 
for farmers and fishers, the EMC has designed, supervised the 
construction of, or operated small plants for the treatment of 
waste water from the complexes.

  [Text] Port Moresby, May 17 (AFP) -- A Swiss firm, SGS, has 
been hired by the Papua New Guinea [PNG] Government to monitor 
timber exports out of the country in the face of what are seen 
as unscrupulous deals by Asian timber companies, officials said 
Tuesday. 
  It comes as pressure mounts for effective action against 
foreign companies, many said to be part of a huge Malaysian 
operation accused of plundering Papua New Guinea's rain forests 
for huge profits. 
  The 5.5-million-dollar contract is aimed at tightening 
scrutiny and inspection of logging and timber exports to 
maximise government revenue from log sales. 
  SGS will also guard against transfer-pricing and illegal 
sale 
of logs in a deal which Forestry Minister Tim Neville said would 
pull unscrupulous companies into line. 
  Neville said in an Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) 
television program Monday that he had been offered bribes of up 
to 20 million dollars and threats were made on his life because 
of his strong drive for reform of the timber industry. 
  He told the ABC the threats and offers of bribes were 
serious 
and those responsible faced criminal charges, but did not not 
name the companies responsible. 
  Following a visit to logging areas of the country with 
Neville, the program highlighted what it termed as the 
"wholesale devastation" of PNG's forests. 
  SGS, based in Geneva, has been engaged in the business of 
trade surveillance since 1878. 
  "We will be present at all loading ports to check the volume 
of timber loaded and do species identification," SGS general 
manager Len Cordiner said Tuesday. 
  "We will also be checking all the contract documents and 
setting up a computerised data base for keeping records on all 
of the concessions and timber going out from these concessions." 
  Cordiner said the principal objective was to obtain precise 
figures and facts on how much timber was being exported from 
Papua New Guinea so that the government had more effective 
control over the forest industry. 
  "At the moment there is a belief that a lot of logs are 
going 
out of the country without being declared," he said. 
  "There's also a belief that the revenue the government is 
collecting is well below what it should be. 
  "So the objective is to control the industry and to make 
sure 
that the loggers are doing the right thing; that the correct 
value is being declared; and that the government is getting the 
correct income.

  [Text] The National Economic and Development Authority 
(NEDA) revealed today that the safeguarding of the environment 
is now ensured with the approval by President Ramos of the 
Philippine Program for Biodiversity Management. 
  This program will prevent the depletion of the country's 
natural resources in the pursuit of industrialization as 
envisioned under Philippines 2000. 
  The approval of the program was made during the recent 
meeting of the Philippine Council for Sustainable Development 
(PCSD) with the president. 
  Officially called the Philippine Strategy for Biological 
Diversity Conservation (PSBDC), the program contains 18 broad 
objectives intended to address issues such as biodiversity 
policy, sustainable use, sustainable agriculture, recognition of 
ancestral domain, public education and awareness on 
biodiversity, and institutional capability-building. 
  The specific goals of the PSBDC include: developing and 
implementing a holistic and comprehensive national program for 
the conservation of biological diversity and the sustainable use 
of its components; ensuring that the relevant activities of the 
biodiversity program harmonize with those of other government 
and nongovernmental organizations (NGO's), private sector, 
religious groups, and local community; and institutionalizing 
the practice of biodiversity conservation through legislative, 
administrative, fiscal and other regulatory measures. 
  An important issue the program addresses is the need for a 
review of existing national and local policies on the 
management, use, and conservation of natural resources areas, 
wildlife and other biological resources. 
  The program thus aims to reform those policies that 
encourage 
the misuse of natural resources and ecologically unsound 
management of biodiversity and its components. 
  It also proposes that policies which give incentives to 
industries that practice sustainable development and 
environmentally sound activities be adopted. These would 
include reduction of resource consumption through waste 
minimization, recycling, and conservation. 
  Another objective of the PSBDC is the implementation of 
natural resources accounting method that promotes biodiversity 
conservation. Part of this objective is the development of 
satellite environmental accounts in the Philippine system of 
national accounts. 
  This could lead to the appropriate pricing of resource 
ecosystems. Today, resource ecosystems are being treated as 
"free" good and their degradation does not count as depreciation 
of the nation's basic capital stock in the calculation of Gross 
National Product (GNP). 
  Another critical objective of the program is the integration 
of biodiversity conservation into national and local development 
planning. 
  "If government agencies, both national and local, are 
willing 
to incorporate biological diversity conservation in the planning 
and management of the country, positive changes in the 
ecological, economic and social spheres of development will 
surely come about," the program states.

  [Text] Taipei, May 12 (CNA) -- Taiwan will attend the 
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) 
animals committee meeting scheduled for May 16-18 in Beijing, a 
spokesman for the local green consumers foundation said Thursday 
[12 May]. 
  Foundation Chairman Fang Chien said the Council of 
Agriculture [COA] agreed to attend the meeting after being 
notified by committee Chairman Hank Jenkins, through Fang, that 
he had reached an agreement with mainland Chinese authorities to 
allow Taipei's participation. 
  Beijing had previously said it would not allow Taiwan's 
participation at the meeting, ostensibly because it is not a 
CITES member. 
  Jenkins, a conservation official in the Australian 
Government, said it is important for Taiwan to be present at the 
meeting because issues pertaining to wildlife protection and 
conservation in Taiwan are on the agenda. 
  Both government agencies and private conservation groups in 
Taiwan are hoping to attend the meeting since it will detail the 
future direction of international wildlife management programs, 
Fang said. 
  He said it would have been "unjustifiable" for Taiwan to be 
barred from the meeting, considering CITES has threatened it 
with trade sanctions for its failure to sufficiently stem the 
trade in rhino horn and tiger parts. 
  The COA will be represented by Prof. Li Ling-ling from 
National Taiwan University and Prof. Wang Ing from National 
Normal University at the Beijing meeting. Fang said he would 
also be a member of the Taiwan delegation, along with Ted Ting, 
chairman of the Beautiful Taiwan Foundation, another local 
conservation group. 
  The biennial meeting is a warm-up for the 1994 CITES parties 
meeting, which is scheduled to open in Florida this November.

  [Text] Taiwan's importers of corn and soybeans, 
retaliating against the U.S. ban on import of wildlife products, 
threatened Friday [13 May] to take their business worth about $1 
billion a year away from the United States. The Taiwan Feed 
Industry Association and the Taiwan Vegetable Oil Manufacturers 
Association lodged protests with Washington's unofficial embassy 
in Taipei over the U.S. ban on wildlife product imports from 
Taiwan. 
  President Bill Clinton announced the ban, worth up to $25 
million a year, last month in response to the island's continued 
trade in products made from endangered tigers and rhinos. 
  A spokesman for the Taiwan Feed Industry Association said if 
there is no goodwill response from the United States, his 
association will give priority to South Africa, Thailand, 
Central American countries, and Australia when buying corn and 
soybeans. The two associations of Taiwan's many importers of 
corn and soybeans buy 5 million and 2 million tons a year. ROC 
[Republic of China] officials have denounced the U.S. move as 
unjust after Mainland China eluded sanctions.

  [Excerpt] The Thailand Business Council for Sustainable 
Development, comprising 50 leading company members, has 
initiated five projects aimed at protecting and saving the 
country's environment. 
  The council was established six months ago to address 
environmental issues and is chaired by former Prime Minister 
Anan Panyarachun. 
  The five projects are: pesticide-free agricultural villages, 
renovation of Khlong Lot, study of lignite and its impact on the 
environment, environmental conservation circle (ECC), and green 
labelling. 
  The council's objectives are: to provide reliable 
information and guidance to distinguish genuine 
environment-friendly products; to encourage the production of 
green products using clean technologies; to promote energy 
conservation and recycling; to promote the establishment of a 
third-party labeller who can offer an unbiased opinion to back 
up marketing claims, to establish more demanding standards for 
companies to make environmentally sound products; and to promote 
environmental awareness among manufacturers and consumers. 
  Chaiyot Bunyakitdi, director of the Thailand Environment 
Institute's business and environment programme, said the green 
labelling project will be significant in helping identify 
projects that have proven to be less destructive to the 
environment. To date, 19 member firms have agreed to 
participate in the labelling project. 
  Environment-friendly products have achieved international 
popularity among environment-conscious consumers. 
  Mr. Chaiyot said the council will vigorously promote this 
project and hopes to establish guidelines to assist firms in 
their marketing claims, often not entirely accurate, of products 
less damaging to the environment. 
  The Thailand Business Council for Sustainable Development 
(TBCSD) has proposed establishing a committee, to be chaired by 
Permanent Secretary for Industry Siwawong Changkhasiri, on green 
labelling guidelines and comprising representatives from the 
Federation of Thai Industries, Board of Trade, Thai Industrial 
Standards Institute, Office of Consumer Protection, 
Environmental Engineering Association of Thailand, Press 
Association, Public Relations Confederation of Thailand, 
Marketing Association of Thailand and no more than 25 
representatives from TBCSD. [passage omitted]

to cause an ecologic catastrophe by blowing up the chemical 
facilities in Tuzla (northern Bosnia), Belgrade POLITIKA said on 
Thursday. 
  The Tuzla chemical works are similar to that in the Indian 
town of Bopal which caused the death of 2,500 people and 
seriously injured 150,000. 
  Tuzla is held by the Muslims who have over the past few days 
been massing major forces in the south and southwest of this 
city, also confirmed by the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) 
spokesman in Sarajevo on Wednesday. 
  The Seventh Brigade of the Bosnian army, well-known for its 
fundamentalism and lightening-speed offensives, has been 
transferred to the Kladanj-Olovo region (south of Tuzla) in 
preparation of military actions in this region, REUTER said. 
  The threat of an `ecologic strike' from Tuzla could be a 
desperate measure since poisons cannot tell the difference 
between one's own army and civilians and those of the enemy, the 
Belgrade paper said. 
  Another possibility is that NATO would fulfill Muslim 
expectations and help them if they are unsuccessful, as in the 
case of Gorazde. 
  The Muslims could blow up several tanks containing poison 
substances and, in keeping with the already proven scenario and 
with the support of the Western media, blame the Serbs and then 
ask for NATO's help, POLITIKA said. 
  The threats by the Tuzla Muslims would cause the death of 
thousands of people and seriously hurt over hundreds of 
thousands. 
  Before the outbreak of the civil war in Bosnia, Tuzla was a 
major center of the chemical industry which had stores amounting 
to about 1,300 tonnes of chlorine, 1,100 tonnes of ammonium, 60 
tonnes of sulfuric acid and 3 tonnes of phosgene. 
  The release of chlorine into the atmosphere would threaten 
life in an area ranging from 1.5 km - 76 km, while the ammonium 
would affect an area from 1 km - 28 km depending on the weather, 
POLITIKA learned from Dusan Rajic, a contamination expert of the 
Yugoslav army's techinical institute in Belgrade. 
  The use of phosgene would affect only the centre of the city 
or the cite from where it was released. Those who are 
threatening to cause an ecologic catastrophe could use this 
element since, by sacrificing their own people, they would 
achieve their aims--to force international military aid, Rajic 
said. 
  The Muslims have already applied this scenario of 
sacrificing 
their own people to turn the international public against the 
Serbs. Last year they caused the massacre in the Vase Miskina 
Street in Sarajevo, while this year they caused the death of 
innocent civilians at Sarajevo's Markale Market in the same way. 
  Both times the aim was achieved--the international community 
reacted with lightning speed and blamed the Serbs. Subsequent 
reports by UNPROFOR representatives about who was really to 
blame, had no effect.

  [Text] Sofia, May 12 (BTA) -- The radiation impact of the 
nuclear power plant at Kozloduy (on the Danube) is weaker than 
the natural background radiation, a joint news conference of 
representatives of the power engineering industry and the 
Ministry of the Environment was told today. 
  The state of environment in Bulgaria is alarming. Last year 
nearly 900,000 tonnes of sulfur dioxide were thrown up in the 
air. The major source of sulfur dioxide pollution is the 
Bulgarian brown coal, especially the coal mined in the 
Maritsa-Iztok area. However, the power stations using brown 
coal as fuel account for 31.62 percent of the electricity output 
in this country, the news conference was told. 
  According to power producers, bringing power engineering 
into 
line with the Bulgarian environment legislation will cost a lot 
of money--every Bulgaria will have to pay 1,500 leva a year 
until 2010. 
  According to experts of the Ministry of the Environment, the 
power engineering industry is hardly the sole air polluter. 
Exhaust emissions pollute the air in the big cities with carbon 
dioxide. Measurements show that exhaust emissions account for 70 
percent of the air pollution in Sofia.

<F P=106> [Article by Piotr Zajdel: "The Ecological Zero Option"] </F>
  [Excerpts] The Army of the Russian Federation left Poland 
with a great deal of ecological damage and "souvenirs." The most 
dangerous of these are the pollution of the soil and the water 
table by chemical waste and petroleum lines. The estimated cost 
of the damage is approximately 52 billion zlotys [Z]. 
  Already in the 1980's, the Polish Ecological Services tried 
sporadically to control pollution from some of the Soviet 
military bases. Most of these efforts failed because "outsiders" 
were not permitted to enter Soviet bases. Not until May 1992 did 
the situation change, after the signing of a Polish-Soviet 
agreement on the removal of Soviet forces from Poland. Joint 
inspections of both Polish and Russian bases began. The result 
of all of this was ecological standards that were incorporated 
into the agreements for transferring the former Soviet military 
bases to the Poles. "We have documented the magnitude of all the 
damage caused, and we have calculated the costs," stated Andrzej 
Walewski, the Main Inspector for Environmental Protection. 
  "The Russians left without paying for the ecological damage 
they committed, so, in turn, we are not going to pay them for 
any of the equipment they left behind," stated Walewski. 
According to him, Poland won the battle with a political 
success, while the Czechs and Hungarians incurred many costs 
during the Soviet pullout. "The fact that our country had 
documentation on the ecological damage played a great 
psychological role," stated Walewski. 
  Of 59 sites that were occupied by the Soviets, 35 had the 
potential to be ecological hazards. The National Inspector for 
Environmental Protection chose 21 sites believed to be the most 
contaminated. The inspections included all of the air bases, 
large fuel depots, ammunition dumps, and firing ranges. 
  Tests were conducted on underground water to see if there 
was 
chemical contamination. "Water was inspected both above and 
below ground. Also, the damage done in forests and on roads and 
contamination from chemical and nuclear weapons were examined," 
stated Walewski. These tests were conducted on the grounds of 
the bases and around them. Hydrological tests are being 
conducted on a wide scale by using bore-hole methods. 
Physiochemical tests of the water and water table are being done 
in specialized laboratories. The tests are conducted at 
government expense, and, to complete them, it is estimated that 
the cost will be approximately Z14 million. 
  The tests are being funded by Polish zlotys exclusively and 
under the direction of the Ministry of Environmental Protection. 
The Military Technical Academy will also participate in the 
tests in tandem with other research groups. 
  The damage may be assessed at Z52.2 billion. "This is a 
rather abstract sum, a sum we would have to pay in order to 
fully recultivate the land," stated Walewski. [passage omitted] 
The majority of the funds will come from the national budget. 
The Environmental Protection group has developed a special 
ranking in terms of money and in terms of which area will be 
"cleaned" first. The cleaning will take place first in the most 
contaminated areas. These areas are: Kluczewo, in the Szczecin 
voivodship; Brzeg, in the Opole voivodship; and Swinouscie and 
Borne Sulinowo in the Koszalin voivodship. Let us not forget 
that the Soviet forces were stationed on Polish soil from World 
War II until 17 September 1993, over an area of 70,000 hectares 
and 59 bases. Their stay was legitimized by an agreement between 
the People's Republic of Poland and the Soviet Union.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 12/5/1994 -- Starting today 
under the aegis of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of 
Europe is the International Seminar on the Protection and 
Management of Fresh Water Sources in Eastern and Central Europe. 
  The opening session, presided by Francesco Parisi, chairman 
of the Committee for Environment, Regional Planning and Local 
Authorities of the Council of Europe, approached the general 
issues of the role the Danube basin can play in Europe, the 
global management of water in environmental policies. Held 
under the sign of European integration, the proceedings of the 
seminar, Mr. Parisi said, "are part of the building of a great 
edifice, because the nation we all belong to is the European 
nation." 
  In the address made on the occasion, Romanian President Ion 
Iliescu gave a brief description of Romania's experience in 
water management, of this country's water resources and its 
hydrographic map, of the need to use water economically, of the 
management and protection of water resources. 
  Adrian Nastase, speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, welcomed 
the participants in the Bucharest seminar on behalf of the 
Romanian Parliament, reasserting Romania's wish to align to 
European standards as the major objective of the Romanian 
foreign policy. 
  The opening speeches were followed by debates on the first 
theme: the actions taken by the Council of Europe in the 
direction of fresh water resources management and protection, 
with a report by Victor Ruffy, vice-president of the Committee 
for Environment, Regional Planing and Local Authorities of the 
Council's Parliamentary Assembly.

  [Text] (DYN) -- A British company -- under the guise of 
carrying out important ecological work -- is planning to plunder 
some 50,000 hectares of quebracho woods in the province of 
Santiago del Estero without the permission of the Argentine 
state, according to a report from a local environmental group. 
  A complaint was lodged yesterday [14 May] by the Cordoba 
FUNAM ecological group (Foundation for the Protection of the 
Environment) in conjunction with a fellow British group which 
said the woods, in the region of Moreno in the northeast of 
Santiago del Estero, would be in grave danger if no action was 
taken by the government to shelve the plans. 
  The British company, currently assessing the cost of the 
project, hopes to market the quebracho with the brandname "AAA 
Hardwood." The work would be carried out in conjunction with the 
local Australian Argentine Agricultural (AAA) group. 
  "The project will be promoted by an ecological lobby as if 
it 
had come from a forest which had been exploited rationally," 
FUNAM President Raul Montenegro said. "In other words they will 
try to fabricate a green image." 
  The British company's plans, leaked to FUNAM last month, 
estimate that once work gets under way in Santiago del Estero 
the company will be in a position to produce some 3.6 million 
metres of parquet, 13,901 tons of charcoal and 30,000 tons of 
other fuel. 
  A probe into the affair has also discovered that a leading 
bank in the Federal Capital has offered to put up capital in 
order to fund the project. 
  Santiago del Estero forestry commission representatives have 
said they will fight the plans although they have not yet 
received precise details of the British company's intentions. 
  Meanwhile the national government has made no comments on 
the 
case. 
  The forests under threat are considered the most important 
of 
their type in Argentina.

<F P=106> [Article by Ronaldo Brasiliense] </F>
  [Excerpts] The Environment and Legal Amazon Region Ministry 
is threatening to dismantle six national parks, three biological 
reserves, seven national forests, two environmentally protected 
areas, and four rational exploitation reserves. As these units 
have not been legally registered within the period contemplated 
in the laws, their status will become void. This is an 
unprecedented retrograde step in the Brazilian environmental 
policy. Two of the threatened units are in Rio de Janeiro: the 
Tingua biological reserve, which was created on 23 May 1989; and 
the Mario Xavier national forest, which was created in October 
1989. 
  In accordance with Article 10 of Decree 3365 dated 21 June 
1941, the legal registration of these units, which were created 
by the federal government, "must be made effective through 
agreements or obtained judicially within five years of the date 
on which the decree is published. At the end of this period, 
the terms of the decree become void." When this happens the 
unit can only be the object of a new decree after one year. 
  The Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable 
Natural Resources (Ibama)--which is responsible for the 
administration, preservation, and maintenance of the 
preservation units--allegedly has no funds to finance the legal 
registration of these units that were created at the end of Jose 
Sarney's administration and the beginning of Fernando Collor 
administration. Several areas were created as an ecological 
marketing strategy a few days before the UN Conference on 
Environment and Development (Rio-92) in an attempt to show the 
world that Brazil--which had been harshly criticized 
internationally for deforestation and clearing land by fire in 
the Amazon Region--was concerned about environmental 
preservation. 
  Research by Ibama experts before Rio-92 showed that the 
government would have to invest $1.2 billion to legally register 
the land on which Brazilian national parks, biological reserves, 
ecological stations, national forests, environmentally protected 
areas, and rational exploitation reserves are situated. 
  The first warning of the threat that has been affecting 
these 
units was made by Atanagildo Matos, aka Gatao, who is the 
president of the National Council of Rubber Tappers. Gatao is 
the successor to ecologist Chico Mendes. He reported that five 
rational exploitation reserves created during the Collor 
administration are threatened with being dismantled because of 
Ibama's negligence in legally registering the expropriated areas. 
  On 10 May, Atanagildo Matos and Federal Deputy Sidney de 
Miguel (Green Party-Rio de Janeiro) met Environment Minister 
Henrique Cavalcanti and called for urgent measures to prevent 
Brazil from losing these units which are important for the 
preservation of the national flora and fauna. Their loss would 
be a tremendous blow for the Brazilian environmental policy. 
[passage omitted] 
  The National Center for Sustained Development of Traditional 
Peoples succeeded in legally registering 2.1 million hectares of 
the Alto Jurua and Chico Mendes rational exploitation reserves 
in Acre State; the Cajari River reserve in Amapa State; and the 
Ouro Preto reserve in Rondonia State. The Chico Mendes rational 
exploitation reserve in Xapuri and Brasileia counties, with 
970,000 hectares, shelters 7,500 people and was demarcated with 
the assistance of the Army Cartographic Service. The land of 
the Cajari River reserve, with 481,000 hectares and 5,000 
inhabitants, still has not been totally registered because the 
Jari Project is questioning its legality in the courts. 
  The nine rational exploitation reserves created by the 
Brazilian Government cover an overall area of 2.2 million 
hectares and have 28,460 inhabitants who live basically on 
rubber gathering, Brazil-nut harvest, and babassu exploitation.

  [Text] Santiago, 17 May (EFE) -- Chilean Foreign Minister 
Carlos Figueroa noted today that Chile agrees with the 
establishment of a sanctuary for the protection of whales in the 
southern hemisphere, but located south of latitude 60 degrees, 
at the so-called Antarctic convergence. 
  Minister Figueroa explained that the Chilean stance is 
slightly different from the French position, which establishes a 
whale sanctuary from 40 degrees latitude south to Antarctica, 
including Chilean waters from the city of Valdivia, 835 km south 
of Santiago, to Cape Horn, at 56 degrees latitude south. 
  The foreign minister emphasized that Chile wants to explain 
at the next International Whale Commission (IWC) meeting, 
scheduled in Puerto Vallarta (Mexico) from 23 to 27 May, a 
"consistent" position with respect to the four sea treaties or 
conventions that it has signed. 
  Chile has signed conventions on the sea, on the sea bed, and 
on high seas fishing, as well as a treaty on territorial seas. 
  The foreign minister noted that Chile has banned whale 
hunting within its 200-mile territorial waters. He therefore 
indicated that our country "has already initiated unilateral 
protection of this resource." 
  The foreign minister confirmed that Chile is willing to sign 
a broad multilateral agreement to protect whale species. He 
noted that there are fairly advanced studies on the situation of 
the ecosystem at the abovementioned Antarctic convergence. 
  Representatives of the "Greenpeace" ecological organization 
in Chile delivered on 11 May to the president of the Republic, 
Eduardo Frei, a petition with more than 300,000 signatures 
supporting the establishment of a sanctuary for the last whale 
populations in the South Pacific. 
  According to data supplied by this ecological organization, 
more than 1 million whales have been hunted down over the past 
80 years, and the "blue whale," the largest whale species on our 
planet at 32 meters long and 100 metric tons in weight, has been 
particularly affected.

  [Excerpt] Democratic Constituent Congress [CCD] President 
Jaime Yoshiyama yesterday announced the establishment of the 
National Environment Authority [Autoridad Ambiental Nacional] 
which will guide and coordinate environment policies. 
  Yoshiyama also asked developed countries to swap part of the 
foreign debt for environment protection and measures against 
poverty. 
  Yoshiyama said: "A direct relationship exists between 
poverty, environmental damage, and sustainable development which 
must be considered in any international relations that are based 
on solidarity and shared responsibility." 
  Yoshiyama also asked developed countries to pardon part of 
the poor countries' foreign debt so as to restore economic 
well-being and assist development compatible with sustainability. 
  Yoshiyama made these remarks during a "Sustainable 
Development and Economic Growth in Ibero-America" 
entrepreneurial meeting. This meeting was part of the 22d AICO 
[Ibero-American Association of Chambers of Commerce] executive 
board meeting between 2 and 4 May. 
  Yoshiyama, who delivered the main lecture, admitted that 
human rights, the removal of poverty, tariff agreements, the 
protection of intellectual property, and the protection of the 
environment are among the most important and universally 
relevant issues. 
  The ruling party congressman emphasized the significance of 
a 
common strategy among the regional countries to cope with the 
problem of universal environment protection. 
  Yoshiyama also asked for a change in attitudes and 
practices, 
specially by developed countries, and the transfer of the 
technology needed by developing countries to protect their 
environments. 
  He said he wants costs and benefits of sustainable 
development to be equally shared at the international level. 
  Yoshiyama wants large-scale education policies to make 
people 
aware of the importance of the environmental issue. 
  He announced that a National Environment Authority would be 
established within the next few weeks. This National 
Environment Authority will guide and coordinate environmental 
policies. Marc Dourojeanni--the Inter-American Development Bank 
environment division chief--hailed this announcement and offered 
a donation of $2 million toward this National Environment 
Authority. 
  Yoshiyama explained that the new Constitution includes, 
among 
the human rights, the right to a balanced environment that 
favors the development of life. He added that the CCD is 
working on this. 
  To the surprise and approval of the large number of 
participants at the AICO meeting, Yoshiyama said: "I want to 
announce that within the next few weeks the Peruvian Congress 
will vote on a bill on the establishment of a National 
Environment Authority." 
  Yoshiyama emphasized: "In response to the concern of public 
and private organizations, the National Environment Authority 
will guide and coordinate environment policies and control the 
sustainable use of our natural resources. It will also guide 
actions in this area." [passage omitted]

  [Text] The historic Farakka Day is being observed today. 
Eighteen years ago on May 16, 1976 the late leader of the 
suffering people, Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhasani, brought out 
a huge procession comprising several hundred thousand people to 
demand an equitable share of the Ganges River water. People 
from all walks of life in Bangladesh from Teknaf [southernmost 
tip of the country] to Tetulia [northernmost tip of the country] 
joined this long march, which was led by Maulana Bhasani. This 
long march started at 1000 from Dhaka on May 16. The 
processionists travelled (?456) miles and made an overnight halt 
at Chapainawabganj [District]. On the morning of May 17 when 
this procession marched toward the border at that time the whole 
path was converted into a huge sea of agitated people. The 
procession stopped at a spot [name indistinct] about three miles 
inside the border at 1600. On that day, the people of South Asia 
and the whole world witnessed through this massive procession 
the demand raised by the people of Bangladesh for a fair share 
of the waters of the Ganges River. The world was amazed to see 
this huge procession by the people of this country to realize 
their legitimate share of the water of an international river. 
The world had extended its support to this cause of the people 
of Bangladesh long before this procession took place. 
  The adverse effect created in Bangladesh due to the 
construction of the Farakka Barrage on the Ganges River is now 
discernible. The situation has further deteriorated. Vast 
tracts of land in Bangladesh are becoming deserts due to this 
withdrawal of the Ganges water at Farakka. The part of the 
Ganges River that flows into Bangladesh is known as the Padma. 
This Padma was once a mighty river, and the people living along 
its banks led a very affluent and prosperous life. The part of 
Bangladesh through which this river flows was once lush, green, 
and full of crops. At present, these coastal areas have been 
turned into deserts. The vast bed of the Padma River has now 
turned into a desert and has become sandy. Many parts of the 
Padma River have also become grazing ground for cattle. The 
river has become totally unnavigable in several areas. The level 
of underground water in the areas adjoining the Padma River has 
fallen tremendously due to the shortage of water in the river. 
This has led to the destruction of agricultural lands and 
trees. Scarcity of water in the river has also severely 
affected navigation and shipping transport. This has directly 
affected the life of about 30 million people living on the banks 
of the Padma River and has posed a threat to their livelihood. 
  This situation has created a negative impact on the economy 
of a least developed country like Bangladesh. Bangladesh wants 
to be relieved from this unbearable situation and demands its 
legitimate share of the water of the Ganges, which is an 
international river. Bangladesh is making efforts at the 
bilateral level for a peaceful settlement of the water sharing 
issue. In this regard, several meetings were held in India and 
Bangladesh at different levels. It is unfortunate that no remedy 
has been found yet for this problem. [Words indistinct] This 
Ganges River problem is a life and death problem for about 30 
million people in Bangladesh. 
  Since the present democratic government came to power, it 
has 
been holding direct talks with the Indian Government at 
different levels with a view to resolving this Ganges water 
sharing problem. So far the talks have not yielded any positive 
results. On the other hand, the talks have become long and 
drawn out. During her visit to India, Prime Minister Khaleda 
Zia held talks with the Indian prime minister, Narasimha Rao, on 
the issue of resolving this Ganges water problem. India gave 
its assurance that it would take active measures to resolve this 
problem. After this, several rounds of talks were held between 
the officials of the two countries for working out a solution to 
the problem, but no progress has been made. Bangladesh has 
raised this issue regarding the sharing of the Ganges River 
water at the Commonwealth summit, the Nonaligned Movement, and 
in various international forums. It has also held talks with 
different countries of the world seeking their active 
cooperation in securing an equitable share of the Ganges River 
water. The world has extended its support to the demand raised 
by Bangladesh for an equitable share of the Ganges River water. 
Diplomatic efforts have also been made for a peaceful solution 
of the Ganges River water problem but no progress has been made 
in this regard. 
  Today is 16 May. It commemorates the historic Farakka Day. 
On this day, the people of Bangladesh demand an early solution 
to the water sharing problem -- which is their life and death 
question. This demand was also raised at the discussion 
meetings, seminars, symposia, and rallies held today in 
observance of the day. The Ganges water sharing issue is solely 
a humanitarian problem. It is not a political problem. It 
would be inhuman to consider this problem as a political issue. 
We hope that in the interest of good neighborly relations, 
India will take effective measures for an early solution to this 
problem.

  [Text] Aligarh, March 29--Despite repeated warnings by 
global environmental agencies, developing countries, including 
India, have failed to adequately respond to the challenges posed 
by the growing threat of pesticide pollution. Almost 50 per cent 
of food in developing countries is contaminated with pesticides, 
according to a recent report. 
  Scientists say that the study of pesticide behaviour is of 
critical importance particularly for developing countries which 
also face food shortages. Presently 135 pesticides are 
registered by the Indian Pesticide Registration Committee. A 
majority of these pesticides have been found to be unsafe by the 
United States of America Environmental Agency. 
  According to a recent report by the World Health 
Organisation 
(WHO), every year at least five lakh people suffer from 
pesticide poisoning all over the world and of these an estimated 
5,000 die. Monitoring of pesticide contamination is therefore 
absolutely necessary, it adds. 
  At a recent seminar of "soil pollution" in Madras, sponsored 
by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, 
scientists have suggested that Indian farmers should be 
immediately provided with "Soil Health Cards." The soil health 
cards will help government agencies in analysing the pesticide 
content in soils of different regions of the country. 
  The proposal has been accepted by the Tamil Nadu government. 
Professor M.S. Swaminathan, an eminent scientist and chairman of 
the national organising committee of the seminar, appealed to 
other states to follow suit. 
  In his paper "Pesticides and Their Impact on Groundwater," 
Dr 
R.P. Singh, a soil scientist at the Aligarh Muslim University, 
has contended that at least three banned pesticides which were 
considered hazardous in some western countries, do not pose the 
same danger in some regions in India because of certain 
characteristics of the soil and different climatic conditions. 
According to him, if the soil characteristics of a particular 
area is studied, then the selection of a proper and safe 
pesticide becomes a distinct possibility. 
  Dr Singh points out that pesticides such as Carbofuran 
oxmyal 
and Phosphasmidon do not pollute groundwater when they are used 
in clay loam and silt loam soils in India, provided the annual 
rainfall is not high. These pesticides have a high absorption 
affinity towards such soils and hence their movements restricted. 
  According to a United States environmental agency report: 
"If 
the partition coefficient value of a pesticide is more than five 
and the organic matter's partition coefficient value is more 
than 300, then the pesticide is not harmful." 
  Similar views have been expressed by Dr N. Sethunathan of 
the 
Central Rice Research Institute of Cuttack. He said: "The study 
of leaching rates of pesticides using soil physico-chemical 
properties will be of immediate help in controlling pesticide 
pollution in flooded soils."

  [Text] Baghdad, 16 May (INA) -- Baghdad Mayor Tahir 
Muhammad Hassun has stated that the assistance offered by 
specialised health, environment, and human rights organizations 
and agencies has not improved the environment situation in 
Baghdad and has not remedied the increasing shortage suffered by 
the Baghdad municipality services. 
  At a news conference attended by local, Arab, and foreign 
correspondents as well as the INA correspondent, the Baghdad 
mayor said that these organizations have provided the Baghdad 
municipality departments with only 5 percent of what they direly 
needed in the various services sectors. 
  The Baghdad mayor reviewed the direct impact the continued 
imposition of the unjust embargo has had on Iraq and on Baghdad 
in particular, especially the suspension of work in many Baghdad 
city development projects, the piling of garbage in various 
quarters of the city in view of the shortages experienced by the 
municipality in the human and mechanical field since the 
specialized machinery has come down from 800 to 300, with most 
of these out of order. 
  He explained that 500 to 700 tonnes of garbage are daily 
left 
on the streets. This means more than 20,000 tonnes a month. He 
said that the shortage experienced by the various municipality 
services is increasing and that the continued piling of garbage 
on the streets will lead to the spread of many infectious 
diseases 
  Tahir Muhammad Hassun warned against the impending danger 
that threatens the individual and the environment in Baghdad as 
a result of the spread of diseases stemming from pollution, and 
the overflowing of the sewerage system and how this will cause 
the death of thousands of citizens. 
  The news conference was attended by the deputy mayor and the 
municipality dpartments' directors.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Shmelev: "Kremlev Phantoms"] </F>
  [Text] In the mid-1960's all radio stations often 
used to air the song "Blue Cities." Do you remember the words? 
"Sometimes people dream of blue cities with no names..." 
  This was some prankster's big joke at our censorship, the 
most powerful in the world. He hailed cities that never existed 
on any map. But these phantom cities did have names, and their 
names were quite poetic: Sarov, Ozersk, Verkh-Neyvinsk, 
Saraklych, Zolotaya Sablya [Golden Saber]... On secret charts, 
however, their names sounded more boring: Arzamas-16, 
Chelyabinsk-65, Zlatoust-26... There also were ZATO's ("Closed 
Administrative/Territorial Units"). 
  Seven cities were formed by the 17 March 1954 edict in 
locations which contained establishments of the Ministry of 
Medium Machine-Building nuclear weaponry complex. Forty years 
ago. (Besides the three cities mentioned above, there were 
Krasnoyarsk-26, Sverdlovsk-44, Tomsk-7, Sverdlovsk-45.) Three 
more were added a little later: Chelyabinsk-70, Krasnoyarsk-46, 
and Penza-16. 
  For the entire 40 years the numbered cities existed under 
conditions of total secrecy. They were absent from post office 
directories and statistical reference books; they were also 
excluded every time there was an official census or when voters' 
lists were compiled. 
  Every road that led into such a place was blocked by barbed 
wire strung along its perimeter and had a military checkpoint at 
the point of entry. Further on, there was the territory of a 
military unit with another checkpoint at the exit. Only after 
these two filters could one get to a "Zero city." This "close" 
atmosphere contributed to a specific "zero" mentality. On the 
one hand, for instance, these phantom cities had a high level of 
technical education because the defense used to draw the best 
graduates from the best schools. On the other hand, there was 
also a hysterical spy mania and a caste disassociation from the 
"uninitiated." 
  On the one hand, there is patriotism deserving nothing but 
respect and an obsession with work (many "zero" residents do not 
know what vacations are and have not gone beyond the barbed wire 
for years). They also have strict morals typical of restricted 
communities and monasteries. On the other hand, there is a 
humanities gap borne by being so remote from any source of 
culture and by the restricted character of these science-towns, 
closed to artists' tours, congresses, festivals, student 
Olympics, etc. There are also GULAG traditions inherited from 
the prisoners who built the cities. All this results in 
flourishing provincial conservatism. "Zeroites" cannot stand the 
press media. To this day they are overly careful as they mumble 
"site," "item," "experiment," "building N" instead of "reactor," 
"bomb," explosion," "storage vault..." Meanwhile, their faces 
acquire an expression as if they need to go to the bathroom on 
serious business. 
  Zero cities have their own specific features: the totally 
geometric layout of their streets, groups of marching soldiers, 
plenty of sports grounds and arenas. 
  Another distinctive feature of the science-towns is their 
ecological unpredictability. Neither the unique underground, 250 
meters deep, atomic station of the Krasnoyarsk mining and 
chemical combine, nor the Chelyabinsk complexes which process 
the exposed fuel and produce weapons-grade plutonium, nor the 
cyclotrons of Dubna, Protvin, and Arzamas have undergone 
independent ecological analysis for decades. But who used to 
control the radiation environment? It was the services of the 
same classified complex that created this radiation danger in 
the first place. In other words, I drink, and then I take myself 
to the sobering-up station too... 
  One can imagine the results of all this. Especially 
considering that even in the open city of Moscow, which is as 
stuffed with secret sites as a Christmas turkey with apples, 
radiation ecologists are wandering under solid fences trying to 
use the wind rose, at least, to figure out the parameters of 
radioisotopes and other toxic pollutants emitted into the 
atmosphere. Moreover, radioactive sources and waste are being 
found in neighboring kindergartens and private apartments. One 
can imagine what is happening behind those fences. 
  A new dawn is finally breaking over the phantom cities. The 
Russian Federation Government issued an edict on 4 January 1994 
which officially assigns the following geographic names to them: 
Zheleznogorsk (Krasnoyarsk-26), Kremlev (Arzamas-16), Zarechnyy 
(Penza-19), Novouralsk (Sverdlovsk-44), Zelenogorsk 
(Krasnoyarsk-45), Lesnoy (Sverdlovsk-45), Seversk (Tomsk-7), 
Ozersk (Chelyabinsk-65), Snezhinsk (Chelyabinsk-70), Trekhgornyy 
(Zlatoust-26). Some of the information on these cities has been 
declassified. 
  We learned that, by 1 January 1993, the population of the 
big 
10 among Zero cities numbered 723,000 people instead of the 123 
million claimed by OGONEK a couple of years ago. According to 
data provided by the Main Administration for Social Policy of 
the Minatom [Ministry of Atomic Energy], they enjoy the services 
of 385 kindergartens and nurseries, 149 schools, nine higher 
education establishments, nine vocational technical schools, 21 
movie theaters, four puppet and four music and drama theaters, 
10 music schools, 23 libraries, seven museums, 105 gyms, 18 
stadiums, 10 swimming pools, 24 young pioneers' camps, etc. 
Unemployment is still rather low there--only 7,518 were 
unemployed as of December of last year. 
  These data, however, do not cover other numbered locations 
(Shkotovo-22, Krasnoyarsk-39, Zagorsk-7, Severodvinsk, 
Golitsyno-2). Neither do they disclose the number of reactors, 
nuclear fuel storage vaults, stored total energy, radioactive 
waste dumps, the technology for its conditioning, methods of 
radiation monitoring, the number of times the Minatom dinosaurs 
were visited by ecological commissions of international 
Greenpeace, of the Doctors of the World for the Prevention of 
Nuclear War committee, of the Toward a New Earth movement, and 
other nonagency experts. 
  However, it is not everybody that wants to make the 
information on Zero cities public. A representative poll of 
Chelyabinsk-Ozersk residents conducted by the city 
administration sociological group at the beginning of this year 
showed that the absolute majority of the people (82 percent) 
spoke unequivocally against "opening" their city...

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Neskoromnyy, Greenpeace of Russia: "The </F>
Kostromskaya AES Has Not Been Built but It Is Very Dangerous"; 
followed by unidentified ADS report: "The Future of the 
Dalnevostochnaya AES Will Be Decided by the People"] 
  [Text] In December 1992 it was decided to resume 
construction of the Kostromskaya nuclear power station (KAES) 
which was originally started in 1988 in the village of Chistye 
Bory, Buyskiy Rayon. Currently construction has reached a zero 
cycle, though the Russian Law on Environmental Protection 
forbids "to locate, design, or construct nuclear power stations 
near major bodies of water of republic importance." The station 
is being built on a tectonic fault which has a high-level strata 
of ground water, and the soil is geologically unstable, 
resulting in washing away, sinkholes, and landslides. The KAES 
pond is to be located on the bank of the Kostroma river, which 
flows into the Volga. If radioactive waste seeps into the water, 
the whole Volga area will be contaminated. 
  Not a single Russian reactor, including the KAES, passed 
through state ecological experts; not a single one of them was 
mass produced--each one was built as an experimental one because 
neither technology was able to prove itself. No insurance 
company in the world would take on the responsibility of 
insuring Russian nuclear power stations. 
  In early 1993 the ecological movement "In the Name of Life" 
attempted, for the first time, to conduct a referendum against 
the construction of the KAES. Fifty thousand signatures were 
collected in support of it from oblast residents. The idea of 
the referendum was also supported by the Kostroma city council. 
  Similar referenda were conducted in Mordvinia and Nizhny 
Novgorod Oblast. In Nizhny Novgorod it was decided to reorient 
the construction to a different production line, in spite of the 
fact that the reactor shop had already been completed. Mordvinia 
decided not to build any stations at all. 
  The construction of the majority of new nuclear power 
stations [AES's] in the Soviet Union was allowed by government 
decrees of the 1970's. At that time no evaluation as to whether 
it was economically feasible to construct such stations in their 
intended locations was carried out. Chernobyl put a stop to all 
construction. In 1991 the Russian Law on environmental 
protection set forth a new decisionmaking procedure allowing 
construction to begin and the criteria for choosing future 
station locations. 
  Certain conditions are necessary for the construction and 
operation of any nuclear station: adherence to the existing 
legislation and sanitary norms in the design and construction as 
well as a mandatory ecological analysis. The construction of 
many Russian AES's was resumed after the 1992 decree of the 
Russian Government. It describes the construction of the KAES 
quite clearly: Accept the ministries' proposals "on completing 
the work on engineering lines for the social infrastructure on 
the KAES site in 1993." In October 1993 state ecological experts 
rejected the draft "Comprehensive Program for the Development of 
Russian Federation Nuclear Power Facilities Through 2010." The 
construction of nuclear stations is continuing, however. 
  Some construction it is, too! The housing of the second 
reactor of the Balakovskaya AES was dropped during its 
installation, but only a superficial examination was done after 
the incident. When laying the foundation, pads of local 
limestone were used instead of marble ones, and ground water 
started to react with them and erode them. The units are 
settling unevenly and faster than expected by design, which 
creates stresses in the structure. 
  Thirty years ago the idea was to replace crude oil and coal 
with inexhaustible, cheap, and harmless nuclear energy. But the 
idea proved to be unsound, from both the ecological and economic 
points of view. Previously the cost of nuclear power failed to 
include the cost of procuring and transporting raw materials, 
and the expenses caused by accidents. The cost of burying a 
used-up unit is approximately the same as that of its 
construction. Nuclear energy is being nudged out of the 
energy-producing market. 
<H5>  The Future of the Dalnevostochnaya AES Will Be Decided by </H5>
the People 
  The feasibility report on the Dalnevostochnaya [Far East] 
nuclear power station which was prepared by the St. Petersburg 
institute Atomenergoproyekt was handed over to the 
administration of Khabarovsk Kray and Solnechnyy Rayon, the 
intended location of the station. According to Yuriy Komov, head 
of the Far East Center for Energy Problems, no decision has been 
made yet on construction of the Dalnevostochnaya AES. 
  It is no secret that the eliminated kray soviet decided to 
build or accommodate nuclear power facilities on its territory 
only after the issue was presented to a kray referendum. Local 
organizations of the Democratic Forces of Russia movement and 
the "Greens" held several rallies demanding that the feasibility 
report be submitted for public discussion. But currently, Yuriy 
Komov thinks, it is unclear from the legal point of view who 
ought to make the decision about building a nuclear power 
station with four 440-megawatt units. At present time a public 
commission is being set up under the kray administration that 
will examine every aspect of the AES construction proposal.

<F P=106> ["Addendum to Edict No. 236 of the Russian Federation </F>
President of 4 February 1994: Basic Provisions of the Russian 
Federation Government Strategy for Environmental Protection and 
Provision of Stable Development"] 
  [Text] 
  The Basic Provisions of the Russian Federation Government 
Strategy To Protect the Environment and Ensure Stable 
Development represent a foundation for constructive mutual 
activity of Russian Federation organs of state power and its 
subjects, local administration organs, entrepreneurs, and public 
associations as they work on ensuring a comprehensive solution 
to the problems of a well-balanced development of our economy 
and an improvement of the environment. 
  Enforcement of the Russian Federation Government Strategy To 
Protect the Environment and Ensure Stable Development requires 
the implementation of our citizens' right to have a beneficial 
environment, which is stated in the Russian Federation 
constitution, and the right of future generations to utilize our 
natural resources potential with the purpose of maintaining 
stable development, as well as the resolution of current 
socioeconomic issues inseparably from implementing adequate 
measures for the protection and improvement of our environment 
and the preservation and restoration of our natural resources. 
<H5>  1. Safeguarding Ecologically Safe Stable Development Under </H5>
Market Economy Conditions 
  To ensure ecologically safe and stable development, the 
government should regulate the use of natural resources and 
stimulate work on environmental protection by adopting 
streamlined socioeconomic, financial and tax policies under 
market economy conditions. Administrative activity should be 
oriented to achieving economic well-being combined with the 
ecological safety of Russia. 
  The basic directions of all work on ensuring ecologically 
safe, stable development are as follows: 
  Provide ecologically feasible locations for production 
facilities; 
  Maintain ecologically safe development of industries, the 
energy industry, transportation, and municipal services; 
  Maintain ecologically safe development of agriculture; 
  Ensure nonexhaustive use of restored natural resources; 
  Ensure rational usage of nonrenewable natural resources; 
  Expand utilization of secondary resources, recycling, and 
safe disposal and burial of wastes; 
  Improve management in the areas of environmental protection, 
utilization of natural resources, and prevention and elimination 
of extreme situations. 
<H5>  2. Protection of Human Habitation Environment </H5>
  In order to create conditions allowing our citizens to 
exercise their constitutional right to live in a beneficial 
natural environment, the following basic directions are outlined: 
  Create a healthy human habitation environment in urban and 
rural locations; 
  Develop a network of recreational and health-care facility 
complexes; 
  Improve the quality of foodstuffs; 
  Provide the people with good-quality potable water; 
  Prevent pollution of atmospheric air and water reservoirs; 
  Ensure radiation safety of the population; 
  Prevent and diminish the dangerous effects of natural 
phenomena, technological accidents, and disasters; 
  Provide ecological education and training for the people. 
<H5>  3. Recovery (Restoration) of Damaged Ecosystems in </H5>
Ecologically Unsafe Regions of Russia. 
  The following basic directions are set in order to overcome 
the intensifying disparity between the development of productive 
forces and preservation of the ecological balance in regions 
with an unsafe environment and to ensure natural development of 
ecosystems, preserve and restore unique natural complexes and 
locations when territorial economic issues are being resolved, 
by finding optimal modes of natural resources utilization and 
protection of the environment: 
  Remove some of the major cities and industrial centers from 
a 
critical ecological situation;

  [Text] Moscow -- A meeting took place in the Russian 
Federation Defense Ministry between Major General Sergey 
Grigorov, chief of the Russian Federation Defense Ministry 
ecology and special protection funds directorate, and European 
Parliament deputies Christian Rousing and Freddy Blak. The 
visitors from Denmark saw for themselves how the storing and 
utilization of nuclear weapons and propulsion plants in the army 
and the navy is done by experienced specialists with the aid of 
the most up-to-date technical monitoring equipment. Owing, 
however, to considerable cuts in nuclear arms and redeployment 
of missile units there is a lack of ecology specialists. The 
Europarliament deputies voiced readiness for cooperation in 
jointly training them.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Karlov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 17 May -- While being in possession of 
powerful technologies and facilities for processing and 
recycling toxic waste, the West, nevertheless, prefers to export 
this waste to other countries in Africa, South America, East 
Europe, or the CIS, which do not have such facilities. This is 
not an economic move but a purposeful political action in order 
to save themselves from the harmful anthropogenic effects of the 
waste. The West sees Russia as the preferred candidate for a 
world garbage dump, Valeriy Timofeyev, representative of the 
Russian Federal Counterintelligence Service, said today at a 
meeting of the inter-departmental commission for ecological 
safety of the Russian Security Council. 
  Judging by the report made by Aleksey Poryadin, first deputy 
minister for the protection of environment and natural 
resources, there are causes for concern. Russia produces 
annually about 7,000 million tonnes of waste, of which only 
2,000 million (28 percent) are then used in the national 
economy. To date, 1,600 million tonnes of toxic waste have 
accumulated in the country. The situation that has come about 
in Russia with the formation, use, de- activation, storage, and 
burying of waste results in irreversible damage to the natural 
environment and poses a real threat to the health of Russian 
people. 
  Russia already has "waste storages" that can cause 
ecological 
catastrophes, but despite this, the import of foreign toxic 
substances to this country continues. There is an increasingly 
clear tendency to conclude deals on importing and recycling 
dangerous waste under the guise of foreign economic projects on 
recycling raw materials to extract valuable substances or on 
giving humanitarian aid.

  [Text] The final results of a study into radioactive 
pollution in the Far East's seas, conducted in March-April by a 
Russian-Japanese-South Korean expedition, will be revealed not 
earlier than in October. Interfax learned this in the 
scientific-industrial amalgamation Taifun which was one of the 
organizers of the expedition to the Far East. 
  Currently, scientists have preliminary data on cesium-137. 
The study of sea water and bottom at sites where Russia had 
buried nuclear waste did not show excessive levels of radiation. 
  However, as Taifun noted, it would be possible to make a 
conclusion on whether nuclear waste damaged the environment only 
after a study of the data on the levels of strontium-90, 
plutonium, and a number of other radionuclides, expected to be 
finished not later than in October. 
  The expedition which was organized at the initiative of 
Japan 
and South Korea made a study of regions where Russia buried its 
nuclear waste. This summer it is planned to study the burial 
sites at sea of Japanese and South Korean nuclear waste.

  [Text] At the present time there is no evidence whatsoever 
to suggest that the leaking of corrosive products and 
plutonium-239 from the torpedo warheads on board the Komsomolets 
atomic submarine could do any significant harm to the fishing 
industry of countries fishing in the Norwegian and Barents seas. 
This conclusion is contained in a report by experts of the 
State Ecological Commission of Russia's Ministry for 
Environmental Protection and Natural Resources. The experts say 
that, even if the most pessimistic forecasts prove correct, the 
dose which could be received by man if the plutonium escapes 
into the environment is significantly less than the annual 
permissible maximum which the human body can absorb. The 
conclusions of the expert commission were released by the press 
center of Russia's Ministry for Natural Resources.

  [Text] "There is no information to suggest that the leak of 
corrosive plutonium-239 from the warheads on the Komsomolets 
nuclear submarine could cause a degree of damage to the fishing 
industries of countries which use the Norwegian and Barents seas 
and to the local population." 
  The conclusion was contained in an ecological report by an 
expert commission from Russia's ministry for environmental 
protection (Minprirody) on proposals for the further operation 
of the Komsomolets and on ways to minimize the emission of 
radioactive substances from nuclear warheads on board into the 
environment. Interfax received the information from the 
Minprirody press center Thursday. 
  The ecological report said that at worst the dose which any 
human being could receive from the emission of plutonium would 
be far lower than the permissible yearly intake of plutonium by 
the human body. 
  That conclusion can be backed up by a comparison of the 
plutonium content in nuclear warheads on board the Komsomolets 
(around 400 Curie) and the amount of plutonium in the Irish Sea, 
into which British nuclear enterprises had emitted a total of 
2000 Curie without noticeable pollution being recorded in the 
fishing waters. 
  However, given the intensity of efforts to localize the 
source of radiation at comparatively low cost, the expert 
commission approved further projects for work on board the 
Komsomolets. The outer slits in the vessel's bow would, it 
said, be closed to eliminate the possibility of corrosive 
plutonium leaking from the torpedo installations in the future.

<F P=106> [Viktor Litovkin report: "The Sunken Komsomolets Puts Out </F>
SOS Signals"] 
  [Text] Sergey Khetagurov, deputy minister for emergency 
situations, has told an INTERFAX correspondent that 15 June this 
year the ministry will mount an expedition to the site of the 
disaster involving the Russian nuclear-powered submarine 
Komsomolets, which sank in the Norwegian Sea in April 1989. The 
purpose of the two-month expedition, aboard the research ship 
Akademik Keldysh, is to seal the torpedo tube hatches. 
  The submarine has two torpedoes on board with nuclear 
warheads, and these fill specialists with the greatest 
apprehension, the deputy minister said. "It is impossible to 
rule out, in principle, a possible spread of radioactivity as a 
result of corrosion of their casing," he believes. 
  At the very same time Academician Vladimir Zuyev, department 
head at the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of Oceanology, 
has sent a letter to the Russian president's staff. He reports 
that, despite the real possibility of a volley discharge of 
weapons-grade plutonium into the marine environment from the 
sunken Komsomolets, the expedition to it and the actual sealing 
of the vessel are in jeopardy. Leading specialists with rich 
experience of underwater work have been taken off it. The 
necessary ecological expert appraisal has not been carried out. 
There is no federal program for the reliable corrosion-proofing 
of an increased source of radioactive danger, and the necessary 
financial resources have not yet been allocated to this. 
  What is the problem here? Why does the situation with regard 
to the sunken Komsomolets elicit such increased attention and 
such contradictory assessments? Several nuclear-powered ships 
have sunk in recent years, and so much radioactive waste has 
been dumped in the oceans that the possibility of a leak of 
plutonium from two torpedoes appears a mere trifle compared with 
the constant discharge of radiation from these graveyards. 
  Dr. of Technical Sciences Tengiz Borisov, former chairman of 
the Committee for Carrying Out Special-Purpose Underwater Work, 
whose functions have now been transferred to the Ministry for 
Emergency Situations, believes that this is not quite the case. 
The question of ensuring the Komsomolets' radiation safety is 
far more serious than other similar tragic instances. There are 
several reasons. 
  First, the submarine lies off the coast of Norway, in 
Norway's traditional fishing grounds. The discharge of 
plutonium into the water -- and traces of it were already 
detected last year, although they do not yet exceed the 
background values -- could deprive that country of fisheries for 
hundreds of years, destroy the modern fish-processing industry, 
deprive tens of thousands of people of their livelihoods, and, 
as a consequence, drastically undermine Russia's prestige and 
force it to pay compensation running into many millions in 
foreign currency. 
  Second, Russia, its leadership, and its specialists still 
have the technical and economic possibility of preventing the 
radiation pollution of the ocean, corrosion-proofing the sunken 
vessel, and delivering Europe from the threat of an ecological 
disaster. But precious time must not be lost here. We are left 
with virtually the last chance of carrying out the work this 
summer. There will not be another opportunity -- the torpedoes' 
beryllium casings are bound to break up within the next few 
months, and then all efforts will be in vain. 
True, not all the specialists familiar with the situation on the 
submarine share the anxiety of Tengiz Borisov, his colleagues at 
the Institute of Oceanology, or other scientists and practical 
underwater workers. Some of them -- mainly employees of the 
Ministry for Emergency Situations -- maintain that fishing is 
not conducted at a depth of 1,700 meters, where the Komsomolets 
lies, and so there is simply no threat that plutonium will get 
into the fish diet and thence onto people's tables. 
  In addition, they say, in the opinion of nuclear scientists 
at the Scientific Research Institute of Experimental Physics at 
Arzamas-16, where the torpedoes' nuclear warheads were created, 
the discharge of plutonium following the destruction of the 
torpedoes' casings will not have appreciable radiation 
consequences either for the population or for the fauna. If a 
100-percent discharge does occur, all the material will settle 
in a compact stain between 30 and 400 km long. At the same time 
the radiation doses will be virtually insignificant at the far 
limits of the seat of radiation. 
  The IZVESTIYA editorial office has a copy of this opinion of 
the Scientific Research Institute of Experimental Physics, 
approved by Academicians Yuriy Trutnev and Stanislav Voronin of 
the Russian Academy of Sciences, the chief designers of nuclear 
warheads. Its conclusions do not coincide with those reached at 
the Ministry for Emergency Situations. "It is not yet clear," 
the scientists write, "whether the uncertainty that exists at 
the present time in the estimates of seabed pollution by the 
fissionable products of plutonium corrosion can affect the 
global conclusion that `the escape of plutonium from the nuclear 
weapons as their insulating casing is destroyed has no 
appreciable radioactive consequences....'" Further: "It is 
necessary to make a more detailed assessment of the possible 
movement of plutonium from the bed to surface layers as a 
consequence of the seasonal migration of plankton which winters 
on the bed and the competing processes of spreading of the 
plankton patch on the lifting of plutonium build-ups from seabed 
deposits...." 
  If we translate the scientists' words into simple language 
understandable to everyone, it becomes clear that large areas of 
plankton plastered with the decomposition products of nuclear 
warheads or, rather, precisely plutonium, have zero buoyancy. 
They can be moved by underwater currents any distance from the 
scene of the tragedy and thus end up, ultimately, in the food of 
someone living thousands of kilometers from the Norwegian Sea. 
  The academicians believe that it would be premature to 
conclude that in work with the nuclear-powered submarine 
Komsomolets it is possible to confine ourselves just to 
radiation monitoring; everything must be done to make naval 
weapons systems safe, bearing the possibility of accidents in 
mind. A similar conclusion was reached by the Russian Security 
Council Interdepartmental Commission on Ecological Safety, which 
discussed this problem at the end of last year. 
  What, then, is preventing this from being done today? 
Particularly as the Ministry for Emergency Situations, as Sergey 
Khetagurov declared, is ready and has plans to carry out the 
special expedition to seal the stricken submarine? 
  In the opinion of many specialists with whom I have spoken 
about this, work on corrosion-proofing the sunken submarine is 
being hindered by departmental differences and by ambitions 
which, no less than the actual corrosion, are eating away at 
formerly amicable and united collectives. 
  The people who last year organized and carried out the 
unique 
deep-water experiment in the Norwegian Sea, who ascertained and 
analyzed the actual condition of the sunken vessel and its 
systems, and who used unique underwater robots to peep inside 
the Komsomolets, proposed their own program for 
corrosion-proofing it -- packing the torpedo compartment with a 
special sorbent, isolating it from seabed currents by means of 
metal covers with rubber seals, and, in addition, giving the 
Ministry for Emergency Situations disinterested assistance in 
implementing it and working on the expedition on a voluntary 
basis. But there was not even a reply to their appeal. 
  At the same time the new structures of the Ministry for 
Emergency Situations, which have never before encountered such 
complex underwater work, are acutely short of such specialists. 
Yet in many cases they antagonize former employees of the 
Committee for Carrying Out Special-Purpose Underwater Work and 
other organizations. There is very little time left until the 
start of the expedition. It will be very difficult during the 
remaining days to make up for what has been neglected during the 
preceding months. 
  Ships with deep-water apparatus on board could be delayed 
from putting to sea because ecological expertise and money are 
lacking and all the necessary equipment has still to be 
prepared. The favorable weather in the ocean will pass. Then 
will come new interdepartmental accusations, a search for guilty 
parties.... Who will benefit from this? 
  Experts of my acquaintance believe that in the interests of 
the getting the job done the departmental differences and 
ambitions must be overcome and discarded. We must not reject 
anybody's help, because too much is at stake. Not only the 
country's prestige but also people's health. There is an 
extremely great need today for a government program for the 
corrosion-proofing of the sunken submarine -- a program approved 
by the president and with powers to involve all the necessary 
organizations and structures in this operation. We must not put 
our trust in foreign assistance. We ourselves are capable of 
rectifying what we have done. 
  This is now becoming a matter of honor for the country and 
its specialists.

Twenty of the plant's workers have so far been affected. Three 
had to be dispatched to Kharkov for special treatment at an 
institute. An investigation is under way. 
  Meanwhile specialists have worked out that 200 cubic meters 
of contaminated soil will have to be removed from the plant's

have to be removed from the reservoir where water for 
fire-fighting purposes is kept. It is assumed that the

<F P=106> [Natalya Ostrovskaya report: "Firms Will Compete for Right </F>
To Build Nuclear Waste Reprocessing Facilities for Us"] 
  [Text] Vladivostok -- The Pacific Fleet is not going to 
pour any liquid radioactive waste -- a by-product of the 
destruction of nuclear submarines -- into the Sea of Japan 
before the end of the year. That is the only specific accord 
reached during the work of the Russian-Japanese commission on 
the problem of liquid radioactive waste. A statement to that 
effect was made by Yevgeniy Stomatyuk, chairman of the Maritime 
Kray Administration Natural Resources Committee and member of 
the Russian-Japanese commission, on his return from Tokyo. 
  Prior to Tokyo the commission, under the cochairmanship of 
Nikolay Yegorov, Russian deputy atomic energy minister, and 
Amano Yukiya [name as transliterated], head of the Japanese 
Foreign Ministry Nuclear Energy Department, visited Vladivostok, 
then the city of Bolshoy Kamen which, as is well known, is where 
old navy tankers full of radioactive water stand moored at the 
Zvezda Plant, and also Sysoyev Bay. The latter is the site of a 
support center, the so-called sedimentation ship division and 
the base where Pacific Fleet submarines are cut up for scrap. 
  The Maritime region was included in the itinerary solely at 
the Japanese side's insistence, which is perfectly 
understandable. Since the problem of recycling liquid 
radioactive waste is going to be resolved using resources 
allocated by the Japanese Government, it is clear that it is 
time to put an end to the secrecy and display the potential 
sites for the construction of the reprocessing complex. No one 
doubts that one is needed today. After all, even though the 
process of cutting up nuclear submarines is still going on at 
the Zvezda Plant, all the liquid radioactive waste tanks are 
full and there are approximately 2,000 cubic meters of 
radioactive water stored there at present. 
  According to the specialists, the most logical thing of all 
would be to set up the complex for the recycling and 
reprocessing of nuclear waste right here at Zvezda. But the 
inhabitants of Bolshoy Kamen opposed this method of resolving 
the problem and the Russian-Japanese commission decided to look 
for another solution. 
  Without coming to any definitive or irrevocable decision, 
the 
commission has arrived at two preliminary options. 
  Option one is the construction of a mobile complex for the 
recycling of liquid radioactive waste, in other words a floating 
installation capable of moving freely at sea and taking waste 
products from ships and from shore-based storage facilities. 
Such an installation could be produced in six months, according 
to the assurance given by the Japanese. 
  Option two includes the construction of additional fixed 
containers for liquid radioactive waste and a shore-based 
reprocessing complex in Sysoyev Bay. The containers could be 
built in three months, the complex in a year. 
  It will become clear by mid-May which of these is the 
preferred option. By that time representatives of the Crown 
Agents, a British firm of consultants who took part in the 
commission's work, have pledged to produce an estimate of the 
cost and economic expediency of each option. 
  When the final choice has been made it is proposed to put 
the 
best plan out to tender. In the commission's opinion the 
contract will go to whoever can guarantee to fulfill all the 
necessary technical and economic conditions at the lowest cost. 
Anyone will be allowed to tender. It is presumed that this 
will mean Japanese, Russian, and U.S. firms above all. 
  So, if everything goes according to this plan, it may be 
hoped that within about four months the ill-starred and 
ramshackle TNT-5, the subject of much discussion for six months 
now, will finally be separated from its liquid radioactive 
cargo. But what about now? After all, if the Maritime Kray 
Administration is to be believed, this vessel is only notionally 
seaworthy because it could spring a leak at any moment or sink 
to the bottom without warning. To avoid protest actions by 
local inhabitants on the one hand, and problems in dealings with 
neighbors in the Sea of Japan on the other hand, the commission 
came up with what it believes is a compromise solution: The 
TNT-5 will be towed further away from the Bolshoy Kamen 
protesters. It is hard to guess right now just where that will 
be and how it will be done because the tanker is dilapidated and 
was written off two years ago. Perhaps it will be towed out 
into Sysoyev Bay.... 
  Here is an interesting detail. For the first time in the 
history of this question, the very highest Russian authorities 
gave the Japanese permission during the commission's work not 
only to visit the Zvezda Plant but also go aboard the legendary 
TNT-5. However, the prudent visitors declined to visit the TNT 
after they had checked it with their personal dosimeters and 
registered a reading considerably above the radiation 
background. I wonder what was felt at that particular moment by 
those people who, by the whim of an evil fate, were unlucky 
enough to be doing their fixed-term service aboard this 
dangerously radioactive tub? Perhaps the sailors and commanders 
of the illustrious Pacific Fleet feel that for six months they 
have been guinea pigs who have helped to show the effect of the 
prolonged exposure of the human body to small doses of radiation.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valentin Pavlov] </F>
  [Text] Barnaul May 11 TASS -- A three-day session of the 
Scientific Council of the programme to investigate the "distant 
radiation after-effects of the Semipalatinsk nuclear tests on 
the population of Altay territory" began here today. 
  Invited to take part in it, in addition to the participants 
of the "Semipalatinsk programme", were scientists from almost 60 
research institutes, who have discovered hitherto unknown 
documents on Soviet nuclear tests, and their opponents. 
  The participation of the latter, according to Valeriy 
Kiselev, director of the regional Medico-Ecological Problems 
Research Institute, is most important, because their views will 
allow the session to see more clearly the weak points of the 
programme and to further the ongoing investigations. 
  As distinct from previous sessions, the current one will 
work 
only in plenum, which will allow it to create new conditions for 
the inter-disciplinary interaction of various specialists: 
Physicists, chemists, biologists, physicians and social 
scientists. Such complex studies are most necessary today. 
After all, Altay, which was affected by more than 58 nuclear 
blasts in the period from 1949 to 1990, and also by the first 
explosion of a thermonuclear bomb in August 1953, was turned 
into a sort of "human survival testing ground". Only the 
picture of the 1949 explosion was modelled so far. Much work is 
yet to be done on the other tests. But the after-effect of 
Soviet nuclear tests on the Altay population is well known. 
They are more terrible than those of the Chernobyl disaster, 
because the local population was exposed not once, but many 
times over to irradiation with radionuclides with a short period 
of decay. 
  The session will analyse in detail the incidence of diseases 
among the territory's population, which was affected by 
explosions on the Semipalatinsk testing ground. According to 
Kiselev, the international scientific community expects from the 
parties to the programme a thorough analysis of the medical 
after-effects of nuclear tests, because a massive examination of 
all the people affected by radiation was carried out for the 
first time in Altay, which has involuntarily become a sort of 
research laboratory. 
  The session will discuss the results of 1993 scientific 
works 
and the main directions of further studies. Moreover, it will 
be an important landmark in the preparations for an 
international conference on the "radiation test" programme, 
which will be held in Altay this September.

<F P=106> [Press release by Armenian Press Service: "Ecological </F>
Bulletin--93"] 
  [Text] According to the Republic Environmental Monitoring 
Center the state of the air basin of the cities in Armenia last 
year created the following picture. In Yerevan of the 13 indices 
taken under control, four, including that on dust, exceeded 
established levels. By comparison with 1992, however, the 
average annual and maximum density of harmful substances 
decreased. 
  This is reported in the annually issued "Ecological 
Handbook" 
of the Ministry of Environmental Protection. Evaluating the 
pollution of the air basin of populated points with toxic 
emissions the handbook reports an overall comparative decrease 
in their amount in a number of other cities of the republic 
where measurements were taken at regular intervals. But with 
regard to specific compounds (carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, 
and others) the indices are yet to reach acceptable levels. 
  Samples for the analysis of water surfaces were not taken 
from all of the rivers in the republic because of the lack of 
transportation and fuel, which does not allow an accurate and 
comprehensive general characterization. Nevertheless it was 
established that permissible levels of ammonia ions, nitrites, 
petroleum products, and copper are being exceeded. At the same 
time changes in the average annual density of these substances 
are not noted. 
  Inspection services of the ministry checked the work on 
environmental protection at 1,645 facilities in the republic and 
found 1,683 violations of environmental laws in connection with 
which 25 cases were forwarded to legal investigative agencies. 
The operation of three facilities was stopped. Demands for 
reimbursement of damages were prepared in connection with 
violations occurring at numerous enterprises, including 
Ararattsement, Armenergoprom, and the Yerevan TETs [Heat and 
Power Station]. 
  The Administration for the Protection of Fisheries is 
conducting an inventory of artificial water reservoirs with the 
participation of interested organizations to establish a true 
picture of existing fish species and populations and also for 
the proper organization of state fishing. The administration 
recorded 231 cases of illegal fishing and fined 200 individuals. 
In the course of raids made at the Sevan National Park some 256 
nets and three seines, along with eight rubber boats, and 
several thousand kilograms of fish were confiscated.

  [Text] The building of the first waste processing 
facilites--dealing with the treatment of solid household and 
industrial nontoxic waste--was begun in the village of Barba, 
Vetkovskiy Rayon, Gomel Oblast. Construction is to be completed 
by late (1994). Then, this processing complex will begin 
treating the waste from Gomel enterprises. The cost of 
construction is covered by some 100 Gomel enterprises with which 
the Gomel Executive Commission signed agreements on sharing 
expenditures for this project. Gomel authorities had to make 
this decision when Dorofeeva, chairman of the State Committee 
for Ecology, and the Belarusian Government refused to earmark 
financial assistance to them. According to Alyaksandr Titov, 
chairman of the Gomel Office for Ecology and Radiological 
Security, he does not understand why the State Committee for 
Ecology does not use this unique occasion to work out the 
technology of construction and operation of this complex to 
eventually free the city from dumping grounds.

<F P=106> [Article by Vasyl Shevchuk, deputy minister of environmental </F>
protection of Ukraine, doctor of economic sciences: "The Effect 
of Harmful Wastes. Ways To Integrate Economic and Ecological 
Reforms in Ukraine"] 
  [Text] Centralized administration of Ukraine's economy over 
a prolonged period of time caused it to develop with huge 
structural disproportions. The ecological problems it inherited 
are primarily the result of the improper use of natural 
resources. 
  The inefficient economic system with ownerless property and 
administrative redistribution of funds promoted wasteful use of 
resources and inefficient energy consumption in monopolized 
production. Heavy industry with its resource-intensive 
technologies accounts for 61 percent of the gross domestic 
product in Ukraine's economy as against 34 percent in the 
economies of EC countries. The power-output ratio in Ukraine's 
gross national product is the highest among the countries of the 
former Soviet Union. It is nine times higher than in the 
countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation 
and Development [OECD], and nearly four times greater than in 
countries with higher than average per capita income. 
  This is what has created the "Ukrainian phenomenon" in the 
economy, which combines world prices with meager wages and a 
scarcity of goods. This same situation provides a key to 
defining the ways and methods for conducting economic reforms. 
The transition from centralized planning to a market economy 
must also include improving the environment by imposing harsh 
penalties for massive, unwarranted squandering of resources. 
  The principal factors that could promote progress in 
improving the state of the environment include ending political 
and administrative interference in price formation and setting 
wage rates, introducing a system of incentives through taxes and 
payments, using economic methods to equalize starting conditions 
in state enterprises and sectors, eliminating the 
interdependence of prices and revenues and material outlays, 
demonopolizing and restructuring production potential, 
restricting the access of enterprises to government money 
(budget restrictions), and abolishing subsidies for the use of 
such natural resources as energy, minerals, and water. 
  The decline in production is significantly reducing 
pollution. Market reforms provide an opportunity to preserve and 
reinforce this effect for the next decade by encouraging a shift 
towards resource-conserving and clean technologies and forms of 
activity. As industrial capital renewal proceeds, the dumping of 
most substances that pollute the environment can be maintained 
at a stable level or even reduced if there is rapid economic 
growth. Industrial restructuring will affect water pollution to 
a lesser degree, because most of these wastes come from 
agriculture, household plots, and public utilities. 
Consequently, in the long term, attention will have to shift 
from air to water pollution. 
  In the process of economic reform, we may discover 
advantages 
in stimulating investments in environmental protection in the 
private sector, especially if it can reduce undesirable results. 
Investments in environmental protection in the industrial and 
power sectors must conform to the lowest-cost principle and to 
the process of making decisions in the private sector. On the 
whole, the key factor in improving the state of the environment 
lies in the integration of environmental needs with the 
structure of sectorial policy. Abolishing subsidies for energy 
will result in reducing consumption and promote the use of new 
resource-conserving and cleaner technologies. 
  As a result of the critical shortage of available resources, 
divergences between economic and environmental interests will 
grow. Some of the old enterprises will continue to operate, 
because closing them would cause substantial social losses. Such 
enterprises must be required to implement environmental 
protection measures that do not require large financial outlays. 
Improvements can be achieved at most old enterprises simply by 
introducing "efficient management" (more painstaking repairs, 
combatting waste, installing improved regulating and monitoring 
equipment, applying more stringent standards in managing 
production and processing methods). These measures are very 
important, because it is not possible to introduce clean 
technologies on a large scale until new markets for the sale of 
various kinds of production are created and until the economic 
capability of enterprises is assured. 
  Privatization will promote market reforms. The government 
can 
speed up privatization and promote progress in the field of 
environmental protection by establishing clearly defined rules 
regarding responsibility for causing damage (harm) to the 
environment in the past and by making new owners liable for all 
pollution by toxic substances that results from their activity. 
In many cases, the state itself must assume responsibility for 
causing damage to the environment in the past. An audit of 
balance sheets (inventory) in the field of environmental 
protection must be conducted immediately in order to distinguish 
between the pollution caused in the past and that being caused 
now. And if production at privatized enterprises does not meet 
the necessary standards, stricter antipollution standards should 
be gradually phased in. 
  In the future, the structural reorganization of industry 
will 
lead to a reduction in the harmful effects of pollution on human 
health in a specific region as those employed in inefficient and 
harmful industries, which are subject to closing, are provided 
with opportunities to find new jobs, as economic activity picks 
up, and as the surviving enterprises accumulate sufficient funds 
to invest in new technologies. 
  Conducting an ecological and technological audit will enable 
us to collect the most important data on enterprises that do not 
lend themselves to privatized operation and to plan tasks for 
the short term. 
  In an economic system based on achieving gross production 
indicators, the state allocated less than half a percent of the 
gross national product for environmental protection, which 
failed completely to compensate for the damages and losses 
caused by the technogenic volume. Until now, an enterprise's 
economic liability for polluting the environment has been purely 
symbolic and has not exceeded 1.5-2.0 percent of its profit. 
  The creation of a new economic system of environmental use 
and environmental protection measures as part of the transition 
to a market economy must become an integral part of the system 
for managing and regulating the economy. 
  The principal elements of this economic mechanism must be: 
  Payment for special use of natural resources; 
  Payment for polluting the environment; 
  A system for financing and extending credit for 
environmental 
protection measures (state and local budgets, environmental 
protection funds, banks, enterprise funds, foreign investments, 
etc.). 
  To ensure that these fundamental goals are achieved and to 
create a system for financing environmental protection measures, 
a fixed percentage of the gross national product must be 
earmarked in the state budget for spending on measures to 
protect the environment. According to estimates prepared by the 
ministry of environmental protection and the ministry of the 
economy, this amount can and must be no less than 0.9-1.0 
percent of the GNP. The greater portion of this money should 
come from payments for the special use of natural resources 
(water, minerals, etc.) and payment for land. The remainder of 
the environmental protection costs should be met by the local 
budgets, ecological funds, and the enterprises' own funds. An 
effort should also be made to encourage the development of 
ecological business enterprise and the extension of credit by 
banks for investment in environmental protection. Taking into 
account the present ecological state of Ukraine, it is necessary 
to increase the proportion of environmental protection 
expenditures to 3-5 percent of the GNP. 
  The funds earmarked in the state budget of Ukraine for 
environmental protection measures should be kept separate and 
used to finance priority national and regional programs and 
measures. The construction of environmental protection projects 
using centralized capital investments must be conducted on the 
basis of government contracts. The ecological funds and banks 
must protect these funds against inflation. It is also necessary 
to create a favorable climate for investments and an effective 
system of realizing foreign investments in the Ukrainian economy 
in general, as well as in the protection of the environment.

<F P=106> [Article by Tetyana Khomych: "The Lake of Death. It </F>
Actually Exists On the Map of the Dnieper Region"] 
  [Text] Geologists discovered it, by accident, five years 
ago. They explored a site for working an uranium ore deposit 
similar to that near the Devladove Station in Sofiyivskyy Rayon 
that functioned for 15 years. Ore began to be extracted there 
in 1965-68 by an original method developed by Moscow design 
institutes. What it really was did not became known to the 
general public until 1989, when the project was declassified. 
By that time, the deposit had not been worked for about six 
years, and it might have become a mystery forever if ecologists 
had not decided to find out more about some of the figures. 
  There is a danger that the discovered lake will not remain 
"silent" forever, but may declare itself in a most terrible 
manner. If this does take place, Ukraine will have yet another 
Chernobyl, and this time it will be brought with water.... 
  Here is what the chief ecologist of the Dnieper Research 
Center at Ukraine's Academy of Sciences, Hryhoriy Shmatkov, 
said, in particular, about the subsurface lake. The emergence 
of this affliction was brought about by... Ukraine's mineral 
wealth, particularly by its uranium ores. They usually occur 
under the earth's surface as compact layers in the form of a 
subsurface block. A borehole was drilled to a depth of between 
50 and 70 meters, and, through it, concentrated acids were 
pumped into the layer. They completely dissolved the uranium 
ore, and the associated minerals transformed them into pulp. 
After that, a new borehole was drilled, the liquid was pumped 
out through it and taken for enrichment. The process was 
repeated every 25 meters. In the course of a single operation, 
a mixture made up of 205,000 tonnes of concentrated sulfuric 
acid, 66,000 tonnes of concentrated nitric acid, and 25,000 
tonnes of concentrated nitric ammonium got underground. Such a 
mixture is capable of dissolving anything, it even turned soil 
into pulp--specially treated pumps and pipes could only 
withstand it for several months. 
  After the substance was processed and enriched uranium was 
obtained, the radioactive waste was again pumped into the ground 
in the form of pulp. This process continued for at least 11 
years and now, in accordance with estimates by specialists, 
there are between 6 million and 7 million tonnes of such 
radioactive acid waste under ground. It is in a semi-liquid 
state, and the lake, which will only cease to be radioactive in 
200 or 300 years, is capable of drifting. 
  In accordance with conclusions by specialists, the lake 
moves 
by approximately 20 meters a year. This is due to the fact that 
its front is somewhat inclined, since earth horizons are also 
not quite horizontal. If one multiplies 20 meters by 200 years, 
it will become obvious that, over that stretch of time, the lake 
will advance by kilometers. The most terrible thing, however, 
is the fact that, on its path, it may come across fissures, 
aquifers, or sandstones. Then the "water" from the subsurface 
lake of death may percolate into subsurface wells, from which 
the life-giving moisture is today supplied to the majority of 
populated areas in the region. People will become ill and will 
not know why.... 
  It is true, though, that Moscow specialists, who were first 
to have detected that lake (it had not, obviously, been planned 
by the designers and not even foreseen), are trying to convince 
us that nothing "terrible" will happen. However, ecologists 
have reasons to doubt these reassuring conclusions. For 
example, one of their initial assertions to the effect that the 
lake, having come across clayey layers, will not penetrate them 
proved erroneous. Local geologists disprove this. Yet another 
circumstance is taken into account: The special geological 
team, which discovered the lake, did not arrive in the Dnieper 
Region for noble purposes. Its goal was to locate yet another 
deposit, similar to the one in Devladove, and only the social 
processes of 1989 thwarted this intention. However, is it in the 
interests of Moscow geologists to show their hand in full and 
make public what was done to Ukrainian land by other imperial 
"specialists"? The Moor has done his duty, and the Moor has 
left.... 
  At the same time, Ukraine has remained with yet another 
headache and, who knows, it may become no less severe than that 
caused by Chernobyl. Today, ecologists raise the question of 
the most stringent control over the movement of the lake and 
over the quality of drinking water in the surrounding area. It 
is practically impossible to neutralize the lake, because huge 
sums of money will have to be invested in order to build a 
special plant, manufacture special substances, drill new 
boreholes, and pump these neutralizing substances into them. 
So, it is only realistic now to conduct permanent monitoring 
and research and open a laboratory or a station in the area of 
the lake for conducting the necessary studies, making forecasts, 
and so on. However, this is also capital, and it will fall as a 
burden upon our budget. 
  However, this is the fate of all colonial countries, such as 
Ukraine was until recently. Those who want to see it within 
some "union" again must realize that they not only vote for the 
absence of a Customs officer at the Russian-Ukrainian border, 
but also for new Chernobyls and lakes of death on Ukrainian 
land. It is necessary to remember this.

<F P=106> [Article by Acting Crimean Interior Minister V. Kuznetsov, </F>
Crimean Ecological Center Chairman V. Rysich, and V. Tarasenko, 
chairman of the "Ecology and Peace" association: "Crimean 
`Russian Island?'"] 
  [Excerpts] The "Ecology and Peace" association in the 
Crimea has repeatedly expressed its justified concerns over the 
environmental situation in areas of our peninsula occupied by 
military units and facilities. It is also alarming that there 
is no environmental control on these areas. Whereas Crimea's 
civil ecological service has an efficient scientific and 
practical potential (even though certain shortcomings still 
exist), the corresponding service carried out by the military 
in, for example, the Odessa Military District, is performed 
by...two specialists, as we have already reported. 
  The "Ecology and Peace" association has expressed its 
concern 
in a letter to the Ukrainian defense minister. In response, the 
military department concurred with the Crimean specialists' 
assessment of the situation at military bases, has expressed its 
full understanding, and concluded that there is no money for 
action. 
  We are not, however, facing a case that if someone does not 
want to do something he cannot be forced to do so. 
  We must act! This is why the three seemingly different 
specialists have united under the one "roof" of this article, to 
tell readers the truth about the environmental situation in 
military towns. [passage omitted on nuclear tests conducted by 
the USSR in the 1950's] 
  Do not think, however, that all the misery is far away from 
the Crimea. Similar events are taking place at the Bagerovsk 
military range (it is now a radioactive dumping ground). 
  At a briefing in the Crimean Supreme Council, the range's 
deputy commander announced that personnel protecting the 
radioactive dump site are slightly inert and sleepy, and that 
something resembling lichen has appeared on the servicemen's 
skin. 
  The statement was made on 14 May 1993. Even though our 
specialists requested that the Ukrainian Defense Ministry 
examine the facility, nobody has so far bothered to do so. The 
response is always the same--there is no money. Regretfully, 
this response has not been presented to the mothers whose 
children are serving at the Bagerovsk range. We would not envy 
those who would have to do that! As a matter of fact, this is 
just another version of the Russian island in the Pacific Ocean 
[site of nuclear tests]. In that case, however, more than 50 
admirals and officers were brought to account. 
  One official document of the former General Headquarters 
dated 1988--a protocol on military facilities' harmful impact on 
the Crimean environment--listed many garrisons, facilities, and 
units in which other environmental "dangers" had been 
discovered. The document included advice and recommendations as 
well. 
  Absolutely nothing has changed since then. Our recent survey 
has revealed that no environmental certificates are held in 
military towns, oil warehouses do not have appropriate 
capacities to store oil sediment, sewage systems do not work in 
most military units, etc. 
  Another extraordinary accident has recently occurred--the 
spilling of oil products in Sevastopol Bay. On the same day as 
we had a conversation at the State Committee for Environment 
Protection, reports of a new spill came in. In one of the 
military units deployed in the city of Saki, according to 
witnesses, 240 tonnes of oil products seeped into a resort lake. 
Meanwhile, there is a document in force, signed by all the 
"power" ministers, which obligates all civilian and military 
leaders to exchange information on emergency environmental 
situations. Apparently, however, nobody has been demanding its 
implementation. 
  The authors of the article not only approve and support the 
president's program for gradual demilitarization of the Crimea, 
they can also provide a specific program for implementing it. 
Resources released in this process could be used in resolving 
social needs and environmental problems. The program for 
gradual demilitarization will contradict neither Ukraine's laws 
nor its Defense Ministry's military doctrine.

<F P=106> [Article by Svetlana Tutorskaya: "Doctor Achilles' Fire </F>
Alarm. An International Expert from Frankfurt Inspects CIS 
Nuclear Power Stations"] 
  [Text] Even tragedies can turn into farce, apparently. A 
year or so ago information was published on the extremely poor 
fire protection at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station. 
  You might expect, after everything that had happened, that 
the station would be properly protected against fire. A year 
ago, when Doctor Achilles delivered his report at an 
international symposium, he showed some slides: Rusty hydrants, 
which would be hard to operate when trying to get water into the 
hoses in the event of a fire; emergency exists clogged up with 
garbage; failure to observe the rules for dividing the station 
area into sections that can be sealed off, with special 
fireproof doors.... 
  According to the international rules, Doctor Achilles said, 
the buildings must have a fireproof partition with a special 
door every 60 meters. But at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power 
Station this year, as last, you can cover 200 meters and not 
encounter a partition. This means that, if a calamity were to 
occur, the fire would spread like lightning, without hindrance. 
The fire protection system has not been put into shape in the 
year since the first inspection at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power 
Station. 
  How many years now has a vast multitude of people been 
enduring the consequences of the Chernobyl accident -- a massive 
accident with massive consequences. As the oncologists 
predicted, there continue to be more and more cases of thyroid 
cancer among children exposed to radiation. People from various 
countries are pooling resources and efforts (the new child 
cancer experts' seminar that has just been held in Minsk was an 
example of this) to devise a treatment strategy, indeed to 
provide basic drugs and equipment for sick children. I do not 
have to remind you that it is all very expensive. According to 
the experts, the personnel responsible for fire protection at 
the Chernobyl station are military people without special 
training, and there are only 14 of them. There are four on duty 
at night and two by day -- in the enormous station building. 
Many of the instruments that are intended to warn of the danger 
of a fire are in locked closets and are not freely accessible. 
Instead of special fireproof doors you have conventional doors, 
which would rapidly melt in a big fire, and in some cases simple 
wooden doors. 
  The EC is allocating funds to plug these gaps, although the 
money has not been received yet. But what money do you need to 
provide free access to instruments and clear away garbage 
blocking emergency exits? 
  Electricity produced by the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station 
goes to Austria, and the station is making good money. But it 
remains an open question why, here and at other nuclear power 
stations, notably Zaporozhye (also visited by an international 
commission recently), they have virtually the same, forgive me 
for saying so, fire condition red. 
  If the technical impotence and nihilism of the station 
personnel are cause for amazement, then Doctor Achilles himself 
is a source of equally strong emotion. Do you think he stamped 
his feet and hollered "I'm leaving"? Not a bit of it. He is 
quite determined to effect positive changes in the mental 
outlook of our engineers and technicians -- a truly Herculean 
task. Without making a song and dance, doggedly and 
systematically, Achilles is getting through and securing a 
willingness to cooperate. It is to be hoped that the impetus is 
converted into positive change before, God forbid, fire breaks 
out again owing to faulty wiring, negligence, or whatever.

  [Text] The CORD [chemical oxidation reduction 
decontamination] process has successfully been used to 
decontaminate a nuclear power station reactor pressure vessel 
for the first time in the world. CORD, which was developed by 
the power generation (KWU) division of Siemens AG, has thus 
proved its efficacy in this field as well. 
  In addition to the reactor pressure vessel, all four 
circulation loops and the reactor water purification and 
residual heat removal system in the Swedish Oskarshamn 1 nuclear 
power station (442 megawatts) were decontaminated in 13 days. 
The test results available to date show that well over 99.6 
percent of the radioactivity was flushed out, in other words 
that the average decontamination factor was much greater than 
200. 
  This process makes it possible to convert all the chemicals 
involved into carbon dioxide and water without residue, even 
while the decontamination work is still under way. On 
completion of decontamination, therefore, the water reacquires 
demineralized water quality. The dissolved cations and 
radioactivity have been removed by the ion exchanger filter in 
the reactor water purification system, thus requiring no 
additional ion exchanger. Once the reactor pressure vessel had 
been hosed out with high-pressure water, it showed only a 
"residual wipe-off activity" of about 4 Bq/sq.cm. The dose rate 
at the bottom of the vessel was lowered by more than 20 mSv/h to 
under 0.02 mSv/h, and this extremely low radiation level now 
makes it possible to carry out the relevant tests and repair 
work. 
  Following the positive results obtained with CORD, 
Siemens-KWU has been commissioned to undertake a similar job in 
Finland, where the 300-cu.m primary system of the Lovlisa 
nuclear power station is scheduled for decontamination in August 
1994.

<F P=106> [Steen Voigt report: "Auken Brings Together Eastern </F>
Europe's Top Environmental People"] 
  [Text] The environment ministers of all the countries of 
Eastern Europe will meet in Copenhagen in June at the invitation 
of Svend Auken to discuss "soft loans" for environmental 
investments. The aim is to accelerate environmental work in the 
East. 
  It is of crucial importance for improved and increased 
environmental work in the countries of Eastern Europe that they 
have access to cheaper forms of finance for their environmental 
investments -- in water and air purification installations, for 
example. 
  So said Environment Minister Svend Auken (Social Democratic 
Party) who has invited all his East European counterparts to 
Copenhagen for the first three days in June to discuss "soft 
loans" in the environmental field in order to exert pressure on 
international banks. 
  The environment ministers from the three Baltic countries, 
Russia, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, 
Belarus, Moldova, and Ukraine have accepted the invitation. 
This is the fist time that so many East European environment 
ministers will have been brought together. 
  "Like the countries of Eastern Europe Denmark is tired of 
the 
fact that reports are written and large-scale investigations are 
carried out without anything coming of them," Svend Auken said 
yesterday when he announced the meeting. "Now we want to show 
that something can be done." 
  Svend Auken has long been pressing the EBRD [European Bank 
for Reconstruction and Development], for example, to grant 
cheaper "soft loans" with lower interest rates, longer repayment 
periods, and a repayment-free period if the loan is for 
environmental purposes. 
  Today international banks do not have different interest 
rates for purely commercial loans and environmental loans. This 
is slowing down the environmental work in Eastern Europe whose 
countries with their weak currencies need an immediate economic 
return rather than an environmental return from their 
investments. 
  "The idea behind the meeting is to influence the 
decisionmaking processes of the banks, but also to make this 
into a major issue when we meet in Sofia next year at the 
pan-European environment conference," Auken said. 
  Representatives of the EBRD, the World Bank, The European 
Investment Bank, and the EU [European Union] Commission have 
also been invited to the meeting in Copenhagen.

<F P=106> [Article by Kaj Skaaning: "The Energy Minister Puts the </F>
Environment Above a Free Energy Market" -- first paragraph is 
BERLINGSKE TIDENDE introduction] 
  [Text] The energy report: The environment must not suffer 
when there is energy liberalization, writes the energy minister 
in the energy policy report that will be submitted to the 
Folketing on Thursday [21 April]. 
  The Danish Government will help support a broader 
liberalization of European energy markets only if some 
significant prerequisites are fulfilled. 
  According to the energy policy report, which Energy Minister 
Jann Sjursen (Christian People's Party) will submit to the 
Folketing on Thursday, the government will emphasize three main 
points. 
  First, there should be a clear connection between an opening 
of energy markets and concern for environmental protection. 
Second, transitional arrangements should be ensured -- not least 
with regard to the young Danish natural gas sector. Third, the 
subsidiarity principle should be maintained. 
  "It is the government's position that the liberalization 
proposals not be dealt with in isolation but be seen within a 
greater energy policy context in the European Union [EU]," 
Sjursen will tell the Folketing on Thursday. 
<H5>  EU's Environmental Requirements Should Be Made the Same </H5>
  He believes that special emphasis should be put on a greater 
effort in the environmental area. A liberalization of the 
electricity and gas markets must not be promoted at the cost of 
more environmentally sound forms of energy production. Increased 
competition should be followed up with joint and more ambitious 
EU environmental requirements so competitive conditions will 
become the same. 
  Among other things, the government will work for a common 
CO[.sub]2[/] excise fee within the EU, but it will also work 
to ensure that the liberalization proposals establish only 
overarching principles. 
  The working out [of details] and their regulation should be 
left to member countries. 
  Denmark is ahead of other countries when it comes to 
reducing 
CO[.sub]2[/], and in his report Sjursen sticks to a Danish 
goal of a 20-percent reduction of CO[.sub]2[/] emissions by 
2005 in relation to 1988. And he made no effort to conceal the 
fact that special emphasis would be placed on energy consumption 
by industry. 
<H5>  Industry Must Bear the Brunt </H5>
  "The government feels it is crucial that emphasis be put on 
making industry's efficiency measures in the area of energy 
consumption more cost effective. There is still in fact a 
significant potential for further efficiency measures in 
industry. If this potential is not utilized, then households 
will have to institute even more expensive measures to achieve 
the goal while relatively cheap savings possibilities in 
industry remain unutilized," Sjursen says in his report. 
  Sjursen believes that environmental and energy excise fees 
can be implemented without reducing competitiveness. Excise fees 
should be behavioral in nature and the proceeds be returned to 
industries "in a compensatory fashion." 
  But the average Danish consumer of energy as well is to be 
made to alter his behavior. A committee has come out with a 
number of recommendations for a greater effort to get consumers 
of electrical heat to convert to more energy-efficient forms of 
heating. 
  "The government will now work to see to it that a general 
agreement is reached between the energy companies and the 
authorities about converting electrical heat," writes Sjursen, 
who also believes that in the area of realizing savings on 
electricity, "there is still a significant potential that can 
realized."

Ecofin Council To Debate Reduction of Taxes on Biofuels on 6 
June--Creation of a Scientific Group in France"] 
  [Text] Brussels/Tours, 10 May 94 (AGENCE EUROPE) -- As 
part of the first European Forum on Biofuels, the European 
Commissioner with responsibility for taxation, Mrs Christiane 
Scrivener, has announced that the Ecofin [Economic/Financial] 
Council will examine the plan for a reduction of taxes on 
biofuels at its meeting on 6 June. 
  Meanwhile, the French government has set up a scientific 
group that will attempt to promote the development of biofuels 
along with the concerned ministries (Industry, Environment, 
Higher Education and Research, Agriculture and Fisheries), 
announced Agriculture Minister Jean Puech, as he inaugurated the 
Forum. The new group "Agriculture for Chemistry and Energy" 
(Agrice), to be chaired by Philippe Mangin, brings together 
representatives of the National Institute for Agronomic Research 
(INRA), national agricultural trade unions and industry. Mr 
Puech added that "the industries concerned by the future of our 
agriculture, as well as potential customers for the technologies 
being explored also wish to take part. Two major French 
enterprises, Total and Rhone-Poulenc, are currently representing 
these interests". France has chosen "an intelligent alternative 
to traditional set-aside, namely, industrial set-aside", he 
added.

<F P=106> [Jean-Francois Augereau report: "COGEMA Will Be Able To </F>
Reprocess 1,600 Tonnes of Nuclear Fuel Per Year"] 
  [Text] The government has just given the go-ahead to the 
opening of the latest units in the second nuclear fuel 
reprocessing plant in La Hague (Manche). This new unit, with an 
annual capacity of 800 tonnes, should come into production this 
summer and reach its nominal power in 1996. It will be entirely 
dedicated to fuel from the EDF [French Electricity Company] 
power stations. 
  The General Nuclear Materials Company (COGEMA) has just 
received from Industry Minister Gerard Longuet and Environment 
Minister Michel Barnier permission to start up the latest units 
of its new UP2-800 irradiated fuel reprocessing plant in La 
Hague (Manche). This decision is the latest stage in the program 
to extend the reprocessing capabilities of the La Hague plant 
launched in 1979. 
  Henceforth COGEMA has two factories, each with a capacity of 
800 tonnes, on this nuclear site situated at the extremity of 
the La Manche departement, a few kilometers from Cherbourg. The 
first, UP3, which came into service on 23 August 1990, is an 
ultramodern plant, valued at 27.8 billion francs [Fr], the cost 
of which was virtually completely funded by the contracts which 
27 foreign electricity companies have signed with COGEMA for the 
reprocessing of around 7,000 tonnes of nuclear fuel. 
<H5>  EDF Contract </H5>
  The implementation of these contracts, which has already 
begun, had prompted some anger in November 1992 when France 
delivered 1.5 tonnes of plutonium to the Japanese authorities. 
Between now and the year 2000, around 20 tonnes of plutonium 
should leave for Japan, because it is the very function of 
reprocessing nuclear fuel to sort through the "ashes" left by 
the reactors to find the reusable pure material (96 percent 
uranium and 1 percent plutonium) in the waste proper (3 percent). 
  Although foreign reprocessing requirements are fulfilled by 
the operation of UP3, at present the only factory in the world 
capable of reprocessing on an industrial scale, EDF's 
requirements should be fulfilled by the very new UP2-800 plant. 
Moreover, EDF has signed a contract with COGEMA for the 
reprocessing of 8,400 tonnes of fuel from its pressurized water 
reactor (PWR) nuclear power stations. 
  Around Fr30 billion has been spent (the difference in price 
between the two factories is partly due to taking account of 
inflation) to equip this new unit, which was built on the 
remains of the former UP-2 plant which reprocessed its first 
barrel of fuel in June 1966, but which experienced real problems 
during its conversion for the reprocessing the PWR fuel in the 
eighties. It then only slowly reached its nominal production 
capability set at 400 tonnes per year. 
<H5>  Installation Rethought </H5>
  UP2-800 is, however, an installation which has been entirely 
rethought, virtually an identical copy of UP3, but which has 
benefited from the experience of this factory which, so far, has 
reprocessed a little more than 1,900 tonnes of foreign used 
fuel. But it differs from it slightly in that in the future it 
will have to reprocess relatively limited tonnages of other 
kinds of fuel known as mixed uranium-plutonium fuels (MOX). 
  Taking this MOX reprocessing into account in the UP2-800 
concept made it necessary to think in advance about process 
modifications because of the presence of bigger quantities of 
plutonium in the installation. Therefore, there is already a 
plan to build a factory known as R-4, which will make it 
possible, in particular, to run that process. It could start 
around the year 2000 and, according to COGEMA, presupposes "a 
technological leap forward if we wish to keep reprocessing costs 
down." 
  This concern seems particularly legitimate because, after 
the 
lifting of many legal obstacles, Britain is starting up its 
Thorp plant worth 2.8 billion pounds (around Fr25 billion) 
situated in Sellafield in northwest Britain. But, although 
COGEMA is no longer alone on the reprocessing market because of 
this competition, the announcement of the launch of UP2-800 will 
undoubtedly revive the controversy over the value of 
reprocessing used fuel.

<F P=106> [Article by Dankwart Guratzsch: "Another Dioxin Alarm in </F>
Germany: PVC Production Generates Seveso Poison in Previously 
Unknown Quantities -- Inquiry in Lower Saxony"] 
  [Text] The federal and land environment ministries are 
alarmed: A new dioxin hazard, the extent of which is still 
unknown, appears to be threatening the Federal Republic of 
Germany. 
  Yesterday, the Lower Saxony Environment Ministry ordered an 
inspection of the soil and waterways in the area surrounding the 
Jadebusen and the PVC [polyvinyl chloride] producer ICI's works, 
including mussels and sediment, for contamination by chemical 
toxins, including the Seveso poison, dioxin. 
  Federal Environment Ministry spokesman Cay Frimuth told DIE 
WELT: "Dioxins occur in PVC production in quantities of which we 
were previously unaware and which have shocked us." Armin 
Basler, head of the Chemicals Safety Department, added: "To 
date, everyone has been pointing to the waste incinerators as 
the presumed major dischargers of dioxin, but now we are seeing 
that emissions from production are much higher." 
  Lower Saxony's Environment Minister, Monika Greifahn (SPD 
[Social Democratic Party of Germany]), who was the first to 
trace the poison to its source, mentioned an additional ground 
for concern: "Exactly why and at which point in the production 
process dioxins occur remains a complete mystery." 
  The realization "that these substances are also transported 
in water" was recent, said Greifahn. 
  The high dioxin content in the flue gases discharged by a 
Hoesch AG sintering plant had already come to light in North 
Rhine-Westphalia -- an environmental scandal that has been 
keeping a board of inquiry set up by the land parliament in 
Duesseldorf busy ever since. The allegation is that Environment 
Minister Klaus Matthiesen (SPD) failed to make public his 
knowledge about the dioxin discharger. 
  The map of the Federal Republic is now being systematically 
scanned by computers to establish the emission zones of the 10 
German PVC manufacturers. The sludge "paths" must also be 
traced. 
  The Wilhelmshaven works alone has been piling 400 tonnes a 
year of highly contaminated sludge onto Lower Saxony's hazardous 
waste dumps: Its dry substance contains record quantities of 
400,000 nanograms of the superpoison per kilogram. There is 
currently no technological solution at all for controlling this 
new source of poison. Work on initial preventive strategies is 
scheduled for completion by the summer.

<F P=106> [Article by Michael Wendel: "Black Gold From Plastic Waste: </F>
Plastics Recycling Will Channel Packaging Floods -- Pilot Plant 
Starts Work This Week"] 
  [Text] About 10 million tonnes of plastics and elastomers 
are produced and processed throughout the year in the German 
plastics industry. In 1993, more than 280,000 tonnes ended up 
in the yellow Dual System (DSD) collection sacks as packaging 
waste. DSD managers expect 440,000 tonnes of plastic packaging 
bearing the green dot by the end of 1994, the plastics mountain 
for recycling being expected to swell to 750,000 tonnes by the 
end of 1986 -- much more than the recycling capacity currently 
available in Germany. However, the much-prophesied waste flood 
by no means rattles the top DSD people, who are temporarily 
afflicted by tight finances and reprocessing bottlenecks. They 
are placing their trust in a confident promise made by Plastics 
Manufacturing Industry Association chairman Albrecht Eckell: 
"The problem of plastics recycling will have been cracked by 
the end of 1998." 
  The magic formula is reprocessing into raw materials. 
Instead of just melting plastics down to make park benches, 
flowerpots, and noise insulation panels, yogurt pots, detergent 
bottles, and similar waste will be used as sources of raw 
materials. This week, the BASF chemicals group (on whose board 
Eckell sits) is bringing on stream a pilot plant in 
Ludwigshafen, where ground-down plastic waste will be liquefied 
at 400 degrees Celsius then split into oils and gases. Up to 
950 grams of petrochemical products will be distilled in this 
way from every 1,000 grams of plastic and used as raw materials 
in the BASF factories. The PVC [polyvinyl chloride] component 
will be separated out as Javelle water and processed in the 
hydrochloric acid works. The plant, claims a BASF brochure, 
will operate without pressure in a closed system, so it will 
discharge "virtually no emissions." 
  The 40-million German mark [DM] pilot plant has an annual 
recycling capacity of 15,000 tonnes. The follow-up model, which 
is scheduled to come on stream early in the summer of 1996, is 
of a different caliber: It can reprocess up to 300,000 tonnes 
of contaminated, unsorted DSD packaging -- sufficient volume, 
together with the VEBA [United Electricity and Mining Works AG] 
coal-oil plant in Bottrop (170,000 tonnes) and the RWE 
[Rhineland- Westphalian Electricity Works] plant (70,000 
tonnes), to meet the requirements of the Packaging Regulation 
until that date. 
  The new industrial-scale technology admittedly has one 
drawback: These expensive plants -- BASF's investment will 
amount to DM300 million -- must keep running, so they need a 
constant plastic waste input. This does away with the incentive 
to avoid creating packaging waste. In order to ensure supplies 
of DSD material, BASF is also working with the Cologne-based 
Otto Group, whose annual sales of DM1.3 billion make it one of 
the giants on the waste disposal market. Group chairman Otto 
answers objections that central plastics recycling will speed up 
the polarization process in the industry by pointing out that 
small and medium-sized disposal firms could participate in a 
"nationwide project" at 15 regional logistical centers. 
  Plastics recycling does not come cheap. The Dual System pays 
BASF DM325/tonne -- about a 10th of the cost of producing a 
tonne of recycled raw materials, collection, sorting, and 
separating the packaging waste taking the lion's share. One 
tonne of crude oil costs DM200 on the world market. In the 
ultimate analysis, the consumer has to pay for it as well at the 
checkout -- the "green dot" is what makes this possible.

  [Text] Frankfurt-based Hoechst AG has discontinued CFC 
[chlorofluorocarbon] production. The chemicals group's 
Stammwerk plant, which has already produced 8,100 tonnes of 
these ozone-damaging substances in the current year, was shut 
down on Thursday and will be demolished for scrap. A smaller 
production plant at Hoechst Brazil will cease production by 1995 
at the latest, the company has announced. Used CFC's will no 
longer be reprocessed by Hoechst in the future, but broken down 
into their chemical components. There is thus only one CFC 
producer left in Germany, Solvay in Hannover. A Solvay 
spokesman has said that this firm, too, intends discontinuing 
production within the next few weeks. Last year, Solvay produced 
21,000 tonnes of CFC's. 
  Hoechst, which enjoyed 40 percent of the domestic and 5 
percent of the world market, states that it is the first 
producer in the world to cease CFC production. It used to 
produce up to 90,000 tonnes a year. The group decided in 1989 
to cease production, which will be banned in Germany from 1995 
onwards. Chlorinated CFC's, which are in widespread use as 
coolants in refrigerators and air-conditioning systems, 
constitute the main threat to the ozone layer, which protects 
the earth against ultraviolet solar radiation, at altitudes 
between 15 and 20 kilometers. The chlorine contained in these 
substances destroys the ozone chemically. Even now, a million 
tonnes of CFC's are still concealed in chilling and 
air-conditioning systems and plastic foams the world over. 
  Hoechst has recently begun producing the ozone-friendly 
R134a 
coolant as a substitute for chlorofluorocarbons. 
Environmentalists, however, complain that this substance still 
contributes to the greenhouse effect. There was an explosion in 
the new R134a production plant a few weeks after it entered 
service, in mid-March. Since then the plant has been at a 
standstill by order of the authorities.

  [Text] The German reflyable science satellite Astro-Spas is 
currently being fitted out for its next mission at the German 
Aerospace AG (Munich-based DASA) Satellite Systems Division. 
The German Space Agency, DARA, and DASA have presented the 
satellite's new instruments and tasks at a news conference in 
Munich: The science satellite, bearing the name Crista-Spas, is 
scheduled to begin its "inspection" of the upper earth 
atmosphere in October this year. 
  Crista-Spas has the job of studying the upper earth 
atmosphere (10 to 150 km). The photochemical, energetic, and 
dynamic processes that take place in the upper atmosphere are of 
great significance to life on earth. An understanding of these 
processes and the behavior of the atmosphere is central to an 
understanding of current environmental issues, such as the ozone 
problem and the much-feared climate problem. 
  The measurements will be performed with two instruments: 
Crista and Mahrsi. Crista (cryogenic infrared spectrometer and 
telescope for the atmosphere) is an infrared measuring device 
with unprecedented three-dimensional resolution: 2.5 km 
vertical and 500 by 600 km horizontal. 
  It was developed to study small-scale dynamic structures in 
the upper atmosphere that have hitherto eluded measurement by 
satellite. Small-scale structures in the several hundred to 
several thousand kilometer range have only been detected to date 
by rocket, balloon, or ground measurements. However, these only 
gave local "snapshots," with the result that very little is 
known of the frequency of small-scale structures in time and 
space. Crista will make the first-ever global measurement of 
these structures and attempt to determine their frequency. 
  The measurements performed by Crista will be complemented by 
Mahrsi (middle-atmosphere high-resolution spectrograph 
investigation), a device for measuring radicals in the 
atmosphere. Mahrsi's main task consists in the global definition 
of the vertical density profiles of the hydroxyl radical and 
nitrogen oxide with 2-kilometer resolution at an altitude of 40 
to 150 km. The experiment will also provide information as to 
the neutral density and temperature in the atmosphere. 
  Responsibility for the development of the experiments, the 
scientific preparations for the mission, and the analysis of the 
parameters recorded is shared by the Bergland University in 
Wuppertal (Crista) and the Naval Research Laboratory, 
Washington, D.C. (Mahrsi). 
  The third Astro-Spas mission is scheduled for the fall of 
1995 and will be a second flight by the Orfeus and Imaps 
telescopes, which are being modified and enhanced in the 
meantime in the light of experience acquired during their first 
flight. A fourth mission -- with the Crista/Mahrsi payload -- 
has been firmly booked for fall 1996.

  [Text] Dortmund-based VEW [United Westphalian Electricity 
Works] AG will work with Siemens AG of Berlin and Munich in the 
future on thermal waste disposal, and an agreement to this 
effect has recently been signed. As the two corporations 
announced on 16 March, the purpose of working together is to 
make greater use of the low-temperature carbonization process 
developed by Siemens-KWU [Power Generation Division], an 
environment-compatible technology for disposing of domestic 
waste residue, domestic-type industrial waste, and sewage sludge 
that cannot otherwise be avoided or recycled. In the view of 
both parties, it represents the best method of meeting the 
strict requirements of ecological and economical waste residue 
reprocessing. Low-temperature carbonization makes for a 
particularly high recycling quota and an exceptional energy 
output. 
  Siemens and VEW stated that working together would primarily 
enable them to offer the local authorities responsible for waste 
disposal, principally in the catchment area served by VEW and 
its east German subsidiary, Halle-based MEAG [expansion 
unknown], not just partial solutions but a complete package 
comprising everything from planning, building work, and 
financing to the operation of thermal disposal plants. 
  In low-temperature carbonization, residual waste is 
converted 
into commercial substances and electricity, virtually without 
residue and effluent problems, by a combination of 
low-temperature carbonization and, subsequently, 
high-temperature incineration. Organic pollutants, such as 
dioxins and furans, are safely destroyed, and inorganic 
pollutants are securely bound in a hot-melt granulate. The 
leach-resistant granulate can then be used as a substitute for 
sand or gravel in, for example, road building. 
  A low-temperature carbonization plant with an annual 
throughput of 150,000 tonnes of waste residue salvages an annual 
average of 6,750 tonnes of iron and over 700 tonnes of aluminum, 
which can be smelted without further processing and recycled as 
high-grade steel and aluminum products. The same plant also 
generates up to 75 million kilowatt-hours of electricity. For 
every tonne of domestic waste, no more than 3 kilograms of 
reaction products from the flue gas dust collector has to end up 
on the hazardous waste dump, the equivalent of only 0.3 percent 
of the original quantity at the very most.

<F P=106> [Interview with Oskar Lafontaine, SPD deputy chairman and </F>
minister-president of the Saarland, by Helmut Loelhoeffel; place 
and date not given: "Those Who Do the Right Thing by the 
Environment Will Be Rewarded"] 
  [Text] Loelhoeffel: Your name is synonymous with 
the social democratic concept of "ecological renewal of 
industrial society." The SPD's government program quite 
intentionally focuses on work, social security, and economics. 
Why is it that you allow the ecological component to be 
shortchanged? 
  Lafontaine: Ecological modernization is a pivotal 
reform project as far as we are concerned. Work, social 
security, and ecological renewal are not contradictions by any 
means. We wish to combine work and the ecology and make it clear 
that ecological renewal will result in more jobs and that it is 
a social task our society must deal with, because intolerable 
ecological conditions cannot be permitted to exist from a social 
point of view. 
  Loelhoeffel: But the Greens and the environmental 
groups are saying that the draft program does not contain very 
much solid language aside from some general declarations of 
intent. They doubt that the SPD is serious about new initiatives 
on the environment. There even are critical voices from inside 
the SPD itself. 
  Lafontaine: From the point of view of the Greens I 
can understand that criticism. They are a political party in 
competition with us and they would like to cast doubt on our 
credibility on ecological issues. What is more, they do not want 
to come out as they did in the last Bundestag election when they 
failed to gain any seats. By now the voters have a very good 
idea of where the SPD stands on environmental issues. We already 
stated in the last Bundestag election campaign that an SPD 
government would take decisive steps aimed at ecological renewal 
which would be markedly different from the practices of the Kohl 
government. One of the central projects still is an ecological 
tax reform. 
  Loelhoeffel: The draft program merely refers in 
general terms to an energy tax, however. Michael Mueller, the 
spokesman of the SPD parliamentary group, and others deplore the 
lack of a clear statement on higher mineral oil taxes for 
example. One cannot leave the transportation sector out of the 
equation. After all, it accounts for about 25 percent of energy 
consumption. 
  Lafontaine: Unfortunately both the public and 
large segments of the political parties still do not understand 
what ecological tax reform is all about. It is not designed to 
provide funds for this or that project; it is not a way of 
making people pay more taxes but a way of setting new price 
signals. The principal idea behind this reform is to place less 
of a load on work and to raise taxes on the consumption of 
energy and materials harmful to the environment. This will 
create incentives to use less energy and to put new products on 
the market which conform to environmental standards. Those who 
do the right thing by the environment will be rewarded. 
Employees will have more money in their pockets because income 
taxes or other payroll deductions imposed by law will be cut. 
  Loelhoeffel: Why put the blame on the public 
rather than admit weak points in selling the program? 
  Lafontaine: I have seen 100 headlines which read 
"fuel taxes to rise." But I have not seen a single headline 
referring to the ecological tax reform which said "deep income 
tax cuts" or "cuts in payroll deductions." Not a one. The media 
almost always focus on the seemingly negative aspects, and those 
that are positive are suppressed. And that does harm to this 
important reform project. 
  Loelhoeffel: But it is difficult to understand 
your project, if one cannot gauge its consequences. 
  Lafontaine: The consequences are that there is 
less strain on the environment and that the working population 
is relieved of unnecessary burdens--and that creates more jobs. 
Employees get to keep more of what they earn and can decide on 
their own what they wish to spend and consume. That needs to be 
understood because we need to obtain the approval of the public 
for this ecological tax reform. Better environmental policy can 
only succeed and the proposed lessening of the strain on the 
environment can only be achieved if the majority of the voters 
is for it. Unfortunately a good many environmentalists fail to 
see the connection. Those who would like to see the price of one 
liter of gasoline raised to 5 marks [DM] may salve their 
conscience. They may even gain the support of a number of 
delegates to a party congress. But they make it impossible to 
win a majority of the voters over to their position. 
  Loelhoeffel: Just the same, we would like to hear 
some real numbers. Who will have to pay how much when? 
  Lafontaine: It would be both irresponsible and 
unwise from the point of view of economics to decide on scope 
and timing without taking the economic situation into account. 
For instance, the decisions reached would depend on whether the 
automobile industry were doing well or doing poorly. Many other 
factors would also play a role. That applies to all decisions 
which have economic and social consequences. 
  Loelhoeffel: What other factors contribute to the 
SPD's credibility with regard to environmental protection? 
  Lafontaine: The second important point in addition 
to ecological tax reform is that we believe the production of 
electric power from nuclear reactors is untenable and therefore 
wish gradually to relinquish that option. In talks I have had 
with the environmental groups I got the feeling that this 
particular demand for which many protest demonstrations were 
held over the years has been all but checked off because it has 
long since been included in all the wish lists. Real progress in 
the nuclear energy field alone provides an ecological 
justification for a change of government in Bonn. The third 
point I would like to mention is the restructuring of research 
policy which needs to be focused on the environment. We have to 
build a bridge into the solar age, i.e. all technologies which 
conserve energy, lessen the strain on the environment, and 
develop renewable forms of energy, including the use of solar 
and wind energy, must be supported in entirely different ways 
from now on. 
  Loelhoeffel: The current version of the SPD 
government program puts the ecological tax reform off to the 
time "European Union [EU]-wide regulations" have been adopted. 
That sounds like procrastinating a solution and shifting 
responsibilities. What is it that the SPD can and will push 
through? 
  Lafontaine: We have a first draft in hand. It goes 
without saying that we will not wait until every EU country has 
understood the need for ecological tax reforms. I am in full 
agreement with Rudolf Scharping on that point. Let me remind you 
of the debate on the catalytic converter and lead-free gasoline. 
If we had waited then until all the EC countries availed 
themselves of that technology, it would have been introduced on 
a Europewide scale at a much later date. We took the lead and 
the result was that the technology spread all over Europe. As a 
consequence, new jobs were created here in Germany as well. 
  Loelhoeffel: Is there a need to change, clarify or 
augment other passages of the ecology segment of the present 
draft? Do you yourself think more forceful language is needed? 
  Lafontaine: There is a debate on speed limits. The 
present draft states that we must have speed limits that are 
ecologically suitable and contextually meaningful. There is a 
specific reference to the need for a 30-kilometer speed limit in 
residential areas. Independent of the debate on speed limits as 
such our principal aim is to make progress on the introduction 
of new environmental technologies. The most important item on 
the agenda are automobiles that conserve gas by using two to 
three liters per 100 kilometers. 
  Loelhoeffel: Are you giving any thought to 
dictating fuel consumption limits to the automobile industry? Or 
how else do you propose to bring about the development of more 
efficient and ecologically friendly engines? 
  Lafontaine: I am opposed to more regulations, and 
that goes for the ecology as well. The main thing is to cut down 
on energy consumption. That, after all, is the political goal. 
The political establishment should exercise restraint with 
regard to setting exact technical standards on specific 
environmental targets. That should be left to the technicians 
and to competition. That is why I am in favor of restricting 
ourselves to achieving the goal of lower consumption. And that 
is where the price signal comes in which we are putting up with 
the ecological tax reform.

<F P=106> [Article by Walter van Hulst: "Automobile Flywheel Saves One </F>
Third In Fuel"] 
  [Text] Eindhoven -- The combination of a hybrid drive, a 
high-speed rotating drive wheel, a combustion engine, and a 
continuous variable transmission (CVT), can save 30 to 40 
percent of fuel in private cars without any loss of performance 
or comfort. 
  E. Spijker, who hopes to obtain his doctorate at the 
Technical University of Eindhoven on Friday 15 April, includes 
in his thesis solutions for the regulation and control of such a 
hybrid transmission in combination with a CVT, using some 
electronic measurement and control engineering but based mainly 
on mechanics. Spijker conducted his research in collaboration 
with Van Doorne's Transmission in Tilburg. In the Traffic 
Technology Group's laboratory, run by Professor Dr. Ir. R. 
Kriens in Eindhoven, a working model is being tested. According 
to Spijker, enough experience has now been obtained to be able 
to build a moving prototype. There will probably be a follow-up 
to his research. 
  The hybrid transmission, when combined with the CVT, is more 
or less an alternative to the electric car, which has a short 
driving radius and is really only suitable for use in urban 
areas. The research carried out in Eindhoven is aimed at the 
curbing both consumption by and emissions from the ordinary 
gas-driven car. 
  In the past, much research has already been carried out on 
both the CVT and the use of a drive wheel, and also on a 
combination of the two. Initially the CVT was known for its 
rather weak transmission, certainly when combined with a drive 
wheel. Van Doorne's Transmission has, however, developed it to 
become an extremely dependable technology. 
  Control and regulation of the combined CVT and drive wheel 
was another problem, partially due to vibration and possible 
peak torque. Such a flywheel continues turning when something 
goes wrong. Allowing smooth changes in revolutions was also 
quite a job. Today's spoilt driver is, after all, used to a 
vehicle that does not vibrate. 
  The research institute CCM in Nuenen, collaborates with 
Novem 
on a drive wheel for use in buses and trains. Dr. Ir. F. 
Thoolen, the company's project leader, obtained his doctorate at 
the end of last year at the Technical University in Eindhoven on 
an electronic regulation. The CCM design is at the moment 
undergoing endurance tests, the results of which are expected by 
the coming Spring. In his design Spijker uses a 
fiber-reinforced plastic drive wheel developed by CCM which is 
light and small, and suitable for very high revolutions, but he 
solves the problem of regulation mechanically. He is very 
enthusiastic about the practical applications. It will be 
possible to drive a prototype within a few years, without any 
space problems. "The whole system has already been built once 
into a Volvo 480 which did indeed have a very sloping hood. But 
that was not a problem. The only problem was the air filter." 
  The Eindhoven Traffic Technology group is primarily focused 
on the themes of safely and the environment. According to 
Spijker and his supervisor, Ir. R. van der Graaf, as far as the 
environment is concerned, the automobile industry refuses to 
cooperate when it involves long-term, speculative research. 
Competition is cutthroat and investment has to produce quick 
returns, particularly now that the sector is in a deep 
depression. A disappointment for the Kriens group was the 
withdrawal two years ago of Volvo as a research partner. But 
the Eindhoven Technical University has decided to continue by 
itself in the field of variable transmission, wherever possible 
with the support of third parties such as Novem [Netherlands 
Association of Energy and the Environment].

<F P=106> [Article by Thomas Lerner and Lars-Ingmar Karlsson: "Ban on </F>
Unleaded Expected"] 
  [Text] Finance Minister Bo Lundgren and the government are 
considering tightening the environmental requirements for 
gasoline. In a year there could be a ban on selling ordinary 
unleaded gasoline, and only the less environmentally hazardous 
class 2 variant would be allowed. 
  In a DAGENS NYHETER interview on the connection between the 
economy and the environment, Bo Lundgren took a generally 
positive view on stricter economic control in order to reduce 
the environmental problems. But he clearly stakes out the 
preconditions. One of the principal demands is that competition 
must not be distorted, and he uses the environmental 
classification of unleaded gasoline as an example. 
  "If there were only two producers selling the new 
environmental class 2, a complete halt would be wrong. In that 
case it would be better to have a tax refund for it." 
<H5>  Waiting for the European Union </H5>
  Today all companies sell environmental class 3 (in principle 
ordinary unleaded gas). The environmentally better class 2 has 
been sold only by OK, Uno-X, and Texaco since last year. 
  But now that the other companies are also expected to start 
selling environmental class 2 as soon as within a year, why then 
be satisfied with a tax refund? the finance minister reasons. 
  "When there are good alternatives to a product one cannot 
introduce administrative bans," in Lundgren's opinion. 
  The government does not yet believe it has all the facts in 
order to submit a proposal for environmental classification of 
gasoline. The study was ready a year ago, to be sure, but the EU 
[European Union] must also have time to have its say. 
  "I could very well imagine that Sweden might be a pioneer in 
environmental classification. It could be implemented at the 
coming turn of the year," says Bo Lundgren, but points out that 
the EU must first agree to the Swedish way. 
  Bo Lundgren and the nonsocialist government have been the 
subject of harsh criticism for not using economic means of 
control as a way toward a better environment. A toothless 
surcharge on cadmium in commercial fertilizer and higher taxes 
on leaded gasoline are more or less all the government has 
accomplished, environmental researcher and Social Democrat Per 
Kageson recently wrote in DAGENS NYHETER. 
  "Starting with what we had, we have done a lot," Lundgren 
counters. 
<H5>  Higher Energy Taxes </H5>
  "Look at our reduction of the carbon dioxide tax for 
industry. Keeping a high energy tax for industry would both 
create economic problems in Sweden and aggravate the global 
environment. Our energy tax reform prevents Swedish companies 
from becoming established abroad." 
  Somewhat surprisingly, Bo Lundgren can very well imagine 
that 
the energy taxes on industry might be raised. He can even accept 
that the distribution is changed so that the households assume a 
comparatively smaller share of the burden and industry a larger 
one. But it is not yet time for that, he says. All countries, at 
least in the EU, must also participate. 
  "If I get the chance, I will work for an orientation toward 
more environmentally based taxes." 
  Will you push these issues in the EU? 
  "Yes, if I get the opportunity. I think we should have been 
able to do more with the coordination internationally than we 
have." 
  So how does one switch taxes from labor to environmentally 
hazardous activities, for example? The environmental movement 
demands such a change in taxation and the EU has also begun to 
discuss it now. 
  "Many overrate the opportunities for lowering taxes on 
labor. 
The tax base for work is much broader than the one for the 
environment," Lundgren says and describes the difficulties 
created by this imbalance. 
  "A cut in the employer's tax by 5 percent, for example, 
costs 
20 billion kronor. That is a great deal compared with all 
environmental and energy taxes," the finance minister says and 
stresses that he is by no means an opponent of this thinking. 
Here as well Sweden must keep pace with other countries. 
  However, it is probably not primarily the tax on work that 
will be switched to "green" taxes. 
  "I think one should begin by lowering the value-added tax. 
The damaging effect of the employer's tax could be tackled in a 
different way. It is more difficult to do so with the 
value-added tax." 
<H5>  New Study </H5>
  Both the change in taxation and other links between 
taxes/fees and the environment will be analyzed in a new study. 
Bo Lundgren therefore prefers to wait with inflexible opinions 
on what is best. 
  "I have to think about what I am prepared to do in order to 
have whiter snow at my farm in Scania," he says and remembers 
that the snow sparkled more in his youth, when the environmental 
destruction had not progressed so far.

  [Text] Sofia, February 17 (BTA) -- A three-day 
Bulgarian-British seminar on AIDS started here today. A 
delegation of five British specialists led by Prof. Nicholas 
Day, head of the Institute of Public Health, Cambridge, will 
deliver lectures on the social aspects of the disease to 50 
Bulgarian specialists. There are four major topics to be 
addressed: Registering the HIV-positive and those who have 
developed the full symptoms of the disease, exerting control 
over AIDS patients, the way society treats them, and statistical 
modelling. 
  The seminar has been organized within the Tempus Programme. 
Its coordinator for Bulgaria, Prof. Ivan Chernozemski, told a 
BTA reporter that they are seeking to modernize Bulgarian 
education and the operation of social medicine departments and 
to improve prophylaxis. 
  According to the National Preventive Medicine Centre, to 
date 
121 individuals have tested HIV-positive in Bulgaria. 24 of 
them have developed the symptoms of the disease and 18 have 
died. However, the No AIDS Foundation believes that the number 
of those infected with the virus is much greater, reaching 
between 800 and 1600. About 4 million of Bulgaria's 8.5-million 
population have taken the test so far. Bulgaria ranks 8th in 
Europe by the number of HIV- infected. Eleven infants were born 
by HIV-infected mothers. One of them tested positive, four are 
healthy, the others are kept under observation. The virus has 
spread most widely in Burgas and Gabrovo, but Sofia and the 
Black Sea resorts should not be ignored, either, said Associate 
Professor Zdravka Argirova, head of the Central AIDS Laboratory. 
  Unlike other European countries, in most of the cases in 
Bulgaria the virus has been transmitted sexually. Of the 
HIV-positive 45 percent are between 19 and 25 years of age and 
got the virus from their sexual partners. Ever since the 
obligatory monitoring of blood and blood products for HIV was 
introduced in 1987, the blood transfusion path for transmitting 
the virus has been cut. Only 10 patients were infected in that 
way before 1987. The homosexuals are also ten, the others got 
infected in heterosexual contacts. According to Ms. Argirova, 
young people are the ones who fall into the high-risk group. 
Their lacking in sexual education is the main reason for the 
spread of the disease, doctors say.

  [Text] Plateau, Feb. (NAN) -- About 28 people have been 
confirmed dead by the Langtang north local government in Plateau 
following an outbreak of cerebro spinal meningitis (CSM) in the 
area, the NEWS AGENCY OF NIGERIA (NAN) reports. 
  A statement from the information unit of the local 
government 
explained that as a means of containing the situation, health 
authorities in the state had despatched a team of medical 
experts to the area, while the federal government had directed 
the release of 10,000 doses of vaccines for the area. 
  It said that the state's commissioner for health, Alhaji 
Usman Abdullahi, had already visited the affected area and had 
given assurance that the situation would be brought under 
control. The commissioner attributed reason for the spread of 
the disease to the absence of an epidemic prevention and 
surveillance committee at the local government area. 
  He, therefore, directed all the local governments in the 
state that had not constituted such a committee to do so without 
further delay. In the meantime, the traditional ruler of 
Langtang, Mr. Edward Zhatau, has called on both the state and 
federal governments to come to the aid of his people by 
supplying drugs and equipment to the hospitals in the area. The 
traditional ruler, who made the call when the state's health 
commissioner visited him, however, commended the efforts taken 
so far by the state government to check further spread of the 
disease.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur: The Health Ministry has set up a new 
unit to deal with the AIDS problem. 
  Health Minister Datuk Lee Kim Sai said yesterday the 
AIDS/STD 
(sexually transmitted diseases) Control Division would be placed 
under the Health Division of the ministry. 
  ``There will be seven medical officers manning the unit and 
at least one (medical officer) in each state,'' Lee said after 
presenting a RM100,000 cheque from the ministry to the Malaysian 
Council of NGO's (non-government organisations) on AIDS. 
  ``Our aim is to make every level of society aware of the 
disease,'' he said. 
  Lee said that based on worldwide trends, the number of AIDS 
cases was expected to increase but Malaysia should not 
contribute to the increase. 
  He said that there were already 179 confirmed HIV carriers 
this year. 
  ``Out of 96 people suffering from the disease, 63 people 
have 
died up to January this year,'' said Lee, adding that the 
number of HIV carriers now stood at 7,579. 
  When asked whether the government would stop importing drugs 
from British-based firms, Lee said his ministry would abide by 
the Cabinet net decision. 
  ``We will have to refer to our experts though on certain 
drugs which may not be available elsewhere,'' he said. 
  He said that five or six companies with contracts worth 
RM600 
million would be affected. 
  Lee stressed however that the ongoing contract between Yeoh 
Tiong Lay Construction and a Bristish company to build 12 
nucleus hospitals would be honoured.

  [Text] Sofia, February 22 (BTA) -- Heart disease is the 
major cause of death in this country, while respiratory diseases 
have the highest incidence, according to statistics of the 
National Health Information Centre, quoted in today's KONTINENT. 
  Heart disease and related conditions such as heart attack, 
stroke and kidney failure, have caused 60 to 63 percent of 
deaths over the last ten years, mortality figures show. The 
steady increase in their proportion is attributed to the aging 
of the Bulgarian population. Cancer, mostly of the lungs, skin, 
breasts and stomach, accounts for 13 to 14 percent of deaths and 
ranks second in death statistics. 
  Up to 5 percent of deaths are caused by respiratory 
diseases, 
which have the highest incidence in this country and constitute 
30 percent of all registered diseases every year, according to 
statistics. 
  Nervous disorders such as neuroses, phobias and depressions 
are also widespread. They have accounted for about 16 percent 
of all registered diseases over the past ten years. Doctors say 
there are four people on antidepressants to every patient who 
has seen a doctor about his or her neurosis. 
  Prophylactic checkups among school students reveal alarming 
tendencies. 53 percent of primary school students have 
scoliosis. 34 percent of secondary school students have impaired 
vision, 9 percent have neurosis and 10 percent suffer from high 
blood pressure.

  [Text] Sofia, March 15 (BTA) -- Associate Professor 
Khristo Tsvetanski, a cancer specialist working with the 
National Oncology Centre since 1970, gave BTA an interview on 
the incidence of cancer in Bulgaria. 
  Q: How does the cancer incidence in Bulgaria 
compare to European rates? 
  A: Bulgaria ranks in the medium range of cancer 
incidence, according to figures released by the Epidemiology 
Unit of the National Oncology Centre, which are also reported to 
the World Health Organization. 
  Q: Where does cancer stand among the major causes 
of early death and disability? 
  A: It ranks second after heart disease. 
  Q: Is cancer incidence in Bulgaria on the 
increase? 
  A: There is an upward trend worldwide and 
Bulgaria is no exception. I will quote again figures provided 
by our (epidemiology) unit. In 1985, 20,881 developed cancer, 
bringing the total number of cancer patients to 132,374. The 
1990 figures are 22,021 and 153,651, respectively. In 1992, 
22,956 Bulgarians developed cancer, bringing the total to 
139,243. 
  Q: Which types of cancer are the most widespread 
in Bulgaria? 
  A: According to statistics, lung cancer ranks 
first, followed by breast, stomach, rectal and colon cancer. 
Men are mostly affected by lung cancer. Other widespread types 
of cancer in men are stomach, rectal, prostatic and colon 
cancer. Women suffer most often from breast cancer, as well as 
from cervical and ovarian cancer. 
  Q: Is cancer diagnosed early in Bulgaria? 
  A: Comparing Bulgaria to the developed countries, 
there is a lot to be desired in this respect. It is alarming 
that in recent years we have witnessed a retreat. In 1990, 
52.99 percent of patients were diagnosed early. In 1992 their 
proportion was 48.58 percent. 
  Q: Is cancer screening done now? 
  A: There used to be two mass screening programmes 
for a long time. Fluorography, that is, screening for growths 
in the chest and mainly in the lungs, is no longer done as the 
method was rejected. Starting from 1956, all sexually active 
women were invited to be screened for cervical cancer. In 1971 
the smear (Pap) test was introduced. Over 1.5 million women 
used to be tested every year, as a result of which many were 
treated for conditions that might otherwise have developed into 
cancer, or cancer was diagnosed early and treatment was much 
easier and more effective. It is a pity that screening has not 
been done since 1990.

Microbiology Institute based in Techonin, East Bohemia, has 
focused only on the defence research of the regulation of 
immunite reactions and of anti-viral and immunomodulative 
preparations, not on bacteriological weapons, Professor Josef 
Fusek told CTK today. 
  Fusek, the rector of the Military Medical Academy, to which 
the Techonin institute belongs, was reacting to articles 
published by the Czech press on Thursday [17 March] and today, 
according to which the institute developed dangerous species of 
bacteria and viruses destined for the production of biological 
weapons. 
  The right-leaning daily CESKY DENIK reports that such 
substances have been stored in several places in the Czech 
Republic. 
  "Biological weapons have never been developed, produced or 
stored here. The institute was not constructed for such 
activities. The institute has never been asked to do such 
work," Fusek said. 
  The Czech Republic has fulfilled -- without exception -- the 
convention which bound it not to develop, produce or store 
chemical weapons. The premises of the mentioned institute were 
opened to an international inspection in May 1990, he stressed. 
  Fusek also dismissed the allegation by CESKY DENIK that 
germs 
of cholera, plague and other dangerous substances were used in 
the institute. 
  The Czech Defence Ministry has not so far commented on the 
issue, which, according to a ministry spokesperson, will be 
taken up at a ministry press conference today.

  [Excerpt] Prague, April 23 (CTK) -- Czech Defence Minister 
Antonin Baudys spoke with journalists on his return from France 
this evening. [passage omitted] 
  None of the information recently spread in the Czech media 
that the smallpox virus had been stored in the Czech Republic 
had been shown to be correct, Baudys said. However, he admitted 
that a small quantity of the variola minor virus had been 
stored. Variola minor causes an illness which is very close to 
smallpox (variola maior), but which can have an easier course. 
  Baudys said that the spreading of such information, which 
was 
not based on the truth and yet concerned the credibility of the 
state or created the impression of high insecurity was not 
proper.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 26/4/1994 -- By the end of 
March, 2,736 AIDS cases were registered of which 2,547 cases 
involved children. 
  Statistics available say the adults have got infected with 
the AIDS virus mainly through unprotected heterosexual contacts 
(49.7 percent), while homosexual contacts caused only 7 percent 
of the cases. 
  While drugs-use cases have not been singled out, for about 
30 
percent of the cases the infecting pattern has not been 
explained. 
  The majority of the afflicted children have got infected in 
hospitals and orphanages (32 percent) especially through blood 
transfusions (24.7 percent). 
  The largest number of AIDS cases (373) are registered in 
Bucharest, followed by the counties of Constanta (with a rate 
close to the Bucharest one), then Giurgiu, Galati, Bacau. 
Several counties such as Cluj, Alba, Salaj, Maramures have each 
registered only one case. 
  In spite of the last four years' education of the public and 
severe measures to bar the AIDS spreading, Romania still holds 
the first place in Europe with the number of AIDS cases at 
children, because of the negligence before 1989. [sentenced as

  [Excerpt] Bratislava, April 12 (CTK) -- [Passage omitted] 
The funding of health care has brought it to the brink of 
collapse with a 2 billion crown debt ($60 million). Due to 
this, urgent measures must be taken to prevent the system from 
collapsing, Health Minister Tibor Sagat tells the independent 
NARODNA OBRODA. 
  First of all, supplies of medicaments cannot be halted, says 
Sagat. The government has provided the National Insurance Fund 
with a half-a-billion crown "injection," while additional money 
is expected by the end of April, he adds. 
  Moravcik's cabinet will try again to settle last year's debt 
of the health facilities. However, previous techniques of 
comprehensive repayment only demoralized the management, Sagat 
says. That is why it is necessary to apply a differentiating 
approach regarding repayment of debts, while Sagat himself he is 
about to establish the criteria in person in cooperation with 
the Association of Hospitals, he adds.

<F P=106> [Article by Special Correspondent Andres Villalonga: "More </F>
Promises Than Solutions To Control Third Outbreak of Cholera"] 
  [Excerpt] Salta--Death and disease continue to ravage this 
province, the epicenter of the third outbreak of cholera, where 
every day the largest numbers of cholera cases are reported in 
Argentina. 
  Poor neighborhoods and settlements cover large areas where 
drinking water and sewage systems are in short supply. 
  The authorities have said that just a few hours ago another 
death was reported in the Lerma Valley, and in the San Martin 
and Rivadavia departments the disease continues to spread. 
  The feeling is that this outbreak will worsen over the 
course 
of the summer, for even higher temperatures are predicted. There 
is no sign of government prevention projects or campaigns, so 
more deaths and cases of cholera are expected. 
<H5>  Nothing To Be Done </H5>
  The deputy governor in charge of internal matters, Ricardo 
Gomez Diez, attempted to explain to LA NACION the lack of 
projects to put a definitive end to this disease in his 
province. "Well, to solve the problem we need over $80 million. 
What the national government sends us is not enough, so there is 
very little we can do," he said. 
  He continued: "Even if we had the money the projects would 
take a lot of time, and the solutions would come too late; it 
will be a long time before cholera goes away. We will have to 
get used to the idea that there will be cholera for a while 
longer." 
  When allocating blame, the official said: "We are 
responsible, but the national Ministry of Health and Social 
Action also shares this responsibility. We have a profound 
economic crisis here. We had a shortfall of 16 million pesos and 
now we are down to 5 million; last year the national government 
gave us 1.2 million pesos in aid, but that is not enough."

<F P=106> [First paragraph is LA NACION introduction] </F>
  [Text] Discussing foot-and-mouth disease, the administrator 
of Senasa [National Service for Animal Health] said that this 
disease, which first appeared in Bariloche and then spread to 
other areas, will soon be fully under control. 
  Senasa's general administrator, Dr. Bernardo Cane, yesterday 
told LA NACION that within 60 days the situation in Rio Negro 
will be fully normalized. There, because of the outbreak of 
foot-and-mouth disease in the region, approximately 9,000 sheep 
were sacrificed to prevent the spread of disease. 
  Shortly after his return to Buenos Aires from that region, 
Cane, in a telephone interview, said that the strategy 
implemented by his organization, including the slaughter of 
animals, vaccination, revaccination, restrictions on livestock 
movements, the establishment of new fixed checkpoints, and the 
inspection of meatpacking plants and pig-breeding facilities, 
would be operational within 90 days. 
  Thirty days have now elapsed, so he felt that within 60 more 
days the situation will be absolutely under control. Efforts are 
continuing to achieve that goal. 
  He said that in Bariloche 125,000 animals were revaccinated 
and there are no signs of danger. In Viedma a similar number of 
animals have been vaccinated and revaccinated. 
  Concerning the last eight outbreaks in Adolfo Alsina, San 
Antonio Oeste, and General Conesa, he said that immediate action 
was taken, as on the other occasions, and that the situation was 
under control. 
<H5>  No Danger </H5>
  The official also said there was no danger for either Buenos 
Aires or Chubut and, when asked if what had happened could pose 
some risk to the progress of the National Plan to Eradicate 
Foot-and-Mouth Disease, he emphatically said no. "On a national 
level," he said, "everything is going very well. In the last 
three months there were only seven instances reported all over 
the country (not including the ones in Rio Negro); this will 
absolutely not impede the progress of the plan." 
  Foot-and-mouth disease causes Argentina losses of $300 
million a year because of international restrictions on our 
meats. 
<H5>  Foot-and-Mouth Disease Plan </H5>
  In his conversation with LA NACION, Cane said that the area 
covered by Chubut, Santa Cruz, and Tierra del Fuego, that is, 
the area south of the 42d parallel, is considered by 
international organizations as a disease-free zone not requiring 
vaccination. 
  He also said that starting tomorrow, staffers from the Pan 
American Foot-and-Mouth Disease Center, from INTA [National 
Institute of Agricultural-Livestock Technology], and Senasa will 
begin work on a Foot-and-Mouth Disease Plan to standardize a 
package of epidemiological measures that, when implemented in 
the mid-term--it cannot yet be determined exactly when--will 
enable Neuquen and Rio Negro Provinces to regain the status of 
vaccination-free zones. 
  Neuquen does not vaccinate and to protect itself from this 
disease it has banned the entry in its territory of meat 
containing bones--the virus multiplies in the bone marrow. 
Furthermore, Senasa has declared Neuquen free from 
foot-and-mouth disease, and for the past 10 years no outbreaks 
of this disease have been reported. 
  The Foot-and-Mouth Disease Plan will now attempt to have 
this 
province and Rio Negro internationally recognized as regions 
free from foot-and-mouth disease. 
<H5>  Sacrifice </H5>
  When asked whether it was absolutely necessary to sacrifice 
animals, Cane answered that firmness in making such decisions 
counts for a great deal with international organizations. 
  "By sacrificing these animals it is possible to recover 
disease-free status within one year; if that is not done, it 
takes at least two years, and by 1995 we want to have this 
disease under control," said Cane. 
  He added that both the European Union and Chile supported 
the 
measures taken by Senasa and have not imposed restrictions on 
our products. 
  Chile--the only country in South America recognized as free 
from foot-and-mouth disease--is at this time the third-ranking 
buyer of our meats, following Germany and Italy. Every year it 
buys 25,000 tons of refrigerated choice meat cuts. 
  Concerning his position as Senasa's director, Cane said his 
resignation is still under consideration by Secretary of 
Agriculture Felipe Sola. However, he reiterated his desire to 
continue working with all the sectors involved, "for we all 
share this responsibility." 
  A few days ago Cane said in a statement to Telam that 
"mistakes were made on a national and provincial level and by 
producers and the meat-packing industry," which contributed to 
the spread of this disease south of the Colorado River.

<F P=106> [Article: "Gloomy Forecast"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Brasilia--About 43 million people throughout the 
world will be infected with the AIDS virus by the year 2000. 
That figure is from the WHO, which estimates that 90 percent of 
the cases at the start of the next century will occur in the 
developing countries. Brazil alone will have 87,000 new cases 
over the next two years. During that period, 85,000 people will 
die of HIV. [passage omitted] 
  Of the 43,964 cases recorded in Brazil so far, 10,198 were 
detected in 1992 alone. "One feature of AIDS is its spread to 
other groups. Its incidence among women and children is rising," 
Lair explained, and she also mentioned the growing use of drugs 
by young people. 
  In an attempt to reverse the AIDS situation in our country, 
the Federal Government will spend $250 million on prevention 
campaigns over the next four years. Of that total, $160 million 
will come from an agreement signed with the World Bank. "The 
rest of it--$90 million--will be Brazil's share," says Minister 
of Health Henrique Santillo.

<H5>  Campaign To Alert Young People </H5>
  Worried by the steadily rising incidence of AIDS among young 
people between the ages of 13 and 25, the Federal Government 
chose yesterday -- the World Day of Struggle Against AIDS -- to 
launch a nationwide campaign targeting young people and aimed at 
preventing the disease. In addition to two films that will be 
shown through the 12th of this month to inform young people 
about AIDS, the Ministry of Health has also begun distributing 
six million condoms throughout the country. 
  "The main means by which the AIDS virus is transmitted to 
the 
young population are basically sex and the use of drugs," says 
Lair Guerra de Macedo, coordinator of the National AIDS Control 
Program. Showings of one of the films began yesterday on a 
national network. It shows a girl putting condoms in her purse 
before going out to meet her boyfriend. "You lose nothing by 
using a condom. Not even pleasure," says the film at the end. 
Another video that will also be shown shows a naked man taking a 
shower. As he steps out of the shower, he sees a trail of 
condoms leading to the bed where his girlfriend is. "The films 
are suggestive and encourage people to use condoms," says Lair 
Guerra. 
  But even though the number of drug users as a percentage of 
all AIDS cases in Brazil has increased from 2 percent from 1986 
to 26 percent this year, Planalto Palace vetoed a part of the 
campaign showing drug users how to sterilize needles and 
syringes. Considered "too strong" by President Itamar Franco's 
advisers, that 30-second video explained how to wash the 
syringe: twice in cold water, twice in bleach, and twice again 
in cold water. At the beginning of January [1994], the Federal 
Government will launch a new campaign aimed at the general 
public.

<F P=106> [Article: "AIDS Infects One Person per Day"] </F>
  [Text] One person per day is being infected with the AIDS 
virus in the Federal District. That figure comes from the 
Hospital Foundation, which has now counted 1,070 people in the 
public network's hospitals and health centers who are carriers 
of the virus and 492 who have developed the disease. If that 
pace continues, AIDS will be the fifth-ranking cause of death in 
the Federal District within five years, in the opinion of Luiz 
Bezerra, medical officer in the Department of Public Health. The 
disease occupies 15th place among the chief causes of death in 
the city. 
  Rosely Cerqueira, coordinator of the AIDS Program and 
director of the Department of Public Health, believes that the 
number of victims in the capital is larger than that recorded 
because the AIDS Program is unaware of cases reported to private 
hospitals and independent physicians. Although she considers the 
situation "worrying," Rosely points out that the picture was 
even worse two years ago. 
  Figures by the Hospital Foundation's AIDS Program show that 
unlike the situation in previous years, the disease has been 
spreading faster among heterosexuals and intravenous drug users 
-- in the latter case because of the practice of sharing 
syringes. 
  "AIDS is not a disease that attacks only specific groups 
such 
as homosexuals," Rosely Cerqueira warns. Through September 1993, 
19 cases had been reported among homosexuals, compared to 36 
among heterosexuals and 35 among intravenous drug users. 
  The capital's young and productive population is the major 
victim of the disease, which is spreading among people over 15 
years of age. Women have come to constitute an important segment 
of the group in question. In the 1980's, there were 20 infected 
men for every infected woman. For every three men carrying the 
virus in the capital today, there is one infected woman. 
  Campaigns--The lack of information is pointed to as one of 
the main reasons why the disease is spreading. "People feel that 
they will never become infected with the AIDS virus," says 
Marcelo Idalga, president of GAPA (AIDS Support and Prevention 
Group). 
  To alert the public to AIDS, about 15 members of the group, 
including students, government employees, and members of the 
liberal professions, meet regularly to organize debates and 
enlightenment campaigns. The group has also set up an AIDS hot 
line (349-8000) to help AIDS victims and inform the public about 
the disease. 
  One example cited by GAPA to illustrate the misinformation 
about the disease that is heard on the hot line concerned a 
woman who was desperate because she worked in the same room as a 
carrier of the virus. Marcelo Idalgo [spelling variation as 
published] recalls: "She believed that she could be infected 
through the air." 
  Another recorded case was that of a man who had asked the 
janitor to keep a few kegs of milk in his house and then 
panicked when he learned that the man had AIDS. The rumor then 
spread through the neighborhood that the milk might be 
contaminated. People did not calm down until it was explained 
over the AIDS hot line that the virus would never survive inside 
a keg.

<F P=106> [Article by Gloria Santos: "Authorities Acknowledge </F>
Meningitis Epidemic"] 
  [Text] Health authorities admitted yesterday that 
meningococcal meningitis has become epidemic in Rio de Janeiro 
State, and they are now talking to the Ministry of Health about 
importing Cuban vaccine for a mass immunization drive during the 
early months of 1994. According to the experts, Rio de Janeiro 
is the municipality where the situation is most disturbing, but 
the state's superintendent of community health, Jorge Mixo, is 
now studying the need for immunization in other municipalities 
in the Rio de Janeiro Lowlands, where there is also a high 
incidence of the disease. 
  The conclusion that an epidemic exists was presented to the 
Ministry of Health at a meeting the day before yesterday in the 
afternoon, at which time the state's figures since 1990 were 
analyzed. This week the state is going to provide an emergency 
budget of 6 million cruzeiros, without going through the bidding 
process, to reequip the laboratory at the Sao Sebastiao Hospital 
in Caju, which is responsible for the tests that classify the 
disease by type. Next Monday the Municipal Secretariat of Health 
will provide the ministry with a review of the incidence of the 
disease this year [1993] and recommend that immunization be 
extended to adults up to 20 years of age. 
  Mary Baran, the municipality's coordinator of epidemiology, 
says that although the disease is more prevalent among children, 
it is necessary to immunize adults so as to "break the chain of 
infection," since the bacterium is harbored in the throats of 
from 10 to 15 percent of the population. The two secretariats 
have not yet decided how many doses must be imported, but the 
experts already know that the 5 million doses ordered by the 
Ministry of Health from Cuba (that being the remaining amount in 
a contract signed in 1990) will only be enough to immunize the 
municipality of Rio de Janeiro. 
<H5>  Situation Worse This Year </H5>
  From January through 24 November 1993, 2,209 cases of 
meningitis and 499 deaths were recorded in Rio de Janeiro State. 
Of that total, 725 individuals (32.5 percent) had meningococcal 
meningitis and 148 of those (29.6 percent) died. That situation 
exceeds the maximum limits as estimated at least four years ago 
-- the average had been 800 cases since 1990. But according to 
experts, the situation has been disturbing since 1986, when a 
significant increase in cases of type B meningococcal meningitis 
began showing up. In the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro, the 
situation is more serious this year because of the lightning 
speed with which the disease has been developing, according to 
Mary Baran, an epidemiologist in the municipal secretariat. 
  "The disease has been developing at lightning speed. Whereas 
we used to have up to 72 hours in which to treat the patient and 
prevent aftereffects, people this year have been dying within 24 
hours," Mary says. The experts cannot yet explain the reason for 
that phenomenon. No cases were recorded in the municipality 
yesterday. Jorge Mixo, state superintendent of community health, 
acknowledged that the secretariat was having difficulty 
monitoring the state because the municipal secretariats were not 
sending in data daily. 
  Jorge also announced that he had sent a circular to the 82 
municipalities asking for a situation report on an urgent basis 
so as to be able to evaluate the need for immunization and the 
target population and order the doses from the Ministry of 
Health. The vaccine must be administered in two doses to ensure 
immunization. 
<H5>  Cremerj Private Clinics Charged With Selling Vaccines </H5>
  The Rio de Janeiro Regional Council of Medicine (Cremerj) 
has 
begun an investigation into charges that private clinics are 
selling Haemophilus influenza type B vaccines that have expired 
and storing the medicine improperly. The investigation will also 
determine who is responsible for publication in the newspapers 
last week of an advertisement which, according to council 
director Abdu Kexfe, is confusing the public regarding the type 
of meningitis vaccine available in the clinics. 
  Yesterday Cremerj notified clinic owners and sales 
representatives for the vaccine against the type of meningitis 
caused by the Haemophilus influenza type B bacterium to make 
depositions on the 8th. The council is publishing in today's 
newspapers a notice explaining the types of meningitis and the 
available vaccines. In surprise inspections conducted by the 
Noel Nutels Laboratory on Monday, irregularities were found in 
two clinics. 
  The Urgil immunization clinic in Lagoa was ordered closed, 
and Climuno in Copacabana will have to prove that it was 
authorized to import the vaccine and that conditions in the 
clinic are sterile. At Urgil, vaccines that had expired were 
found, and the medicine was not being stored properly. 
<H5>  Controversial Experiment </H5>
  The Cuban vaccine against type B and type C meningococcal 
meningitis is the only one in the world with effectiveness 
levels exceeding 75 percent. Even so, use of the vaccine in 
Brazil has caused divided opinions among experts in the public 
health field. It was tested in our country for the first time in 
1989, when there was an outbreak of the disease in Sao Paulo and 
2 million children were immunized. Studies of the immunizing 
capability of the medicine were started after that, with the 
vaccine being tested in seven states: Espirito Santo, Minas 
Gerais, Santa Catarina, Parana, Sergipe, Amapa, and Rio de 
Janeiro. 
  There is disagreement among the institutions that analyzed 
those studies. Whereas the Brazil-Cuba Commission concluded that 
the estimated effectiveness was 82 percent for all types of 
meningococci and 79 percent in the case of type B, other 
institutions questioned the vaccine's immunizing capability. One 
member of the commission, physician Eduardo Azeredo Costa, 
explains that the controversy arose because of the different 
conditions under which each state used the vaccine.

  [Text] Porto Alegre -- Luiz Clovis Belarmino, chairman of 
the technical commission of the Fourth Biological Symposium, has 
stated that biological plague control -- through the use of a 
number of microorganisms, fungi, and bacteria -- in agriculture 
as well as in animal and human health has already resulted in an 
annual savings of $200 million in agriculture, in addition to 
the benefits they bring to the environment. 
  According to Belarmino, Embrapa [Brazilian Agriculture and 
Livestock Research Enterprise] is ready to launch a product 
based on a combination of bacteria that attacks caterpillars 
feeding on leguminous and citrus plants. 
  There are 10,000 species of insects that eat, destroy, or 
attack in other ways plants and animals that are important for 
the survival of mankind. Some species, such as locusts, may 
completely destroy some crops. 
  Belarmino said that the new microorganism was obtained by 
crossing two bacteria in the laboratory: the Bacilus 
Turingenses- Kurstaki and the Bacilus Turingenses-Aizawa. He 
noted that this is among 200 research papers to be submitted to 
the Fourth Biological Symposium to be held in Gramado (Rio 
Grande do Sul State) from 15 to 20 May, with the attendance of 
350 scientists from 50 countries. 
  The First Symposium on Biological Control in the Southern 
Cone and the Fifth Brazilian Meeting on Biological Control of 
Plant Diseases will also be held at the same time. 
  Another new method that is already being applied in Mato 
Grosso is the use of a bug feeding on manure to fight horn 
flies, one of the main livestock health problems. These bugs 
plow in manure and bury part of the horn fly larva underground, 
thus gradually rendering them useless. In so doing, these bugs 
are preventing the reproduction of horn flies already at the 
larva stage. 
  Belarmino concedes that there are no laws in Brazil 
regulating the creation of new living organisms, Embrapa's 
research on microorganisms, the crossing of bacteria, and the 
separation of genes. He guarantees, however, that every 
precautionary measure and biological control procedures 
established by the Ministries of Health and Agriculture, by 
Ibama [Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable 
Natural Resources], and by Embrapa itself are followed. 
  The use of biological agents will make it possible to reduce 
by half the use of pesticides in plague control. The main 
success remains the use of Bacolovirus Anticarsi in fighting the 
soybean plague already in 1.2 hectares [figure as published] in 
Brazil -- the largest area in the world under biological 
control. This area accounts for 10 percent of the country's 
overall soybean plantation and for 40 percent of soybean 
plantations in Rio Grande do Sul.

  [Text] During the first three months of 1994, 31 new AIDS 
carriers were registered in Israel. 
  New figures on the AIDS situation in Israel arrived at the 
Health Ministry this month. Since 1981 1,134 AIDS carriers were 
discovered, 784 of them men. Of these carriers, 33 left the 
country and 29 died of causes not directly related to the 
disease. 
  So far 202 people have died of AIDS in Israel; 16 of the 
patients have left the country. Only 26 women are registered as 
AIDS patients at the present time, approximately 10 percent of 
the living patients. 
  Over the last few years there has been a steady increase in 
the number of women contracting AIDS in Israel. The reason for 
this is the increase in the number of hetrosexually contracted 
cases.

and O.Yu. Bagayeva, Far Eastern Regional Center for the 
Prevention of and Fight Against AIDS, Khabarovsk Scientific 
Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology under the 
``Organization of the Laboratory Service'' rubric: ``Status of 
Laboratory Diagnosis of HIV Infection in Far Eastern Region''; 
UDC 616.98:578.828.6]-078.33[571.6]] 
  [Text] Ten years ago, the first cases of AIDS were recorded 
in the United States. Today, the infection has been recorded in 
more than 160 countries throughout the world. As of 1 March 
1992, 533 HIV-infected individuals, including 267 children, had 
been discovered in the Russian Federation. Sixty-one persons, 
including 45 children, were infected with AIDS. 
  A system of special medical institutions for preventing and 
fighting AIDS has been formed and is now operating in Russia. 
They diagnose and coordinate efforts to prevent the spread of 
HIV infection. 
  The Far Eastern Regional Center for the Prevention of and 
Fight Against AIDS serves as curator for the following eight 
territories in which territorial centers operate: the Republic 
of Sakha (Yakutiya); the Khabarovsk and Primorski krays; and the 
Amursk, Kamchatka, Magadan, Sakhalin, and Chita oblasts. 
  Since 1990, the epidemiologic situation with respect to HIV 
infection in the Far Eastern region has remained unchanged. 
Three cases of HIV infection have been recorded here: Two were 
recorded in the Primorski kray (one was a foreigner deported 
from our country, and the other was a young man who is now under 
clinical observation), and one case of AIDS was recorded in a 
1.5-year-old little girl who lives in a village in the Kamchatka 
Oblast who was infected during hospitalization in the city of 
Shakhty in the Rostov Oblast. 
  Laboratory diagnosis of HIV infection in the region's 
territory is performed by 98 diagnostic laboratories. There were 
40 at the beginning of 1990 and 73 by the beginning of 1991. 
During the 1989-1991 period, 4,090,469 blood samples were 
analyzed for HIV infection in the Far Eastern region. A general 
trend toward an increase in the number of persons examined 
throughout the region's territories has been noted. This 
indicator equaled 10.3 percent in 1989, 15.85 percent in 1990, 
and 19.78 percent in 1991. 
  Among those examined in the past 3 years, the groups with 
the 
highest percent decrease in the number of persons examined were 
pregnant women (41.5, 40.0, and 27.9 percent) and donors (33.5, 
25.2, and 19.4 percent). The absolute number of persons examined 
by year increased somewhat. 
  The number of at-risk persons examined decreased in 1991 as 
compared with 1990: The number of drug addicts examined 
decreased from 5,402 to 4,403, and the number of homosexuals and 
bisexuals examined decreased from 521 to 432. 
  Laboratories primarily screen the public for the presence of 
HIV antibodies. The average load on one equivalent state unit in 
the region fluctuates from 15 to 39 studies daily. The 
laboratories are small and have inadequate equipment, test 
systems, and disinfection agents. Many diagnostic laboratories 
lack multilumen pipettes and have a limited number of single-use 
tips and plotting sheets for serologic reactions. The 
instruments obtained from cooperatives do not always undergo 
metrological inspection. 
  Laboratories diagnosing HIV infection should have at least 
two types of test systems based on a cell culture lysate and on 
recombinant proteins. They generally have a recombinant test 
system of two different series at best. No test systems based on 
a cell culture lysate have entered the region since 1991 because 
the Vektor Scientific Production Association [NPO] has stopped 
producing them. Orders for antigen-lysate test systems from the 
Antigen NPO have not been filled despite multiple appeals. An 
analysis of the distribution and use of test systems to detect 
HIV antibodies in 1990-1991 established significant 
shortcomings: manufacturing enterprises are failing to adhere to 
the quarterly plan for shipping test systems, which limits their 
shelf life and write-off period; the design features of test 
systems (lysate, recombinant, synthetic) are not specified on 
requests from territories; the need for simultaneous tests for 
HIV-1 and HIV-2 is not given full consideration when screenings 
are conducted; and there is a trend toward an unsubstantiated, 
inflated number of test systems shipped. 
  To date, test systems for HBsAg have not reached the 
territorial centers in a centralized fashion. The inadequate 
supply of equipment of materials has affected the quality of the 
studies performed and the speed at which results are obtained. 
The Primorski Kray center acquired the Serodiya 
[transliteration] HIV test system for foreign exchange provided 
by sponsors, which has significantly improved diagnosis in stage 
1. 
  The diagnostic capabilities of oblast and rayon laboratories 
are not being adequately used to diagnose opportunistic 
infections. The operation of the laboratories affiliated with 
the Kamchatka and Primorski kray centers is an exception. 
Serodiagnosis of the following are performed there: viral 
hepatitis; staphylococcal, pneumococcal, and herpetic infection; 
diptheria, pertussis, rubella, and echinococcosis; and 
immunodeficiency conditions. Determination of immune status and 
examinations for HBsAg are performed in the laboratories 
affiliated with the Khabarovsk, Sakhalin, and Chita territorial 
centers. 
  Staff members at the Yakutsk Republic Center have developed 
a 
program to observe morbidity due to viral hepatitis and the 
status of the sanitary-epidemiological regimen at 
treatment-and-prophylactic institutions, and development of a 
program to prevent HIV infection is being completed. 
  The directors of the Far Eastern region's health care 
agencies are paying a great deal of attention to training 
specialists. About 90 percent of their staff members and many 
physicians at infectious disease hospitals and 
sanitary-epidemiological stations have completed advanced 
training in the laboratory and clinical diagnosis of HIV 
infection and AIDS-related diseases at central bases in Moscow 
and Saint Petersburg. Seminars on the diagnosis of HIV infection 
to which specialists from institutes providing advanced training 
to physicians, scientific research institutes, and the Far 
Eastern Regional Center for the Prevention of and Fight Against 
AIDS are invited have been held in practically all territorial 
centers. 
  Training cycles that are systematically jointly conducted 
with the Khabarovsk Medical Institute at the Far Eastern 
regional center are playing a big role in training specialists 
in the diagnosis of viral hepatitis, HIV infection, and 
AIDS-related and AIDS-indicating infections, as well as in 
methods of detecting immunodeficiency conditions. Specialists 
from different territories throughout the Far East are trained 
for 2-4 weeks. The training courses are as close as possible to 
the actual work performed by physicians and laboratory 
assistants. After having completed the training, the course 
attendees receive certification and begin working independently. 
  The Far Eastern Regional Center for the Prevention of AIDS 
coordinates work related to diagnosis and prevention in the 
region. Work on the scientific topic "Study of the Epidemiology 
of and Development of Epidemiological Oversight and Prevention 
of AIDS (Carriage and Morbidity) Under the Extreme Conditions of 
the Far Eastern Region" has been under way since October 1989. 
The regional center confirms diagnoses and detects HIV 
antibodies in blood serum sent from the territories treated by 
it, including by the immunoblot method. 
  In 1989, serum came mainly fram the Primorski Kray (88.4 
percent), but after the Japanese test system Serodiya was used 
in the operation, the number of serum samples sent for 
confirmation of diagnosis decreased sharply and amounted to 0.08 
percent in 1991. In 1990, most serum samples (80.9 percent) came 
from the Khabarovsk Kray and Sakhalin Oblast. The same pattern 
was maintained in 1991, although the percentage of serum samples 
from these territories decreased somewhat (65.82). 
  Most of the serum samples sent from the territories for 
confirmation of diagnosis in 1989, 1990, and 1991 were obtained 
during examinations of pregnant women (code 109) and accounted 
for 528 of 2,086 serum samples, i.e., 25.3 percent. Of the 2,086 
samples, 431 (20.66 percent) were sent under code 113 (clinical 
indications), and 235 (11.27 percent) were sent under code 108 
(donors). 
  The regional center performs immunologic studies of cellular 
(14 indicators) and humoral (13 indicators) immunity, including 
determination of class A, M, and G antibodies, immune complexes, 
total protein, ceruloplasmin, transferrin, haptoglobin, 
medium-weight molecules, properdin, pathological macroglobulins, 
C-reactive protein, lysozyme, _b_-lysine, and 
_b_-lipoproteins. 
  The staff members of the Far Eastern Regional Center for the 
Prevention of AIDS provide consultations and methodological 
assistance related to AIDS diagnosis to physicians in different 
specialists. Forty-seven specialists have been trained in modern 
diagnosis of HIV infection and viral hepatitis (28 in 1991) at 
workstations at the regional center's laboratories. 
  Specialists from the Far Eastern regional center 
systematically travel to diagnostic laboratories throughout the 
region for consultations and to participate in territorial 
seminars on the diagnosis and prevention of AIDS and to control 
the quality of the studies being performed. 
  The laboratory service for diagnosing HIV infection in the 
Far Eastern region is now basically organized. The staff members 
of most of the 98 laboratories are involved in diagnosing HIV 
infection but are not yet paying the necessary attention to 
isolated viral hepatitis markers, determining immune status, or 
detecting AIDS-indicator and AIDS-related infections. 
  The Far Eastern regional center has assimilated and is using 
methods of laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis of HIV 
infection. The experience that has been accrued in laboratory, 
training methodology, and organizational work related to 
training specialists has enabled the associates of the Far 
Eastern Regional Center for the Prevention of and Fight Against 
AIDS to work jointly with the Khabarovsk Medical Institute to 
train physicians and midlevel medical personnel on the problem.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "AIDS-Related Deaths in Italy Before </F>
1980, Aiuti Claims"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Florence, April 12 -- An attempt to dispel 
the myth that Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) was a 
plague that began in the 1980's has been launched by Italian 
immunologist Fernando Aiuti, who claimed there is evidence the 
AIDS virus was found in the bodies of 10 Italians who died 
between 1976 and 1978. 
  Speaking at the "Biotechnology and AIDS" conference 
currently 
in progress in Florence, Aiuti stressed how these revelations 
"confirm the existence of the virus in Italy in the Seventies." 
  In making his claim, Aiuti cited research by virologist 
Ferdinando Dianzani and separate research by Carlo Baroni and 
two other scientists, who performed biopsies on tissues from 
living patients. Dianzani in his address at the conference did 
not agree fully with Aiuti but stated that, according to his own 
conclusions, the first death by AIDS in Italy occurred in 1978. 
  Also announced at the conference yesterday by Peter Piot of 
the World Health Organization (WHO) was the start of first-stage 
trials of an anti-AIDS vaccine within the month on 35 volunteers 
from Brazil, Thailand and Uganda, under WHO auspices. The main 
aim of the trials will be to determine the safety and the 
effectiveness of the vaccine, chosen from a group of 12 possible 
vaccines developed over the last few years. 
  Duke University immunologist Dani Bolognesi, speaking at the 
conference, warned however that some of these latest candidate 
vaccines, like many of their forerunners, have also come from 
laboratory-produced strains and thus may not produce 
substantially different results from those already known, and 
may not have the same effects on human beings as on laboratory 
animals. 
  Hopes are increasingly turning towards the positive signs 
coming from studies into seropositives whose longevities are 
longer than expected and whose high levels of anti-bodies, known 
as CD-8 Lymphocytes, seem to have a neutralizing effect on the 
HIV virus, which causes AIDS. 
  Bolognesi pointed out that researchers should be looking for 
ways to imitate the natural resistance of these anti-bodies in 
formulating the next stages of vaccine research.

Persons Have Contracted the Virus, 2461 Have Died Since 1983."; 
as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Bern, 31 Jan (ATS) -- A total of 684 new AIDS cases 
have been registered in Switzerland in 1993, compared to 650 the 
previous year. Of the 3,561 AIDS cases that have been recorded 
since 1983, 2,461 have died, the Federal Office of Public Health 
announced in its bulletin on Monday. 
  531 of the [1993] registered cases are men, while 153 are 
women. The main victims of the disease are drug addicts (293 
cases), followed by gay and bisexual men (240). In addition, 
last year, 63 men and 49 women have been infected through 
heterosexual contacts. 
  More than one third of all cases registered since 1983 are 
from the canton of Zurich (1287). Next are Geneva (531), Vaud 
(425), Bern (330), and Basel (277). 
  Considering the total population figure, Geneva is the 
hardest hit canton with 124.5 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. 
For the entire country, 18,949 positive tests have been 
registered through the end of 1993. The strongest proportion of 
positive tests has been recorded in the canton of Zurich (32.8 
percent of the total number).

"Quarterly AIDS and HIV Figures"] 
  [Text] The Public Health Laboratory Service [PHLS] today 
published in the Communicable Disease Report AIDS and HIV 
figures for the United Kingdom. These show that in December 
there were 105 new reports of AIDS cases bringing the cumulative 
total to 8,529 cases. 
  The cumulative total of recognised HIV infections is now 
21,101. New reports of HIV infection may relate to people who 
have recently become infected, to people infected some time 
before choosing to be tested, or to people first tested when 
they develop AIDS. 
<H5>  Notes to Editors </H5>
  1. Epidemiological surveillance of the Acquired immune 
Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) was begun at the PHLS AIDS Centre in 
collaboration with the Communicable Diseases and Environmental 
Health (Scotland) Unit [CD&amp;EH(S)U] in 1982. Surveillance of 
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, the cause of AIDS, 
commenced in late 1984. 
  2. PHLS CD&amp;EH(S)U work in collaboration with colleagues 
in 
the Oxford Haemophilia Centre (coordinating national information 
on haemophiliacs) and with colleagues in the Department of 
Paediatric Epidemiology, Institute of Child Health. 
  3. AIDS case reports are compiled from voluntary 
confidential 
reports by clinicians directly to PHLS and CD&amp;EH(S)U. A 
summary 
report is released monthly. 
  4. HIV infection reports are made through a voluntary 
confidential reporting by the microbiologists in laboratories 
where HIV tests are carried out. They are summarised and 
released with the monthly AIDS figures at the end of each 
quarter. 
  5. Due to the length and variability of the period between 
infection with HIV and development of AIDS (average of between 
8-10 years), reports of AIDS cases do not give a picture of the 
current spread of HIV infection. 
  6. Information on deaths is based on reports to PHLS and 
CD&amp;EH(S)U from clinicians, supplemented by information on 
death 
entries obtained from the Office of Population Censuses and 
Surveys and the Registrar General for Scotland. 
  7. There are many people currently being treated for disease 
related to HIV infection who do not yet fulfil the surveillance 
case definition for AIDS. 
  Further data on AIDS is available in the PHLS Communicable 
Disease Report, which can be subscribed to by contacting Editor 
CDR, PHLS Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre, 61 Colindale 
Avenue, London NW9 5EQ. 
<H5>  [Note to Readers: In following AIDS reports from the United </H5>
Kingdom only editorial notes that contain new information will 
be published.]

published in the Communicable Disease Report AIDS figures for 
the United Kingdom. 
  These show that in January there were 174 new reports of 
AIDS 
cases bringing the cumulative total to 8,842 cases. 
  In order to provide a wider range of information about AIDS 
and HIV in the United Kingdom, the Communicable Disease Report 
has recently introduced a new schedule for publication of 
surveillance data. This is designed to focus on different 
aspects of the data throughout the year. So that a wider 
audience can also benefit from this improved presentation, the 
monthly and quarterly routine Press Notices will in future be 
replaced by new quarterly formats. These will provide 
considerable additional information over that presented 
formerly. This is the last in the current series of Monthly and 
Quarterly AIDS and IV figures. The new format will begin in 
April. [passage on editorial notes omitted]

"Epileptics `Suffering From GP Ignorance'"] 
  [Text] Up to 50,000 people are suffering from epileptic 
seizures which could be prevented if family doctors prescribed 
modern drug treatments, specialists said yesterday. 
  Ignorance of the condition, which affects 350,000 Britons, 
is 
widespread among GP's, who ignore sufferers or refer them to 
hospital. Nearly 100,000 people suffer seizures at least once a 
month but half could be eliminated with the right treatment, Dr 
Tim Betts, consultant neuropsychiatrist at the Queen Elizabeth 
Hospital, Birmingham, said. 
  Launching a survey of public attitudes to epilepsy, Dr Betts 
said sufferers were still stigmatised as unstable. One in four 
of the 1,000 respondents said they would not feel comfortable 
about letting their child play with a child who had epilepsy. 
  Seizures can affect a sufferer's job prospects, 
relationships 
and quality of life. In 80 per cent of sufferers the condition 
is fully controlled with drugs or surgery but they are still 
barred from jobs in the police or armed services and may have 
difficulty following other careers such as primary school 
teaching. 
  One in 200 of those who continue to have seizures die each 
year in accidents, by suicide or directly as a result of their 
condition. Suicide is five times more common among epilepsy 
sufferers. 
  "Whole areas of the country have no epilepsy service at 
all," 
Dr Stephen Brown, chairman of the Epilepsy Task Force, said.

"TB Among Homeless Increasing"] 
  [Text] There are more cases of tuberculosis in Britain than 
had been thought, according to a survey that says one in 50 
homeless people may have the disease. Crisis, the homeless 
charity, suggests the numbers affected have reached levels of 
developing countries and New York, where drug-resistant strains 
have emerged. 
  The number of cases in Britain has risen by nearly a fifth 
over the past six years and doctors expect 6,000 to be reported 
this year. The sharpest increase has been among women aged 
25-44. The disease was declining until the mid-1980s. 
  Dr John Moore-Gillon, consultant lung specialist at St 
Bartholomew's Hospital, London, said: "The figures from the 
Crisis survey don't surprise me. But if confirmed, they will 
show the level is higher than we realised." 
  Overcrowding, homelessness and the increase in refugees from 
countries where TB is endemic are blamed for the rising 
incidence.

weeks. They are supported by the Royal British Legion and the 
Gulf Families Crisis Line. 
  The two organisations, frustrated at the MoD's refusal to 
acknowledge veterans could be suffering from long-term illnesses 
linked to war service, have asked Raymond Donn, a Manchester 
solicitor, to co-ordinate the claims. 
  Donn said he was surprised by the reaction to newspaper 
advertisements he placed three weeks ago. "So far there have 
been 250 servicemen past and present who have given details of 
physical illness still suffered after three years," he said. 
  Mick Darlow, a former Signals corporal, typifies the 
experience of the British veterans. A former army cross-country 
runner, he is now capable of working only three days a week as a 
lorry driver before exhaustion and pain confine him to his home 
in Skelmersdale, Lancashire. 
  Darlow, who is married with three young daughters, was sent 
to the border of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait on January 2, 1991, as 
part of a six-man team running a satellite communications 
system. By the time he returned home on March 23, he was 
suffering from severe body pains, diarrhoea and a strong 
aversion to noise. Army doctors who ran tests on him concluded 
that he had a virus and problems with his lymphatic system. 
  He is convinced his stint in the Gulf war is responsible. 
"There are hundreds like me. Why won't the MoD acknowledge 
something happened to us out there?" he said. 
  The MoD said it did not recognise the syndrome. "We have had 
11 individuals referred for medical inspection," said a 
spokesman. "All have been assessed and found to be suffering 
from recognised medical conditions incompatible with their 
service in the Gulf."

<F P=106> [Article by Michael Horsnell: "Cambridge Fears Meningitis </F>
Outbreak After Student Dies"] 
  [Excerpt] More than a hundred Cambridge University staff 
and students have been treated after an undergraduate died of 
meningitis and her friend was admitted to hospital in a critical 
condition. 
  Julia Birkbeck, 19, died within an hour of admission to 
Addenbrooke's hospital but Paul Bentley, 21, is responding to 
treatment. The students and staff who were in contact with them 
over the past seven days were traced by the Cambridge Health 
Authority and given antibiotics. 
  Miss Birkbeck had been rowing on the Cam the previous day 
but 
the authority discounted the river as the source of the 
infection and said it was possible that a small dinner attended 
by Miss Birkbeck and Mr Bentley in college on Saturday night 
held the key to the outbreak of the severe meningococcal version 
of the disease. Suggestions that the Cam was the source of a 
bacterial infection which attacked three women members of a 
Cambridge college boat crew earlier this week, causing their 
hands to swell to twice their normal size, were similarly denied. 
  Miss Birkbeck, from Glasgow, was a first-year modern 
language 
student at Girton College and all-round athlete. She took part 
in an energetic row with her college eight on Monday complaining 
of a headache before becoming sicker that night. She was 
admitted to the hospital's intensive care at 7:30 am on Tuesday 
and died an hour later. Mr. Bentley, from Essex, a medical 
student at Gonville and Caius College who was admitted three 
hours later, was said to be improving. 
  Dr Roger Buttery, a Cambridge Health Authority consultant in 
communicable disease control, said more than 100 contacts of the 
two students had received an antibiotic prophylactic and been 
told to contact their GPs if symptoms of meningitis occurred. 
  He said: "There is no possibility the outbreak had anything 
to do with the Cam, though we constantly stress that people 
shouldn't jump in because any river is infected. Whether the 
dinner party was a relevant connection with the outbreak is 
uncertain." 
  Sarah Key, the dead woman's senior tutor, said: "She was so 
strong and so vital, it's almost impossible to think she has 
just died." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by David Fletcher: "Hospitals Cut Waiting Times"] </F>
  [Text] No patients wait more than two years for hospital 
in-patient care or day surgery, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, Health 
Secretary, announced yesterday. 
  This was in contrast to April, 1992, when more than 1,600 
patients were in two-year queues for hospital treatment, she 
said. 
  Her claim was challenged by Labour who said official figures 
showed there were 412 people listed as waiting more than two 
years -- a claim later confirmed by the Department of Health. 
  Mrs Bottomley said that nearly 75 per cent of patients were 
seen within three months and 98 per cent within a year. Even 
better progress was being made in some parts of the country such 
as Merseyside where no patients waited for more than a year. 
  She was welcoming the second Citizen's Charter report which 
compares NHS performance in the three months up to Dec 31 with 
performance in the three months up to March 31, 1993. 
  It shows cuts in waiting times for urgent cases in accident 
and emergency units. Patients assessed immediately on arrival 
rose from 74 per cent to 83 per cent. The first NHS tables will 
be published in the summer highlighting how each hospital and 
ambulance service performed.

<F P=106> [Article by David Brindle, social services </F>
correspondent: "`Few Patient Benefits' in NHS Changes"] 
  [Text] The market-style changes to the National Health 
Service have done little to improve the quality of care or 
patient choice, the first broad and independent evaluation says 
today. 
  Only fund-holding by family doctors has produced any marked 
-- if selective -- benefits, according to research by the King's 
Fund health policy institute. 
  This has led to two-tier health care in some parts of the 
country. 
  The institute commissioned seven research projects over the 
period 1990-93, covering various aspects of introduction in 1991 
of self-governing hospital trusts, fund-holding and the 
contracting system between trusts and health authorities or 
fund-holders. 
  A report drawing together the research results says that 
while the changes have put in place systems for improving 
performance, and while there is potential for exploiting them, 
there is yet only limited evidence of any gains. 
  Claims that trusts have led to greater efficiency are 
difficult to substantiate because the first trusts were already 
the more efficient units, the report says. The degree of patient 
choice of hospital has always been low and the changes "do not 
appear to have affected this situation". 
  Services for elderly people have shown no improvement in 
terms of choice, accessibility, communication or quality, with 
patients covered by the research having waited longer for 
treatment in 1992 than in 1990. 
  Introduction of medical audit has offered a chance to 
improve 
the quality of care by highlighting and reviewing good and bad 
practice, the report says. 
  But research at four hospitals showed that it was 
interpreted 
too narrowly and was dominated by senior doctors, excluding 
other health professionals. 
  While the report says that fund-holding general 
practitioners 
have achieved benefits for their patients, and that fund-holding 
is one of the few parts of the changes having the planned effect 
on competitive efficiency, it warns that this may be at the 
expense of equity of treatment. 
  "The evidence suggests that a two-tier service has developed 
in places, almost by default." Although it is argued that all 
patients will eventually benefit, "it is hard to see how this 
could come about without some expansion in funding to finance 
across-the-board improvements in services". 
  Sir Duncan Nichol, chief executive of the National Health 
Service, welcomed the report but said that the changes had not 
yet been fully implemented, with re-structuring of health 
authorities, the Department of Health and the NHS management 
executive still to come. 
  "The reality for patients is that the NHS has reduced 
waiting 
times, increased the level of treatment and enabled significant 
improvements in the quality of care provided," Sir Duncan said.

  [Text] Evidence of an increase of epidemic proportions in 
asthma among children, and related allergies such as hay fever 
and eczema, are published today by the Parliamentary Office of 
Science and Technology, which blames the rise in part on fumes 
from vehicles. 
  The committee says the Government should consider powers to 
order people to stop driving in cities when air pollution 
reaches levels which spark asthma attacks. It says voluntary 
exhortations used at the moment may not be enough. 
  One in 10 children are thought to be suffering from asthma 
-- 
double the rate 10 years ago. In 12 years the annual cost of 
treatment had risen from &pound;50 million to more than 
&pound;350 
million in prescription charges alone. 
  The committee says children are subject to a cocktail of 
chemicals from motor vehicles which could be at least part of 
the cause. Passive cigarette smoking and home pollutants such as 
dust mites could also be a factor. 
  The report says: "While the evidence is not conclusive, the 
long-term trend in road traffic would be consistent with the 
observed trends in respiratory allergies, and vehicle exhausts 
are the primary cause of pollutants. Government failure to 
monitor the situation is criticized by the committee, which says 
the UK has by far the smallest number of air monitoring stations 
in the European Union. [quotation marks as published]

<F P=106> [Tom Wilkie article: "Scientists Must Halt Killer Virus </F>
Project"] 
  [Text] Government safety inspectors halted research at 
Birmingham University because of dangers that viruses 
genetically engineered to cause cancer in humans could have 
escaped from a laboratory. 
  The research, taking place in the Department of Cancer 
Studies at the university's medical school, involved putting 
cancer-causing genes into a virus similar to the one that causes 
the common cold. Inspectors from the Health and Safety Executive 
[HSE] were concerned that arrangements to contain the viruses 
might not be adequate. 
  Although the chances of an accident were small, a virus 
genetically modified in that way could infect workers in the 
laboratory and trigger cancer or, if it escaped entirely, put 
the public at risk. 
  This is the first time such tough action has been taken by 
the executive since regulations covering genetic engineering 
came in in 1992. The university's safety procedures will be 
reviewed by the Government's Advisory Committee on Genetic 
Manipulation. 
  Last week, the executive served a formal "improvement 
notice" 
on the university, giving it until 7 April to review the safety 
of all work being done in the Department of Cancer Studies. 
  In December, Professor Phillip Gallimore, of the Department 
of Cancer Studies, and the university itself were served with a 
"prohibition notice," stopping the research immediately. 
  According to an executive spokesman, "the inspector had 
fears 
that the level of containment (of the viruses) was not 
appropriate to the degree of risk. A prohibition notice is 
issued where the inspector believes there is, or will be, a risk 
of serious personal injury. An improvement notice requires 
employers to take remedial action on specific breaches of the 
law within a specified time limit." 
  Although many large companies routinely use genetic 
engineering, one regulator said that industry was "squeaky 
clean" compared with academia. Nearly four years ago, Professor 
John Beringer, who heads a government advisory committee on the 
safety of genetic engineering, predicted that university 
laboratories would be the most troublesome to police for safety. 
  In 1978, Janet Parker, who worked at the university, died 
after a smallpox virus escaped from another laboratory there. 
  Professor David Westbury, Vice Principal of Birmingham 
University, said last night: "Even though research on cancer is 
a vitally important area of medical research, safety has to be 
our over-riding concern. We have already taken action in 
response to the requirements of the HSE and we shall continue to 
work with the inspectors until they are satisfied." 
  According to David Harrison, the university's safety 
officer, 
the researchers, funded by the Cancer Research Campaign, wanted 
to isolate oncogenes -- those implicated in causing cancer -- 
and insert them in human cells which they had cultured in the 
laboratory. By studying the effect of the new gene they hope to 
gain a better understanding of the mechanisms that cause cancer. 
  The researchers used adenoviruses as the vehicle to transfer 
the genes. The best known member of the adenovirus family is 
that which causes the common cold. 
  As an additional safety measure, researchers had altered the 
virus so that it could not replicate inside the cells which it 
infected, said Mr. Harrison. He emphasised that research safety 
had been reviewed within the university: "All of our genetic 
modification work had gone through a committee and had been 
carefully considered." 
  Britain acted early to ensure the safety of genetic 
engineering and its regulations have been taken as a model by 
other countries. 
  However, a House of Lords select committee has recommended 
that some regulations should be scrapped, claiming they are too 
heavy a bureaucratic burden for Britain's fledgling 
biotechnology industry. 
  Larger companies maintain that safety has to be an integral 
part of any successful industry and that commercial goals do not 
conflict with that.

"Britain Faces Skin Cancer Epidemic"] 
  [Text] Skin cancer has become Britain's fastest growing 
cancer, with more than 25 per cent more cases last year than in 
1992, according to the latest figures. 
  More than 40,000 people in the UK were diagnosed as 
suffering 
from skin cancer in 1993, up from 30,000 in 1992, because of 
increased exposure to the sun. 
  A leading cancer expert warned yesterday that babies and 
small children must be protected against the sun this summer. 
Professor Gordon McVie, scientific director of the Cancer 
Research Campaign said that without adequate sunscreens, 
youngsters risked damage from ultraviolet light which could 
cause lasting harm in adult life. 
  A nationwide survey commissioned by the Cancer Research 
Campaign and Boots the Chemist shows that parents use sun 
protection creams on their children, but few keep them covered 
up in T-shirts, hats and sunglasses, or keep them out of the 
treacherous midday sun. 
  Professor McVie said: "The increased number of skin cancer 
cases we are witnessing is a legacy of the 1960's and 1970's, 
when the advent of the cheap package holiday brought the 
Mediterranean sun within the reach of most people's pockets. 
  "This is one cancer which is entirely preventable, but 
unless 
we can get people -- particularly parents -- to follow simple 
sun protection guidelines, I fear we will be facing a skin 
cancer epidemic by 2014." 
  The most dangerous form of skin cancer, malignant melanoma, 
is still considered rare but accounts for about 5,000 new cases 
a year in the UK. It is more common in women than men. 
  There were 1,265 deaths from the disease in the UK in 1992, 
split equally between men and women. Survival rates for women 
seem to be improving, which may be due to earlier diagnosis. 
  Malignant melanoma appears usually as a black or dark mole 
with irregular edges which can itch and bleed. Benign moles are 
more regular in shape and have a lighter pigmentation. Most 
people develop moles on their body before the age of 30, but any 
which appear suddenly should be treated with suspicion. 
  In England and Wales between 1968 and 1985, there was an 80 
per cent greater chance of women developing the disease in 
Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, Dorset, Isle of Wight, East Sussex 
and Cambridgeshire. 
  Men had a 100 per cent increased risk of developing the 
disease in Cornwall and were also more vulnerable in Devon, 
Somerset, Dorset, Isle of Wight, Hampshire, West and East Sussex.

<F P=106> [Article: "Tim Radford on an Atlas Which Utilises an 18-Year </F>
Study To Demonstrate the Geography of Disease: Cancer Map Shows 
North-South Divide"] 
  [Text] The first atlas of cancer cases in England and 
Wales, published yesterday [not reproduced] throws the geography 
of disease into relief across the country. 
  The analysis of 3 million cases over an 18-year period, 
county by county, reveals some puzzles and confirms the 
north-south health divide. 
  More than 70 maps, commissioned by the Cancer Research 
Campaign, show an excess of lung cancers in the north of 
England, of breast cancers among older women in the south, and 
as "hot spot" of stomach cancer in Wales. 
  But malignant melanomas of the skin occur with greater 
frequency in the south and west, where sunshine levels are 
highest. 
  The atlas shows a less easily explained excess of lip cancer 
in East Anglia and of thyroid cancer in north Wales. It also 
reveals Anglesey as having the highest incidence of penile, 
cervical and lip cancer in the country. 
  There are many reasons for cancer. "These can include your 
job, where and how you live, your diet, your drinking and 
smoking habits, and your sexual behaviour," said Professor 
Gordon McVie of the Cancer Research Campaign. 
  "This atlas will help cancer professionals to home in on 
areas of high risk and identify the reasons why some types of 
the disease are more common in a particular area." 
  Mapping of diseases began in 1850, when a London doctor 
tracked cholera cases and found a variation according to source 
of water supply. This was before cholera was identified as a 
water-borne disease. But epidemiology -- the science of the 
study of large numbers of cases according to patterns of 
behaviour -- has since been used to link lung cancer with 
smoking and scrotal cancer with some engineering industries, and 
mesothalamia with shipbuilding. 
  The atlas is supported by appendices carrying regional and 
county information on abortion rates, air pollution, alcohol 
consumption, household food purchases, percentages of residents 
born outside Britain, socio-economic and educational status, 
occupation, venereal disease clinic attendances, and so on. 
  The maps were prepared by Dr Anthony Swerdlow and Dr Isabel 
dos Santos Silva, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical 
Medicine. They are based on records of an average 176,000 cases 
of cancers in each year between 1968 and 1985. More than 33,000 
were of lung cancer, and more than 20,000 were breast cancers. 
  There have been earlier maps of cancer mortality but these 
have not shown the whole picture, because some cancers are 
almost invariably fatal and some are more easily cured. 
  The statistics show a link between scrotal cancer and 
engineering, but no obvious link with leukaemia and nuclear 
power generation. 
  However, there are marked differences according to area. 
  Lancashire has 63 per cent more male lung cancers than the 
average for the rest of the country; Montgomeryshire recorded 85 
per cent fewer. Caernarvonshire and Staffordshire showed 37 per 
cent higher than average rates of stomach cancer, the Isle of 
Wight 35 per cent lower. 
  Prostate cancer incidence was higher in Cambridgeshire and 
Somerset, lower in Denbighshire and Durham. Lung cancer among 
women under 45 was lowest (60 per cent lower) in Hereford and 
Worcester and highest (74 per cent higher) in Northumberland. 
  Breast cancer for women under 45 was highest in Lincolnshire 
(40 per cent) and lowest in Camarthenshire (24 per cent).

"Ministry `Halting Cattle AIDS Tests'"] 
  [Text] Cheshire dairy farmers whose cattle herd appears to 
have the bovine form of AIDS yesterday accused the Ministry of 
Agriculture of blocking wider tests begun by government 
scientists. 
  A new but limited study has confirmed that four out of 10 
animals tested positively to the bovine immunodeficiency virus, 
BIV. 
  A ministry scientist, Dr Joe Brownlie, took blood samples 
from all 115 surviving animals in the herd of Linda and Tim 
Blything, who farm at Kelsall. But Mrs Blything said: "The 
ministry is so far refusing to put up the money to have all the 
samples tested for the virus." 
  The Milk Marketing Board has stopped taking milk from the 
herd although some of the cows are still going for slaughter, 
mainly to be used in mince, sausages and pies. 
  The Blythings say some of their herd has had to be destroyed 
and that most of the survivors are visibly sick, with mucous 
clogging their nostrils and ulcers in their noses and mouths. 
  A ministry spokesman said: "We are considering a request 
from 
Dr Brownlie at our Institute for Animal Health for more money to 
test all the animals for BIV. A decision will be taken in due 
course. But we continue to believe that BIV is a mild and 
transient condition in cattle from which they normally respond 
spontaneously." 
  According to Dr Brownlie's report last week to the 
Blythings' 
vet samples from 10 animals were analysed and four tested 
positively on all three tests for the virus. Three more tested 
positively to two of the tests, leaving their health in doubt. 
  "This is a very much higher level than would be expected in 
a 
healthy herd where no more than 4 per cent would normally be 
positive on all three tests," Dr Brownlie said. "We really ought 
to find out more."

  [Excerpts] Warsaw, 29 Mar -- Poland and Belarus want to 
cooperate in preventing and combating particularly dangerous 
contagious diseases, including the HIV-AIDS epidemic, 
journalists were told today at the outset of a four-day 
Polish-Belarus working conference in Warsaw. 
  The conference is attended by representatives of the Belarus 
Ministry of Health and the five largest cities of this state in 
charge of health care organizations, blood donation, and 
epidemiology. [passage omitted] 
  In Belarus there have been 102 recorded cases of 
HIV-positive 
people, including seven children. Of those 102, 10 already are 
suffering from AIDS. Seventy percent of all cases are located 
in Minsk. According to Polish doctors, Belarus is at the stage 
of the AIDS epidemic where Poland was 6-7 years ago. 
  According to the State Institute of Hygiene there were 2,935 
recorded cases of HIV-positive people by the end of February 
[1994]. Of those, 175 persons contracted AIDS and 98 have 
already died. These are only estimates. Dr. Krzysztof 
Dziubinski, adviser to the minister of health, maintains that a 
growing trend can be observed. 
  As far as diphtheria is concerned, there were 120 cases 
recorded in Belarus last year, while there were only 10 in 
Poland. Last year Belarus purchased Polish anti-diphtheria 
vaccine. It is going to test it and use it in preventive 
treatment.

<F P=106> [Article by Mardy Strom: "Bypass Operations in Tallinn Have </F>
Legal Consequences"] 
  [Text] Over 60 percent of the heart patients who went to 
Tallinn back when there was a long waiting list for bypass 
surgery in Finland have been infected with hepatitis C. 
  A couple of patients will soon take the matter to court. 
They 
are suing the Heart Disease Association, which assured them that 
it was safe to have bypass surgery done in Tallinn. 
  Jyrki Olkinuora, who has been a specialist at the Heart 
Disease Association since the spring of 1990, says that 
suspicions regarding contaminated blood arose in the summer of 
1990. That led to an agreement between the hospital doing the 
operations in Tallinn, the Blood Bank, and the Heart Disease 
Association. The agreement stipulated that only Finnish blood 
products would be used in operations thereafter. 
  The last group of four patients was sent to Tallinn by the 
Heart Disease Association in the fall of that same year, he 
says. Why patients in that group were also infected is a mystery. 
  "I feel that the infection came from local plasma products," 
says Olkinuora. He considers that to be malpractice. 
  He says that unfortunately, Finnish law does not provide 
compensation for that kind of malpractice if the operating 
surgeons are not covered by our insurance system. 
<H5>  About 100 Patients </H5>
  Between 1988 and 1990, nearly 100 patients underwent bypass 
surgery in Tallinn. There was also a period when bypass surgery 
on Finns was performed in Spain, England, and the United States. 
HUFVUDSTADSBLADET has learned that hepatitis C was a problem 
only in Tallinn. [passage omitted] 
  Bypass patients who were operated on in Finland have also 
been infected with hepatitis C. A survey of 685 such patients at 
all the university hospital centers from December 1987 through 
November 1988 detected at least nine cases. Since every patient 
being operated on received an average of 12 units of blood, 
hepatitis C is estimated to have been present in one out of 
every 1,000 bags of Finnish blood at that time. That is a small 
percentage from the international standpoint. 
<H5>  Blood Tested Since 1990 </H5>
  Although the virus was isolated in 1989, a long time passed 
before it was possible to detect hepatitis C in blood. The 
Finnish Red Cross blood bank was one of the first in the world 
to begin the first tests in April 1990. Since then the blood 
bank has systematically tested all blood for the presence of 
hepatitis C, and testing methods have been refined. 
  Sweden did not follow our example until about a year later. 
  So far, no studies have been made to determine how serious 
the liver damage caused by hepatitis C has been in Finland.

  [Text] Zambian Foreign Minister Remmy Kaindu Heli Mushota 
today visited the Public Health Ministry where Cuban Health 
Minister Julio Teja Perez and other officials briefed him 
extensively on the work of the Ministry. 
  The two ministers discussed the possibility of increasing 
current medical cooperation and the mutual hope of seeing such 
cooperation increase, as well as the development of the 
pharmaceutical industry in Cuba, which the Zambian delegation 
had observed. 
  The Zambian foreign minister and his retinue yesterday also 
visited the Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology Center and the 
Carlos J. Finlay Tropical Medicine Institute. In addition, they 
learned about the Cuban health program against AIDS [Acquired 
Immunodeficiency Syndrome]. 
  The Zambian foreign minister was briefed on the family 
doctor 
program which, according to Teja, represents completion of 
Fidel's idea for the people's health program.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
disease reports monitored from FBIS Abidjan Bureau and EAU 
coverage areas. Source information is given in parentheses after 
each item. 
<H5>  Ethiopia </H5>
  Dysentery -- Nine people have died of acute dysentery in 
Asela Town in central Ethiopia in the past 10 days due to the 
lack of hygiene. Local government institutions in Asela Town 
will be closed on 1 April to carry out a cleaning campaign in 
the town. (Addis Ababa Voice of Ethiopia Network in Amharic 1700 
GMT 31 Mar 94) 
<H5>  Gabon </H5>
  Salmonellosis -- Several cases of salmonellosis have been 
reported in Port Gentil, the economic capital, due to poor food 
conservation. The manager of the Meridien Hotel said about 20 
clients and 15 staffers have been hospitalized with 
gastroenteritis accompanied by vomiting and acute diarrhea. 
(Libreville Africa No. 1 in French 1830 GMT 28 Mar 94) 
<H5>  Ghana </H5>
  AIDS -- A medical practioner at the Korle-Bu Teaching 
Hospital, Dr. Robert Mensah, has urged the youth association to 
use their club as a forum for discussing the AIDS pandemic. Dr. 
Mensah was addressing members of the Ivy League Club in Accra. 
He said AIDS is real and that Ghana is currently second on the 
list of the number of recorded cases in West Africa and 11th in 
Africa. As of April last year, there were 11,044 reported cases 
of AIDS in Ghana with the Ashanti Region topping the list. 
(Accra Ghana Broadcasting Corporation Radio Network in English 
2000 GMT 2 Apr 94) 
<H5>  Mali </H5>
  Spinal Meningitis -- Some 110 cases of cerebro-spinal 
meningitis, 32 fatal, have been reported at Segou in the Fourth 
Region. The worst affected districts are (Nguema-Sylla), Sahn, 
and Segou where eight, 84, and 11 cases have been reported, 
respectively. Preventive measures have been put in place for 
two weeks now. The health services have procured 40,000 doses of 
vaccines to contain the situation which is gradually improving. 
There is no cause for alarm now. (Bamako 
Radiodiffusion-Television du Mali in French 1500 GMT 24 Mar 94) 
<H5>  Niger </H5>
  AIDS -- The Tahoua Department is among the areas most 
affected by AIDS in the region. In 1993, 180 cases were 
diagnosed in Tahoua Hospital alone. According to a recent 
study, 1.4 percent of 650 pregnant rural women were 
HIV-positive. Most of these women were contaminated by their 
husbands returning home after months away. Today, the situation 
remains status quo. The hospital's AIDS laboratory tests have 
been suspended due to lack of equipment for blood collection. 
Blood donors fear contamination and, as a result, the blood 
bank is empty. (Niamey Voix du Sahel Network in French 1200 GMT 
30 Mar 94) 
  Meningitis -- A meningitis epidemic has taken hold of Maradi 
Department. Most of the victims of the disease are children 
aged between six months to seven years. At least eight persons, 
mostly children, are admitted daily to the Maradi Regional 
Hospital's infectious diseases ward. Twelve percent are likely 
to die from the disease. The rapidly-spreading epidemic broke 
out in November 1993 in Sahoda village, in Madaroumfa District. 
About 200 cases were reported in March. Cases have also been 
reported in Adjie, Tessaoua, and poorly accessible areas in 
Dakoro District. Vaccines are currently unavailable but a fresh 
delivery of drugs is expected soon. (Niamey Voix du Sahel in 
French 1200 GMT 1 Apr 94) 
<H5>  Nigeria </H5>
  Infant Mortality -- Some 500 babies are said to be dying 
daily in Nigeria from preventable diseases. Health Minister 
Dalhatu Tafida disclosed this in Port Harcourt when he visited 
the Rivers State administrator, Lieutenant Colonel (Dawda Koma). 
Minister Tafida said measures were already being taken to 
tackle these preventable diseases. He said these measures 
include the relaunching of the expanded program on immunization. 
(Lagos Radio Nigeria Network in English 1500 GMT 26 Mar 94) 
<H5>  Tanzania </H5>
  Chlorea -- Cholera has claimed a total of 14 lives since it 
emerged in Kilimanjaro region last December. The Kilimanjaro 
regional medical officer, Dr. Bernard Singano, said 10 people 
lost their lives between September and December last year and 
four people died between January and 21 March this year. A total 
of 213 cases were recorded in four districts from September last 
year to 21 March. The Kilimanjaro regional medical officer said 
the region had taken steps to contain the epidemic, including 
health education, but said the region was facing a shortage of 
drugs to combat the disease. (Dar es Salaam Radio Tanzania 
Network in English 1600 GMT 24 Mar 94) 
<H5>  Zaire </H5>
  Chlorea -- Scores of people have died in the wake of renewed 
outbreaks of cholera and diarrhea in Zaire, the press reported 
here on 19 March. The FORUM newspaper spoke of some 100 dead 
from diarrhea in villages of Eastern Kasai Province, in the 
center of the country, and the AZAP news agency recently said 
cholera was killing 15 to 20 people per day in the Upper Lomani 
region of eastern Shaba Province. 
  A few months ago, officials said the plague had reappeared 
in 
the Ituri region of Upper Zaire. 
  Health officials said the outbreaks were the result of 
degenerating sanitary and environmental conditions in the 
country. (Paris AFP in French 1316 GMT 19 Mar 94)

disease reports monitored from FBIS Abidjan Bureau and EAU 
coverage areas. Source information is given in parentheses after 
each item. 
<H5>  Nigeria </H5>
  Iodine-deficiency disorders -- The Edo State commissioner 
for 
health has said that the (Akoko Edo), (Etsako East), (Etsako 
West), and Owan East local government areas in the state are 
severely affected by iodine-deficiency disorders, especially 
goiter. A campaign has been launched to control and eradicate 
the disease. [Lagos NTA Television Network in English 2000 GMT 
6 Apr 94] 
  Measles/cholera -- Fifty-three children have died from an 
outbreak of measles and cholera in a village in southeast 
Nigeria where local officials feared the death toll could rise, 
the official NAN news agency said. The report released 13 April 
did not say when the diseases broke out, but said most of the 
victims were refugees from the disputed Bakassi Peninsula on the 
border with Cameroon. 
  The report quoted an official for the area, in Nigeria's 
Akwa 
Ibom state, who said emergency medical help was needed to keep 
the death toll from rising. 
  Last week, 25 children were reported to have died from 
measles in Uquo Ibeno village near the Bakassi peninsula, NAN 
said. Refugees who fled the disputed zone, a 1,000 
square-kilometer (400 square- mile) area rich in fish and oil, 
are camped in villages in nearby Akwa Ibom and Cross River 
states. 
  Nigeria and Cameroon have vowed to find a diplomatic 
solution 
to the dispute, which broke out early this year, but both have 
sent troops to the zone. (Paris AFP in English 1657 GMT 14 Apr 
94) 
<H5>  Burkina Faso </H5>
  Measles/cerebro-spinal meningitis -- The director of public 
health has disclosed that this year's incidence of measles was 
not as high as last year's. Some isolated cases of 
cerebro-spinal meningitis have been reported. According to 
statistics there were more cases this year than last year, but 
the situation could not be described as an epidemic. In the 
case of Yalgado Ouedraogo Hospital -- where there have been 
rumors of a new, deadly form of meningitis -- from 1 January to 
31 March 1993, 70 cases were recorded, with 27 deaths reported 
for all forms of meningitis. This year, for the same period, 97 
cases were recorded, with 31 deaths. Although the number of 
cases this year is higher than that of last year, it should be 
noted that all these cases do not come from one locality. 
[Ouagadougou Radiodiffusion Nationale du Burkina Radio in French 
1300 GMT 21 Apr 94] 
<H5>  Ghana </H5>
  Malaria -- Malaria is still the No. 1 killer disease in 
Ghana. It is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, 
especially among children below the age of five, and accounts 
for nearly 30 percent of all clinic attendance in the country. 
Malaria, related to development and economic activities, is 
even more rapidly becoming a major problem. As a way of 
controlling the vector and the disease, the Ministry of Health 
in 1992 worked out a plan of action for the control of malaria. 
The director of technical coordination, Dr. Kofi Ahmed, said 
that the action plan, which is now being implemented, has a 
long-term objective of reducing the incidence of malaria to 
tackle levels that will make it cease to be a public health 
hazard. He said a series of workshops has been set up to train 
health workers to accurately diagnose what malaria is and the 
correct treatment for the disease. Dr. Ahmed said apart from 
medical care, which will be the major strategy, vector control, 
house education, and revision of health legislation are some of 
the strategies that would be pursued. [Accra Ghana Broadcasting 
Corporation Radio Network in English 1300 GMT 19 Apr 94] 
  Measles/cholera -- The regional director of medical services 
in the Upper East Region has told the GRAPHIC that there is an 
outbreak of measles affecting children between the ages of five, 
six, and seven in the region. The TIMES also reports that 
cholera has claimed the lives of 16 people in Sefwi Akotombra. 
[Accra Ghana Broadcasting Corporation Radio Network in English 
1300 GMT 22 Apr 94] 
<H5>  Niger </H5>
  Measles/malnutrition -- A high incidence of measles and 
malnutrition has been reported in Dosso recently. This year, 
the district almost experienced a measles epidemic, with close 
to 75 cases a week per health center. Most of the cases involved 
children who had not been vaccinated. Fortunately, with the 
arrival of the first rains, there has been a decline in the 
disease. Around 25 to 30 cases of malnutrition were recorded in 
the first quarter of this year. [Niamey Voix du Sahel Network in 
French 1200 GMT 22 Apr 94] 
<H5>  SAO-TOME AND PRINCIPE </H5>
  AIDS -- It was reported today that Sao-Tome authorities 
estimate that at least 1,200 people carry the AIDS virus in 
Sao-Tome and Principe. This estimation is, however, very likely 
below the actual figure, since the government so far has not had 
any means to control the spread of the epidemic, a medical 
source also stated. 
  Thirteen cases of the disease were recorded in the 
archipelago for a total population of about 120,000 inhabitants, 
according to the conclusions of a seminar organized during the 
visit of some Portuguese student nurses. A national AIDS 
control program has been launched in Sao-Tome thanks to external 
financing, mainly from the WHO and Western countries. 
Furthermore, an epidemiologic investigation is under way on a 
part of the archipelago to know this disease in Sao-Tome. [Paris

    [Editorial Report] Following is a compilation of reports 
monitored by FBIS Mbabane Bureau from 28 March to 3 April 
concerning outbreaks of and reports on various diseases. Items 
are listed by country and disease. Source follows each item. 
<H5>  Angola </H5>
  Chlorea in Lobito -- "Three cases of cholera have been 
reported in Lobito, Benguela Province. According to Lobito 
District Chief Doctor Eduardo Paulo, lack of basic hygiene in 
the city is the main cause of this disease." (Luanda Radio 
Nacional Network in Portuguese 1900 GMT 29 Mar 94) 
  Cholera in Luanda -- "The health situation in Luanda is 
deteriorating. Our correspondent in Bengo Province says many 
people are dying of cholera in the city because of heavy rains 
and poor sanitation. After malaria, cholera is the disease 
killing the most people in Luanda, particularly in the suburbs. 
It is expected that the disease will spread throughout the city 
because the government has failed to take preventive measures." 
(Jamba Voz da Resistencia do Galo Negro in Portuguese 1900 GMT 
29 Mar 94) 
<H5>  Mozambique </H5>
  Malaria in Manica -- "A total of 188 people died of malaria 
in Manica Province between December 1993 and March 1994. In the 
same period 3,000 malaria cases were diagnosed in the area. 
Manica Provincial Hospital Director Zacarias Raimundo says 
malaria occupies the first place in the number of cases and 
deaths, followed by dysentery and cholera." (Maputo Radio 
Mozambique Network in Portuguese 0800 GMT 2 Apr 94) 
<H5>  South Africa </H5>
  HIV, AIDS -- An estimated 566,000 South Africans were HIV 
positive at the end of 1993, the latest epidemiological survey 
conducted by the Department of National Health revealed on 
Wednesday. The statistics were based on surveys conducted 
annually among women attending prenatal clinics and which served 
as an indicator of the current HIV epidemic. The epidemic is 
following its expected trend with no sign of respite and now 
stands at a point of prevalence rate of 4.69 per cent. This 
means that 47 out of 1,000 sexually active people are 
HIV-infected. The highest incidence of HIV is in kwaZulu/Natal 
with 9.62 per cent followed by the Orange Free State at 4.13 per 
cent and the Transvaal with 3.09 per cent. The Cape has a figure 
of 1.33 per cent. The total number of AIDS cases at the end of 
February was 3,071. (Johannesburg SAPA in English at 0717 GMT 30 
Mar 94) 
  HIV, AIDS -- A Metropolitan Life actuary has estimated that 
another 280,000 people could be infected with HIV during 1994 
and that South Africa could have another 8,000 new AIDS cases by 
the end of the year. (Johannesburg SAPA in English 1304 GMT 29 
Mar 94) 
<H5>  Zambia </H5>
  Measles -- "At least 18 children have died at Museni village 
in Mpolokosay over the past few months due to an outbreak of 
measles. Vice President Levy Mwanawasa heard today that most of 
the children would have been treated but that because of lack of 
medical facilities lives were lost." (Lusaka Zambia National

    [Editorial Report] Following is a compilation of reports 
monitored by FBIS Mbabane Bureau from 4 to 10 April concerning 
outbreaks of and reports on various diseases. Items are listed 
by country and disease. The source follows each item. 
<H5>  Angola </H5>
  Measles, Malaria, Diarrhea -- "Measles, malaria, diarrhea 
and 
other diseases have killed 1,350 displaced people in Dondo over 
the last three months, but the government has sent medicine to 
that city and now has the situation under control." (Luanda 
Radio Nacional Network in Portuguese 0600 GMT 5 Apr 94) 
<H5>  Mozambique </H5>
  AIDS -- "Slightly more than 200 blood donors have been 
turned 
away over the last 15 months because they were found to be 
carrying the HIV virus. The adviser to the AIDS program in 
Manica Province says that 22 out of every 130 blood donors 
turning up at the blood bank show signs of being infected with 
the AIDS virus. Dr. Augusto Cesar Macole also told NOTICIAS 
that every 60 minutes sees one person infected with the virus in 
that province. He added that the number of AIDS cases in Manica 
is only surpassed by the number of cases reported in the city of 
Maputo." (Maputo Radio Mozambique Network in Portuguese 0900 GMT 
5 Apr 94) 
  Cholera in Nampula -- "Ten people have died of cholera in 
Nampula Province because of contaminated water caused by the 
Nadia cyclone last month. According to Health Minister Leonardo 
Simao, the number of deaths could rise since the water treatment 
and distribution system was destroyed by the cyclone. Leonardo 
Simao said more than 40 health posts have been destroyed in the 
13 affected districts." (Maputo Radio Mozambique Network 
Portuguese 1730 GMT 3 Apr 94) 
  Diarrhea in Nampula -- "Diarrhea had killed at least 50 
people in Nampula Province by 2 April. The epidemic broke out 
in the wake of cyclone Nadia. Ten of those people perished in 
Nacala." (Maputo Radio Mozambique Network in Portuguese 1030 GMT 
5 Apr 94) 
  Dysentery -- "Nine people have died of dysentery at Matil, 
Moma District, Nampula Province. A total of 53 cases of 
dysentery were registered in the area. Health authorities say 
the disease was activated by the contamination of water after 
Nadia cyclone hit a number of districts in Nampula Province." 
(Maputo Radio Mozambique Network in Portuguese 1730 GMT 9 Apr 94) 
<H5>  South Africa </H5>
  AIDS -- "There are now 500,000 South Africans infected with 
the HIV virus that leads to AIDS, according to new Department of 
Health and Population Development surveys. `There is no 
indication of the trend abating,' said Dr. Horst Kuestner, 
director of epidemiology. The highest rate occurred in 
Natal/kwaZulu at 9.62 percent of the population, while in the 
Cape it was 1.33 percent. By the end of 1993, over 3,000 AIDS 
cases had been reported." (Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English 
10 Apr 94 19X) 
<H5>  Zimbabwe </H5>
  AIDS -- "Full-blown AIDS cases are expected to reach a 
cumulative total of 130,000 in Zimbabwe by the end of the year, 
ZIANA news agency reports. National AIDS Control Programme 
Co-ordinator Evaristo Marowa said on Thursday at least 28,000 
Zimbabweans suffered from full blown AIDS by the end of 1993. 
This figure was conservative as it only comprised reported 
cases. `The data we collect is inadequate, and we estimate this 
is only one-third of the actual figure,' said Mr. (M?rowa)." 
"Zimbabwe had an estimated 60,000 AIDS orphans at the end of 
last year, a figure expected to rise to 500,000 within five 
years, he told college lecturers, principals, and other 
educationists." (Johannesburg SAPA in English 2128 GMT 7 Apr 94) 
  Dysentery -- "Almost 130 people have died from dysentery and 
more than 25,000 cases have been reported in Zimbabwe since 
January this year, ZIANA news agency reported on Tuesday. The 
Ministry of Health and Child Welfare however said the figures 
had been decreasing slowly since the dysentery outbreak last 
October." Cases were still being found in Harare and in central 
Mashonaland and Manicaland. (Johannesburg SAPA in English 2149

monitored by FBIS Mbabane Bureau from 18-24 Apr concerning 
outbreaks of and reports on various diseases. Items are listed 
by country and disease. Source follows each item. 
<H5>  Swaziland </H5>
  Malaria -- "An undisclosed number of people have died of 
malaria in the Lubombo region, Lubombo Regional Health Educator, 
Mr. Africa Magongo disclosed on Friday." Magongo said "between 
March, April and May the disease is at its peak. He said the 
deaths have been caused mainly because the people go for 
treatment very late, sometimes already unconscious." (Mbabane 
TIMES OF SWAZILAND in English 18 Apr 94 p 5) 
  Goitre -- The Swaziland National Nutrition Council (SNNC) is 
"advocating for legislation to ban the use of un-iodised salt 
because of an increase in goitre disease. The council wants 
that only iodized salt be imported to the country but only if it 
has the 50 parts per million level required here instead of the 
present 20 parts per million....Statistics in the Working 
Document of the SNNC indicate that Hhohho and Manzini regions 
are severely hit by Iodine Deficiency Disorders [IDD]. The 
Hhohho region has a 38 percent total goitre rate and Manzini 29 
percent. Shiselweni and Lubombo which are respectively assessed 
as moderate and mild to IDD have 13 and 6.0 percent total goitre 
rate." (Mbabane TIMES OF SWAZILAND SUNDAY in English 17 Apr 94 
pp 1, 2) 
<H5>  Zambia </H5>
  Meningitis -- "Meningitis has broken out at the towns of 
Ndola and Kitwe in Zambia's Copperbelt region, killing at least 
20 people....Reports say Ndola Hospital does not have enough 
drugs to combat the disease and emergency supplies have been 
ordered from the capital Lusaka." (Johannesburg Channel Africa

  [Text] The health situation in Somalia is increasingly 
worrying. A cholera epidemic is gaining ground in the country. 
It has just reached the town of Kismayu in the south of 
Somalia, where the greatest part of the Belgian contingent used 
to be based. Dr. Georges Dalemagne, who is with the Medecins 
Sans Frontieres organization, takes stock of the situation: 
[begin recording] 
  Dalemagne: There has been cholera in Somalia for a 
few weeks in several regions, including Baydhabo, Belet Huen, 
and Mogadishu. We heard last weekend through our team on the 
ground that there were cases in Kismayu. In a single weekend, 
we checked 127 people suffering from cholera into the hospital. 
A wind of panic is blowing through the town at the moment: it is 
rumored that there have been a few deaths, but the hospital has 
registered only one death so far among the 127 patients. 
  Correspondent Michel Lagaze: Do you think that 
things are going to get worse over the next few days, or could 
we have them under control? 
  Dalemagne: Cholera epidemics usually last for a 
few weeks. We have the impression that the peak is to be 
expected in less than a week's time, and there may well be 
several hundred cases in the town by then. We have had to take 
special measures. We have set up a special camp, a cholera 
camp, since the aim is twofold: to put the patients in 
quarantine and to give them special treatment -- they have to be 
hydrated, to be put under perfusion, to receive a specific 
antibiotic treatment. We have already sent 12,000 liters of 
perfusion fluid from our base in Nairobi. We may also need to 
close down some markets, to take measures to prevent this 
epidemic from spreading to other towns near Kismayu. [end

  [Text] A cholera epidemic that started in Boosasaaso in 
northeastern Somalia in February has now spread to the whole 
country, a Zurich doctor who returned from the country on 3 
April has told Swiss Radio International. Dr. Mathias Muheim, 
who spent a month in Somalia as a member of a WHO team studying 
the epidemic, said the total number of cases had reached 6,000, 
with a mean fatality rate of two percent of cases. The team 
visited Mogadishu, Boosaaso, Kiysmaayo, Baidoa, Beledweyne, and 
Gaalkacyo, he told the radio.

  [Excerpts] The China Venereal Disease (VD) and AIDS 
Prevention Association, a national organization aiming to 
mobilize action by the entire society to prevent and effectively 
control the spread of these illnesses, was set up in Beijing on 
the Sixth World AIDS Day on December 1. 
  Organized by the Ministries of Public Health and Public 
Security, the association draws in nearly 200 council members 
including six vice-ministerial officials and affiliated 
departmental- and bureau-level officers from the aforementioned 
ministries and the Ministries of Justice and Civil Affairs, the 
Army and Police Force, as well as several dozen leading public 
health officials from other provinces and cities. It also 
consists of numerous well-known experts and scholars from state 
research units such as the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, 
the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine, the Academy of 
Traditional Chinese Medicine, and China Foundation for Global 
Venereal Disease and AIDS, plus research and prevention 
organizations in other provinces and cities. 
  Following six years of efforts since the First World AIDS 
Day 
on December 1, 1988, a nationwide network to monitor and prevent 
sexually transmitted diseases has been formed. The government 
has successively established the China Consulting Committee of 
Experts on VD, the State Expert Committee on Control and 
Prevention of AIDS, and the China Research Center of VD 
Prevention. It has set up 26 monitoring sites and 1,535 VD 
prevention organizations across the country, HIV monitoring 
centers in 13 provinces and 161 HIV monitoring posts in further 
provinces and regions. Some 200 HIV initial detection labs have 
been created nationwide, and the number of AIDS identification 
labs has risen to 12. In 1993, with support from the Ministries 
of Public Health and Finance, Guangdong and Yunnan, the two 
provinces where the AIDS problem is the most serious, 
established their own AIDS prevention centers. [passage omitted] 
  The task for the new association is to coordinate and 
integrate promotion and education, medical treatment and 
prevention, scientific research and legal supervision. It must 
form a strong behemoth of opinion and force of opposition across 
society to finally curb the continuous spread of AIDS.

  [Excerpt] Latest reports indicate that in the past few 
years, VD and AIDS have expanded across the mainland at an 
astonishing pace. By the end of 1992, 30 provinces and cities 
had reported a total of over 800,000 VD patients. In 1992 alone 
some 200,000 cases were notified, an increase of 13.79 percent 
over the previous year. In addition, by the end of November 
1993, 1,159 AIDS patients and individuals infected with the HIV 
virus had been found in 22 provinces and cities. Mainlanders 
made up 948 cases, with the rest being foreigners and overseas 
Chinese. Out of the 19 full-blown AIDS patients, 14 have died. 
The incidence of VD and AIDS patients or HIV carriers is most 
serious in coastal or border provinces and regions such as 
Guangdong, Fujian, Yunnan, Zhejiang, Hainan and Guangxi. 
However, in recent years, inland provinces which are 
economically advanced or experiencing tourism booms, like Hunan, 
Hubei and Sichuan, have also witnessed rapid increases in these 
afflictions. 
  The spread of VD and AIDS on the mainland has disturbed and 
worried people. The media has generally attributed the rapid 
spread of AIDS to the influx of foreigners into a more open 
China plus the internal floating population. In reality, China's 
younger generation, affected by unhealthy foreign thinking and 
at variance with traditional concepts about sexual behavior, 
constitutes the more dangerous internal factor. 
  In 1992, Shanghai held a comprehensive survey on psychology 
and morals among people aged between 20 and 55. To the question 
"Are you in favor of a woman developing sexual relationships 
with several men?" the responses varied according to generation. 
More younger people said yes. 
  In 1991, the China Union Medical College Hospital conducting 
a survey on taxi drivers and hotel attendants in a Beijing 
district. Some 13.6 percent of the drivers and 3.4 percent of 
the attendants admitted to more than one sexual partner. About 
16.6 percent of the former and 41.9 percent of the latter had 
desires for more sexual partners. 
  New concepts have led to disastrous consequences. Surveys on 
16 large and medium-sized cities indicate the annual increase 
rate for VD in recent years reached 45.63 percent. The number of 
Chinese HIV carriers infected through sexual contact rose to 20 
percent. 
  The press, sociologists and medicos have made an appeal that 
in the coming new year priority be given to extensive publicity 
and education on VD and AIDS prevention, and dissemination of 
scientific knowledge. Various approaches should be applied to 
publicize the influence brought by VD and AIDS on individuals, 
families, children and society, to foster public awareness of 
protection measures and morality, so that people become neither 
VD sufferers nor spreaders. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Zhu Baoxia: "Who: Intensify AIDS Efforts Now To </F>
Stem Tide"] 
  [Text] The Chinese Government has been urged to take 
further steps immediately to slow down the nationwide spread of 
AIDS. 
  Michael H. Merson, WHO's executive director for the global 
program on AIDS, suggested that the Chinese central government 
should focus on preventing the sexual transmission of HIV, the 
virus that causes AIDS. 
  Efforts should include expanded educational programs, 
increased use of condoms, and the treatment of sexually 
transmitted diseases. 
  And AIDS control work must not be confined to Yunnan 
Province, where reported cases make up about 80 per cent of the 
country's total. 
  Education and publicity campaigns should be carried out 
regularly in all other parts of the country, especially in the 
economic development zones and the coastal regions that have 
experienced a sharp rise in transient populations, he suggested. 
  Merson is in Beijing to help the government work out 
feasible 
policies to combat AIDS. 
  He discussed the worldwide and Chinese AIDS situations with 
State Councillor Peng Peiyun and officials from the Ministry of 
Public Health. 
  He warned that, like other Asian countries, China faces the 
possibility of a serious HIV and AIDS epidemic. Compared with 
the size of the country's population of 1.1 billion, the number 
of reported HIV infections and cases of AIDS is relatively low, 
he said, but there is no reason for complacency. 
  Experience has shown that the actual number of infections 
and 
cases of AIDS is usually greater than the number of reported 
cases, and the risk factors fueling this pandemic elsewhere in 
the region also exist in China. 
  So far, some 1,159 HIV infections and AIDS cases have been 
reported on the Chinese mainland. However, the actual figure 
could be much higher because of limited surveillance work. 
  Experts warn that unless quick steps are taken now, the 
number of cases will grow rapidly in the next six years. 
  However, the trend can still be slowed through extensive 
AIDS-prevention publicity and education. 
plays an effective role in preventing the spread of AIDS.

  [Text] Hong Kong, 14 March (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- This 
reporter has learned from the Yunnan Provincial AIDS Prevention 
and Control Office that, over the past four years or so, the 
province has spent over 7.6 million yuan in the prevention and 
cure of AIDS, and that the amount exceeds 10 million yuan if 
state appropriations and international aid are added. In the 
meantime, a strict monitoring and examination network system has 
been set up. 
  Yang Qi, who is in charge of the Yunnan Provincial AIDS 
Prevention and Control Office, said: In the past few years, 
Yunnan has done a great deal of work in organizing and managing 
the prevention and control of AIDS, monitoring epidemic 
diseases, making laws and regulations, giving publicity to and 
carrying out education, and in training, researching, and 
gaining international cooperation. A monitoring and examination 
network, which is composed of one monitoring and examination 
center, 10 preliminary screening laboratories, and 34 monitoring 
points, plays an exceedingly important role in the prevention 
and control of AIDS. 
  Yang Qi said that the monitoring of 147,330 highly 
susceptible people in Yunnan shows that HIV-infected persons are 
still mainly concentrated in the western border area of Yunnan. 
As of the end of 1993, there were 977 HIV-infected persons, of 
whom 102 were foreigners. Of these 977 persons, 17 were 
diagnosed as AIDS sufferers, and nine have already died. 
  Yang Qi said: Yunnan keeps files on every HIV-infected 
person and every AIDS patient. Moreover, it follows up on them 
with medical treatment and continuously strengthens education 
for their families and highly susceptible people. Furthermore, 
in addition to the AIDS Prevention and Control Day held once 
each year, Yunnan has printed some 100,000 tracts about AIDS in 
the Dai and Jingpo languages and installed three telephones for 
inquiries. All this plays an effective role in preventing the 
spread of AIDS.

  [Summary] The Ministry of Public Health reported recently 
that disease incidence of epidemic hemorrhagic fever (EHF) is 
rising in some areas of China and urged the local government to 
pay closer attention to the matter. According to the report, 
from January to October in 1993, although the disease incidence 
and death toll dropped 11.14 percent and 43.48 percent 
respectively from the same period of 1992, disease incidence in 
some local areas in Anhui, Sichuan, and Shandong Provinces rose 
rapidly and even caused some deaths since October of 1993. 
Reports submitted by 40 EHF monitoring stations across the 
country also affirmed the rapid increase of EHF disease 
incidence since last October. Wild rats are believed to be the 
major vectors of disease transmission, because the density of 
wild rats in some rural areas is as high as 30-40 percent, and 
15 percent in residential areas. Apodemus agrarius, 
which accounts for 80-90 percent of wild rat population, is the 
major intermediate host. In 1993, higher virus-carrying rate and 
infection index of Apodemus agrarius have also been 
reported.

  [Text] Beijing, March 28 (CNS) -- More than 100,000 
persons are poisoned by chemicals used in agriculture annually 
in recent years in China, with the number poisoned in the course 
of production equalling those not engaged in production 
activities, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and the 
Ministry of Public Health. 
  In 1992, a total of 70,618 persons in 25 provinces, 
autonomous regions and municipalities suffered from poisoning 
from agricultural chemicals resulting in 8,620 deaths, 12.2 
percent of all those succumbing to such poisoning. In 1993, 
some 51,283 persons in 27 provinces, autonomous regions and 
municipalities were found to have been poisoned with 6,156 of 
them dying, making up 12 percent of all those poisoned. 
According to experts, some 60 percent of all such poisoning 
cases had gone unreported. 
  In the mid-eighties, there were many cases of such 
poisoning. 
The authorities in some provinces organized teams to prevent and 
treat such poisoning and educated peasants about how to use 
agricultural chemicals, reducing the occurrence of such 
poisoning. After 1987, the shortage of funds and a drop in the 
number of professional staff responsible for prevention and 
guidance work saw an increase in the number of people affected 
by such poisoning. The number of peasants using agricultural 
chemicals increased to over 100 million households made up of 
200 to 300 million individuals, leading to an increase in the 
number of people suffering from such poisoning.

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by Li Wei: "Organ Transplantation Developing in </F>
China"] 
  [Text] Beijing, April 8 (XINHUA) -- Xue Liansheng, 17, who 
suffered from severe hemophilia, received a mother-donated 
spleen transplant three years ago in Wuhan, capital of central 
China's Hubei Province. Now he can walk to school with a cane 
instead of crawling on all-fours. 
  Nearly 20,000 people in China have received various organ 
transplants since the 1970's. To date, 21 different kinds of 
clinical transplants have been performed in China, including 
kidney, liver, spleen, pancreas, heart, bone marrow, adrenal 
gland, parathyroid, lung, testicle, pancreas-kidney, hepatic 
cell, spleen cell, brain cell and brain nervous tissue. 
  Shortage of organ donors -- in part because of the grip of 
old ideas -- is restricting the expansion of these operations to 
help yet more people. 
  Kidney transplants have been the most numerous in China's 
clinical organ transplants: more than 10,000 have been done by 
nearly 90 medical institutions so far. 
  By 1993, nearly 800 kidney recipients had survived for five 
years and over 100 recipients survived for ten years. 
  More than 60 liver transplants have been performed in China. 
Eleven heart transplants have been done and two recipients have 
survived for nearly two years. 
  In addition, pork islet grafts were done for eight patients 
who had been suffering from "type one" diabetes for five to 22 
years. 
  Transplants of cranial nerve tissue and brain cells have 
also 
been developed with good results in treating Parkinson's 
disease, dwarfism, chorea and cerebral hypoplasia in recent 
years, said experts. 
  The study of organ transplantation in China began in the 
1970's, about ten years later than abroad. However, all the 
kinds of organ transplants which have been developed elsewhere 
in the world can now also be done in China, said Qiu Fazu, 
honorary president of the Wuhan-located Tongji Medical 
University. He is one of the founders of China's organ 
transplant research. 
  The Institute of Organ Transplantation of Tongji Medical 
University is China's only large-scale comprehensive research 
unit in this field. In addition, there are several dozens of 
medical units in China which have also joined the study and 
clinical practice of organ transplantation. 
  More than 60 researchers work in the three-storey building 
of 
the Tongji Institute. They have developed 13 kinds of organ 
transplantations, including liver, pancreas, kidney, spleen, 
islets as well as cell perfusion. 
  Xia Suisheng, 70, who is director of the institute and 
president of the Society of Organ Transplantation of the Chinese 
Medical Association, has performed nearly 1,000 transplant 
operations and saved the lives of a number of people who were 
suffering from serious diseases. 
  According to Professor Qiu Fazu, China has made some 
up-to-international-level achievements in organ transplants in 
recent years. However, it still lags behind advanced countries 
in the transplantation of large organs such as liver and heart, 
said Qiu. 
  One of the main causes lies in a shortage of organ donors 
because of the public rejection of the "brain death" concept, 
Qiu said. In China, it is morally and legally prohibited to 
procure organs from corpses whose heart is still beating. 
  "As a result, the quality of grafts in China is lower than 
that of advanced countries," he said. 
  In addition, medical expenses for an organ transplant in 
China are so high that ordinary people cannot afford it. A 
liver transplant costs more than 100,000 yuan (about 11,500 U.S. 
dollars), and the imported immuno-suppressive drugs are also 
very expensive, said Qiu. 
  It is learned that Chinese scientists have been trying to 
extract immuno-suppressive materials from traditional Chinese 
herbal medicines so as to lower the medical expenses for organ 
transplantation. 
  Medical specialists said they would continue to appeal to 
the 
public to accept the concept that "brain death is the beginning 
of irreversible death" and strive for its legal recognition. 
  "With enough organ donors, more Chinese people suffering 
from 
severe diseases will be saved through organ transplants," said 
Qiu.

  [Text] Hefei, April 16 (XINHUA) -- An initial survey of a 
large-scale Sino-U.S. joint investigation of the impact of 
environment and occupations on people's health was recently 
concluded in East China's Anhui Province. 
  It has produced a large body of data for experts to process 
and analyze. 
  The survey was sponsored by the International Research 
Center 
of Environmental Epidemiology, an institution jointly founded by 
Anhui Medical Sciences University and the U.S. Harvard 
University. 
  The four-month initial survey began last August 1 among 
almost 60,000 residents near Anqing City. 
  Each survey form contained more than 2,300 items of 
information. It focused on two subjects: natural history of 
respiratory system diseases and the relations between pesticide 
pollution and disease. 
  Regular follow-up surveys will be carried out among the same 
group of people in the next 15 years and will occupy generations 
of experts to research and find solutions to problems.

  [Summary] Recently the Institute of Epidemiology of the 
Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine (CAPM) conducted a study 
entitled "Diseases Monitor Methodology and Chinese People's 
Health Situation," which provides reference information for 
mapping out China's near- and long-term health plan. Since 
1989, in five years CAPM established a national diseases monitor 
network including 145 monitoring stations in 30 provinces, 
municipalities directly under the Central Government and 
autonomous regions. The purpose of monitoring stations is to 
study people's health situation in China. The stations' major 
findings are: China's overall birthrate, mortality rate and 
infant deathrate are basically unchanged or somewhat decreased. 
However, rate of decrease is different from region to region. 
For example, overall birthrate and infant mortality rate in the 
rural areas are twice those of the cities. In poor rural areas, 
epidemic disease incidences of digestive system account for 50 
percent of the category A and category B infectious diseases. 
Death rate of adult tuberculosis in poor rural areas ranks 
highest in the world. 
  The four major causes of death in China are 
cardiocerebrovescular diseases, malignant tumors, respiratory 
diseases and accidents. Bronchial tumor, which increases at the 
annual rate of 4.5 percent in the nation and 10 percent in rural 
areas, is the major killing tumor of Chinese people. Accidents, 
especially traffic accidents, are increasing at a rate of 10 
percent each year in China.

  [Summary] Although China has attained significant 
achievements in controlling malaria, schistosomiasis, 
filariasis, and black fever, not much has been studied on the 
scope of distribution, rules of spreading, degrees of damage of 
the more harmful parasites. In 1986 the Ministry of Public 
Health launched on unprecedented large-scale study on parasitic 
infection. According to the report given in the "National Survey 
on Distribution of Human Parasites," 62.6 percent of Chinese 
people are infected with 56 kinds of parasites, among them, 19 
are protozoa, 16 flukes, 12 nematodes (eelworms), eight cestodes 
(tapeworms), and one thornheaded worm. The Taiwan thornbelt 
fluke found in Fujian, tiny spinous fluke and narrow testis 
thornmouth fluke found in Anhui and Fujian, are the two first 
time-reported parasites, and the Fujian spinous fluke is a 
newly-discovered species in China. There are more unidentified 
newly-discovered parasites found in every province. According to 
the report, among 147,7742 [as printed] people surveyed, 10.315 
percent are infected with protozoa, 0.573 percent with flukes, 
0.195 percent with cestodes, 59.022 percent with nematodes, and 
43.33 percent of the surveyed population are cross-infected with 
two or more kinds of parasites, some are even infected with nine 
kinds of parasites. Some children under five years old are 
already infected with six kinds of parasites. Higher roundworm 
(46.999 percent), hookworm (17.166 percent) and whipworm (18.796 
percent) infections are also reported in the above surveyed 
population. The data indicate that in China, by estimate, about 
531 million people are infected with roundworms, 194 million 
with hookworms, and 212 million with whipworms.

  [Summary] A survey report conducted by a team led by Zhang 
Zhefu on "Lyme Disease Etiology and Epidemiology" reveals that 
5.33 percent of the surveyed 25,795 population who live in the 
wooded areas of 19 provinces, autonomous regions and cities 
directly governed by the Central Government, are infected with 
Lyme disease, and in some severely-infected areas infection rate 
is even much higher, from 11.28 percent to 18.91 percent. 
Average morbidity rate for the surveyed population is from 1 
percent to 4.5 percent, but it reaches up to 9 percent in 
severely-infected areas. Since 1985, the team has focused its 
study on Lyme disease epidemiology, etiology, vectors, host 
animals and the disease's clinical symptoms. The team isolated 
83 Lyme disease spirochetes from patients, host animals and 
ticks, and found that spirochetes isolated in China are 
different in their structural patterns from those isolated in 
Western countries. The team also identified the natural epidemic 
focuses in 12 provinces.

  [Text] Seven men and a woman returned positive HIV 
antibody tests last month, bringing the number of HIV-infected 
persons in Hong Kong to 429. The Department of Health believes 
the new patients all contracted the potentially lethal virus 
through heterosexual activity. Four HIV carriers developed the 
deadly AIDS virus last month. There have been 99 confirmed AIDS 
cases in Hong Kong, and 65 of them have already died. 
  The Hong Kong Red Cross blood transfusion service has 
recorded 29 people with the AIDS virus. An AIDS Foundation 
member, Patrick Li, called on the public to stop using the 
transfusion service to find out whether they are HIV carriers. 
The Department of Health and the AIDS Foundation offered free 
and confidential AIDS tests. Li said.

  [Text] Viral hepatitis infections surged in 1992, with 
more than twice as many cases recorded as in the previous year, 
according to statistics just released by the Department of 
Health. More people were also diagnosed as having sexually 
transmitted diseases, died of lung cancer and heart disease, or 
were admitted to hospital because of injury or poisoning. 
  The department's annual report for 1992-93 shows that 4,357 
hepatitis cases were reported in 1992 compared with 1,801 in 
1991. Almost all were hepatitis A, 157 were hepatitis B and 301 
were classified as neither A nor B. The report said the 
infections were due to eating raw or badly cooked seafood from 
Hong Kong's polluted waters. Other figures in the report show 
Hong Kong people died from the same serious diseases, in about 
the same proportions, in 1992 as in the previous year. 
  The biggest killers were cancers, heart diseases and 
cerebrovascular diseases, which together accounted for almost 
two-thirds of all deaths. As in the previous year, lung cancer 
killed more men and women than any other tumour, causing 2,761 
deaths in 1992. Most of these were due to smoking, the 
department said. 
  Liver cancer and naspharyngeal cancer were the second and 
third most common tumours among men, compared to breast and 
colon cancer among women. Although slightly fewer people died 
of a heart attack in 1992 -- 1,785 men and women -- overall 
deaths from heart disease rose by about 400, to 5,359. 
  More babies died in that year because they were born too 
small. Almost 24 percent (83 deaths) of infant mortalities in 
1992 were blamed on immaturity, compared with about 15 percent 
(67 deaths) the previous year. 
  A staggering 82,800 patients were treated in hospital 
because 
of injury and poisoning in 1992, making the category the leading 
cause of hospital admission. Of the 1,693 deaths from injury 
and poisoning -- the fifth biggest cause of death in 1992 -- 
almost 45 percent were self inflicted or due to suicide. The 
other main causes of hospital admission were circulatory 
diseases (67,800), cancer (65,000) and normal delivery (54,600). 
  Nearly 3,000 more people were diagnosed with sexually 
transmitted diseases in 1992, making a total of 13,257 cases. 
Almost 60 percent of these were in men aged between 20 to 40 
years. One man died from syphilis. 
  More than 5,000 people were treated in hospital for "the 
effects of a foreign body entering through orifice", while about 
2,560 were admitted because of complications arising from 
previous medical or surgical care. 
  Doctors were unable to diagnose the illness in about 11,300 
cases. Almost 3,400 people died because they were killed or 
fatally injured by other people. One person died because of 
injuries resulting from "operation of war" in 1992.

district was reported to have spread to the interior region. 
Prior to this, three children died of the disease in Simpang 
Kramat. 
  The North Aceh Health Department chief, Dr. T. Marwan Nusri, 
clarified to KOMPAS on 10 Mar that the six victims died in 
Sawang after contracting the disease. They were Syaribanun 
(50), Aisyah (45), Maneh (40), Abidin (65), Maryam (65), and 
Hasan (65). 
  Four of the victims died in their homes while the other two 
died at the health center in Sawang. All of the victims were 
from the interior region, which is far away from the health 
center. 
  It was understood that Dr. Marwan had personally visited the 
affected Sawang district on Wednesday 9 March. At the same time, 
he had distributed medication and taken water samples from 
hundreds of wells around the district. He suspected that the 
well water was contaminated by the virus. Marwan said: " The 
cases which occurred in Sawang were considered as extraordinary." 
  He said that a temporary test conducted indicated that the 
water from a river was unfit for consumption.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 23 KYODO -- The latest report on AIDS 
showed Wednesday [23 March] that 38 Japanese, the highest-ever 
figure, were newly recognized as AIDS patients and HIV carriers 
during a two-month period from January to February. 
  The Health and Welfare Ministry's AIDS surveillance 
committee 
said medical facilities throughout the country reported to the 
committee 66 new AIDS patients and HIV carriers, including the 
Japanese, during the two months. 
  The bimonthly total, 12 more than the previous two-month 
period, brought the total number of those who have contracted 
AIDS and have been infected with HIV to 1,476. 
  Of the 66 new cases, 42 were men and 24 were women, the 
committee said. 
  The figure excludes those infected with the disease via 
blood 
transfusion. 
  Of the new bimonthly figure, 28 were foreigners comprising 
10 
men and 18 women. Most of the women were from Southeast Asia 
and were engaged in the sex business, the committee said. 
  Of the 1,476 AIDS patients and HIV carriers, Tokyo topped 
the 
list with 490, accounting for 33.2 percent of the total, 
followed by Ibaraki Prefecture with 180, Chiba Prefecture with 
108, Kanagawa Prefecture with 91 and Nagano Prefecture with 82,

  [Text] Six more people were found to be infected with the 
virus that causes AIDS and two died of the deadly disease last 
month, health officials said yesterday. Two AIDS victims who 
died March 6 and March 7, respectively, sent shock waves through 
the nation because they hid or did not know of the fact that 
they had been infected with the HIV virus. 
  The Ministry of Health and Social Affairs estimates those 
infected with AIDS across the country at around 1,000, one-third 
of whom are under the ministry's strict health control. 
  The cause of death was found to be connected with the AIDS 
virus one day after a 36-year-old only identified as Ku died 
March 6, a ministry official said. And a man identified as So, 
37, had been dead four days before he was diagnosed as an AIDS 
victim, he added. 
  An Ethiopian seaman was ordered March 14 to leave the 
country 
after he was found to be HIV positive, the official said. He 
was the 43rd foreigner diagnosed as an AIDS carrier. Those 
foreigners are forced to return to their countries. 
  According to the figures released by the Ministry of Health 
and Social Affairs, the country has seen a total of 337 people 
infected with HIV since the first AIDS case was reported in 
Korea in 1985. Of them 44 have died and one emigrated to an 
unknown country. HIV causes AIDS or acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 1 (KCNA) -- Great quantities of 
highly efficacious Koryo medicines are being produced by the 
General Bureau of Koryo medicine production in the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea. 
  According to data available, pharmaceutical factories in 
various parts of the country hit the first quarterly target at 
102.5 percent on the 29th. 
  The pharmaceutical factories under the Pyongyang municipal 
management bureau of Koryo medicine production have topped the 
daily and monthly quotas by expanding the equipment of the 
extracting and enriching processes and raising the standard of 
modernization. 
  The technicians and workers of the central district 
pharmaceutical factory have developed a new pharmaceutical 
material from medicinal herbs abundant in the country and 
introduced it in the production of widely-used medicines by 
pooling their creative wisdom and efforts. 
  The Yomju County pharmaceutical factory under the North 
Phyongan provincial management bureau of Koryo medicine 
production has turned out large quantities of highly efficacious 
medicines with selfmade bonding agents. 
  Pharmaceutical factories under the Kaesong municipal and 
South Phyongan provincial management bureaus of Koryo medicine 
production have produced much more tonics with insam (ginseng) 
and intlers as their main ingredients [words indistinct] 
newly-used medicines than the plan.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, April 2 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- The Ministry 
of Health is setting up special centres in government hospitals 
for prostitutes who are HIV carriers, the Minister Lee Kim Sai 
said here Saturday. The centres would also provide 
rehabilitation programmes to help them change their lifestyle 
and dissuade them from returning to their trade. 
  At present, 140 prostitutes, including 100 foreigners, have 
been detained and found to be infected with HIV, the virus which 
causes AIDS, he told reporters in Seremban, about 60 km south of 
here. 
  Lee said all the foreign prostitutes would be repatriated to 
their country of origin while the 40 local prostitutes would be 
sent to the centres. [Words indistinct] government had 
allocated RM [Malaysian ringgit] 218 million [words indistinct] 
for AIDS prevention activities and awareness campaigns for a 
three-year period beginning 1993. 
  There were now 7,000 HIV carriers in Malaysia, 85 per cent 
of 
whom were drug addicts, who formed the majority of the 150-200 
HIV carriers detected monthly. 
  He said the most prominent problem in the AIDS prevention 
campaign in the country was to convince the high risk groups to 
change their habit and lifestyle. 
  Lee also said that the country's infant mortality rate had 
been reduced from 13 per 1,000 during the Fifth Malaysia Plan 
period (1985-1990) to 11 per 1,000 at present.

  [Excerpt] Kangar, Sat -- Perlis has been hit by cholera and 
health teams are taking every possible measure to prevent the 
disease from spreading. 
  State medical and health services director Dr. Faisal 
Ibrahim 
said today that 10 patients who tested positive for cholera and 
a carrier had been detected since the first case was reported on 
April 6. 
  The victims, aged between seven months and 70 years, are 
mostly living in housing areas and were found to have consumed 
food bought from stalls. 
  The state cholera operations room has been opened to monitor 
developments. 
  Dr. Faisal said health officers were carrying out 
preventative activities, especially among food hawkers and 
handlers in Kangar, Kuala Perlis and Arau since investigations 
revealed that all the victims had consumed food obtained from 
sources outside their homes. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Health Secretary Juan Flavier said yesterday that 
there are eight new cases of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) 
which causes Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS ), 
bringing to 483 the total number of AIDS cases in the 
Philippines this year. 
  Flavier also said the Department of Health (DOH) has decided 
to temporarily withhold the distribution of information, 
education and communication materials earlier found "offensive" 
pending the release of guidelines. 
  As of February this year, Flavier said the total number of 
fullblown AIDS cases was 127 while 77 persons have already died 
of the incurable disease. Of the new cases, four were females 
while the rest were males whose ages ranged from 31 to 33 years 
old. 
  The health department estimated that 50,000 people harbor 
the 
HIV virus but are not aware of it. Less than 500 cases have 
been documented and 116 have resulted in deaths from full-blown 
AIDS. HIV infection in the Philippines is transmitted primarily 
through heterosexual and not homosexual contact. 
  Flavier said that ReachOut [as published] material entitled 
"Lust for Life" which contained pictures of men in anal sex 
would not be released until members of the HIV-AIDS network have 
agreed on the guidelines next week. 
  The material was also reported to have reached school 
children. Apparently, he said, the Filipinos are not yet ready 
for the kind of material which was funded by an American 
organization and aimed at homosexuals. 
  Another non-government organization, Kabalikat [copartner], 
which printed comics on family planning was the subject of 
criticisms by the school and the church sectors. Flavier said 
that the comics contained the use of condoms with the penis in 
an erect position. 
  "As a doctor, I don't find it offensive. But if it affects 
the sensibilities of some people, then we also have to discuss 
this matter," he said. 
  Flavier stressed that the health department cannot censor 
the 
information materials because the DOH lacks specific guidelines.

  [Text] The Department of Health (DOH) reported yesterday 
an outbreak of typhoid fever cases in Camarines Sur in the Bicol 
region and a big drop in the number of measles cases in Region 
12 (Central Mindanao). 
  In a report to Health Secretary Juan Flavier, the regional 
field health office in Region 12 said last January 1994, there 
were only three measles cases admitted to the Cotabato Regional 
Hospital compared to the 49 cases in 1993 in the same month. 
There was one measles case last February. 
  Flavier attributed the 95 percent decrease in the admission 
of measles cases to the previous National Immunization Day (NID) 
programs held nationwide. 
  The immunization coverage for measles in Region 12 -- Sultan 
Kudarat, Lanao del Norte, and North Cotabato -- is 91 percent. 
  Also, the Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP) told 
Flavier the number of typhoid fever cases is rising in Sibobo, 
Calabanga, and Camarines Sur. 
  A team sent to the province last 1 February told Flavier 
that 
there were 34 identified cases in the area. The victims, whose 
ages range from 4 to 64, got sick after drinking contaminated 
water from a shallow well. 
  Flavier said 90 percent of children aged 12 to 59 months in 
the country got high-dose Vitamin A capsules during the 
nutrition service of the DOH dubbed "Araw ng Sangkap Pinoy [Day 
of Philippine Constituent]" last 16 October. 
  About 86 percent of pregnant women nationwide got iodized 
oil 
during the same health program.

  [Text] Cotabato City -- Makabuhay (Dinospora 
rumphi), a wild plant known to be an effective cure for 
typhoid fever, tuberculosis, and other ailments, can prolong the 
life of persons afflicted with Human Immuno-Deficiency Virus 
(HIV). 
  Studies showed that makabuhay has been found to have various 
medical uses. 
  In some tropical countries, the plant is widely used to 
fight 
malaria and is also used as an "abortificent" and as a cure for 
women with irregular menstruation. 
  After learning of makabuhay from the pharmacology department 
of the University of the Philippines [UP], Dr. Eduardo De La 
Fuente Sr., a retired government physician and director of the 
Cotabato Herbal Processing and Pharmaceutical Plant here, 
undertook an extensive study on the "life-giver" herb. 
  The UP Pharmacological Department, led by Dr. Nelia Maramba 
in their studies, found out that the plant can protect the human 
immune system, according to De La Fuente. 
  Appraised of the discovery, doctors tried a makabuhay 
concoction to Sarah Jane (not her real name), a "sex worker" 
found positive of the HIV. 
  Two months ago, Sarah Jane willingly agreed to undergo 
"makabuhay therapy," hoping that her condition would not worsen 
to a full-blown AIDS case. 
  "The purpose of giving the patient makabuhay preparations is 
to prolong the stay of anti-bodies in her body and protect her 
immune system," De La Fuente said. 
  "We will let the virus die of old age while preserving Sarah 
Jane's immune system," he said, admitting though that makabuhay 
has not been medically validated as a drug. 
  He also cautioned that if improperly prepared and wrongly 
taken, "the makabuhay preparation could be extremely toxic and 
could instead do more harm than good." 
  Sr. Florecilla Inzon, a Dominican sister and incumbent 
directress of the Catholic-run Notre Dame Hospital here who 
takes care of Sarah Jane, said that she remains healthy without 
any sign of deterioration in her physical feature. 
  "Dati siyang madalas na nilalagnat ng matagal [She used to 
get long periods of fever quite often]," she said, "pero hindi 
na siya nilalagnat ngayon [but she does not have those fevers 
now]."

district, Nakhon Si Thammarat province, suffer a form of skin 
cancer as a result of ingesting arsenic toxins in the local

  Eighty per cent of all residents in Ron Phibun district and 
some residents in nearby districts have arsenic toxins in their

  The official said local water supplies are polluted by 
arsenic in run-off from ancient tin mines. 
  Consumption of arsenic toxins results in an illness the 
villagers call Khai Dam, or black fever, and induces a kind of 
skin cancer which shows as black spots. A survey of 718 primary 
students showed 125 of them, or 17.4 per cent, have black spots 
on their skin, according to the official. 
  The official said authorities on Tuesday had agreed to 
arrange new water sources for the villagers. 
  It was also planned to dig new water wells in Ron Phibun 
district and to educate villagers about black fever disease. 
  Dr. Chanphen Chupraphawan, from the Thai Public Health 
Research Institute, said providing clean, unpolluted water would 
be an effective way to prevent the spread of black fever. 
  Chanphen said within the next four years, teenagers in Ron 
Phibun will have an 80 per cent risk of getting black fever, 
which could lead to cancer of the lung, kidney and liver.

  [Text] Professor Le Dien Hong, deputy chairman of the 
National Committee for Preventing HIV/AIDS, reported that during 
the first three months of 1994, a total of 197 HIV cases were 
discovered. During the same period, 46 were admitted as AIDS 
patients and 14 died. 
  Thus far, the number of HIV cases in Vietnam has reached 
1,321, among them 1,242 Vietnamese in 29 provinces and 
municipalities. Professor Le Dien Hong said, however, that the 
number of HIV infected persons in Vietnam is dramatically higher 
than the number made public. This is because we have not 
conducted surveys on certain groups of people such as 
prostitutes and drug addicts who are vulnerable to HIV.

in Santiago de las Vegas, has announced that there are 
approximately 60 HIV-positive people participating in the 
outpatient treatment program. Although most seropositive people 
are in sanatoriums, outpatient treatment has been used for years 
with certain patients, who continue to work and who live at 
home. Lately, the number of such people has increased. 
  To place members in the outpatient program, an evaluation

epidemiologists, psychologists, nurses [words indistinct] the 
patients of the essential requirements. 
  Torres, who is deputy director of the largest of Cuba's 11 
AIDS sanatoriums, added that HIV-positive patients must watch 
over their own and other people's health, become responsible, 
stay with the same sexual partner and, if changing partners, 
inform the new partner that they are HIV-positive.

  [Text] Dr. Rigoberto Torres, an expert on AIDS, has told 
this newscast that despite significant economic limitations, 
over 60 participants in a new ambulatory program have their food 
supplies guaranteed and the same access to treatment and 
medicines as hospitalized patients. Torres added that the diet 
program includes eggs, meat, fish, milk, tubers, and vegetables 
to bolster the regular diet received by every Cuban citizen. 
However, Torres acknowledged that this special diet is below the 
4,000-calorie diet the patients received while at the 
sanatoriums, and which is still being provided to those kept 
there. 
  The Cuban hospitalization program began in 1986. Since then, 
1,011 HIV carriers have been detected. However, epidemiologists 
believe that there could be another 200 undetected cases. So 
far, 164 people have died of AIDS, 12 of them due to unrelated 
causes. Full-blown AIDS currently effects 256 individuals. The 
life expectancy of an HIV carrier in Cuba averages 12 years, 
while the average for AIDS cases is 1.5 years. These indexes are 
relatively high in comparison with world statistics.

  [Excerpt] Several months after the neuropathy epidemic, 
only 37 percent of the population in Pinar del Rio takes the 
Neo-Vitaminic 2 vitamin supplement that is given to the 
population for free. This was determined through a survey 
carried out by the center of sociopolitical studies of the 
provincial committee of the Communist Party of Cuba in Pinar del 
Rio. The survey showed 40 percent do not use the supplement 
regularly, nine percent believe they do not need the supplement, 
eight percent took the supplement only for a few months, and 
three percent take other vitamins they consider more 
effective.[passage omitted]

introduction] 
  [Text] Motivated by poor economic prospects, many 
Ecuadorans have traveled to foreign countries to make more 
money. However, the AIDS epidemic caught them there. 
  Since 1984 30 persons have died from Acquired Immune 
Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in the Province of Azuay. The first 
person in this series of deaths was an emigrant who returned 
from the United States with this deadly disease. 
  About 20 persons having the HIV virus are being cared for at 
home or in health centers in Cuenca. Statistics add an 
additional 50 AIDS patients over the past decade in the Province 
of Azuay. 
  Of this total 10 persons were infected with the virus in 
foreign countries, while the remaining 40 caught the disease in 
Ecuador. This reveals the growing danger of the epidemic. 
  Oswaldo Munoz, chief of the Department of Epidemiology in 
the 
Directorate of Health of the Province of Azuay and professor of 
health at the University of Cuenca, considers that the Province 
of Azuay is one of the areas where the incidence of AIDS is a 
cause for concern, although the situation is less serious than 
in the Provinces of Guayas, Pichincha, and Manabi. 
  Munoz said that about 90 percent of those who have died from 
AIDS or suffer from the disease are men, which is explained by 
the fact that sexual promiscuity is more frequent among men than 
among women. 
  Although the Ministry of Health requires doctors to report 
cases of AIDS in a special way, it is impossible to be sure that 
the available, official information covers all of those 
suffering from the disease. However, it probably covers the 
majority of them. 
  The Department of Epidemiology of the Directorate of Health 
of the Province of Azuay has personnel and an office exclusively 
devoted to following the AIDS situation. It even holds workshops 
and distributes reading material with instructions on how to 
prevent this disease which has so far turned out to be incurable. 
  Munoz recalls that there is no vaccination or treatment for 
AIDS and recommends taking the only two valid precautions for 
preventing what is called the disease of the century: sexual 
fidelity and the use of condoms in extramarital intercourse. 
  Professor Munoz is the author of a guide for family 
self-instruction on AIDS, a book published by the Ministry of 
Health under the auspices of the World Health Organization and 
the Pan American Health Organization. The book contains basic 
information on the epidemic, its symptoms, and the population 
most at risk of contracting the disease, among other aspects. 
  The persons suffering from AIDS who have been identified in 
the Province of Azuay belong to a number of social and economic 
groups, which proves that AIDS is a disease which is not limited 
to any special sector of society. Rather, it attacks all groups, 
without distinction. 
  A high percentage of those infected are people who have 
traveled abroad in search of a better personal situation, 
particularly for economic reasons.

  [Text] Guayaquil -- Edgardo Montalvo, president of the 
College of Physicians of the Province of Guayas, has stated that 
the country is experiencing an epidemic of malaria. He announced 
that there are at least 100,000 cases of the disease, of which 
46,200 have been reported by the National Service for the 
Eradication of Malaria (SNEM). 
  Montalvo said that he is deeply concerned. He stated that in 
1992 39,600 positive cases of malaria were reported to the SNEM, 
which means about 72,000 total cases, since it is estimated that 
for each reported case of malaria there is another case which 
has not been reported. 
  In 1993 46,200 positive cases were reported to the SNEM, 
which would amount to a total of 100,000 persons affected by the 
disease. He stressed that in Guayaquil alone 12 persons died of 
malaria in 1993. He attributed the increased number of cases to 
the fact that there has not been a continuous process of 
spraying within and outside the home. He said that the principal 
officials of the SNEM are not specialists in the matter, and 
AID, the Agency for International Development, has stopped 
providing assistance to the SNEM, due to a series of labor, 
morale, and economic instability problems which have arisen. 
Montalvo said that the Province of Esmeraldas, where there are 
more than 12,000 cases of malaria, has become the area most 
seriously affected by the disease. Of those cases of malaria 
about 7,000 are of the so-called malignant type (Falsiparo) and 
more than 5,000 cases are of the so-called benign type (Viva). 
  The Province of Guayas comes next with somewhat less than 
12,000 cases, 6,000 of which are of the benign type and 5,000 of 
the malignant type. In the Province of Manabi there are 7,000 
cases of benign malaria and 3,000 cases of malignant malaria. In 
the other coastal Provinces of Los Rios and El Oro, as well as 
adjacent upland areas in the Province of Austro, there are also 
about 15,000 cases of malaria.

editorial introduction] 
  [Text] Guayaquil -- Dengue fever has been reported in the 
Ayacucho, Ximena, Tarqui, and Febres Cordero areas of Guayaquil. 
Heavy rains are falling on the city and the neighboring 
countryside, although the Office of Civil Defense of the 
Province of Guayas has not reported serious damage from the 
downpour of 9 February. 
  Health authorities in the City of Guayaquil are combining 
their efforts to prevent and fight against endemic diseases such 
as hemorrhagic dengue fever, malaria, and cholera, among other 
illnesses. 
  Furthermore, efforts are being made to avoid the duplication 
of effort, the waste of materials, and squandering of human and 
financial resources. 
  On 9 February technically qualified persons, including Liria 
Mendoza, subsecretary of health, and officials of the municipal 
health service, reviewed the situation at a meeting held at the 
Municipal Offices of Guayaquil. The meeting was presided over by 
Luis Chiriboga, vice president of the Municipal Council of 
Guayaquil. 
  The meeting became necessary due to an outbreak of classic 
dengue fever and an increase in malaria in several outlying 
areas of the city. 
  Cases of dengue fever have been reported in the densely 
populated areas of Ayacucho, Ximena, Tarqui, and Febres Cordero, 
with 94, 343, 133, and 249 persons affected, respectively. 
  Regarding malaria, more than 500 persons have been reported 
as suffering from the disease in the Flor de Bastion area, a 
heavily populated section North of Guayaquil. 
  The persons affected by malaria are receiving specialized 
medical care, and no deaths have been reported so far, nor has 
any case of hemorrhagic dengue fever been recorded. 
  At the same time heavy rains are falling on Guayaquil and 
the 
surrounding province, although, according to the Office of Civil 
Defense of the Province of Guayas, no substantial damage has 
been reported, following the downpour of rain on 9 February. 
  The regions most affected by the diseases are the outlying, 
residential areas of Guayaquil, because they do not have paved 
streets, safe drinking water, sewage systems, and other modern 
city services. 
  Large lakes of water and mud have been left by the rains, 
and 
food is being sold in town squares and other places under 
unsanitary conditions. 
  The City of Guayaquil will work with personnel from other 
services in the area of environmental health to reduce or 
eliminate pools of water, where disease-carrying mosquitoes 
breed. 
  Subsecretary Liria Mendoza participated in the technical 
assessment of the situation, as she has greater experience in 
spraying insecticides, through the National Service for the 
Eradication of Malaria. She will also provide insecticides, 
mosquito netting, and other materials. 
  Antonio Martinez, director of health services of the City of 
Guayaquil, said that if we do not act in an aggressive way, we 
will run the risk of having cases of hemorrhagic dengue fever 
and an increase in other diseases. He explained that, in 
addition to spraying ponds and pools of water, his service will 
provide free medical service in outlying residential areas, 
thanks to which possible outbreaks of epidemics can be detected. 
  The municipal Departments of Sewage and Public Works will 
also take part in efforts to prevent disease through cleaning 
drains and draining ponds, canals, and other areas where 
rainwater has accumulated. 
  A serious case has occurred in the Bastion residential area, 
where stagnant water has caused a major outbreak of malaria 
affecting 85 percent of the people living there. For this reason 
work to drain pools of water is being undertaken on an emergency 
basis. 
  According to technically qualified sources, the increase of 
malaria is in the pernicious form of the virus which causes the 
disease. 
  In the outlying, Bastion area ponds of rain water have 
formed 
which the authorities should drain immediately to prevent an 
increase in the disease. 
  The people have an important role to play in resolving the 
problem. They should cooperate in cleaning up back yards and 
gardens, draining ponds and puddles of water, and disposing of 
objects where water can collect.

<F P=106> [Article by A. Allia: "Tyhpoid Epidemic in Annaba"] </F>
  [Text] Annaba -- Alarmed by rumors of a typhoid epidemic, 
students at the 2,000-bed university housing complex in Sidi 
Amar (Annaba) are raising their voices and demanding strong 
public health measures to stop spread of the disease. 
  Health officials in the wilaya of Annaba admit there was an 
outbreak of typhoid but say major problems were avoided. 
According to Mr. Messikh, a public health official, the first 
typhoid case was reported to the health service on 13 February. 
Other cases followed in the second half of the same month, 
bringing the number of patients under observation to 38. After 
analysis, it was determined that eight people have been stricken 
with the malady, including two cases that required surgical 
intervention. The six others were treated on an out-patient 
basis. 
  According to the Health Department, the epidemic was caused 
by a "cross-connection" (contamination of a potable water 
conduit with waste water) at the university housing complex. 
Investigation by a team of specialists disclosed the fact, 
unbeknownst to local water authority officials, that a 
state-owned road repair enterprise had failed to protect the 
potable water conduit. Holes had been hastily plugged with 
packed earth, creating pools of stagnant waste water. What is so 
bizarre about these revelations is that only the water supply to 
the university housing complex was contaminated, while external 
branch conduits have remained untainted. 
  At all events, according to Dr. Boumaiza, the situation is 
far from alarming. All appropriate steps have been taken to deal 
with the situation. With the ORSEC [Emergency Preparedness Plan] 
plan going into effect early this week, reinforcements arrived 
to beef up the medical corps detachment assigned to the Sidi 
Amar COSU [University Student Council]. Eleven health teams are 
conducting numerous typhoid awareness meetings for the students. 
  A round-the-clock investigative unit was dispatched to Sidi 
Amar, along with three laboratories for bacteriological testing, 
in hopes of totally eradicating the epidemic. A dramatic 
response, but one that will fail unless paired with draconian 
public hygiene measures. Responsibility for such measures 
belongs to COSU officials, Dr. Messikh concluded. 
  The DSPS [public health office] of Annaba wilaya notes that 
several other wilayas are also affected by the typhoid epidemic. 
The number of people infected is not alarming but is worth 
reporting to the general public: 

  -  Skikda: 11 cases 
  -  Khenchela: one case 
  -  Biskra: one case 
  -  Oum 
El-Bouaghi: one case 
  -  Mila: one case 
  -  Tebessa: two cases 
  -  Jijel: 
two cases 
  -  Batna: one case 
  -  Constantine: one case.

  [Text] New Delhi -- More than 30,000 babies in India are 
estimated to be still-born every year, and over 1,20,000 are 
born cretins -- mentally retarded, physically stunted, deaf-mute 
or paralysed -- due to iodine deficiency in mothers, reports PTI. 
  Disclosing this and other adverse effects of iodine 
deficiency, Executive Director of International Council for 
Control of iodine Deficiency Disorders (ICCIDD), Basil S Hetzel, 
said here on Friday that the need for iodine starts even before 
a child is born. 
  He said the total number of still births and neonatal deaths 
attributable to iodine deficiency was over 90,000. "If the 
mother is iodine deficient, the foetus too suffers iodine 
deficiency." 
  When a child is deprived of its iodine needs during the 
period the brain is developing -- last six months of pregnancy 
to the first post-natal year -- the consequences could be 
disastrous, Hetzel said. 
  Describing women of child bearing age and children under the 
age of 15 years as most susceptible to iodine deficiency 
disorders, he said the most common and visible ill-effect is 
goitre, an abnormal swelling in the neck.

  [Text] Ahmedabad, February 13--Poliomyelitis, one of the 
childhood's crippling scourges, will soon be a disease of the 
past in Gujarat, thanks to the massive vaccination programme 
that was launched by the state government some eight years back. 
  Already Gujarat stands on the threshold of totally wiping it 
out; it is in `control grade'. 
  By the end of the present century, just six years from now, 
the dreaded disease will be declared "eradicated," as is the 
goal set by the World Health Organisation and the Centre, the 
minister of state for health, Mr. Shaktisinh Gohil, confidently 
says. 
  Already, consulting paediatricians and orthopaedic surgeons 
conform the decline in cases. In fact, Dr. Kumar Nathani, a city 
paediatrician, said he had seen just seven new cases of polio 
during the last seven years. "All we treat now are the old 
cases," said Dr. Nathani and his physiotherapist wife, Yamini. 
  An orthopaedic surgeon, Dr. Bharat Bhagat, also asserts that 
the disease is fast declining. He should know, being the 
managing trustee of Polio Foundation, which has organised 40 
free polio camps till date, where 15,600 cases, mostly old 
cases, were examined and 2,120 corrective surgical operations 
were performed. 
  Government statistics show that in the first year of the 
massive vaccination programme launched in 1985-86, as many as 
1,012 cases were registered in Gujarat. This fell to 650 in 
1986-87, 156 in 1987-88, then went on rising to 323 in 1991-92 
and then fell again during the last two years to 77 till 
November last. 
  As per the survey report in June 1993, declining trends in 
the occurrence of poliomyelitis are being recorded at the 
national level, as well as in many well-performing states and 
within several districts of other states. 
  The national mass vaccination programme, launched by the 
Centre since 1985-86, has also made a significant dent in the 
occurrence of polio cases. In a single 12-month period, 20 
million children were contacted at least five times, it adds. 
  Before launching of the mass vaccination programme, the 
virulence of the disease in the country was so extensive that 
every year some 200,000 children used to suffer from the disease 
and 2,000 of them used to die. 
  According to a survey conducted by the Union government 
then, 
over 60 per cent of the children became lame due to polio before 
reaching their second birthday. Percent-wise polio resulting in 
physical deformities was 67.6 in urban areas, while in the rural 
areas, the percent was even higher--up to 71.6. In Gujarat, for 
instance, it was reported to be 69 and 71.7 per cent in urban 
and rural areas, respectively. 
  Mr. Gohil states that the government took special care to 
enlist the help of panchayats and anganwadi workers to reach 
ashram schools and anganwadis in deep interiors and inaccessible 
areas to make the programme really effective. 
  To avert the usual occurrence of the disease on a wider 
scale 
during the monsoon months, the minister says that a mop-up 
system has been put in practice, where two doses of polio 
vaccine are administered to all children up to the age of three 
years in March and April. 
  From the beginning of the massive vaccination drive, the 
government took the help of local bodies, medical associations 
and also several voluntary organisations, like Rotary Club, the 
latter even launching a `Polio Plus' programme of its own. 
  The government, and the medical profession aver that the 
credit for the success must go to the mass media, particularly 
to the visual TV media, which gave wide and regular publicity to 
the programme, educating the masses, both in the urban and rural 
areas. 
  The `control grade' for polio, which Gujarat has attained, 
is 
a predecessor to the `elimination grade', when not a single case 
is registered in any of the districts. The next stage will be 
one where not a single case is registered in a three-year 
period. This will come around the year 2,000, it is expected. 
  Specific goals set up by the government for other diseases 
include elimination of neonatal tetanus in all districts by 
1995, reduction in measles cases by 90 per cent by 1995 compared 
to the 1985 level, reduction of deaths and cases due to 
diarrohoeal diseases by 30 per cent and ten per cent by 1985 and 
70 per cent and 25 per cent by the end of this century. 
  According to many private doctors and specialists, this mass 
vaccination programme for various childhood diseases has been 
most effective and the declining trend is not confined to 
poliomyelitis, but also in other childhood scourges such as 
measles, diptheria, whooping cough and neonatal tetanus, which 
cause deaths, debilities and deformities (physical). 
  They are also confident, like the government, that these 
diseases will be declared eradicated in Gujarat in the coming 
years in the same fashion as small pox was declared eradicated 
from the world women 18 years ago.[sentence as printed]

  [Text] Patna, Feb. 18 -- AIDS is threatening to assume a 
menacing proportion in Bihar with 61 HIV positive cases being 
recorded till last December. Out of the 61 HIV positive cases, 
13 have been declared full blown cases of AIDS after the Western 
Blot test. 
  A senior official of the health department, preparing 
anonymity, said the maximum number of Elisa as well as Western 
Blot positive cases have been reported from Patna where 41 HIV 
and eight Western Blot positive cases had been detected so far.

<F P=106> [Article by Ajay Bharadwaj: "Blood Donors Spread AIDS in </F>
Punjab"] 
  [Text] Amritsar, February 23 -- Bhiru has a family of five 
with whom he lives in a shabby corner of the railway platform 
here. Four years ago, he came here from Bihar looking for work. 
To begin with, he tried doing menial jobs which, being a drug 
addict, he found too difficult. 
  He then took to begging, until he stumbled down the more 
lucrative profession of selling blood. He says an agent from a 
private blood bank offered him Rs 40 for a bottle. From then, he 
has been a "regular blood donor," his only means of livelihood. 
  There are more than 150 such Bhirus in the city, inhabiting 
public parks, railway platforms and busstands, who sell their 
blood to eke out a living. The dealers have identified them 
according to their blood groups and whenever they need a 
particular blood type, the professional donors are summoned. 
  In the absence of adequate government facilities, private 
blood banks and nursing homes pay their donors about Rs 50 to Rs 
70 for a unit, the charge between Rs 400 and Rs 700 from 
patient. The price shoots up if it is a scarce group like "O" 
negative. 
  However, what is causing concern are the impurities and 
diseases transmitted through the blood, since the donors live in 
unhygienic conditions. 
  A recent case, in which a patient acquired the AIDS virus 
after getting transfusion at a private hospital here, is 
considered to be the tip of the iceberg. The patient had tested 
HIV negative when he was admitted. 
  Doctors do not discount the possibility that many more 
similar cases may have gone unnoticed, the patient falling prey 
to an un-related disease many years later. 
  According to the health authorities, of the 54 AIDS cases 
detected in the city so far, 17 are believed to have been 
acquired through blood transfusion. 
  Private blood banks are loathe to conduct the mandatory 
tests 
as they would cost about Rs 350 per donor. But in the absence of 
such checks, diseases like malaria, hepatitis and AIDS can get 
through. 
  Amritsar is the only city in the state where licences have 
been issued to private blood banks, and a move is afoot to 
cancel them. But the owners have obtained stay orders from the 
court and thus the business continues. 
  Though there are three licenced dealers in the city, they 
have opened retail outlets near all the prominent government 
hospitals. These were sealed by the authorities last week after 
an AIDS case was detected there. 
  In nursing homes, too, blood banks are operating illegally. 
Relatives or friends of patients are made to donate blood with 
the nursing home keeping a part of it as their commission. 
  The condition of the government-run blood banks, too, is far 
from satisfactory as there are hardly any regular donors or 
storage facilities.

  [Text] Baghdad, Mar 24, (INA)--Iraqi Health Ministry 
confirmed the success of its preventive measures against the 
virus of Acquired Immunity Deficiency Syndrome [AIDS], thus 
keeping Iraq clean from this fatal disease. 
  Official source at the Ministry told INA today, since early 
stages, health authorities in Iraq gave this particular issue a 
great deal of concern to prevent this disease which had recently 
invaded most of the world regions. 
  The Ministry was imposing strict measures on blood tests for 
incomers and carried out examinations on imported human blood to 
verify being free of the AIDS virus. 
  The source made it clear that some AIDS [cases] had been 
recorded in the northern part of Iraq after the 30-state 
aggression of 1991 which had given access to the foreign troops 
inside the Kurdish autonomy area the matter that left this 
region beyond the monitoring of health authorities. 
  The source concluded by saying that further precautions had 
been adopted by the Iraqi authorities to prevent the spread of 
AIDS from the area lies under the control of the pro-Western 
elements to the rest parts of the country. [Sentence as received]

<F P=106> [Report by AL-THAWRAH correspondent 'Ali al-Na'a'as] </F>
  [Text] A study compiled by UNICEF says that 12 percent of 
Iraqi children under five years of age suffer from acute 
malnutrition due to the economic blockade imposed on our country. 
  The study added that the death rate among children has also 
increased so that deaths among breast-feeding children are 
estimated at 92 out of every 1,000 births, and deaths among 
children below the age of five are estimated at 128 out of every 
1,000 live births. 
  Regarding health and other environmental effects of the 
economic blockade on our Iraqi people, the study has noted that 
several diseases -- such as measles, polio, diphtheria, and 
dysentery -- which could have been prevented by vaccination, 
have reappeared in Iraq due to the embargo on medicines. The 
Ministry of Health has organized a joint campaign with UNICEF in 
order to control these diseases. 
  Regarding water supply and sewage networks, the study noted 
that these networks have been seriously affected by the economic 
embargo, which has caused a shortage of spare parts and support 
equipment. This has led to a scarcity of drinking water both in 
the cities and in rural areas. 
  The blockade has also had a great effect on elementary 
education. The UNICEF report said that the great shortage in 
school's requisites and equipment has lowered the standard of 
education and increased the number of failures, especially among 
girls.

  [Editorial Report] Baghdad AL-JUMHURIYAH in Arabic on 9 
March publishes an approximately 4,000-word report on a 
four-hour seminar held by the newspaper on the health situation 
in Iraq and the performance of the Iraqi Ministry of Health. 
The date of the seminar is not given. The seminar, which is 
moderated by AL-JUMHURIYAH Chief Editor Salah al-Mukhtar, hosts 
Dr. Shawqi Murqus, senior under secretary of the Iraqi Ministry 
of Health, several Health Ministry officials, and a number of 
specialist physicians. 
  The moderator opens the seminar by stating that the Ministry 
of Health has become the subject of criticism, as people have 
continued to air their grievances regarding the health services 
rendered to citizens. He adds that some of these grievances are 
justified, while others lack accuracy. He acknowledges that 
there are some loopholes that need to be plugged, and that some 
individual practices need to be corrected. He maintains that 
those voicing criticism have forgotten that Iraq is subjected to 
a medicine embargo that is denying Iraq free access to medical 
requirements. He then invites the AL-JUMHURIYAH press team to 
ask their questions and voice their remarks regarding the health 
situation in the country. 
  One reporter complains of uncleanliness and malnutrition in 
state-owned hospitals. Another reporter notes the scarcity of 
children vaccines and medicine shortages at these hospitals. He 
adds that some medical employees are asking for, and obtaining 
bribes. He also notes the deterioration in the performance of 
some high tech medical equipment. Furthermore, he charges that 
private medical institutions are charging high prices. To 
corroborate their arguments, reporters cite grievances contained 
in letters received by the paper. 
  Respsonding to these grievances, Dr. Shawqi Murqus, senior 
under secretary of the Iraqi Ministry of Health, pays tribute to 
the Iraqi medical institutions and personnel for protecting Iraq 
against epidemics in war conditions. Had it not been for the 
conscientiousness, honesty, and personal integrity of Iraqi 
medical personnel, epidemics would have spread in Iraq in the 
aftermath of the Gulf war, Dr. Murqus adds. 
  Baghdad AL-JUMHURIYAH in Arabic on 14 March continues to 
report on the seminar held by the paper on the health situation 
in Iraq. It publishes on page seven an approximately 4,500-word 
report on the seminar prepared by Nu'man Sirt and Asma' Muhammad 
Mustafa. 
  In this report, Dr. Murqus notes the "criminal economic 
embargo" clamped on Iraq, and its repercussions on the health 
situation in the country. To show how difficult it is for the 
Iraqi Ministry of Health to purchase medicines, he cites 
Britain's "inhumanity", as illustrated by its failure to 
authorize the shipment to Iraq of medicines for angina pectoris, 
although Iraq had concluded agreements in this regard with 
British medicine manufacturers. 
  Dr. Murqus adds: "The British Government has banned the 
shipment of Angised, a product of Bruce Wellcome, although the 
British manufacturer had received the cost of the purchases, 
which totaled $150,000. The British are well aware that this 
medicine is used by angina pectoris victims, and that the 
failure to supply patients with it could lead to death." 
  When pressed further, citing Iraq's need for this medicine, 
the British Government replied that the medicine in question 
contains small granules of a material called glyceryl 
trinitrate, and contended that trinitrate is used in the 
production of explosives. 
  With regard to the services the Iraqi Ministry of Health is 
rendering to the population, Dr. Murqus says: "The Ministry of 
Health provides 250,000 patients suffering from chronic 
illnesses with the necessary medicines throughout the year, 
without interruption. A one-month or two-month interruption in 
the supplies of these medicines means inevitable death. These 
medicines are dispensed to patients through government outlets, 
namely, popular clinics." 
  Dr. Murqus adds that the ability to provide these patients 
with medicines throughout the year since the enforcement of the 
UN sanctions is a "great accomplishment." 
  The Health Ministry official admits that some ministry 
medicines are sold on the black market. Nevertheless, he claims 
that Iraqi physicians are conscientious and creative, and that 
they are conducting sophisticated brain and heart surgery under 
the tough embargo circumstances. He also commends the efforts 
made by Iraqi preventive medicine personnel, who have protected 
Iraq from malaria and cholera. He says that cholera surfaced in 
the country in 1991 only to disappear in 1992. He also notes 
the services offered by the private medical institutions in the 
country, and admits that they charge high prices to patients. 
He expresses hope that the medical system in Iraq will be 
refurbished and developed once the embargo is lifted. 
  Baghdad AL-JUMHURIYAH in Arabic on 21 March continues to 
report on the seminar held by the paper on the health situation 
in the country. It publishes on page 7 an approximately 
4,000-word report on the seminar. 
  Dr. Murqus comments on remarks made by the reporters 
regarding the need for a police report before accident victims 
are admitted to hospital. The moderator cites examples of 
doctors in state-owned health clinics prescribing medicines 
without examining patients, underscoring the seriousness of the 
problem. A Health Ministry official replies by saying that 
there will be stricter monitoring of medical practice. The 
moderator argues that the media should assist health 
institutions by monitoring the health situation in the country, 
enlightening citizens, and reporting problems and grievances. 
  Concluding the seminar, the moderator says that 
AL-JUMHURIYAH 
is ready to dedicate a weekly column to clarifications from the 
Ministry of Health in order to help the ministry enlighten 
people and clarify some matters which might have been 
misunderstood by the public. 
  This appears to be the final report on the seminar, as the 
paper's 21 March edition does not promise any further reportage. 
  Jordan Bureau does not plan any further processing of the 
Baghdad AL-JUMHURIYAH.

  [Text] Hoof-and-mouth disease has broken out among 
hundreds of livestock herds in villages in Samaria and in the 
Qalqilyah region. The Veterinary Service has ordered all 
kibbutzim and agricultural settlements in Israel to take 
precautionary measures and to prohibit outside vehicles from 
entering their farms. 
  In the villages near Qalqilyah, entire herds have died after 
contracting the disease. Over 200,000 animals in Samaria have 
been inoculated so far in a lightning vaccination drive. Our 
correspondent Shulamit Schmerling reports that Israeli farmers 
fear their herds will contract the disease, especially through 
transmission by deer in northern Israel.

  [Text] Kathmandu, April 6 (AFP) -- The seasonal diseases 
like meningitis and diarrhoea have claimed the lives of at least 
35 people over the last week in Nepal, an official of the Public 
Health Office said Wednesday. 
  Of the 35, at least 21 died of diarrhoea in Pajaru, Jajarkot 
district, 300 kilometres (187 miles) northwest of here because 
of contaminated water, he said, adding a medical team had been 
sent to the area. [passage omitted] 
  "Similarly, fourteen children fell victim to the killer 
disease, meningitis in the Nepalese capital over the week," he 
said. 
  "People also fall victim to seasonal diseases during the 
monsoon season (May-August) in Nepal when they drink polluted 
flood waters," he said. 
  But a television report on the deaths of the children and 
those who fell ill due to meningitis, has panicked parents in 
Kathmandu who have rushed to private clinics to get vaccines, 
witnesses said. 
  The Infectious Diseases Control Department at a hospital in 
Kathmandu used to provide free anti-meningitis vaccines, but has 
now run out of stock, a doctor said. 
  Private clinics were charging about four dollars for a shot, 
he said, but added "people need not get panicked by the death 
rate because it is an average rate at this time of the season."

<F P=106> [Andrey Gavrilenko report: "Health Deteriorating, but No </F>
Increase in Medicine. Difficult Situation Developing With 
Medical Supplies for Pacific Fleet Servicemen"] 
  [Text] Vladivostok -- Quite recently it used to be far 
safer going to military doctors for help than their civilian 
counterparts. Now when the health of the draft contingent is 
deteriorating every year the job of military medical staff is 
becoming more and more difficult. And not just because last 
year for instance the number of instances of scabies, 
tuberculosis, and diphtheria in the Pacific Fleet alone almost 
trebled. 
  In some garrison hospitals patients are already being placed 
in two-tier bunks. There is a catastrophic shortage of medical 
staff, who even in the past did not have the luxury of high 
wages. The supply of ambulances is just over half the required 
level and those that are still in operation are well and truly 
worn out. 
  According to Colonel (Medical Service) Nikolay Popov, chief 
of the Pacific Fleet main hospital, a sick servicemen today no 
longer has guarantees that he will be able to receive the full 
course of treatment he requires. At present for instance there 
are no broad-spectrum antibiotics, medicines to treat cerebral 
circulation disorders, and effective antiulcerative 
preparations. The medical equipment with which the fleet's 
medical establishments are equipped is by no means perfect. 
Above all there is a shortage of apparatus to study small 
vessels and the gastrointestinal tract, computerized tomographs, 
which enable early diagnosis, and much else besides. 
  At the same time, Colonel (Medical Service) Gennadiy Shokin, 
acting head of the Pacific Fleet Medical Service, said that the 
health of the young men turning up for service in the fleet is 
getting worse with every year. Thus, one in five new draftees 
is not fit for service among the seagoing personnel, one in six 
has circulation problems, one in seven has a gastric ulcer, and 
one in 10 has abused drugs before being drafted. Some 30 
percent of future seamen are underweight and almost 20 percent 
are suffering from psychiatric disorders. 
  In 1993 around 400 young men who turned up for service in 
the 
Pacific Fleet were sent home before swearing the oath and almost 
as many seamen again were discharged on health grounds in the 
first three months of service. 
  If the prevailing situation is not put right, there will 
soon 
be simply no one to serve in the fleet.

<F P=106> [Article by A. Sarkisov, academician of the Russian Academy </F>
of Agricultural Sciences: "The Scientists Warn.... The Grain 
Beneath the Snow May Be Poisonous" -- first two paragraphs are 
editorial introduction] 
  [Excerpts] Two interdepartmental commissions of the 
Russian Security Council -- on protecting the population's 
health, and on ecological safety -- analyzed at a joint session 
on 9 March the alarming situation on the food market in the 
country, and drew the public's attention particularly to the 
danger which has arisen in many places of food products and feed 
grain being contaminated with mycotoxins, leading to the 
possibility of highly dangerous diseases in people and animals. 
  Professor A.Kh. Sarkisov, academician of the Russian Academy 
of Agricultural Sciences and founding father of mycotoxicology, 
tells us what mycotoxins are, how they can harm the health of 
people and animals, where and how they form, and how they could 
get into our food. 
  Sarkisov begins: Quite soon, the field work will 
begin throughout the country, and of course, the chief tasks are 
connected with the sowing. And here rural workers will come up 
against an unusual factor -- the need first to clear the fields 
of sowings of grain crops which should have been harvested last 
fall. As is well known, these crops were left on millions of 
hectares -- they disappeared under the snow. 
  Of course, this has happened before. In some years it cost 
the lives of many people and animals, before the causes of a new 
"unknown" disease were analyzed. 
  The land, especially its upper layer of cultivated soil, is 
a 
very complex living organism in which micro-organisms invisible 
to the naked eye -- and there can be as many as 100 billion of 
them in a single cubic centimeter of soil -- are actively 
participating in increasing its fertility. However, among them 
there are also microscopic fungi, most often types of fusarium, 
which have the capacity to infect grain which is left standing 
in the soil: They render it toxic to man and animals. [passage 
omitted] 
  The safe way to ensure protection against mycotoxicosis, as 
our past experience has shown, is to carry out the following 
obligatory measures. First, it is necessary in a short space of 
time to carry out, on the farm and for the rayon as a whole, a 
complete count of all areas with unharvested grain crops still 
on the root or in swathes, windrows, etc. Agricultural organs 
must be informed of the results of the count, and where 
infection of grain crops with toxic fusariums was noted earlier, 
the appropriate measures must be adopted. That means regions of 
the North Caucasus, the Volga (Tataria, Bashkiria 
[Bashkortostan], Mordovia, Udmurtia), Siberia, the Orenburg 
region, the Urals, and Altay and Krasnoyarsk Krays, as well as 
certain regions of Kazakhstan. The latest research has shown 
that 60 percent or more of wheat samples, even in Krasnodar 
Kray, contained mycotoxins. This was due to last year's weather 
conditions and the frequent precipitation. [passage omitted]

the threat of a Tuberculosis epidemic in the near future. Last 
year about 3,000 persons with Tuberculosis were registered in 
the city. The medics are also worried by the fact that the

started to grow in Moscow. 
  The so-called high-risk groups consist first of all, of 
tramps, drunkards, and refugees who live mostly in the central

<F P=106> [Article by I. Lipikhin under the "News" rubric: "Conflict </F>
at the Ambulance Service"] 
  [Text] A group of Ambulance Service workers has announced 
its intent to strike. Moscow residents know that this is not the 
first attempt of the people in the white coats to resort to 
extreme measures. Newspapers reported on conflict situations at 
the ambulance service two years ago. And what is the reason for 
today's discord? First, a portion of the collective has come 
out against the imminent reorganization of the ambulance service 
and emergency medical service. Second, the ambulance service 
workers believe that their service is not receiving adequate 
attention from Moscow's government. Is this so? 
  In just nine months of the past year, the Main Medical 
Administration spent an additional 2.34 million rubles to 
increase the wages of the ambulance service's personnel, 
8,856,000 rubles to insure the lives of the service's workers, 
and 84,811,000 rubles to feed them. Each worker sent on a call 
is provided with special clothing. And that costs nearly 100,000 
rubles. The money was allocated systematically, beginning in 
January 1993 when the ruble "hovered" much higher than now. 
  By directive of Moscow's mayoralty, seven substations will 
be 
built in 1994-1995 in rayons of new construction, and an 
additional 13 substations and 4 base garages are slated to 
become operational by 1998. 
  Still unresolved is the question of supplying the ambulance 
service with vehicles. In the past 2 years, the motor vehicle 
combine of the Moscow Administration of Motor Medical Transport 
[Mosavtosantrans] received a total of 65 vehicles for the 
ambulance service. And that's what they got even though each 
year about 400 vehicles become unsuitable for operation. As a 
result, each day there are 160 to 200 vehicles out of service. 
Why has so critical a situation come about? 
  The problem is that the RAF [expansion not given] microbuses 
for the ambulance service are manufactured in the Baltics. They 
must be paid for in foreign exchange -- and in no small amount. 
And according to specialists' estimates, they can serve a total 
of 4 years and 7 months. That is in theory. In practice, the 
little RAFs break down after 1 1/2 or 2 years of operation. 
  To solve the problem of providing transport vehicles for the 
ambulance service, Moscow's government has sought the means to 
buy 220 Mercedes vehicles. Twenty of them are already in 
operation in the city, and beginning in February, another 10 
vehicles will begin operating in Moscow every day. Furthermore, 
the matter of purchasing the medical version of the RAF microbus 
is not being decided. 
  But as far as strikes are concerned, no one has yet 
abolished 
the Criminal Code article regarding responsibility for failure 
to provide medical assistance.

announcement that on 25 January 1994 Anatoliy Solovyev, head of 
Moscow's Main Medical Administration, signed an order regarding 
reorganization of the Ambulance Service station. The 
announcement stated that this was done without the consent of 
the service's personnel and in violation of the law "Regarding

<F P=106> [Interfax article under the "Medicine" rubric: "Ambulance </F>
Service Has Begun Strike; Corpses Will Not Be Removed From the 
Streets"] 
  [Text] Yesterday a portion of the workers of Moscow's 
Ambulance Service began a strike. According to preliminary data, 
10 riding teams of physicians at 8 ambulance service substations 
began a strike. At the same time, in the words of strike leader 
Leon Akopov, the strike included 10 substations of the 44 in 
operation in Moscow. 
  The main reason for the ambulance workers' strike is a 
disagreement between some of the workers and the Main Medical 
Administration over reorganization of the service. The strikers 
are also insisting that collective agreements be reached and are 
demanding the removal of Nikolay Pirotskiy, chief physician of 
Moscow's ambulance service. 
  The strike is occurring in the following form: A team will 
respond to patient calls, but they will only complete half of 
the medical chart for the patient. During the strike, ambulance 
service workers will not remove corpses from Moscow's streets 
either.

  [Text] The mass vaccination of children under the age of 5 
conducted by the republic's Ministry of Health with UN 
assistance is being completed in Azerbaijan. 
  Cases of poliomyelitis and diphtheria in the republic, which 
have become more frequent, represent one of the many sad signs 
of today. The system of compulsory vaccinations of children, 
which formerly was organized efficiently, like many other 
things, has collapsed. The catastrophic shortage of vaccines, 
which previously were received from Russia, and the presence of 
more than 1 million refugees are the reasons for this. 
  As we were told at the Main Administration of Sanitary and 
Epidemiological Supervision of the Ministry of Health of 
Azerbaijan, in the course of this campaign, already the second 
in succession, 900,000 children throughout the republic, not 
taking Baku into account, have received vaccinations against 
poliomyelitis, diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough. For this 
purpose more than 3,000 medical workers have been sent to 
refugee camps in all regions of Azerbaijan. The UN Children's 
Fund undertook to provide the necessary preparations and 
disposable syringes.

<F P=106> [Article by Anda Mikelsone: "Number of Tuberculosis Cases in </F>
Latvia Increases"] 
  [Text] Riga, Feb.4. There has been an increase in 
tuberculosis morbidity and mortality during the past year. In 
comparison with 1992, tuberculosis morbidity has increased by 
14.8%, and mortality -- by 44%. The total number of 
tuberculosis cases in 1993 was 868, while in the 1992 -- it was 
771. 
  Inta Pavlovska, director of the data processing and registry 
division of the State Tuberculosis and Lung Disease Center 
informed DIENA that the increase in tuberculosis morbidity could 
be related to the poor socioeconomic conditions in the nation, 
as well as shortcomings in the legislative process. At the 
present time, there are no laws in Latvia that would require 
infectious cases of tuberculosis to undergo mandatory treatment. 
  In November of the past year, the Department of Health of 
the 
Ministry of Welfare submitted a medical legislative proposal to 
the Cabinet of Ministers, which would require infectious cases 
of tuberculosis to undergo mandatory treatment, explained I. 
Pavlovska. To this day, the proposal to the Cabinet of Ministers 
has still not been reviewed. 
  At present, Latvia has 11 state tuberculosis hospitals, 
providing treatment for tuberculosis cases free of charge. The 
newest of these -- Ceplisi (in Ogre rayon), only started 
operations in January of this year. Most of the patients 
there, however, are chronic alcoholics who suffer from 
tuberculosis.

<F P=106> [Article by Antra Gabre: "Number of Syphilis Victims </F>
Increased Three-Fold"] 
  [Text] What an era! What morals! -- What else can be said 
after hearing that a female employee of an intimacy club 
infected her two year old son with syphilis last year. In 1993, 
overall, according to data from the State Clinical Center for 
Skin Diseases (formerly the Skin and Venereal Disease 
Dispensary), in the course of everyday life, "thanks" to their 
parents, two children have developed gonorrhea and two syphilis. 
  According to the figures for last year, the morbidity rate 
increased three-fold for syphilis, 1.2 fold for gonorrhea, while 
the morbidity rate for fungal diseases increased 1.2 fold, and 
urogenital chlamydial infection was a common diagnosis. 
Furthermore, these are not absolute indices, only the registered 
cases, and many people seek the services of private medical 
firms for treatment of their venereal diseases. 
  A three-fold increase in syphilis is a very high index, and 
the prognosis by specialists at the center is that syphilis 
morbidity will not decline. In 1993, 45 per 100,000 inhabitants 
suffered from this disease in 1993 (in 1992, the respective 
number was 13), with the majority being women, and for gonorrhea 
-- the respective number was 204 (153 in 1992), with the 
majority being men. In 1992, those suffering from venereal 
diseases were persons with a higher education, while last year, 
69% of all patients had a mid-level education, 53% 
-- from 20 
to 29 years of age. Unfortunately, the statistics for last year 
show that even 13 to 14 year old girls have had to seek help 
from venereal disease specialists. 
  Children are primarily infected by fungal diseases -- which 
are passed on to them by infected animals. There is quite a 
number of "wild" cats roaming the streets of Riga, and, 
therefore, parents should look out for their children. In 
comparison with 1992, the number of skin disease cases was lower 
for this past year. Deputy chief physician Dace Galvina explains 
this as related to the institution of patient fees, and the 
relocation of dermatologists to the State Clinical Center for 
Skin Diseases, the result of which is that patients from the 
outlying rayons of the city do not visit these specialists. 
  Likewise, lice infestation, or pediculosis, is becoming more 
widespread. Not only head lice, but also clothing lice have been 
observed. They are primarily being spread by vagrants, beggars 
and the very poor. In Riga, there are two locations where a 
person can be deloused -- the bathhouse at 249 Brivibas Street 
and the Riga Disinfection Station -- but because there is lack 
of means, not everyone can afford to pay for this service. 
  Dr. Galvina reminds us that during the first six months of 
this year, while the Center for Sexually Transmitted Diseases is 
being set up on Pernavas Street, patients may visit venereal 
disease specialists at the State Clinical Center for Skin 
Diseases.

<F P=106> [Article by Iver Hoj: "Private Hospitals in Financial </F>
Squeeze"] 
  [Text] More and more Danes are being treated at private 
hospitals. But it is not easy to make ends meet. There are too 
many beds for the small market. 
  The operations are successful, the patients survive and are 
satisfied, but the hospitals are in financial trouble. 
  Danish private hospitals have high medical standards and 
luxurious accommodations. Nevertheless, they continue to have 
big budget problems. The two largest private hospitals, as a 
consequence, have altered their course in the past few months. 
  Most recently, Mermaid, a private hospital in Ebeltoft, has 
cut its operating costs by 10 million kroner. The hospital has 
also convinced its creditors to cancel half of its outstanding 
debt and for a third time the hospital is out looking for new 
capital, this time, 10 to 12 million kronor. At the same time, 
the entire management has resigned and will be replaced in the 
spring. 
  A total of 200 million kronor has been lost on the hilltop 
above Ebeltoft since Mermaid opened its doors in 1989. 
  On the other hand, "Danmark" Health Insurance provides 
substantial payment for care in private hospitals. 
Administrative Director Preben Hentzen has a number of 
explanations for why there are so many problems with the 
industry: 
  "The number of beds in private hospitals is growing faster 
than the number of patients. It takes time for Danes to get used 
to paying for treatment," he stated matter-of-factly, and also 
pointed to the fact that patients from one county can get a new 
knee or a new hip at hospitals in another county and get 
treatment faster -- for free. 
  There are about 200 beds in private hospitals in Denmark. 
The 
largest are Mermaid with 37 beds and Hamlet, a private hospital 
in Frederiksberg, with 33 beds. There are a number of smaller 
ones as well. An example of a successful one is Erichsen's 
Clinic in Charlottenlund, which is about to expand to 22 beds 
and is in good financial shape. 
  But an industry-watcher finds that private patients bring 
the 
hospitals earnings of only about 100 million kroner, when 
treatments for infertility are not figured in. 
<H5>  Coming In </H5>
  Mermaid has a turnover of 70 to 80 million kroner. But a 
quarter of this comes from infertility treatments. The hospital 
has also made an agreement with Frederiksborg County to perform 
a number of operations. 
  But it has not been enough. The debt to Realkredit Danmark 
has now been reduced from 110 million kroner to 60 million. That 
cuts the rent in half. The Kirkbi Corp., which owns the 
hospital's equipment, has also consented to reduce the 
hospital's leasing payments significantly. The staff has been 
reduced from 90 to 75. 
  All this has given Board Chairman Frank Bottrup confidence 
in 
the future: 
  "We had 11,000 to 12,000 patients in 1993 and turnover of 70 
to 80 million kroner. We are experiencing a very slight rise in 
patient intake. If we maintain the same turnover, the books 
could balance--for the first time," he said. 
  But first he must find new management. Administrative 
Director Sten Christensen, the medical director, the head nurse, 
and a financial officer resigned after having put together and 
won approval for 10 million kroner in cutbacks. 
  "We have a promise of 5 to 6 million kroner of new capital. 
We are now looking for a corresponding sum. I would like to have 
it resolved by the end of this month. It would be 
overdramatizing it, however, to call it a race against time," 
said Bottrup. 
  Hoj: What has gone wrong? 
  Bottrup: The interest is there and the competition 
from the public sector is not the problem. But patients from 
abroad have never come. And earlier, "Danmark" paid 85 percent 
of the actual costs. Beginning in 1993, the fixed contribution 
was reduced so that now patients must pay 40 percent themselves. 
That brought Mermaid's turnover down to a new level. 
  Preben Hentzen of `Danmark' said that it was necessary to 
change the regulations because there was too great a price 
differential from hospital to hospital, and that now it was 
working satisfactorily. But he cannot confirm that Mermaid is 
getting more patients. On the contrary: 
  "If the intake at Mermaid is rising, the patients cannot be 
members of `Danmark.' In 1993, we paid out more for care at 
private hospitals than we did in 1992, but it was spread over a 
number of clinics. There were fewer patients at Mermaid who 
received insurance payments," said Hentzen, who felt that the 
Ebeltoft location was geographically unfortunate for a hospital: 
  "People do not want to travel to Mols for a service they 
could just as easily get in Copenhagen." 
<H5>  Hamlet </H5>
  Hamlet, located in Frederiksberg, opened its doors in April 
of 1993 and presented new competition for Mermaid. At Hamlet 
they are also saying: "Next year." 
  The French-English concern, GHG, withdrew from ownership at 
the end of last year after a disappointing first year. The 
hospital is now owned solely by Danica and Rasmussen &amp; 
Schiotz. 
  "January was not as bad as expected. February looks 
promising," said Hamlet administrative director Anne-Marie 
Traberg optimistically. 
  She is expecting a turnover of 50-60 million kroner this 
year. If this materializes, the hospital will expand next year 
and move closer to a time when the figures will move from red to 
black, which they will at about 70 million. 
  "Patients began to come in the fall and we expect about 
5,000 
patients this year. Danes are feeling increasingly confident 
about private hospitals and are starting to regard us as a 
natural part of the hospital community," she said.

With 90 new cases in 1992 and 58 new cases in 1991 the 
development is going as expected. 
  "The industrialized nations have economic resources and 
medical competence and can control the spread of AIDS and HIV. 
Developing countries are poor and are unable to do so," noted 
Associate Professor Markku Loytonen. 
  Loytonen and Professor Pauli Leinikki of the Public Health 
Institute co-authored the book Kaikki AIDSista [All About 
AIDS]. Leinikki also stressed the problems developing 
countries struggle with when it comes to preventing the spread 
of HIV, as well as Finland's international responsibility. 
  "Finland should do more on the international level," he said 
and mentioned Norway as an example. 
  Norway has an organization for medicine in developing 
countries that uses state funds in its efforts to prevent the 
spread of AIDS in Africa.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Campaign for Increased Condom Use To </F>
Reduce Number of Abortions"] 
  [Excerpts] Finland is in the vanguard as far as the number 
of abortions is concerned. Last year 9.7 abortions were 
performed per 1,000 women between the ages of 15 and 19, about 
half the number that were performed in the 1980's. In the United 
States the corresponding figure is five times higher. The goal 
of the Population and Family Welfare Federation's new campaign, 
which is aimed at ninth graders, is to cut the number of 
abortions in half again by the year 2000, and at the same time 
reducing the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases [STD's]. 
[passage omitted] 
<H5>  Condoms Accepted </H5>
  Associate Professor Pekka Lahteenmaki, senior medical 
officer 
of the Family Welfare Federation's family planning clinic, feels 
that today's young people are increasingly accepting condoms as 
a contraceptive. Some 14 million condoms are used in Finland 
annually. [passage omitted] 
  Condoms are the only contraceptive method that also provide 
protection against sexually transmitted diseases. And the latest 
disease statistics show that cases of gonorrhea and syphilis 
have declined, while chlamydia has increased somewhat. 
  There were 575 HIV cases at the end of last year, of which 
149 had developed AIDS, and 106 of these had died. Statistics 
are unavailable for condyloma and herpes. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Five Cases of HIV Infection in </F>
Pregnant Women"] 
  [Text] Five cases of infection were found in anonymous HIV 
tests at maternal counseling clinics last year. All pregnant 
women were tested. 
  No one knows who the infected women are. The tests were not 
provided with identification information. Around 65,000 tests 
were performed in all, the Public Health Institute disclosed in 
its publication. 
  Professor Pauli Leinikki of the Public Health Institute's 
HIV 
laboratory considers the number of cases that were found 
surprisingly high. In his opinion it shows how important it is 
to have an HIV test when visiting a clinic. However a test where 
the mother's identity is disclosed cannot be made against her 
will. 
  The AIDS situation in Finland is still the best in the 
western world, in the opinion of people at the Public Health 
Institute. According to preliminary reports only 56 new cases of 
HIV infection were recorded last year. That is clearly fewer 
than the year before.

<F P=106> Article by Nina Sergelius </F>
  [Editorial Report] According to an article on page 5 in 
Helsinki HUFVUDSTADSBLADET by Nina Sergelius, authorities do not 
see any immediate need to act against the rapid increase in 
Helsinki street prostitution, but plan to monitor the situation 
closely, especially with respect to sexually transmitted 
diseases (STD) and AIDS. The Helsinki City Council asked the 
police, social service and public health officials to comment on 
the problem. One worrisome aspect they noted was the influx of 
prostitutes from Russia and Estonia over the last few years. The 
council accepted the argument from social workers that 
criminalizing prostitution would make especially alien 
prostitutes more reluctant to visit physicians, and that the 
whole problem of prostitution could be more effectively dealt 
with through "social policy measures." 
<H5>  Reduction in Venereal Disease Cases </H5>
  Despite the appearance of open prostitution -- something 
which was virtually nonexistent in postwar Finland until the 
current recession started in 1990 -- the STD incidence has 
steadily decreased. Statistics from the National Health Public 
Health Service, for example, show that registered gonorrhea 
cases declined from 645 in 1990 to 141 in 1993, and chalmydia 
cases from 2,150 in 1990 to 1,607 in 1993. What was remarkable 
to the author, however, was that 54 percent of those diagnosed 
with gonorrhea in 1993 had been infected abroad. The 
corresponding figure for 1990 was 15 percent. Of those who had 
been infected abroad, 39 percent had gotten the disease in 
Russia and 37 percent in Estonia. 
  The incidence of AIDS is continuing to increase. At the end 
of 1992 the HIV/AIDS treatment hospital in Helsinki had 180 HIV 
positive patients. By the end of last year this figure had risen 
to 211. 
  Given the inverse trend between Helsinki prostitution and 
STD's, however, the Public Health Service joined other offices 
in only adopting a policy of careful monitoring the situation.

  [Text] Finance Minister Theo Waigel, Christian Social 
Union, wants to scrap federal financial support for AIDS 
information. Under the Finance Ministry's medium-term financial 
plan, expenditures on information about the illness and its 
prevention is to be reduced from 20 million German marks [DM] 
this year to zero by 1997. The Federal Central Office for 
Health Information, which will have to disband its AIDS 
department, is not the only organization that will be affected 
by the Bonn savings program. German AIDS Help, an umbrella 
organization to which 130 AIDS groupings belong, will also 
experience financial difficulty. As federal funds are to be 
reduced to DM16 million next year and to DM11 million in 1996, 
Waigel's officials want to cut down on the information campaign 
in the new laender above all. The argument is that there are 
still not that many AIDS cases there.

<F P=106> ["mha"-signed report: "Valuable Results of D-2 Mission"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Bonn, 24 March -- Approximately 11 months after 
the second German space lab mission D-2, not all results of the 
experiments that were carried out during the flight have been 
evaluated. However, the findings that have been obtained so far 
justify a positive balance sheet, the scientific leader of the 
project, Professor Sahm, stated on Thursday [24 March] in Bonn. 
Members of the German Agency for Space Matters (Dara) and of the 
German Research Institute for Aviation and Astronautics (DLR) 
announced the major results of the 10-day mission. 
  Sahm reported about the surprise finding that biological 
cells do not develop the usual box-shape form in a state of 
weightlessness, but that they take on a roundish shape, develop 
thinner cell walls, and that their energy consumption and 
metabolism drop clearly. This unexpected behavior must be 
investigated further. 
  The same applies to the measurement of so-called diffusion 
coefficients, that is physical quantities that are decisive for 
the mixing and separating of liquid substances. These 
characteristic values are indispensable for reliable computer 
simulations of such processes that make new developments 
possible. Yet new findings in the sphere of human medicine, 
including the discovery of a new kidney hormone, and new 
insights in the functioning of the lung have also contributed to 
the success of the D-2 mission. [passage omitted]

  This was discussed at the "Biotechnology and AIDS" 
convention 
in Florence. The high number of pediatric cases is due to 
infection between drug addicts and among heterosexuals. 
HIV-positive mothers have given birth to 2,700 babies. [passage

  [Text] Crew of the quarantined Royal Navy destroyer 
Liverpool are to undergo further medical checks this week after 
four of their number contracted viral meningitis. 
  The disease was diagnosed a week ago in two petty officers 
and an able seamen while the 3,500-ton ship was visiting 
Gibraltar. They were taken ashore and later flown home after 
hospital treatment. A second rating fell ill at sea and was 
airlifted to Lisbon on Tuesday. 
  Liverpool is at present anchored off Spithead, seven miles 
from Portsmouth, and has been ordered to remain there until 
Friday so that the health of the 280 crew can be monitored. A 
number of sailors suffered stomach upsets after leaving 
Gibraltar but preliminary tests suggest the illness has not 
spread beyond the four cases. 
  "Viral meningitis is not life-threatening, but we are taking 
all possible precautions," said a Navy spokeswoman. 
  Liverpool, which has only recently completed repairs to her 
hull and radar systems after an accident in Bahrain harbour last 
year, abandoned a planned visit to Norway and exercises in the 
North Atlantic to return home for the medical checks.

<F P=106> [Article by Ernesto de Paola] </F>
  [Text] The search for private risk capital for the nuclear 
sector is one of the biggest challenges of the process that 
began with the transformation of the power sector. 
  Energy Secretary Carlos Bastos has said that the leading 
guidelines for the transformation are basically the following 
principles: 
  -- The state, as such, has decided to no longer engage in 
the 
production of power, on the grounds that it is not a strategic 
activity. 
  -- Within this context, the privatization of the sector as a 
whole (electric, gas, and oil areas) has basically sought to 
reorient the entrepreneurial role. This topic has been the 
focus of the reorganization that has been implemented over the 
past four years. 
  The first attempts to privatize the nuclear area caused 
distrust in the National Commission for Atomic Energy (CNEA), 
which, according to what Bastos told LA NACION, has now 
disappeared, giving rise to a stage of mutual cooperation. 
<H5>  The Rules of the Game </H5>
  The CNEA, Bastos said, must adapt itself to the new rules of 
the game. 
  One of the main obstacles that specialists mention in 
referring to the search for risk capital for the nuclear sector 
has to do with the appropriate insurance and policies for 
operations, and the economic provisions for the future 
dismantling of those power centrals. 
  Specialized technicians note that a plant like Embalse might 
produce 8,000 tons of highly contaminated residue that should be 
dumped in a grave or appropriate deposit. The total cost of the 
deactivation operation may not be less than $200 million. 
  In the opinion of Bastos, this might not be a serious 
problem. The state has never accumulated reserve funds for this 
purpose, for example by increasing part of the cost of that 
power, simply because it has always been expected that, whenever 
necessary, the Treasury would provide the funds. 
  The CNEA, Bastos went on, should reorganize itself into an 
enterprise ruled by private commercial regulations, which does 
not mean that in the future the Treasury will not provide funds 
for pure and applied research in the nuclear area, or for the 
completion of the third plant (Atucha-2), construction of which 
should have ended in 1987 according to the original project 
timetable. 
<H5>  The Next Steps </H5>
  Concerning the reformulation of the CNEA role, Bastos 
mentioned that work is being done to restructure the laws that 
will regulate the participation and role of private capital. To 
this end it will be necessary to create a new organization with 
the same CNEA people, who will be in charge of regulating the 
sector. This is to some extent what is happening to Calin 
(Advisory Council for Licensing Nuclear Facilities) with respect 
to CNEA, although in this case there will be more autonomy. 
  In sum, there will be a power generation enterprise with 
security legislation for its operation. 
  Furthermore, attached entrepreneurial activities, like the 
extraction of uranium, will be reorganized into one or more 
enterprises whose shares will be, in principle, owned by the 
state.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Final Approval of Accord"] </F>
  [Text] Senate approval of the inspection of Brazilian 
nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) puts the finishing touch on the effort by the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and the Armed Forces to bring the country into 
the community of nations having access to nuclear technology 
while protecting the sovereign interests of national 
development. The decision ratifies commitments made by Brazilian 
diplomats and confirms that the national nuclear program -- 
recognized as a leading sector in the progress of Brazilian 
industrial technology -- is following rigorous parameters in 
complying with international safety standards. 
  Besides the Senate decision, a new level in relations 
between 
Brazil and Argentina has been reached thanks to establishment of 
the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of 
Nuclear Materials (ABACC). The result is that Brazilian 
diplomats now possess important trump cards for reversing 
Brazil's image as an unreliable country as far as transferring 
sensitive technology is concerned. 
  The subject of nuclear safeguards is complex and requires 
exhaustive international negotiations by Brazilian diplomats. 
Brazil has not signed and does not intend to sign the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which it considers 
discriminatory and unfair. It is, however, one of the few 
countries in the world whose Constitution includes a provision 
banning the manufacture of atomic bombs. Perhaps that 
constitutional provision is not regarded as a guarantee, but it 
shows our country's intention to use nuclear technology for 
peaceful purposes. 
  According to the text approved by the Senate, the enrichment 
of uranium will be inspected not from the standpoint of the way 
it is accomplished but in terms of the quantity produced. The 
Navy is thus honoring its pledge to keep uranium production at 
enrichment levels not exceeding 20 percent. Brazil is therefore 
providing the international community with a guarantee that its 
production of nuclear power is not aimed at the manufacture of 
an atomic bomb, which would require uranium enriched to much 
higher levels. And at the same time, the country is protecting 
the secrecy of the military program for building a 
nuclear-powered submarine, a program that is being carried out 
in an extremely efficient manner by the Navy at the Aramar 
Experimental Center in Ipero, Sao Paulo. 
  It should not be forgotten that nuclear power is currently a 
highly competitive international market. Indiscriminately 
divulging the stage reached in certain research could hinder the 
transfer of technology and the achievement of Brazilian 
production levels capable of threatening internationally 
established monopolies.

  [Text] As of 12 April, the Japanese Government decided to 
support the idea of concluding a "multilateral accord on banning 
the production of enriched uranium and plutonium for military 
purposes" (the so-called cut-off pact on military-purpose 
nuclear materials) proposed by U.S. President Clinton last 
September and to allow countries that are not members of the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) to keep military-purpose 
nuclear materials such as high-enriched uranium and plutonium 
which they already possess if they join the cut-off pact. 
  Previously the government, while working on non-NPT member 
nations such as India, Pakistan, and Israel to join the NPT, 
said that it would not allow them to possess military-use 
nuclear materials. 
  However, the government has concluded that the cut-off pact 
will serve as "supplement" to the NPT (according to a Foreign 
Ministry source) and that in order to strengthen the 
international system to check nuclear proliferation, it is 
better to conclude the cut-off pact with non-NPT member nations 
than asking those nations to abandon nuclear materials which 
they currently possess. 
  This cut-off pact was proposed by President Clinton in his 
speech to the United Nations last September. 
  Outline of the proposal is: 
  (1) a multilateral pact should be concluded to ban the 
production of such military-use nuclear materials as highly 
enriched uranium and plutonium; 
  (2) the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] should 
inspect member nations to check whether nuclear materials are 
used for military purposes; and 
  (3) military-use nuclear materials which the member nations 
already possess are exempted from the IAEA inspections. 
  The possible conclusion of the cut-off pact will lead to the 
creation of the third nuclear control system composed of 
countries which possesses nuclear materials but not armed with 
nuclear weapons, in addition to the NPT, in which nuclear 
control group is divided into two: one composed of nations which 
possess nuclear weapons; the other composed of non-nuclear 
nations. Nuclear inspections will also be carried out of the 
third group. 
  The major controversial point of the proposal is that there 
is the possibility that nations which are suspected of storing 
military-purpose nuclear materials will be allowed to keep those 
nuclear materials. However, India recently indicated an 
interest in the proposal, and among the non-NPT member nations, 
there is a positive move toward concluding the cut-off pact. 
Therefore, it is likely that debates on merits and demerits of 
the proposal will be brisk on a world-wide scale.

  [Text] On 5 April, the government decided to seek the 
international community's positive understanding once again of 
Japan's position that it will maintain its "three nonnuclear 
principles" [of not producing, possessing, and introducing 
nuclear arms] in the future, and that Japan will never be armed 
with nuclear weapons in any form. On the same day, the Monju 
fast-breeder reactor, which produces plutonium, reached 
"criticality." Under this situation, the government made the 
aforementioned decision while taking into consideration the 
possibility that the "concern over Japan becoming a nuclear 
power," which lingers in connection with the suspicions over the 
DPRK's (North Korea) nuclear weapons development program, may 
crop up again. In concrete terms, the government intends to 
make its appeals concerning Japan's position as the "only nation 
in the world that has suffered atomic bombings" through various 
opportunities such as summit meetings and the public relations 
activities of embassies and legations abroad. 
  Last year, Japan's delayed decision to support the 
indefinite 
extension of the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) created 
speculation among European nations and the United States that 
Japan "might intend to possess nuclear arms." This was the 
origin of the prevailing view that Japan "will be armed with 
nuclear weapons." 
  Moreover, in connection with North Korea's suspected nuclear 
weapons development, Britain's SUNDAY TIMES newspaper reported 
in January, "The British Ministry of Defense has completed a 
secret report that says there is a possibility that Japan will 
abandon its nonnuclear principles." In the United States, 
Defense Secretary (then Deputy Secretary) William Perry 
testified at a public hearing of the Senate Armed Services 
Committee in February, "If North Korea succeeds in producing 
nuclear weapons, the possibility that Japan, Taiwan, and South 
Korea will seek to possess nuclear arms will increase greatly." 
In this way, there have been statements pointing out the fear 
that Japan will arm itself with nuclear weapons.

  [Text] The issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear arms 
development became a focal point of discussions at the ruling 
coalition parties' policy meeting. In this regard, the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] and Defense Agency [DA] authorities 
were carefully watching the outcome of the discussions at the 
meeting. A MOFA source said: "If the issue is going to be 
discussed at the Diet sooner or later, we should be thankful to 
the coalition parties for their effort to clarify the problem 
points and to draw up policies before forming a new 
administration." 
  On the other hand, some people are already talking about the 
possibility of Japan, the United States and the ROK imposing 
economic sanctions against North Korea without waiting for a UN 
Security Council resolution. They are also pointing out a 
negative aspect, saying that tasks which "should be studied 
internally" (according to a top Foreign Ministry official) are 
being brought to public notice. For the time being, it seems 
the authorities are on "tenterhooks" as far as the possibility 
of having detailed discussions at the policy meeting is 
concerned. 
  Regarding the ruling parties' policy meeting, most Foreign 
Ministry officials have assessed it positively. While citing 
the case of the United States, where presidential candidates 
always announce their policy platform before the actual 
election, as an example, a senior Foreign Ministry official 
said: "This is something we never did before in Japan. I am 
carefully observing the discussions at the meeting with a sense 
of excitement." A top MOFA official said: "I am very interested 
in them." (Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Chief) Tsutomu Hata, 
deputy prime minister and concurrently foreign minister who is 
likely to become the next prime minister, stated: "In terms of 
managing politics, it is good for us to find out the course of 
the new administration at this stage." 
  The DA also shares the same view. A senior DA official said: 
"(Shinseito representative secretary general) Ozawa's concept of 
emergency defense legislation, designed to place the focus on 
the North Korean issue, and the emergency legislation which we 
have been studying from broad viewpoints, are not necessarily 
the same thing. However, we welcome the discussions at the 
meeting." 
  However, their views are different when it comes to the 
concrete issue of whether to include China in cooperation with 
Japan, the United States, and the ROK in the event of an 
emergency involving the North Korean issue. A senior Foreign 
Ministry official pointed out: "This is an issue we should talk 
about in case China exercises its veto power against the UNSC's 
resolution for imposing sanctions against North Korea, but it is 
still too early to talk about it." 
  MOFA officials are saying that it is not good policy, at 
this 
stage, to aimlessly excite North Korea, which reportedly 
informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of its 
policy to conditionally accept nuclear inspections, and China, 
which has "the most influential power," to persuade North Korea.

<F P=106> [Leonard Doyle report: "Satellite Adds to Evidence of North </F>
Korean Bomb Plans" -- report is accompanied by a color photo on 
page 1, about 8 inches square, taken in 1986, and a 
black-and-white photo, slightly smaller, on page 15, taken in 
1990, both reportedly satellite pictures of the same site at 
Yongbyon, North Korea] 
  [Excerpts] Analysing commercially available satellite 
images of North Korea, bought for 1,500 pounds each and enhanced 
by computer, researchers at King's College London have found 
evidence of a secret nuclear bomb programme, writes Leonard 
Doyle. 
  A comparison of photographs taken in 1986 with one taken in 
1990 shows that a large amount of construction work has taken 
place at a "radiological laboratory" at Yongbyon, which U.S. 
sources say hides a clandestine factory for the plutonium needed 
to make nuclear bombs. [passage omitted] 
  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) -- which has 
so 
far refused to use commercial satellite pictures to verify 
whether countries are obeying safeguards under the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty -- has triggered an international 
crisis with North Korea by accepting U.S. spy images as evidence 
that the country has an illegal nuclear programme. 
  North Korea has stopped co-operating with the IAEA and said 
yesterday it would regard the imposition of sanctions over the 
nuclear programme as a "declaration of war". 
  "People have almost no idea what civil satellites can do," 
said Dr. Bhupendra Jasani, the researcher who analysed the 
satellite images. "They are now 20 times better than even a few 
years ago and can show an object half a metre across." Military 
spy satellites used by the U.S. and Russia can show objects as 
small as 20 cm. 
  Previously unpublished satellite photographs of a secret 
nuclear reprocessing facility in North Korea, where 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors were 
recently blocked as they attempted to take radioactive samples, 
have provided evidence that the country has an active nuclear 
bomb programme. 
  The commercially available photographs which contrast work 
on 
the site in 1986 and 1990 have been obtained by the Independent. 
They have been enhanced by computer and analysed by the 
Department of War Studies at King's College, London, and show 
that a facility near Yongbyon could not possibly be the 
experimental nuclear reactor dating from 1965 and a new reactor 
under construction, as the North Koreans claim. 
  The evidence of these photographs coupled with powerful U.S. 
satellite pictures of the site, which remain secret, and IAEA 
analysis appears to confirm that the country can produce the 
bomb. "It is probable that North Korea has enough plutonium to 
manufacture a bomb," said Patricia Lewis of Vertic, the 
London-based arms control treaty verification organisation. 
"The issue now is whether they have the know-how to miniaturise 
a bomb that could be delivered by rocket and threaten Japan as 
well as South Korea." 
  Senior diplomatic sources at the United Nations Security 
Council in New York fear that the crisis with the North Korean 
regime could quickly get out of control. 
  "With more than one million men under arms and 10,000 
artillery pieces and rocket launchers almost within striking 
distance of Seoul we do not want to provoke a psychopathic 
response," one official said yesterday as the Council met to 
hear a report from the Director of the IAEA, Hans Blix. 
  Comparison of enhanced images dating from 1986 (shown on the 
front page) with another photograph taken in 1990, provides 
prima facie evidence that North Korea is engaged in a full-scale 
nuclear bomb programme in violation of the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty, nuclear arms experts say. 
  The IAEA inpspectors also found circumstantial evidence that 
North Korea is engaged in a clandestine nuclear bomb programme 
on their recent visit. "They saw evidence of continuing 
construction work at the so-called radiological laboratory but 
they could not verify whether or not they were making 
plutonium," said IAEA spokesman David Kydd. 
  U.S. spy satellite photographs shown in secrecy to the IAEA 
prompted the recent inspection of the site. North Korea's 
reaction to the inspection now threatens to become an 
international crisis, with the UN Security Council preparing to 
slap sanctions on Korea if it does not co-operate. 
  Those images show that a "radiological laboratory" at the 
same site is in fact a single-storey building constructed up top 
of a plutonium reprocessing facility buried deep underground, 
according to nuclear weapons experts. 
  North Korea has angrily rejected U.S. evidence on the 
grounds 
that it was provided by "the enemy." 
  More evidence was found from analysing nuclear fuel 
processed 
at other North Korean sites that far more enriched uranium has 
been processed into potential bomb-making material than the 
authorities admit to. 
  By computer enhancement of satellite photographs, Dr. 
Bhupendra Jasani, a senior research fellow at King's College, 
has been able to show that there are no electricity transmission 
lines coming in or out of the site of a reactor due to come on 
line next year. 
  There are no anti-aircraft, gun or missile sites around 
Yongbyon, but by enlarging the photographs Dr. Jasani has 
identified three military airfields as well as a large 
ammunition storage site around the facility.

<F P=106> [Report by Katsuhiro Kuroda] </F>
  [Text] Seoul, 18 Mar -- Some 200 people were killed during 
massive explosions at a missile plant in the DPRK (North Korea) 
in November 1991, a defector from North Korea told SANKEI 
SHIMBUN on 18 March. The explosion occurred in Kanggye in 
Chagang Province where military plants are concentrated. In 
addition to the loss of life, the accident destroyed several 
buildings in the city. The "Kanggye No. 26 General Plant" was 
North Korea's largest underground facility built in mountain 
tunnels with a total of 20,000 people employed there; missile 
assembly sites and other functions were reportedly removed 
following the accident. 
  SANKEI SHIMBUN obtained these comments from Ko Chong-song, 
32, who lived in Kanggye and defected to the Republic of Korea 
via China last June. During a three-year period beginning in 
1984, Ko daily went to the plant as a boxer with membership in 
the plant's "sports team." Moreover, his two brothers were 
serving as the accounting department chief and an engineer; he 
also had many friends working there. Therefore, he was familiar 
with the internal affairs of the plant. 
  According to Ko, the first explosion occurred around 2130 
[1230 GMT] on 30 November. His apartment was approximately 2 
kilometers from the plant and was blocked by a hill, but he 
reported that the terrible noise and vibrations emanating from 
the explosion were like those of an earthquake. The night sky 
turned red with fire, and explosions continued until 1030 [0130 
GMT] the next morning. The blasts shattered the windows of his 
apartment, and many houses in the city were destroyed or burned. 
  The accident occurred at an outdoor materials dump near no. 
11 missile assembly site. Mishandling of explosives set off a 
fire which touched off a series of blasts among missiles and 
artillery ordinance. The official death toll was put at 127, 
but it was rumored among citizens that the toll should be about 
200, including civilian casualties. 
  Immediately after the incident, a "suicide squad" was 
organized to seal off the entrance to the tunnel to prevent 
explosions from spreading inside the underground complex; some 
20 volunteers were killed during the attempt. Five were later 
awarded the title "Heroes of the Republic." 
  Following the incident, many party and government leaders -- 
including then-Premier Yon Hyong-mok, Korean Workers Party [KWP] 
Secretary (in charge of military supplies) Kim Chang-ho, and KWP 
Second Economic Commission Chairman Kim Man-song -- inspected 
the plant. Kanggye was sealed off for 20 days following the 
accident, and a strict news blackout was imposed on the area. 
  In addition to missiles, the plant was producing various 
munitions, including rocket bombs, depth charges, torpedoes, and 
mines. Surface-to-air, surface-to-surface, and air-to-surface 
missiles were respectively codenamed "Hwasong [Mars]" 1, 2, and 
3; they possessed a range of up to 200 kilometers. Ko noted the 
plant is presently producing a new missile with a range of over 
550 kilometers. 
  All products of the plant were originally designed in the 
former Soviet Union. They are exported mainly to Iran and other 
Middle East countries. Plant personnel used to say: "The 
Iran-Iraq War was a field experiment for our weapons." 
  The plant is built at the foot of a rocky mountain and is 2 
kilometers in width. Production sections and assembly sites are 
located inside the tunnels, and non-production sections such as 
material dumps and management offices are located outside. 
  Chagang Province is a mountainous region in North Korea 
adjoining the Chinese border. North Korea's military industries 
are concentrated in the region, and civilian traffic is strictly 
controlled. Under such circumstances, the accident has been 
kept secret until now.

  [Text] Russia will resume the supply of nuclear fuel to 
Ukraine after it gets next week the $60 Mn promised by the U.S. 
This was reported at a briefing in Kiev on Tuesday by the 
Chairman for Ukraine's Atomic Energy Committee Mikhail Umanets 
after his discussion with Russia's Atomic Energy Minister Victor 
Mikhailov. 
  In the conversation with Umanets, Mikhailov blamed the 
breaking of the time-table for nuclear fuel delivery to Ukraine 
on Russia's failure to settle accounts with a fuel producing 
plant in Novosibirsk (East Siberia). 
  Umanets also reported that by his information the 
Novosibirsk 
plant was interested in the Ukrainian market since Ukraine had 
always been one of its major clients. 
  He declined to give concrete figures on fuel shipments on 
the 
ground that such information is classified. 
  He pointed out that the construction of a nuclear fuel plant 
in Ukraine was "an urgent national task." In his opinion, 
Ukraine has everything that is needed to cope with the task, 
including uranium ore, "which has been supplied to Russia and 
returned as ready-made fuel." 
  "The price at which we buy fuel in Russia amounts to 64 
percent of the prime cost of electricity generated in Ukraine. 
With the commencement of a state fuel producing plant, this 
indicator could be almost halved," Umanets said. 
  In his words, feasibility tests on such a project are to be 
completed this year.

  [Text] Russia's Chief Airforce Commander Petr Deinekin says 
no agreement has so far been reached on the transfer to Russia 
of part of the former Soviet Union's strategic bomber aircraft 
deployed in Ukraine. In an interview with Interfax on Thursday, 
he put the number of such missile carrying aircraft at 42 
including 19 TU-160's and 23 TU-95 MC's. 
  The two countries are still at odds about the price. Kiev 
wants Russia to write off Rbl 700 Bn of its debt, but Moscow 
agrees to settle for less than a third of that amount. 
  Deinekin said the Russian Defense Ministry could easily 
order 
a new batch of aircraft for Rbl 700 Bn at home. He stressed 
that the Ukrainian bombers had been grounded for quite some time 
because of shortage of fuel and spare parts and extra spending 
would be needed to make them airworthy. 
  He regretted that Moscow's attempts to try to help Ukraine 
to 
denuclearize itself had failed to meet understanding from the 
Ukrainian Defense Ministry. At the same time, he hoped further 
talks will be held in an effort to reach compromise.

<F P=106> [Report from Moscow by Pavel Davidov: "Moscow Secret </F>
Intelligence Report Warns: World Threatened by Leaking Russian 
Secret Nuclear Technology"] 
  [Text] Russia is incapable of protecting its national 
security and monitoring the dangerous weapons it owns. 
Therefore, its intelligence and security services are incapable 
of protecting the world against the threat of proliferation of 
its nuclear bombs, radioactive materials, missiles, and all 
weapons of mass destruction, as well as atomic scientists 
willing to go to any country that will pay them. This 
information is significant because it does not come from Western 
intelligence or foreign sources but is found in a very official 
and top secret report submitted to President Yeltsin a few days 
ago by the Russian Counterespionage Service. The report 
contains a clear warning that it is impossible to prevent 
thefts, smuggling, and secret trade, which is on the rise in 
military plants and sensitive laboratories. The report also 
points out that the states that broke away from the Soviet Union 
are also unable to protect the dangerous Installations they have 
inherited. These states are selling the Installations to 
dealers from Iran, Pakistan, Iraq, and other nations, or to 
trade firms that specialize in gunrunning. Sometimes plants are 
being sold, along with all their equipment, weapons, and 
experts. The report gives evidence that 900 thefts from 
military and nuclear plants and 700 thefts of secret technology 
were reported only during the second half of 1993, including 
nuclear weapons for Iran and Pakistan. It is worth mentioning 
that the information provided in this report was so serious that 
the head of the Counterintelligence Service had to resign. 
  The following are the important highlights of the report: 
  Counterintelligence Service analysts are of the opinion that 
the reorganization of the security services was enacted 
thoughtlessly and without planning and did a great deal of 
damage to the aim of ensuring political and social security and 
stability. They say that the mistakes in establishing the new 
structure of national security might lead to Russia becoming a 
source of threat to other countries and to the world at large. 
  It seems that the source of threat at present is not a 
military threat, because the Army and the military intelligence 
service are still responsible for this factor. The sources of 
danger are apparent in other areas; namely, the environment, the 
threat to the constitution, the intelligence forces, the border 
guards, the military industrial complex, the economy, organized 
crime, administrative corruption, and the nuclear complex. 
  In the past, these sectors were under the control of the 
State Security Committee, the KGB. Now the issues of the 
environment, intelligence, and the border guard have been 
transferred to a special department under the head of state. 
Organized crime and administrative corruption have been 
transferred to the Interior Ministry. Important issues such as 
the threat to the constitution, the military industrial complex, 
the economy, and the nuclear complex are the work of nobody. 
Suitable national security measures have not been taken to face 
possible dangers. These dangers really exist. 
  Despite the establishment of a government emergency 
committee, which should ward off any possible dangers to the 
environment, and the creation of a civilian force for this 
purpose, the immense geographic area of Russia makes the 
civilian force, which is composed of a three battalion brigade, 
clearly insufficient. It may be recalled in this regard that 
the removal of the traces of the Chernobyl disaster required the 
work of 12 KGB teams, internal security forces, and special 
forces in radiation and chemical protection from the Defense 
Ministry. In Ukraine today, the civilian forces are composed of 
one company, and they are nonexistent in Armenia where there is 
a war going on and the possibility of a casual hit or a possible 
attack on the electroatomic [kahrudharriyah] station cannot be 
ruled out. Such an attack would be a disaster for the entire 
Caucasus, Turkey, and Iran and possibly Syria and beyond. In 
spring and summer, prevailing winds in this area could carry the 
radioactive cloud from this Armenian electroatomic station to 
Iraq, the Arabian Gulf coasts, and Israel. 
  The Russian border guard forces have been established on the 
vast Central Asian territory to protect the borders of the CIS 
states as well as the Russian borders. The border posts and 
centers have no security cover and therefore they could come 
under attack not only from the front, but also from the rear by 
various armed groups of diverse affiliations. The same 
situation will soon prevail in the far eastern, northwestern, 
western, and southern areas of Russia. Before the Russian 
Security Ministry was disbanded, the Ministry's local bodies 
protected the rear of the border forces there. As for the 
Russian Counterintelligence Services, they have no such local 
bodies, and therefore, the rear of the border forces will remain 
unprotected. 
  However, the most dangerous situation is manifested in the 
sectors of the military industrial complex, the economy, and the 
nuclear complex where the situation threatens dire consequences 
for not only Russia's national security, but also for the 
security of many countries if not the entire world community. 
  In the past, the protection of the military industrial 
complex and most of the big establishments in the Soviet economy 
and in Russia was one of the prerogatives of the KGB forces. 
Local KGB bodies guarded their technologies within the 
establishments and protected the production secrets. When the 
KGB was disbanded in late 1992 and early 1993, this became the 
work of the Russian Security Ministry. The federal Russian 
Counterintelligence Service, which was established in 1993, was 
denied this job. Eventually, only certain major establishments 
in the military industrial complex were given protection from 
outside guard forces manned by militiamen. The vast majority of 
these establishments are protected by elderly personnel armed 
with old shotguns or pre-World War I pistols. Thus, the 
military factories and establishments as well as scientific 
institutions and important laboratories have been denied 
official state protection. Contrary to what happens in the 
United States and Europe, no private security bodies have been 
established due to lack of funds and the general deterioration 
in the country. 
  As a result of all this, only in the second half of 1993, 
900 
thefts of various kinds of weapons and equipment, and 700 thefts 
of secret technology (designs and description of chemical 
reactions and processes, etc.) were registered at the 
institutions of the Russian military industrial complex and the 
nuclear complex. This includes special documents on 
manufacturing weapons of mass destruction, chemical weapons, and 
even biological weapons. In general, the special documents on 
the minute details of the manufacturing of weapons. It is 
possible that these secrets could fall into the possession of 
people who will use these terrible weapons without hesitation, 
and without even thinking of the grave consequences of this 
step, just for the sake of achieving their selfish and national 
objectives. 
  What makes the situation even more complicated is that most 
of the republics that became independent of the former USSR, 
have on their territory some of the institutions, factories, and 
scientific centers and laboratories which, in one way or 
another, are affiliated with the military industrial complex, 
the nuclear complex, the production of chemical weapons, or 
production of mass destruction weapons. Several of these 
institutions, which used to be secret, are now located on the 
territory of newly independent states, whose leaderships do not 
know how to dispose of them. In fact, they believe that the 
best solution is to sell them, along with their means of 
production and their technology, to the highest bidder, 
regardless of who it is. If the nuclear material and their 
technology were sold with some caution and secrecy, the mass 
destruction weapons and the technology of their production, and 
even the chemical weapons, were sold publicly. Here are some 
examples: 
  In November 1993, a medium-size ship, with 40 families of 
Russian refugees from the city of Krasnovodsk in Turkmenistan on 
board arrived in the city of Astrakhan. Among these families, 
there were six families whose breadwinners used to work at one 
of the secret workshops of the ammunition depot of the former 
Soviet war fleet. At this workshop, all the nuclear charges of 
the torpedoes and sea mines were tested and most of them were 
sent to the Black Sea fleet. Following the disintegration of the 
USSR, the new state of Turkmenistan decided that it did not need 
these charges in the depot because it does not have a fleet or 
naval air force units. The entire depot was sold in one year. 
The sea mines workshop was also sold. The already-made 
production was sold, and the equipment was sold later. The 
experts who returned to Russia said that Iranians and Pakistanis 
were among the buyers. The buyers offered the engineers and the 
technicians working at the workshop contracts to work on the 
equipment back in their countries for five years. Some of the 
former officers of the Caspian Sea fleet signed contracts and 
left with the equipment after working for more than a year and a 
half without salaries. Arrivals in Astrakhan said that the 
families of other officers lead a very miserable life in the 
open, and that they cannot return to Russia. 
  In the same way, the gunpowder factory in the town of Shusta 
[place name as published] in the suburbs of Namangan in 
Uzbekistan, was sold. When it was built in 1910, this factory 
used to produce gunpowder. Later, it became a huge war 
institution specializing in producing air-dropped bombs. It was 
one of the three Soviet factories where cluster bombs and vacuum 
bombs, which are considered a kind of mass destruction weapon, 
are assembled. 
  After the break-up of the Soviet Union, Uzbekistan no longer 
needed the factory and there was no way to convert it to 
civilian production. Work stopped in the factory and the 
Russians, fearing nationalist clashes, began to leave Uzbekistan 
for Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. The local central government 
in Tashkent began to sell the very expensive equipment and 
technology that was in use at that time. The same thing 
happened at the design office, which can be compared to a small 
research institute in this field. The string of buyers again 
included Iran and Pakistan, followed by India, Indonesia, and 
Iraq. 
  We can give dozens of examples of this kind. The weapons of 
mass destruction spread all over the Third World from all the 
republics of the former Soviet Union because of the lack of 
control and protection exercised in the past by the KGB. These 
weapons can easily fall into the hands of irresponsible 
adventurers. Here is another example: A secret laboratory, 
which carried out near-production level scientific research in 
chemical weapons and lasers, in the town of At Bashi, a suburb 
of the Kirghiz town of Naryn, was lost. Kirghizia did not need 
this laboratory. The new nation could not use it or convert its 
products because it had no trained Russian personnel who use to 
work there. The Russians left Kirghizia in a hurry after 
nationalistic sentiments rose. Only the walls of that 
laboratory remained. Where is the equipment? Where are the 
documents? Are they in China, Iran, Pakistan, Iraq, or in 
another country? Very few Kirghiz figures know the facts, and 
they prefer to remain silent. 
  In none of the CIS states where nuclear weapons are 
distributed do we find any government monitoring of radioactive 
and nuclear radiation, except in Russia, where a special 
committee, Roscomatomnadzur, [as published] or the government's 
committee to supervise nuclear materials, exists. However, the 
committee's duties and resources are very limited. Monitoring 
is confined to ascertaining that the storage and use of nuclear 
material does not harm the health of people or the environment. 
At best, committee employees can record a radiation leak or a 
violation of the rules for storing nuclear materials. 
  The tragedy today is that the state has not organized the 
protection of materials and related technologies against 
ordinary theft, illegal sale, or smuggling abroad -- protection 
that was the job of state bodies. The Counterintelligence 
Service was robbed of this job and the information branch, which 
belongs to the KGB, was given the task of fighting nuclear 
terrorism. However, this body has no local branches in the 
Russian areas, where the nuclear sites exist. It is doubtful if 
such branches will be established in the near future because 
this is not within the duties of the KGB information branch, 
which should operate outside the country. Therefore, the 
country's powerful nuclear establishment, which includes the 
nuclear fuel factories for the electroatomic stations, ship 
reactors, and plutonium weapons factories, as well as the 
research centers, the nuclear waste burial grounds, and test 
fields are now denied the state's protection and the monitoring 
of dealing with nuclear and radioactive materials, which in the 
past were under the protection of the state organizations, as is 
the case today in all other nuclear countries. 
  As far as nuclear and radioactive security are concerned, 
the 
situation at the Semipalatinsk field for underground nuclear 
tests and at Russian nuclear establishments previously linked to 
this field as part of the general Soviet nuclear program is 
extremely serious. 
  Until recently, Russian specialists worked in this field. 
After Kazakhstan became independent, the Kazakhs -- on the 
pretext of imposing their control of the suspension of all 
nuclear experiments -- managed to withdraw the external Russian 
Army guard units, as well as the internal guards traditionally 
composed of special KGB units. Russian specialists in all 
sections of the field are now being replaced by Kazakhs, most of 
whom have no experience in handling this kind of material, not 
to mention the fact that they do not have any scientific degrees. 
  No special documents were written regarding the delivery and 
acceptance of radioactive and nuclear equipment or material in 
this field. Likewise, no special documents were written 
regarding the amount of radioactively polluted sand and rock 
resulting from previous tests. This allows long-term 
radioactive waste material resulting from many years of active 
work in carrying out powerful underground nuclear tests to be 
squandered. This waste can be used to obtain, by retrieval, 
nuclear fuel for nuclear reactors and first-generation nuclear 
arms containers, such as used in the kind of bombs dropped on 
Japan in 1945. Apparently, this is a profitable area for the 
seller, purchaser, and mediator. The role of the mediator who 
sells retrievable equipment [al-mu'-iddat al-salihah li 
al-isti'adah] from the Semipalatinsk field is played by a 
London-based firm called "United Ration Trading Limited" [name 
as transliterated]. Money is paid through this firm's channels. 
The radioactive equipment and waste are exported to northern 
Iran from the Port of Shevchenko. The subsequent route, 
however, is still unknown to the Russian counter-espionage 
organizations. 
  In the fall of 1993, this London-based firm contacted the 
plants in the Tomsk-7 [name as transliterated] city. These 
plants are among the largest producers of weapons-grade 
plutonium in the entire former Soviet Union. Controls still 
enforced by the Russian Security Ministry prevented the 
smuggling of a batch of the plutonium abroad. The firm's 
representative was expelled from Russia. However, the 
reorganization of this ministry denied the Counterespionage 
Service the right to control the nuclear complex. It is not 
impossible that weapons-grade plutonium could now leak from 
Tomsk-7 into the so-called "potential states", states on the 
verge of making nuclear arms. 
  For more than two years Russia and Kazakhstan have been 
arguing sharply over this question and over the fate of the 
Baykonur space base, and all the other installations and 
institutions, including nuclear facilities, on Kazakh territory. 
It is in these installations that nuclear reactors are 
assembled and prepared for launching into outer space aboard 
special spacecraft. The problem has not been resolved yet. The 
facility is still under the control of Russian warplanes. 
However, an agreement has been signed between Kazakhstan and 
Ukraine on joint use of the Baykonur spaceport for trade 
purposes. 
  It has been noticed that the report of the Counterespionage 
Service says this agreement contains a paragraph binding the 
signatories to "coordinate efforts regarding maintaining unified 
prices of tradable nuclear waste". This means Ukraine and 
Kazakhstan have not abandoned "trade in nuclear and radioactive 
materials." The only thing they care about is to avoid 
competing with each other over the sales of this extremely 
hazardous "stuff". 
  The secret report devotes a chapter to the future of 
scientists and specialists working at the war industrial 
complex, that is, in military industries, as well as experts in 
treating nuclear and radioactive materials and in the missile 
industry, outside the boundaries of the CIS. The report 
discloses that more than a third of the scientists and 
specialists in the nuclear field and in highly sophisticated 
technology, who total 3,000 people that used to work in the 
Soviet Union, have left the country and now work at major 
scientific institutions in the United States, Japan, Germany, 
France, Britain, and Sweden. Also, around 6,000 
"medium-caliber" engineers and science experts have left the 
country. Some of them settled in countries with nuclear 
potential. They are now conducting nuclear and atomic 
technology research. 
  It is worth mentioning that the people who drafted the 
report 
point out that the major part of this threat to Russia's 
security is attributed to repeatedly reorganizing the Security 
Ministry and its agencies. Perhaps it is against this 
background that Boris Yeltsin has dismissed Nikolay Golushko 
[name as transliterated], director of the Counterespionage 
Service that prepared the report, and appointed Sergey 
(Shibashin) as a replacement. 
  Security circles in Moscow fear the Counterespionage Service 
will experience yet another reorganization that could aggravate 
the current chaos and threaten continued proliferation of 
nuclear weapons and radioactive agents and more Chernobyl 
disasters.

  [Text] Grigoriy Karasin, an official representative of the 
Russian Foreign Ministry, dismissed on Thursday allegations by 
foreign media that Russia continues to work on the creation of 
biological weapons. 
  Such publications "are clearly aimed at destroying mutual 
trust, and at aggravating relations between the signatories of 
the Convention banning biological weapons," he said at a 
briefing in Moscow. 
  Karasin noted that Russia as legal successor of the USSR 
took 
all responsibility for the implementation of the 1972 
Convention, including the functions of a guarantor of this 
document. Under the trilateral agreements between Russia, USA 
and Great Britain, mutual visits to biological facilities and 
exchange of information continue between the sides. 
  Karasin also said that Russia is in favor of the creation of 
a control mechanism for the implementation of the Convention. A 
special conference on this issue will be convened in Geneva in 
September.

  [Text] Deputy head of Russian troops for chemical and 
biological defenses General Valentin Yevstigneyev [name as 
received] has described as groundless any suspicion about 
Moscow's violation of the international ban on the development, 
production or storage of biological weapons. 
  He was commenting on a Sunday Times publication which 
alleged, referring to intelligence sources and three Russian 
"defectors," that the Russian Defence Ministry was engaged in 
the development of biological weapons behind Yeltsin's back. 
  Yevstigneyev does not consider the paper's report unusual 
given the background of continued Western accusations against 
Russia concerning the developing of such weapons. He said that 
in the past, such campaigns were timed to coincide with major 
international talks on banning biological or chemical weapons in 
an effort to divert attention from the West's own programs which 
were in violation of the 1972 convention. 
  The general said the Sunday Times publication had emerged in 
the run up to a session by a preparatory committee intended to 
clear the ground for a special conference for measures to verify 
the compliance with the 1972 convention. Moscow is expected to 
continue work on possible verification measures at that session, 
Yevstigneyev said.

<F P=106> [Article by James Adams: "The Red Death"; Subtitled "The </F>
Untold Story of Russia's Secret Biological Weapons"; described 
as "Exclusive extract from The New Spies, his forthcoming book"] 
  [Text] Vladimir Pasechnik was born in 1937 in Stalingrad, a 
city soon to be ravaged by the World War II. He became one of 
the brightest young scientists in the Soviet Union, determined 
to use his talent in the cause of peace, never allowing his 
research in biophysics to play any part in the kind of 
destruction that had cost the lives of his family. 
  After graduation, he did research at the Institute of High 
Molecular Compounds in Leningrad, working on new antibiotics and 
treatments for supposedly incurable illnesses such as cancer. 
  In 1974 he was approached by a general from the Soviet 
Ministry of Defence with an irresistible offer: to set up and 
run a laboratory in Leningrad, with an unlimited budget to buy 
equipment in the West and recruit the best staff from all over 
the Soviet Union. It would be known as the Institute of Ultra 
Pure Biochemical Preparations. 
  For Pasechnik it was an opportunity to realise many of his 
most cherished ambitions in the fight against illness. His 
early research was promising; he felt he could produce a cure to 
some forms of cancer. Until then he had thought he would never 
have the resources to complete his work. Now he was being given 
the chance to develop one of the Soviet Union's most advanced 
laboratories in biotechnology. He accepted. 
  The fact that the offer came from the Ministry of Defence 
did 
not worry him unduly. In the Soviet Union, the military was the 
engine of most scientific research; it had the cash and the 
people to run it. Even if a scientific project had a strictly 
civilian application, the military was still in charge. It was 
the Soviet way. 
  From 1974 to 1981, Pasechnik built up his special 
laboratory, 
scouring the country until he had 400 people on his staff, a 
lavish budget and enough hard currency to give his scientists 
constant access to the latest biotechnological advances in the 
West. The laboratory began its work in 1981. Over the next two 
years Pasechnik realised the truth: far from being the heart of 
a new civilian research operation, he was at the centre of a 
vast network of factories and laboratories working on deadly new 
weapons of war. 
  "Officially we were involved in vaccine development and in 
producing preparations for protecting crops," said Pasechnik. 
"In fact, we were developing methods of production and 
equipment for a huge biological warfare programme." 
  To begin with, Pasechnik had little idea of the scale of the 
operation. Only later did he discover that, as well as his 
laboratory in Leningrad, there were two more in Moscow, two just 
outside it and one in Novosibirsk, all working on the same 
project. Five manufacturing plants employing 15,000 people were 
operating in other parts of the country. The operation, known 
as Biopreparat, had a budget of 200m roubles and tens of 
millions of American dollars a year. It was one of the best 
kept secrets of the cold war. 
  Its task was to develop new strains of diseases, more 
powerful than anything known to science and to produce them in 
aerosol form. The germ also had to be resistant to antibiotics 
available to the NATO armies of the West. The specific job 
allocated to Pasechnik's laboratory staff was to make them 
effective weapons of war: They had to find ways of delivering 
the germs by artillery shell, bomb or missile, to ensure that 
they had a long life in the open air and that they could be 
dispersed over a wide area. 
  The breakthrough came in 1983 at the research institute of 
applied microbiology at Obolensk, 60 miles south of Moscow. 
There, with the help of work done at Pasechnik's laboratory, 
scientists developed their first super-plague: a new strain of 
tularaemia. A severe infectious bacterial disease of man and 
domestic animals, carried by contact or insect bite, it is named 
after Tulare, California, where it was discovered. The tests on 
it were sufficiently encouraging for Moscow to give permission 
for full-scale development and production. 
  Two years later, the scientists at Obolensk were asked to 
develop an even more deadly germ based on pneumonic plague, 
another airborne infection. Pasechnik's job was to refine the 
production processes to make the operation more efficient. As a 
result, by 1987 the Soviet Union had sufficient industrial 
capacity to manufacture 200 kilos of the super-plagues every 
week, enough to kill up to 500,000 people. 
  The super-plague germ was, of course, never manufactured on 
this scale. The germ had a short life and only enough was made 
for testing. But the Biopreparat network stood on standby, 
ready to begin fullscale production when instructed, at a time 
in the future that was designated Day X. 
  Here then was a programme for producing the most devastating 
genetically engineered weapons ever seen, just waiting to be 
given the go-ahead. Tiny quantities of the Russian super-plague 
could devastate any city in the West, killing millions while 
leaving buildings, factories and raw materials intact. They 
would be the perfect designer weapon. 
  At the Soviet defence ministry, high-ranking generals were 
fully aware of this biological capability and built it into 
their military planning. Known as the Weapons of Special 
Designation, they would be used not only as a last resort but as 
support weapons in a conventional non-nuclear conflict, to 
attack the enemy's troop reserves and hamper his operations at 
ports and rail centres. 
  Every part of this programme was in breach of the 1972 
Biological and Toxin Warfare Convention, an international 
agreement which the Soviet Union had signed. It was also 
against the spirit of glasnost and perestroika that had been 
proclaimed by Mikhail Gorbachev. 
  For Pasechnik, the Gorbachev era was a chance to try to 
change the direction of the programme at his laboratory. In 
late 1985 he pressured senior officials in Biopreparat to let 
him switch some of his research effort to the civilian purposes 
for which it had ostensibly been established. He got nowhere. 
  "I was told many times just to get on with my work and stay 
in my place," he said. Pasechnik did just that. By 1988, he 
had risen to a rank equivalent to that of major-general and was 
in charge of two manufacturing plants and three research 
laboratories. Two of these were working on biological weapons; 
the third was given to him to placate his desire to do civil 
work -- and also as a cover for the biological warfare research. 
  But Pasechnik was increasingly uneasy. He had no idea that 
his work was in breach of the 1972 treaty; he did not know such 
a treaty existed. But he felt that the weapons he was helping 
to develop were an abuse of his scientific skills -- and 
demonstrated hypocrisy in the Russian military command about the 
Gorbachev revolution. Above all, he felt passionately that 
genetically engineered biological weapons were a crime against 
humanity. 
  In late 1988, he began to think about defecting. Despite his 
long and illustrious scientific career, Pasechnik had never been 
allowed to travel outside the Soviet bloc. Then, in the summer 
of 1989, Biopreparat began negotiations with a factory in 
Toulouse, France, which manufactures equipment for chemical 
laboratories. Pasechnik volunteered to go to finalise the deal. 
As a reward for his overall performance, permission was granted. 
  He arrived in France at the beginning of October. He had 
thought carefully about how to escape the KGB watchers who 
travelled with his group. One morning he telephoned the British 
embassy in Paris and in a brief conversation with a surprised 
diplomat announced himself, his position and his wish to defect. 
  The news of his offer reached the Secret Intelligence 
Service 
(SIS, otherwise known as MI6) in London at a critical time. For 
the previous five years, SIS, the American CIA and a number of 
Nato military intelligence organisations had been trying to 
piece together the snippets of information they had about the 
Soviet biological warfare programme. 
  In May 1979, American intelligence had heard reports of an 
explosion at a secret Soviet research facility on the outskirts 
of Sverdlovsk, 850 miles east of Moscow. A leak of anthrax had 
killed up to a hundred people; an area three miles downwind of 
the factory had been contaminated. The Russians had tried to 
contain the damage with a widespread immunisation programme but 
it had proved largely useless. 
  Throughout the 1980's, the leak had been raised by both 
British and American officials with their Soviet counterparts. 
But the official line remained the same: that a handful of 
people had died in the city after eating contaminated meat 
bought on the black market. There was no biological weapons 
programme. 
  Snippets of information from sources in the Soviet Union 
suggested otherwise. Satellite pictures showed plants and 
testing sites apparently configured for the manufacture of 
biological weapons. The DIA (the Defence Intelligence Agency, 
the Pentagon's spies) estimated that the Russians had up to 
eight sites for developing and storing biological weapons. SIS 
largely concurred with that view, and a series of reports were 
circulated to intelligence chiefs and British ministers, warning 
that the Soviet biological programme had not slowed down as a 
result of the Gorbachev reforms. 
  As frequently happens when intelligence is fragmentary, the 
politicians refused to hear the message. At the time, all 
Western governments had been seduced by Gorbachev's reforms. 
The cold war was thawing and no prime minister or president was 
prepared to risk a confrontation with the Soviet Union that 
might change the delicate balance of international relations. 
At the same time, there was a sense that Gorbachev was an 
honourable man who would not allow anything as terrible as 
biological weapons to be developed while he was president. The 
intelligence warnings were ignored. 
  When the SIS station chief in Paris flashed the message to 
London about the would-be defector in Toulouse, it caused 
considerable excitement. At last, here was proof that would 
satisfy even the most sceptical politician. Pasechnik was 
driven to Paris and caught a British Airways flight to Heathrow, 
travelling on false papers supplied by British intelligence. 
  As his feet touched British soil, Pasechnik burst into 
tears. 
The decision to leave his country and his family had placed a 
terrible strain on the defector. He had convinced himself that 
the work he had been doing was so terrible that he would 
probably face serious charges and perhaps prison in the West. 
It is a measure of his courage that, despite his fears, he 
stepped off the plane ready to tell all. As soon as he was 
settled in a safe house outside London he was reassured that he 
had found a new home and not a prison cell. 
  There was the normal nervousness in SIS about any defector: 
was he a plant? All the indications were that he was bona fide. 
He did not know how to drive, a clear sign that he was a member 
of the privileged elite in the Soviet Union; the distress he 
showed when he recounted the work he was doing was impossible to 
fake; then there was his love of Mozart sonatas, which he would 
listen to in the evenings after yet another dinner with his 
guardians. The SIS debriefers were quickly reassured. 
  He brought with him a wealth of new information. "It was 
stunning," said one of the debriefers. "A whole ministry 
exposed, billions of roubles spent, a complete organisation 
shown to be a front; then there was the clear involvement of 
Gorbachev, this friend of the West. It just went on and on." 
  To cope with all the information Pasechnik produced, SIS, 
the 
Ministry of Defence and other government departments set up a 
special task force of scientists, intelligence officers and 
analysts to assess the intelligence and put it into a wider 
context. 
  It was painstaking work, but very fruitful. As he described 
his entire life, education and work, the taskforce understood 
for the first time the real relationship between the Academy of 
Sciences, previously considered a purely civilian body, and the 
Soviet military. 
  As is usual in such cases, the intelligence gleaned from 
Pasechnik was shared with the CIA; on both sides of the Atlantic 
the mosaic of Russia's biological weapons programme was 
gradually filled in. As the picture cleared, so both the CIA 
and SIS began to brief their respective political masters. For 
the first time, the politicians were given unambiguous reports, 
clearly prepared on the basis of information from a 
highly-placed defector. To underline the seriousness of the 
problem, Pasechnik was brought out to brief senior officials on 
both sides of the Atlantic. 
  The evidence was so compelling that even the politicians who 
had no wish to confront Gorbachev were left with no choice. In 
April 1990, the British and American governments jointly 
confronted the Soviet Union with the evidence and spelled out in 
detail what they knew. There was no reaction. 
  Then, in June 1990, President George Bush and Margaret 
Thatcher met separately with Gorbachev. Both raised the 
question of biological weapons; Gorbachev denied all knowledge. 
Thatcher, who believed she had a specially-close relationship 
with the Soviet leader, told him that unless the programme was 
stopped, the West would go public. Gorbachev promised that he 
would look into the matter. 
  Two months later, the Soviet foreign minister, Eduard 
Shevardnadze, sent a formal reply, rebutting the charges. By 
this time, both the CIA and SIS had produced an even more 
exhaustive briefing for Bush and Thatcher. Having succeeded in 
forcing action at the highest levels after so many years of 
frustration, the intelligence community was determined to press 
its case until the Russians confessed. 
  In December 1990, the Russians issued an invitation to 
Washington and London to visit four of the sites that had been 
named. A joint Anglo-American delegation was dispatched. 
  If the trip was intended to be reassuring, it had the 
opposite effect. In Obolensk the British discovered a chamber 
for testing biological weapons suspended in an aerosol. The 
steel room which was 50 feet square, had posts on the floor to 
which animals could be tied while vents in the ceiling allowed 
poisons to be sprayed into the room. 
  The team also discovered a chamber used to test delivery 
systems for biological weapons. At another site, there was row 
after row of fermenters used to mass produce hundreds of kilos 
of biological weapons -- a chilling confirmation of everything 
Pasechnik had revealed. 
  Nevertheless, the Russians continued their denials. In 
September 1991, a month after the attempted coup, John Major, 
the new British prime minister, met Gorbachev in the Kremlin. 
Publicly the two-hour meeting was confined to economic issues, 
but Major confronted him with the evidence of the secret weapons 
programme. 
  Again Gorbachev denied everything and moved the normally 
unflappable Major to wave an angry finger in the face of the 
Russian leader. "We've got the goods on you," he shouted. 
  As the intelligence community continued adding to the file, 
the confrontations with Moscow continued through the fall of 
Gorbachev and the rise to power of Boris Yeltsin. On February 
1, 1992, Bush and Yeltsin met for their first summit. In 
advance of the meeting at Camp David, American diplomats made 
clear that the biological weapons programme was a major 
stumbling block between the two allies and a gesture by Yeltsin 
in this area would be seen as a sign of a new era in 
U.S.-Russian relations. This time Yeltsin came prepared. He 
admitted, for the first time, that there had indeed been a 
secret programme and that he had ordered it to be shut down. 
  But it was not for another month that Yeltsin was told by 
his 
own officials of the full extent of the programme. In March, 
the Russian military finally came clean: they had secretly 
developed bombs and missiles capable of carrying the 
super-plagues in defiance of international agreements. Yeltsin 
signed a formal decree cancelling the programme. 
  But the disinformation did not stop there, as prominent 
Russian officials involved in the Biopreparat programme set 
about trying to minimise the work they had been involved in. It 
was a campaign filled with the kind of lies and evasions that 
were supposed to have vanished in the new era of democracy in 
Russia. 
  For example, General Valentin Yevstigneyev assured the 
newspaper NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: "There were not as many people 
involved as it might seem." He maintained that the work of the 
various laboratories was essentially for civilian purposes. He 
also tried to diminish the role of Pasechnik. 
  Reactions like these contributed to growing scepticism in 
both London and Washington that Yeltsin's order to dismantle the 
Biopreparat project was being carried out. Although the main 
testing site was reported to have been shut down, those 
monitoring the project were hardly reassured when it was 
announced that the man put in charge of the dismantling of 
Biopreparat would be General Anatoliy Kuntsevich, the architect 
of the Soviet Union's chemical weapons programme. His 
appointment was seen as a sop to the hardliners in the military. 
  One senior Western intelligence official said: "Here was 
this man who had done nothing but lie to us for years on 
chemical weapons, and now suddenly we are supposed to accept 
that he is willingly going to set about destroying his life's 
work. We could hardly be expected to take Yeltsin's promises at 
face value."

<F P=106> [Nicholas Bethell report: "Scientist Says Russians Still </F>
Defy Chemical Weapons Ban"] 
  [Text] Vil Mirzayanov, who became Russia's first 
post-Soviet political prisoner for revealing Russia's continuing 
chemical weapons programme, has spoken of "barbaric conditions" 
in the prison from which he was released last month. 
  Dr. Mirzayanov was told that the case against him, on 
charges 
carrying up to eight years in prison, has been dropped for lack 
of evidence. At his flat in Moscow he said: "I was called to 
the Ministry of Justice by Lev Baranov, the prosecutor in my 
case. It was a five-minute conversation. He apologised to me 
on behalf of A. N. Ilyushenko, Prosecutor-General of the Russian 
Federation. I told him that I would be taking the `new KGB' to 
court for the great moral and material damage they caused me 
these past 18 months." 
  Dr. Mirzayanov, 58, said that men were held at the 
Matrosskaya Tishina jail, sometimes for years, while their cases 
were investigated, with no visits permitted from friends or 
family. He described having to stand with 50 other prisoners, 
all naked because of the heat, in a cell infested with rats, 
cockroaches, bedbugs and lice, and so small that no one could 
lie down or sit. 
  Dr. Mirzayanov worked for more than 25 years in a large 
military chemical research institute on Enthusiasts' Avenue in 
Moscow. In 1990 he was one of the first to resign from the 
Communist Party to join the democratic movement. In October 
1992 he blew the whistle on his old firm, revealing that 
Russia's chemical warfare industry, despite the 1989 
Bush-Gorbachev agreement to destroy all chemical weapons and end 
production, was producing a new binary substance in Volgograd 
eight times more poisonous than anything possessed by the 
Americans. He was immediately arrested. 
  In early 1992, he said, field trials of the new gas were 
held 
on the Ustyurt plateau in what was by then the independent state 
of Uzbekistan, without the knowledge of President Karimov, the 
Uzbek leader. 
  "In other words, we pulled the wool over the Americans' eyes 
good and proper," he said. When the Americans found out later 
that year what was happening, they said nothing for fear of 
making Mr. Bush look foolish in the run-up to the presidential 
election. 
  Dr. Mirzayanov talked of past years in the Soviet military 
chemical establishment in Chapayevsk, where soldiers who were 
thought by the authorities to be of poor quality were put to 
work pouring lewisite, a deadly poisonous arsine derivative, 
from buckets and teapots into artillery shells. Many of them 
died. Then there was the great "white sea" accident when tons 
of poison were discharged into the Volga river, turning it white 
with the bellies of dead fish. 
  Russian scientists and generals, he says, continue their 
terrible work on chemical warfare even today. Accidents are 
frequent. They carry on working because it is the only trade 
they know and because chemical warfare has no possibility of 
"conversion" into peaceful work. 
  The Russian authorities have decided that the poisons to be 
destroyed under the Bush-Gorbachev agreement should be dealt 
with by those who made them. This is being done, he says, by 
burning the poisons in remote Russian localities, with 
disastrous results for the environment. 
  It is estimated by Dr. Mirzayanov that up to 50 per cent of 
those in Russian labour camps may be innocent of the charges on 
which they were convicted. He attributes his own escape from a 
long prison term to "pressure by Amnesty International, the 
European Parliament, the American Academy of Sciences and the 
Russian democratic movement". 
  Those who have no such friends are still wrongly convicted 
in 
large numbers. Aleksey Smirnov, the former Soviet dissident who 
is now chairman of the Centre for Human Rights in Moscow, said: 
"You must not imagine, just because the Soviet Union has gone, 
that Russia is now a country with monitors. We need observers. 
We need Western non-governmental organisations with staff and 
equipment. We need a civilised parliament. Then maybe we can 
make progress."

  [Text] Deputy head of Russian forces for nuclear, chemical 
and biological defences General Yuriy Tarasevich speaking in 
parliament put the country's stockpile of chemical weapons 
subject to destruction under an international convention at 
40,000 tons. These are deployed at seven different sites and 
must be destroyed within a period of ten years. 
  He said that chemical weapons causing a blistering effect 
were among the first to be destroyed at two sites-in the 
villages of Kamarka (Udmurtia) and Gorny (Saratov Region). 
Tarasevich said the operation would cost Rbl [rubles] 500 Bn 
[billion] at last year's prices. The total spending for the 
destruction of all chemical weapons runs at Rbl 2.5 Tn 
[trillion]. 
  However, Tarasevich declined to say whether Russia was 
engaged in the development of new-generation chemical weapons on 
the grounds that this should be "the subject of a special 
session." 
  Head of the Foreign Ministry's arms control department Oleg 
Sokolov said it would be in Russia's interests to become one of 
the first of 65 signatories to ratify the convention on the 
destruction of chemical weapons. He said "negative implications 
from Russia's failure to do so are obvious." 
  For his part, chemical scientist Vil Mirzayanov who was also 
involved in the hearings told reporters that Russia had offered 
to destroy 40,000 tons of chemical weapons though it had 
produced more than 400,000 tons. 
  In his view, the remainder was destroyed in a barbarous way 
without any elementary precautionary measures being taken, which 
in itself "is just as dangerous as the use of the weapon itself." 
  To begin with, an international commission of experts must 
be 
set up to find where and how those weapons were buried, he said. 
  Mirzayanov called for extending the destruction period from 
25 to 30 years given the enormous spending involved.

  [Text] An attempt is being made to resolve the issue of the 
elimination of chemical weapons behind the scenes without public 
debate, scientist Vil Mirzayanov declared in an interview with 
Interfax. 
  He said every effort should be made to keep the Duma from 
ratifying a treaty on chemical weapons destruction. 
  He said that "since Russia does not have an environmentally 
safe technology for chemical destruction, the period of chemical 
weapons scrapping should be prolonged from 10 years, as is 
envisaged in the treaty, to 25-30 years." 
  He called for an early debate on the issue with the leaders 
of parliamentary factions from Russia's Choice Party, Russian 
Unity and Concord Party, Yavlinsky's Association, Communist 
Party, and Liberal Democratic Party. 
  Mirzayanov argued that the proposed technology of burning 
chemical weapons could not guarantee safety and explained that 
this method provided for burning toxins in special hermetically 
sealed chambers and for filtering the resulting gasses. 
  "But here the question arises as what to do with the 
filters, 
which absorb poisonous pollutants", Mirzayanov said. Besides, 
in his words, nothing guarantees that through the filters 
chemical weapon components could not pollute the atmosphere. 
  He urged the Duma to sanction a chemical weapons inventory. 
In his words, "a weapon that has been buried is as dangerous as 
a weapon planned to be sealed." Mirzayanov noted that 
"pollutants have not only instantaneous but also delayed impact 
on people." 
  He predicted adverse effects for the next generation and 
said 
that "gradual but damaging changes are taking place in humans."

  [Text] Russia has been meeting its commitments on the 
supplies of cryogenic rocket boosters to India. 
  The deal, whose terms in line with the Missile Technology 
Control Regime, MTCR, were made public at the end of last year, 
has been officially endorsed by the Russian cabinet, a 
Vice-Chairman of Glavkosmos, Russia's major space research 
establishment, has said in an interview with Interfax. 
  In line with new terms, Russia is to deliver at least four 
cryogenic boosters to India for its SLV-3 rockets. This is 
twice more than envisaged by the contract signed by Glavkosmos 
in 1991. 
  Lifted up by a Russian booster, SLV-3 will be able to put 
loads in orbit about 36,000 kilometers above the earth. 
  As the General Director of Russia's Space Agency Yuriy 
Koptev 
has told Interfax, supplies of ready-made cryogenic blocks are 
within MTCR, which Russia wished to join by signing a memorandum 
of intent in Washington on September 2, 1993. 
  In Koptev's words, two additional blocks will be shipped to 
India to compensate for Russia's failure to meet the initial 
commitments, concerning the supply of technologies in bypass of 
MTCR. 
  Koptev declared that Russia had kept virtually intact the 
volume of financing, totalling $300 million, envisaged by the 
contract. India is to get the first booster next year.

  [Text] There can be no question of resuming nuclear tests 
at the Semipalatinsk test site, Kazakh leader Nursultan 
Nazarbayev told Russian mass media leaders in Moscow on 
Wednesday. 
  He said as many as 526 aerial, surface and underground 
nuclear blasts had been carried out in eastern Kazakhstan in the 
past 40 years. An estimated 500,000 people fell victim to the 
tests and serious environmental damage was caused. 
  "Kazakhstan has so far been left alone to face those 
problems. The Russian president and I discussed this at length 
and I can now say with confidence that Russia will help us in 
utilizing that large scientific complex for peaceful purposes. 
For example, the Semipalatinsk site can be used for testing 
safety systems of the nuclear power plants or as a space 
training center in concert with Baikonur," Nazarbayev said. 
  At the same time, he called for an international commission 
to be set up, Russia included, to assess the volume and nature 
of damage caused to the people and environment. "This can at 
least help set priorities in eliminating the harmful effects 
from testing," Nazarbayev said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "EU: European </F>
Employers (UNICE) Stress How Urgent It Is To Reach a Council 
Decision on Dual-Use Goods"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 15 Apr 94 (AGENCE EUROPE) - UNICE [Union 
of Industrial and Employers' Confederations of Europe], the 
spokesman for European business circles, has expressed concern 
about the delay by the Council of the Union in defining a regime 
to be applied to "dual-use" goods and technologies (civilian and 
military). It is a known fact that the problem concerns exports 
of such goods towards third countries. Difficulties arise from 
the need to reconcile the free movement of goods in the market 
without borders with the control of certain "sensitive" exports 
towards a number of third countries. If there is no common 
regime, then goods and technologies which could be used for 
military purposes would leave the [EC] Community and cross 
countries which do not have sufficient controls. This issue has 
implications on the defence policy of Member States which makes 
it difficult to define what regime should be introduced. UNICE 
recalls its earlier suggestions for resolving this problem 
through "effective export controls" which are not detrimental to 
the competitiveness of European companies. It affirms: "Although 
the Council's work has since made considerable progress, UNICE 
regrets that it has not been concluded. Ministers of the Twelve 
still do not agree on a number of points, such as the 
"catch-all" clause (treatment of suspect customers), length of 
and measures applicable during the transition period, which are 
fundamental to the efficient operation of a European Union 
export control system. Consequently, UNICE calls on ministers to 
resolve the outstanding problems urgently. The abolition of the 
Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM) 
on 31 March, which UNICE welcomes, makes the setting up of a 
European Union regime of export controls on dual-use goods and 
technologies all the more necessary. It would strengthen the 
European Union's position in the current negotiations related to 
the establishment of the New Forum in charge of defining the 
lists and procedures for future controls on dual-use products. 
For economic operators, cooperation between countries which have 
developed effective and reliable control regimes is essential to 
prevent distortions of competition both in Europe and with third 
countries. Lastly, at a time when the United States is reviewing 
its own export control regime, the European Union should seize 
the opportunity to show the way forward by putting in place an 
innovative system of export controls based on a licence-free 
European zone which could evolve in time into a licence-free 
zone at multilateral level, including the United States, Japan 
and any country which could meet the criteria defined in common. 
For all these reasons, UNICE stresses how urgent it is that 
decisions be taken."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "EP Calls for a </F>
Uniform EU Position for NPT Revision in 1995"] 
  [Text] Following its rapporteur, Carlos Robles Piquer on 
the revision of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) at 
the conference for revision scheduled for 1995, the European 
Parliament took an explicit stand in favour of a Community 
position that is as uniform as possible at this conference. It 
also noted with satisfaction that the European Commission has 
carried out preliminary action along these lines which will 
allow dialogue with the other Community institutions. The EP, 
that is particularly concerned about the "immense" risks 
entailed by the collapse of the Soviet system for the control of 
nuclear exports and the possibility that some of the 2000 to 
3000 USSR specialists in the nuclear weapons field will turn 
into "nuclear mercenaries," calls on the Union to insist upon 
the establishment of a universal control regime of the complete 
uranium and plutonium cycle for civilian use (also possibly of 
thorium), including material from the military cycle further to 
the partial dismantling of military arsenals. The EP notes that 
between 27,000 and 30,000 nuclear tactical and strategic weapons 
are stockpiled in the former Soviet Union alone. It also 
stresses the importance that the European Energy Charter 
attaches to nuclear energy and its safety, and the strategic 
role that this form of energy plays in energy supply and in the 
CIS' export potential. 
  In its resolution, the EP calls on the European Union, on 
the 
basis of Article VII of the NPT, to carry out political action 
aimed at encouraging the creation of denuclearised zones: The 
Parliament notes that, further to South Africa's accession to 
NPT, the African continent may be considered as a denuclearised 
zone, and calls on the Union for vigorous diplomatic action so 
that Brazil may follow the example of Cuba which joined the 
Tlatelolco Treaty. This would also make Latin America a nuclear 
weapon-free region. The EP states that the EU should include 
conditionality clauses on nuclear non-proliferation in 
cooperation agreements with third countries and that the 
cooperation actions eventually established by these agreements 
in nuclear energy matters should be strictly limited to the use 
of this type of energy for peaceful purposes. Such clauses 
should particularly be included in agreements with the CIS and 
Eastern European countries and the International Centre for 
Science and Technology in Moscow should make it possible for 
nuclear experts to specialize in energy applications. In 
addition, Parliament notes that: 
  - in the context of the Middle East peace talks, a 
denuclearized zone should be created in the region; 
  - the Commission departments responsible for security checks 
in the framework of the Euratom Treaty should apply the 
provisions on controls of exports of nuclear material to North 
Korea as stringently as possible. 
  Lastly, the EP calls for useless duplication between the 
IAEA 
(International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna) and the security 
control mechanisms established under Article 77 of the Euratom 
Treaty to be avoided.

Cooperation: 200 Scientists Meet in Zurich"] 
  [Text] A total of 200 European scientists and experts are 
meeting in Zurich until Thursday [28 April] to promote 
scientific cooperation in matters of security policy. An 
information exchange association is expected to be set up. The 
organizers of the meeting are the Federal Military Department 
and the Federal Department for Foreign Affairs. 
  The objective of this international conference is to promote 
the creation of research institutes with democratic objectives 
in Central and Eastern Europe. 
  The research institute on security policy matters and on 
analyzing conflicts of Zurich's Federal Polytechnic School and 
the UN Research Institute on Disarmament are participating in 
this conference as are approximately 100 research institutes on 
security policy issues. 
  Despite tight budgets, international cooperation is 
essential, Federal Counselor Kaspar Villiger said at the opening 
of the conference. International criminal organizations, 
uncontrolled migration flows, rising numbers of mass destruction 
weapons, and increased nationalist feelings are all serious 
problems for security policy, he added.

<F P=106> [Article by Liesl Graz, Berne: "Offshore Landing Dodges Arms </F>
Rules"] 
  [Text] A Swiss aircraft company is planning to move 
production to the Isle of Wight to take advantage of laxer 
British rules on arms exports. 
  Pilatus Aircraft, a subsidiary of Oerlikon-Buhrle, best 
known 
for its sophisticated weapons systems, currently manufactures 
its Pilatus PC-7 and PC-9 aircraft in Stans, near Lucerne. 
  The planes, originally developed for training, have been 
widely sold to countries such as Guatemala, Burma, Iraq, Iran 
and El Salvador. Swiss law prohibits military sales to `areas of 
conflict.' 
  Pilatus has long claimed that its planes are not military 
equipment and that, if armies buy them for training, that is not 
the same as buying them for killing. But the Defence Ministry, 
which decides when export licences may be granted, is 
interpreting the rules more narrowly. 
  The planes leave the factory equipped for training, but 
sometimes acquire gun points by the time they reach their 
destination. The Pilatus works and Oerlikon insist that they can 
do nothing about what happens to their products at stop-overs. 
At least one company in Belgium openly offers gun-ready 
conversion services. 
  Officially, the company says the reason for its move to 
Britain is `mostly money.' But the subtext is that the European 
Union in general, and Britain in particular, look more 
hospitable as export bases. 
  Pilatus will not say when the production transfer will take 
place and a spokesman said last week that no jobs would be lost 
in Stans, so aircraft for crop-dusting or training may be built 
there, while more problematic buyers are served from Britain. 
  The Pilatus works are named after a nearby mountain which 
commemorates a legend that a Roman, first name Pontius and known 
for washing his hands of responsibility, wound up there in his 
old age.

<F P=106> [Article by Louis Marie Horeau: "The superhoax of the </F>
Superphenix's Reactivation"] 
  [Text] The Creys-Malville machine is neither a laboratory 
nor an incinerator: It only produces electricity. 
  Although a firm defender of the Creys-Malville machine, an 
EDF [Electricity of France] engineer asks ironically: 
"Superphenix transformed into a research laboratory? Why not 
into a girl's boarding school?" Most nuclear specialists were 
incredulous of the government's announcement of a "conversion" 
of the supergenerator. Some believe that it is a camouflaged way 
of shelving it. Others lean toward a test balloon before a 
deceitful restart-up. But not one of them believes the fable of 
a "laboratory" crossed with a "waste incinerator" which [Prime 
Minister] Balladur tried to pass. 
  Moreover, if the various interpretations supplied by the 
press are to be believed, the glowing official explanations were 
not perfectly understood: 
  To believe LE QUOTIDIEN dated 24 February, it is a 
"restart-up" that the government is announcing: 
  On that same day, LIBERATION offered a different point of 
view, its article beginning with the words: "The Superphenix 
agony is beginning:" 
  As for LE FIGARO, it sees a rather happy old age and 
emphasizes the role of incinerator: The most controversial of 
the French nuclear projects will be converted into a nuclear 
waste incinerator. 
  Has anyone thought of turning it into an amusement park to 
compete with EuroDisney? 
  From now on, the first tasks entrusted to the Superphenix 
will be research and demonstration. Unfortunately, there already 
is a research laboratory devoted to breeding. It is called the 
Phenix and it has served as an experimental model since 1973, 
following the first studies carried out by another research 
reactor, Rapsodie, that went into service in 1967. Why not a 
third laboratory to corroborate the results obtained by the 
first two, and why not make preparation for a Hyperphenix? Thus, 
France could cover itself with research centers while waiting to 
find a machine that works. 
  But this wonderful project is coming up against a serious 
difficulty: In order to "experiment," the Superphenix must 
obviously be started. As soon as the reactor is in operation, 
even at a lower power, it produces an enormous quantity of heat. 
It is impossible to dissipate this heat by cooking soft-boiled 
eggs. The only solution is to produce electricity, which gives 
the "laboratory" the troublesome appearance of being a nuclear 
power plant. We will get over this by getting light from 
"experimental" electricity. 
  The incineration of plutonium, now qualified as a "waste," 
is 
the second mission entrusted to the Superphenix. An aside: For 
years, the eggheads of the Atomic Energy Commission and of the 
EDF have explained to us that plutonium is the wealth of the 
future. France even built the world's most expensive plant in 
The Hague; it produces plutonium. Today, the Superphenix, a 
machine costing more than 50 billion, is requested to destroy 
what The Hague produces. Logical? 
<H5>  Defective Core </H5>
  But the new and noble task of sanitary engineer entrusted to 
this jack-of-all-trade reactor poses a delicate problem. The 
core of the Superhenix is currently full of a nuclear fuel the 
composition of which does not allow it to function as a 
"sub-reactor" and therefore to consume plutonium. The reactor 
should first be unloaded. But a "fill-up" costs approximately 3 
billion francs. This is a little expensive to treat it like a 
lowly Kleenex. The only solution is to burn this first core. At 
full power, it will take 2 years. Since Superphenix, transformed 
into a laboratory, will only function at a lower power, 4 years, 
if not more, must be allowed. 
  For this deluxe trash can to be finally able to eat 
plutonium, a way must also be found to unload one by one the 
old-type fuel rods stored in the reactor. There are several 
hundred of them and it takes one day per rod; or, if everything 
goes well, one more year. 
  With a little luck, Superphenix will begin its new career as 
an incinerator in the year 2000. According to official figures, 
it could devour 200 kilograms annually if it were to operate at 
full power. Therefore, only 100 kilograms at 50 percent, etc. 
The French electronuclear pool is currently producing annually 
some 10 tons of plutonium. Building some 100 Superphenix is 
therefore sufficient to save France from plutonium 
superproduction. 
  Superheating in the brain of some nuclear officials is the 
one remaining danger.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Radioactive material is being stored 
at Bundeswehr facilities in Storkow near Berlin. In its 
response to a request from the Party of Democratic 
Socialism/Left Ticket, the Federal Press Office has stated that 
this is confirmed by the Federal Government. The facilities 
were taken over from the National People's Army of the GDR, and 
most of the radioactive material has come from those stocks. "A 
considerable part" of the material was also stored there by the 
GDR Ministry for State Security. The material consists of 
"sealed radioactive sources," mainly of the Cobalt 60 
radionuclide. The Bundeswehr was looking for ways of using this 
material, it was stated.

  [Excerpt] Bonn (DPA) -- In the struggle against arms 
exports, the Cologne Customs Office of Criminal Investigations 
has prevented 11 major cases of violations by German suppliers 
since October 1992. On the occasion of the current parliamentary 
discussions on the renewed amendment to the Foreign Economy Law, 
FRG Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (Free Democratic Party of 
Germany) noted in a position paper, which became known on 
Wednesday [13 April]: "The greatest success consists in catching 
the main German supplier for the nuclear program of a foreign 
country and uncovering his acquisition organization in Germany 
and Western Europe." According to industrial circles, the 
country could be Pakistan. 
  In four of the 11 cases involved intentional violations of 
the Military Materiel Control Law and one case involved the 
planned delivery of military goods to Iraq. In the other cases 
there was "the suspicion of planned subcontractor deliveries for 
nuclear and missile programs of various sensitive countries." 
With these explanations Rexrodt wanted to justify his stricter 
legal stipulations in the field of telecommunications secrecy 
and fines. The Bundestag Economics Committee, however, postponed 
its deliberations on this matter at short notice. [passage

  [Text] The ESA [European Space Agency] and the BNSC 
(British National Space Center) organized a press conference 
during the international oceanography congress held recently in 
Brighton. A report was given on the contribution being made to 
oceanographic studies by the first European remote-sensing 
satellite, the ERS-1, and on the future possibilities that will 
emerge when it is joined in the near future by the ERS-2, to be 
launched either in late 1994 or early 1995. 
  BNSC Assistant Director John Shrimplin opened the 
proceedings 
and introduced the speakers, Rene Bonnefoy, head of the ESA 
department for Earth observation programs, who reported on the 
current status of the ERS-1 mission, and T.W. Llwellyn-Jones of 
Leicester University, who described what the two ERS satellites 
would jointly be able to offer. A particularly interesting 
study made David Corr of Data Science Limited in Farnborough, 
was among the related papers presented at the congress in the UK 
seaside town. This paper shows that, although the primary 
function of the ERS's is to study oceanography, they have also 
proved to be ideal for another use, the production of digital 
elevation models (DEM). These are perspective images 
constructed from interferometric radar data obtained from space. 
This technique was first used in 1986 with data obtained using 
the Seasat satellite. However, in effect, it has only become 
universally known and commonly used since the great mass of 
interferometric data supplied by ERS-1 has been available. This 
offers global coverage and is also of such a high quality that 
it produces average resolution DEM's 5 meters high and 50 meters 
wide. 
<H5>  A Significant Italian Contribution </H5>
  ITaly's particularly important contribution to the ERS 
satellites is worth remembering. Alenia Spazio and its 
subsidiary Laben were respectively responsible for the design, 
development, and production of the radar altimeter (guiding an 
international industrial team made up of AME [expansion not 
provided], ETCSA [expansion not provided], Schrack, CASA 
[Aeronautic Constructions Company], and EMS [expansion not 
provided]), the on-board systems and equipment, and the testing 
and scientific data switching equipment (heading an 
international industrial team that included Odetics, BTM 
[expansion not provided], Spar, and ITL [expansion not 
provided]). FIAR, another Finmeccanica company, was in both 
teams. 
<H5>  The "TANDEM Scene" </H5>
  The Llewellyn-Jones report highlighted the value for 
oceanography, and more generally for the Earth observation, of 
the related activities that could be effected, with only 
marginally increased costs, in the months following the launch 
of ERS-2 when ERS-1 will still be operational (it should remain 
"in perfect health" until the end of 1995 and will continue to 
function during the first months of 1996, but will have a 
"degraded" capacity). He described the so-called "TANDEM Scene" 
of activity of the two satellites, that -- he underlined -- will 
be the only way to pursue a series of goals; the above-mentioned 
generation of global and medium-resolution DEM's, correct 
sampling of mesoscale oceanic structures, the determination 
(also by means of interferometry) of the height of forest tree 
foliage and of its variation, reporting on the mass and 
movements of glaciers and ice fields. These goals can only be 
pursued by making use of the satellites in TANDEM, and 
furthermore they could produce conspicuous benefits in sectors 
in which they cannot boast of having exclusive rights, such as 
the study of climatology (the mesoscale of wind fields, coastal 
winds), monitoring the growth of plants and studies of marine 
ice. 
  The TANDEM activity, in which a strong interest has been 
expressed both by the scientific community and by those working 
in applied fields (meteorology, agriculture, civil defense, 
etc.) could indicatively last from May to December 1995, but an 
extension to observe seasonal phenomena, particularly snow and 
ice during the early months of 1996, is not excluded if the 
performance of the ERS-1 remains at a high level. 
  The potential advantage of the TANDEM configuration is that 
it permits more frequent data acquisition for a given instrument 
(for example the SAR, Synthetic Aperture Radar ) for each area 
examined, and the comparison of data previously acquired by the 
instrument on one satellite with that acquired by another 
instrument (for example the ATSR, Among Track Scanning 
Radiometer) on the other satellite. The applications are 
extremely varied, and are even more so when the potential for 
global coverage in DEM form, with a resolution analogous to that 
of the SPOT [Probational Earth Observation Satellite] satellites 
is added. This is furthermore obtainable in any atmospheric or 
light conditions since radars are used.

<F P=106> [Article signed SK: "Total Ban on Chemical Weapons -- The </F>
Federal Council Wants To Ratify the International Convention"] 
  [Text] Bern, 20 Apr (ATSA) -- Switzerland should ratify the 
international convention banning chemical weapons and calling 
for their destruction. The Federal Council made this proposal 
to the Assembly in a message that was adopted on Wednesday [13 
April]. The convention is the first disarmament treaty for an 
entire category of mass-destruction weapons. Switzerland has no 
chemical weapons. 
  In January 1993, Switzerland signed the convention that bans 
the design, manufacture, storage, and use of chemical weapons. 
The participating states also pledged never to help anyone 
undertake activities breaking this convention. Besides, all 
existing stocks of chemicals weapons must be destroyed, as well 
as the plants innvolved in the making of such weapons and the 
weapons left by a state on foreign territory. 
  An exhaustive monitoring system -- extended to the civilian 
chemical industry -- will be set up to ensure that the 
convention is complied with. An international organization on 
banning chemical weapons will be established in The Hague to 
carry out this monitoring function. Over 150 states have signed 
the convention up till now, including Switzerland in January 
1993. 
<H5>  No Problem for Switzerland </H5>
  In its message, the Federal Council stressed that 
Switzerland 
itself does not have any mass-destruction weapons. It considers 
that the convention on chemical weapons is, together with the 
nonproliferation treaty, the most important multilateral treaty 
in the security field. The elimination of chemical weapons will 
reduce the risk of a serious military threat. The government 
further says that the destruction of such weapons will have to 
respect the environment. 
  The government underlines that the Swiss chemical industry 
unreservedly adheres to the objectives of the convention. 
Implementing this convention does not require creating new 
institutions or laws, but nevertheless implies considerable 
monitoring activities.

<F P=106> [Article signed "SM/AZ": "Disarmament Conference in Geneva </F>
Heads Toward Stopping All Nuclear Tests"; as released by Bern 
ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Geneva 30 Mar (ATS) -- Nuclear tests have been 
partially prohibited since 1963. The Disarmament Conference 
devoted most of its winter session, which ended in Geneva on 
Wednesday [30 March], to drawing up a treaty that would prohibit 
all nuclear tests. The stage of declaring good intentions is 
now past, and a treaty could be ready within the next 12 to 18 
months, affirmed Mexican Ambassador Miguel Marin-Bosch. 
  Mr. Marin-Bosch, who is the chairman of the committee 
responsible for negotiating such an agreement reiterated that 
since the signature of the Treaty of Moscow in 1963 -- banning 
nuclear tests within the atmosphere, in extra-atmospheric space, 
and underwater -- more than 2,000 nuclear tests had been carried 
out by the United States and the former USSR. Both these 
countries, along with Great Britain, are signatories to the 
agreement on a partial stop to tests. 
  Mr. Marin-Bosch underlined that a treaty prohibiting all 
nuclear tests constituted a "very important" part of a universal 
regime aimed at nuclear non-proliferation. In particular, this 
regime involves negotiations on certain fissile materials, and 
an agreement protecting those countries which have no nuclear 
weapons. 
<H5>  Ratified by 160 Countries </H5>
  Some 160 countries have now ratified the treaty partially 
banning nuclear tests. Moreover, the United States and Russia 
have decided on a moratorium of their underground tests, 
prolonged until 1995. Great Britain is de facto applying the 
same rule. 
  For France, President Francois Mitterrand stated that his 
country would also observe a moratorium for as long as he 
remained president. China may shortly go ahead with a test in 
the atmosphere. However, when deciding on its moratorium, the 
United States probably estimated that fresh Chinese tests would 
not undermine their technological progress, asserted Mr. 
Marin-Bosch.

  [Text] In a bid to prevent former Soviet scientists and 
engineers involved in the development of nuclear weapons from 
emigrating to other nations, Japan, the United States, Europe, 
and Russia have established the International Science and 
Technology Center [ISTC] in Moscow. It has been learned that a 
Japan-proposed plutonium research project to be undertaken at 
the ISTC remains shelved after the United States opposed it. 
The United States is believed to have opposed the project with 
the aim of keeping both Japan and Russia from engaging in 
plutonium research; the U.S. opposition is likely to cause a 
problem for Japan which has promoted the plutonium research 
project under an international framework. 
  The Japan-proposed project is composed of two research 
areas: 
the development of a new-type fast breeder reactor which uses 
lead instead of sodium as a coolant, and research on group 
separation of radioactive waste. Japan has proposed promoting 
the plutonium research project in response to Russian hopes; the 
Japan Atomic Power Research Institute and other Japanese 
research institutes are to cooperate with the project. 
  The ISTC held its first session of the Board of Governors 
from 17 to 18 March in Moscow. The U.S. Government notified the 
Japanese Government just prior to the session that "it objects 
to any project to promote Russia's use of plutonium." 
  As reasons for objecting to the project, the U.S. Government 
is said to have cited: 
  (1) its concern over Russia's lax management of nuclear 
materials; and 
  (2) the inconsistency of the Japan-proposed plutonium 
research project with the U.S. policy of pursing nuclear 
nonproliferation. 
  In response, the Japanese Government has notified the U.S. 
Government: "Given the objective of establishing the ISTC to 
prevent Russian scientists and engineers in charge of handling 
plutonium from emigrating, it is inappropriate not to undertake 
plutonium-related research projects." 
  The first session of the Board of Governors held in March 
did 
not take up the Japan-proposed plutonium research project for 
discussion, and withheld adopting other research projects in 
question. However, the first session decided to undertake 23 
research projects unrelated to plutonium. The cost of those 
research projects is estimated at approximately $12 million. 
  The next session of the Board of Governors scheduled for 
June 
is set to adopt additional research projects; the Japanese 
Government plans to consult with the U.S. Government about the 
bilateral dispute over the Japan-proposed plutonium research 
project. Some government officials take the view that Japan 
will have to conduct a partial review of the plutonium research 
project to ensure its smooth undertaking.

<F P=106> [Article by Valeriy Fedorovich Davydov, candidate of </F>
historical sciences and Institute of the USA and Canada senior 
scientific associate: "Russia and the United States: Facing the 
Challenge of Nuclear Proliferation"] 
  [Text] One of the focuses of U.S. and Russian foreign 
policy priorities is the goal of preventing further 
proliferation of nuclear weapons. In the 1960's, at the height 
of the Cold War, the United States and the USSR acknowledged 
that for the sake of international security and their own 
security it was essential to limit the number of members in the 
"nuclear club." Today political rapprochement and the 
establishment of alliance relations between the United States 
and Russia offer broader opportunities for joint or parallel 
actions. 
  However, it is clear that their bilateral efforts are as yet 
inadequate to the degree of threat to international security 
posed by nuclear proliferation. The three "underground" nuclear 
states -- Israel, India and Pakistan -- are outside the bounds 
of the Nuclear Weapons Non-Proliferation Treaty. According to 
experts' estimates they already possess a certain number of 
completed nuclear devices. The Republic of South Africa, which 
joined the treaty in 1990, has stated that it produced six 
nuclear warheads in the 1970's and 1980's. Of the CIS member 
states with nuclear weapons deployed in their territory, Belarus 
and Kazakhstan have signed the treaty. Ukraine remains a 
non-member. Argentina and Brazil, which have a highly-developed 
nuclear industry, are also not members. 
  Nor is the picture any more encouraging among the treaty's 
signatories. In March of last year North Korea officially 
announced its intention to withdraw from the treaty and thereby 
free itself from its political obligations not to build nuclear 
weapons.[.sup]1[/] Even though Pyongyang has not yet made 
good on its threat, this could set a dangerous precedent. As 
demonstrated by Iraq's large-scale nuclear weapons efforts as 
revealed during the Gulf War, it cannot be assumed that some 
states might not use their participation in the treaty as 
camouflage for the accumulation of fissionable materials and 
nuclear technology for military purposes. Experts list Iran, 
Syria, Algeria, Libya, Taiwan and South Korea among such 
countries. Programs for the use of nuclear energy for peaceful 
purposes can significantly simplify and accelerate the road to 
acquiring nuclear weapons. Despite the international system to 
control the trading and exchange of nuclear materials and 
technologies, "black" and "grey" markets continue to operate, 
and there technologies and materials with direct or dual 
applications can still be acquired. The collapse of the USSR 
created a further risk of trade in contraband and a "brain 
drain" to states striving to acquire nuclear weapons. 
  According to experts' projections, if the most decisive 
measures are not taken there could be more than 10 members in 
the "nuclear club" by the start of the 21st century, and the 
expansion will take place among the developing states. That 
prospect, coupled with an alarming situation regarding 
proliferation of other weapons of mass destruction -- chemical 
and biological weapons and missiles -- requires the United 
States and Russia, as the two principal founders of the 
non-proliferation system, to fundamentally reevaluate their 
traditional approaches to prevention of nuclear weapons 
transfers from one country to another, in order to achieve 
greater effectiveness in ensuring international and their own 
national security. 
  Beginning in the 1960's the policy of the United States and 
the USSR in non-proliferation field was based on a 
discriminatory principle: we (the nuclear powers) may have 
nuclear weapons, while you (the non-nuclear powers) may not. At 
the height of the Cold War, when the accumulation and 
improvement of nuclear arsenals was the main concern of the two 
opposing superpowers, one could hardly have expected any other 
approach. The current system for monitoring of non-nuclear 
states' activities by the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) was established, a system accepted by them largely as a 
result of pressure from the United States and the USSR. But even 
in those years, aware of the vulnerability of their position, 
Washington and Moscow stressed that the system was only intended 
to "buy time" -- restraining nuclear proliferation until such 
time as they could reach agreement among themselves on a way to 
stop the nuclear arms race. This was also reflected in the text 
of the treaty, in which non-nuclear states pledged not to build 
nuclear weapons (Article II) and nuclear states pledged to 
undertake disarmament (Article VI). However, during the period 
of nuclear confrontation the latter frequently ignored their 
pledges. Despite the fact that all the fundamental agreements 
between the United States and the USSR -- SALT I and SALT II -- 
acknowledged the need to comply with obligations under Article 
VI, they nevertheless actually led to further expansion and 
improvement of nuclear weapons arsenals. The nuclear arms race 
and the doctrine of nuclear weapons use created a nuclear 
weapons cult, and the discriminatory double standard applied in 
regard to non-proliferation spurred on efforts by Israel, India, 
Pakistan and other countries to acquire them. The legacy of the 
Cold War is that even today nuclear weapons remain a symbol of 
military and political greatness and, consequently, a cherished 
dream of countries counting on playing a leading role in their 
region or in the international arena. 
  Would the appearance of nuclear arsenals of perhaps only a 
few dozen warheads in a number of developing states really be 
such a threat to American and Russian security interests, 
considering that Washington and Moscow possess thousands of 
nuclear weapons each? Just one or two nuclear strikes within 
U.S. or Russian territory would be considered unacceptable 
damage to their security. Such a threat would increase 
significantly in the event of the further spread of nuclear 
missile technology. In that event strategic stability could be 
superseded by chaos, in which the threat of regional nuclear 
conflicts, involvement of the current nuclear powers therein, 
and anonymous nuclear missile attacks would increase many times 
over. Already in the 1990's the focus of the nuclear threat has 
shifted from the developed countries to the developing world. In 
1990 threats to use nuclear and chemical weapons were issued 
alternately by both Israel and Iraq, and during the Gulf War by 
the United States and Iraq. If Baghdad had succeeded in building 
a nuclear weapon before the start of the war, it apparently 
would have used it, just as it used its ballistic missiles. That 
same year the risk of nuclear conflict arose between India and 
Pakistan as a result of the dispute over Kashmir. In 1993 the 
threat of a similar conflict between North and South Korea was 
considered serious. 
  A majority of experts reject the possibility that nuclear 
weapons will be used by the current nuclear powers against each 
other.[.sup]2[/] We are witnessing an unprecedented 
devaluation of the military significance of various types of 
nuclear weapons, and interest in Russian-American agreements to 
control them is waning. 
  The era of nuclear competition between the superpowers is 
over, but it could be followed by an era in which weapons of 
mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, will proliferate. 
In order to keep that from happening the United States and 
Russia are demanding preemptive, coordinated joint efforts 
without parallel in the past. Furthermore, new principles are to 
form the basis of non-proliferation policy. 
  Firstly, the United States and Russia should acknowledge 
jointly that proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is the 
principal threat to their national security and international 
security. It is precisely from that standpoint that their 
political and military relations should be restructured, and the 
sooner, the better. The spectrum of interaction should include 
global monitoring of nuclear activities by "underground" nuclear 
and "threshold" nuclear states -- exchange of intelligence 
information between the CIA and the Foreign Intelligence 
Service, development of preventive measures against the possible 
use of nuclear weapons, and joint research in the field of 
anti-missile defense. 
  Secondly, it has become clear that it will not be possible 
for very long to try to combine the uncombinable -- retaining 
the "nuclear club" while not admitting anyone else to it. In 
order to prevent expansion of the "nuclear club" it will be 
necessary, along with its other members, to begin the process of 
disbanding it, taking far-reaching steps in that direction such 
as complete bans on nuclear testing, the production of 
fissionable materials for military purposes and use of nuclear 
weapons. Only in that event can one hope that a 
non-proliferation system based on an appropriate treaty be 
effective and universal. 
  Thirdly, the United States and Russia should rely primarily 
on political methods of preventing nuclear proliferation, 
avoiding the use of force and not attempting to use existing 
problems as an excuse to justify preparations for a new cold 
war, this time between North and South. The role of nuclear 
police is not only intolerable from a moral standpoint, it will 
also inevitably have the directly contrary effect on 
international and national security. That role could in various 
non-nuclear states prompt a powerful desire to put an end to the 
"military and political hegemony" of the current nuclear powers 
through the accumulation of nuclear weapons by associations of 
various states, for example the Islamic states. In view of the 
rapid proliferation of missile equipment and technology in the 
developing world, the territory of the United States and Russia 
will sooner or later lie within the range of new nuclear 
countries' missiles forces. It would be necessary to pay an 
unacceptable price for taking part in the establishment of 
nuclear order in the world, i.e. an increased threat to national 
security. It is not likely that high-tech anti-missile defense 
systems will provide a 100-percent guarantee of the nuclear 
states' invulnerability against strikes by potential members of 
the "nuclear club." The most promising route for the United 
States and Russia to take is not strategic preparations for 
expansion of the "nuclear club," but instead prevention of 
nuclear proliferation. 
  Will the United States and Russia be able to quickly 
restructure their military and political relations in such a way 
as to fully subordinate them to the problems of confronting a 
new challenge? The two countries' success in the 
non-proliferation field will to a significant degree depend on 
the answer to that question. 
  As the creators of a non-proliferation system, they will be 
responsible for breathing new life into the treaty, ensuring 
that it continues to function into the 21st century and 
attempting to bring in those states that are not currently 
signatories to it. The United States and Russia must state 
unambiguously that they condemn the aspirations of any state to 
acquire nuclear weapons, regardless of the nature of their 
relations with them, and they must classify the use of such 
weapons as a crime against humanity. 
  It appears important that the U.N. Security Council draft a 
special declaration on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. It 
should express two key non-discriminatory principles of new 
policy in this area. On the one hand, a statement by the five 
permanent members of the Security Council declaring nuclear 
weapons proliferation intolerable, and on the other a clear 
expression of their willingness to disband the "nuclear club" 
and eliminate nuclear weapons completely. The highest-level 
Security Council session in January 1992 could be considered a 
first step; following that session it was stated that the 
proliferation of weapons of mass destructions posed a threat to 
peace. It is logical to assume that the next step could be the 
aforementioned declaration. 
  Support for the treaty by all permanent Security Council 
members who possess veto power would allow one to assume that 
the council is capable of playing a more decisive role in 
affirming non-proliferation as a standard, violation of which 
would invoke the U.N.'s use of adequate measures as provided for 
by Chapters VI and VII of the U.N. Charter. That possibility 
stems from the final document of a Security Council session 
which states that Security Council members will take appropriate 
measures in the event of any violations reported to them by the 
IAEA. 
  In 1993 the U.N. Security Council was unable to take such 
measures (China was opposed) with regard to North Korea, which 
had announced that it was withdrawing from the treaty, primarily 
because the five permanent members had no coordinated position 
on how to resolve nuclear non-proliferation issues. Drafting a 
special declaration would not only facilitate greater U.N. 
effectiveness, but would also ensure support by the world 
community against any violator of the nuclear non-proliferation 
regime. The United States and Russia should play the leading 
role in achieving consensus among the nuclear states regarding 
the need to adopt such a declaration. 
  The United States and Russia could add to the world 
non-proliferation system additional barriers to preparations by 
"threshold" states. That role could be played primarily by 
complete bans on nuclear testing and the production of 
fissionable materials for military purposes. 
  Sooner or later the time will come when there will be a need 
for the "threshold" states to test their nuclear devices. A 
complete test ban treaty could essentially be an insurmountable 
obstacle to a political decision by any "threshold" country to 
conduct such tests. Thus realization of a program to create 
reliable nuclear forces could be halted at an early stage. The 
presidents of the United States and Russia agreed at their 
meeting in Vancouver that negotiations on a multilateral nuclear 
test ban should begin in the near future, and that their 
governments will carry out appropriate consultations among 
themselves.[.sup]3[/] Any delay in drafting a complete test 
ban could be fraught with serious consequences: firstly, the 
risk of a test being carried out by some "underground" or 
"threshold" state for the purpose of declaring itself a nuclear 
state and, secondly, complications in the 1995 conference on the 
further fate of the treaty and its expiration date. 
  The problem of fissionable materials for military purposes 
is 
analogous. So long as they continue to be produced by the 
nuclear states, one can hardly expect the candidates for the 
"nuclear club" not to do the same. Many years of efforts to 
convince Israel, India, Pakistan and other countries to place 
their facilities for the production of enriched uranium and 
weapons-grade plutonium under IAEA monitoring have proven 
fruitless. As demonstrated by the examples of Iraq and North 
Korea, even countries that are signatories to the treaty are 
secretly stockpiling fissionable materials. It is clear that 
only if the nuclear powers agree to the measure will it be 
possible to expect similar steps by the "threshold" countries. 
Surpluses of already manufactured materials in the United States 
and Russia and the closure of a number of the facilities in 
question have made easier realization of the idea of a global 
halt to the production of fissionable materials for military 
purposes and appeals to other nuclear and "threshold" states to 
join in the initiative. A proposal put forward by President 
Clinton in September 1993 at a session of the U.N. General 
Assembly was a timely step in that direction. 
  The United States and Russia could also give joint 
consideration to ways of expanding the IAEA's authority. IAEA 
inspectors would take part as observers in monitoring of 
compliance with treaties on the elimination of nuclear weapons. 
After reprocessing, a portion of the fissionable materials could 
be transferred to that international organization for use in the 
implementation of peaceful nuclear programs. This could 
graphically demonstrate that both sides are willing to beat 
their swords into plowshares and convert their nuclear 
production facilities in the spirit of President Eisenhower's 
"Atoms for Peace" program. In that event the United States and 
Russia would be called upon to facilitate a further increase in 
the effectiveness of IAEA monitoring and respect for it in the 
international arena. 
  In 1995 a conference of treaty signatories will be held to 
decide whether the treaty should remain in force indefinitely or 
only for a specific period of time. The treaty text leaves no 
other choice: the conference does not have the right to decide 
to abrogate the agreement. Nevertheless, it is possible that 
participants might extend the treaty for a short period of time, 
upon expiration of which it would be considered invalid. It is 
also possible that some individual participants might exercise 
their right to withdraw from the treaty as granted to them by 
Article X. In 1995 an effort might be made to make extension of 
the treaty contingent upon the nuclear powers' performance of 
their disarmament obligations (Article VI), specifically by 
banning nuclear testing. 
  At all four conferences held to verify the workings of the 
treaty (1975, 1980, 1985 and 1990) the non-nuclear states have 
regularly criticized the nuclear powers for failing to perform 
their obligations, and in particular for continuing to conduct 
tests. The SALT I and SALT II treaties are definitely capable of 
reducing tension over this issue in 1995, but they will hardly 
be enough to achieve the main goal: extending the treaty 
indefinitely. It is of fundamental importance that the text of a 
complete nuclear test ban treaty be drafted by the time the 
conference opens in 1995. The same end could also be served by 
the aforementioned declaration by the nuclear states that are 
the five permanent Security Council members, regarding their 
willingness to see nuclear disarmament through to the end. There 
is no need to set strict time limits on elimination of nuclear 
weapons; the most important thing is to express an official 
interest in the complete and guaranteed liberation of the world 
from nuclear weapons. 
  Another area in which the treaty can be reinforced is 
expansion of the number of signatories. The next group of new 
members should come from the independent states that have 
emerged in place of the former USSR and Yugoslavia. Lithuania, 
Latvia, Estonia, Belarus and Uzbekistan have already signed the 
treaty. The United States and Russia could have some influence 
on other states as well in order to ensure that they sign the 
treaty by the start of the 1995 conference. 
  In the course of efforts to provide the new states' 
governments with an incentive, the United States could let it be 
known that it is willing to help them resolve their economic 
difficulties if they will sign the treaty. For its part, Russia 
could on similar terms promise assistance with the development 
of peaceful atomic industry, in particular nuclear power plant 
construction. 
  By the time of the 1995 conference it would also be possible 
to think about ways of rewarding developing countries that have 
nuclear power development programs for signing the treaty and 
abiding by the non-proliferation regime. The idea of providing 
them at a favorable price the enriched uranium obtained through 
dismantling of nuclear warheads seems attractive. 
  The most significant difficulties face the United States and 
Russia in their efforts to turn back the clock on nuclear 
proliferation in South Asia -- the "race" between India and 
Pakistan -- and in the Near East, i.e. in Israel, and to prevent 
the building of nuclear weapons by North Korea and eliminate 
threat that nuclear weapons will be retained by Ukraine and 
other CIS members. 
  The example of South Africa, which stated in March 1993 that 
it had dismantled all its previously manufactured nuclear bombs, 
gives reason to hope that the same path might also be taken by 
the "underground" nuclear states -- India, Pakistan and Israel. 
The most important thing today is to restrain those states from 
any attempts to officially declare themselves nuclear states 
prior to the start of the 1995 conference. 
  India's position on non-proliferation issues is ambiguous 
and 
not fully defined. On the one hand, it was one of the first 
countries in the world to support the idea of non-proliferation. 
New Delhi regularly expresses its support for complete bans on 
nuclear testing and the use of nuclear weapons and for complete 
elimination of all nuclear potential and creation of a nuclear 
weapons-free world. On the other hand, India was the first 
developing country to label the treaty discriminatory, saying it 
permanently divided the countries of the world into nuclear and 
non-nuclear, as well as the first developing country, in 1974, 
to test a nuclear device, throwing down an open challenge to the 
non-proliferation system. According to experts' estimates it may 
have approximately 100 nuclear devices. India takes a negative 
position on the idea of creating a nuclear-free zone in South 
Asia and toward bilateral agreements with Pakistan to ban 
nuclear weapons testing and nuclear weapons proliferation in the 
region. If nuclear weapons proliferation continues, Indian 
"hawks" might gain the upper hand and the country would set out 
irreversibly on the path to producing and deploying nuclear 
weapons. 
  However, after the end of the Cold War it became obvious 
that 
the world was moving in a different direction: the United States 
and Russia concluded far-reaching agreements on reducing their 
nuclear arsenals; South Africa signed the treaty, and Argentina 
and Brazil, though not parties to the treaty, announced their 
renunciation of military nuclear programs. India's relations 
with nuclear China improved markedly. Therefore the positions of 
those in India who support a wait-and-see course have been 
significantly strengthened. The only thing that could tip the 
scales in favor of open possession of nuclear weapons would be 
intensification of nuclear preparations by Pakistan. 
  According to experts' estimates, Pakistan probably has 
approximately 10-15 nuclear devices. However, they believe that 
Pakistan's military nuclear program was frozen in 1990, when the 
United States cut off military aid in response to the 
acceleration of that program and stated that the entire complex 
of American-Pakistani economic and political relations would be 
called into question if the program were carried out. U.S. 
pressure produced results (albeit temporary ones) -- it became 
possible to exert diplomatic influence on the positions of New 
Delhi and Islamabad. The role of the United States and Russia in 
this region is divided: the United States restrains Pakistan, 
and Russia restrains India. 
  Thus far India has taken a negative stance on convening a 
five-state conference (India, Pakistan, the PRC, Russia and the 
United States) on security and nuclear non-proliferation issues 
in South Asia. However, its approach will change in any event if 
the United States and Russia officially announce their 
willingness to completely eliminate nuclear arsenals, if a 
corresponding U.N. Security Council declaration is adopted and, 
finally, if multilateral accords banning the testing or use of 
nuclear weapons are achieved. Even today the United States and 
Russia could begin discussing with India the latter's idea of 
creating a nuclear-free world, as well as the role that it would 
play in restraining nuclear proliferation among developing and 
non-aligned states. 
  As in the case of India and Pakistan, there is little 
likelihood that Israel will join the treaty prior to the 1995 
conference. Its signing of the treaty could be the final act in 
a series of events that will lead to the creation of an 
effectively monitored nuclear-free zone in the Near East. That 
has long been proclaimed as a goal by the Arab countries, Iran 
and Israel, and is supported by the United States and Russia. 
Creation of a zone free of nuclear weapons is a lengthy process 
requiring the development of a monitoring system encompassing 
not only nuclear weapons, but also missile, chemical and 
biological weapons. Furthermore, a nuclear-free zone can be just 
one means of resolving the political issues that are the basis 
of military tension in the Near East. However, neither does that 
mean that we should wait for a general resolution of the Near 
East situation and only then begin creating such a zone. Since 
Iraq's nuclear capability was destroyed Israel has essentially 
had no competitors capable of challenging its nuclear monopoly 
in the region. According to experts' estimates, it has 150-200 
nuclear devices. Yet it is quite obvious that the Arab countries 
and Iran are not likely to let Tel Aviv retain that monopoly 
forever. Israel is also very concerned by the fact that some 
Arab countries are stockpiling chemical weapons and acquiring 
missile technology as a counterweight to its nuclear potential. 
All this could prompt Israel to take a more positive and 
constructive attitude toward plans to create a zone in the Near 
East free of weapons of mass destruction, plans under which Tel 
Aviv would attempt to a certain extent to exchange its nuclear 
potential for chemical, biological and missile disarmament in 
the Arab countries. 
  Since the end of the Cold War and the reestablishment of 
diplomatic relations with Russia the nuclear threat to Israel 
has been virtually non-existent. Alliance relations with the 
United States and de facto guarantees of the 
foundations of its security deprive continuation of a military 
nuclear program of all motivation. It was in this situation that 
the United States and Russia became able to influence Israel to 
stop the further implementation of that program and freeze its 
nuclear preparations. 
  A difficult situation exists on the Korean Peninsula. If the 
Korean People's Democratic Republic were to acquire nuclear 
weapons this could, according to expert consensus, have the most 
dramatic effects on the non-proliferation system. In that case 
South Korea would be forced to reexamine its approach to nuclear 
weapons and make the decision to build them. One after the 
other, many countries in Asia, particularly Japan and Taiwan, 
could be drawn into a nuclear arms race. Therefore the stakes in 
whether or not North Korea has nuclear weapons are very high, 
requiring the United States and Russia, as the founders of the 
non-proliferation system, to take immediate yet well-reasoned 
measures. 
  The North Korean threat caught everyone off guard. Despite 
the fact that American and Russian experts have repeatedly 
warned that such a step was possible[.sup]4[/], the nuclear 
powers proved unprepared for this turn of events, once again 
demonstrating the lack of high-priority attention to nuclear 
non-proliferation issues. As pointed out previously, efforts to 
take action through the U.N. Security Council have been 
fruitless, but that may be for the best. In the opposite case, 
if economic and political sanctions were taken against North 
Korea, the treaty itself would be compromised, because it 
provides for voluntary participation and the right to withdraw 
from the treaty. A treaty is not a prison whose escapees must be 
forcibly returned to their place of detention and punished. 
  The United States and Russia were forced to resort to the 
methods of "quiet diplomacy," but thereupon discovered that they 
had virtually no political leverage, or else that it was very 
limited. That is especially true of Russia. After abrogating its 
treaty of friendship and mutual assistance with North Korea, 
almost completely shutting off shipments of raw materials and 
weapons and undertaking a political reorientation toward South 
Korea, Russia lost its main sources of influence on North Korea. 
As a result, if there were anyone else that could influence 
North Korea, then that would mainly be its ally China. The 
United States and Russia have been forced to work through 
Beijing, but at this point it is difficult to say how successful 
that influence will be. 
  The temptation is great to resolve the issue by force. But 
until the world community and the U.N. Security Council give the 
go-ahead for any such actions, they would be regarded as 
aggressive acts, and that could harm the non-proliferation 
system. At the present stage, U.S. and Russian interaction 
should have the goal of preventing North Korea from officially 
declaring itself a nuclear state. 
  The interests of the United States and Russia coincide on 
their approach to the hotbed of nuclear proliferation that has 
emerged in place of the former USSR. Both powers understand that 
if it is not extinguished and if in addition to a nuclear Russia 
there also emerged other nuclear states -- for example, Ukraine 
-- that could spur on the spread of nuclear weapons to other 
regions and undermine the world's policy of restraining the 
ambitions of "threshold" countries. For Russia that goal is of 
vital importance, as its security interests require that it be 
surrounded by nuclear-free states. 
  By 1994 there were political indicators permitting one to 
hope that by the start of the 21st century only Russia will 
still be a nuclear power. These were: firstly, the Alma-Ata and 
Minsk (1991) accords regulating nuclear relations in the CIS; 
secondly, Russia's assumption of the USSR's seat in the U.N. 
Security Council; thirdly, pledges by Ukraine, Belarus and 
Kazakhstan to become nuclear-free states under the Lisbon 
Protocol (May 1992) to the SALT I Treaty; fourthly, the SALT II 
Treaty, which provides for elimination of a majority of the 
missiles deployed in the republics' territory; fifthly, the 
constitutional obligations of Ukraine and Belarus to become 
nuclear-free states; and, sixthly, the categorical 
unacceptability to the industrially developed countries of the 
world of other republics besides Russia possessing nuclear 
weapons. The successful completion in mid-1992 of the withdrawal 
of tactical nuclear weapons from the other republics to Russia, 
ratification of the SALT I Treaty by Belarus, Ukraine (though 
with some caveats) and Kazakhstan, and Belarus' signing of the 
non-proliferation treaty indicate that the accords can be 
implemented within the scheduled time frame. 
  However, it would be a serious political mistake to think 
that the issue is settled. The process of regulating mutual 
nuclear relations could be interrupted by a possible collapse of 
the CIS, social upheavals in the republics, assumption of power 
by extremely nationalistic forces, and increasing economic and 
political instability in Russia itself. In the event of the 
worst-case scenario -- social upheavals and civil war -- control 
over nuclear proliferation and weapons would be lost completely. 
  In this situation, assessment of the approaches taken to 
this 
issue by Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan is important. Ukraine's 
approach to nuclear weapons is taking shape under the influence 
of two factors: on the one hand, the need to abide by its 
official obligations to sign the treaty and become a de 
jure nuclear-free state following the withdrawal of 
strategic nuclear forces to Russian territory and, on the other, 
efforts to take advantage of its temporary position as a 
de facto nuclear state to increase its political 
prestige in the world arena and strengthen its security relative 
to a nuclear Russia during a period of heated debate over the 
Crimea and the Black Sea Fleet. 
  Whereas the former factor makes it possible to put forward 
various anti-nuclear initiatives regarding, for example, the 
establishment of joint control with Russia over destruction of 
nuclear devices withdrawn from Ukrainian territory, 
transformation of the Black Sea into a nuclear-free zone, 
Russian suspension of further nuclear testing, etc., the latter 
factor means a desire to keep nuclear weapons in its territory 
as long as possible, to achieve greater control over those 
weapons, to participate directly in subsequent negotiations with 
the United States regarding their elimination, etc. It should be 
noted that in the Ukrainian parliament increasing criticism is 
being levelled at the president (particularly by deputies from 
Rukh) as political tensions with Russia increase, accusing him 
of giving up nuclear weapons without receiving any security 
guarantees in return. Strong pressure on the president is also 
coming from the rapidly emerging military-industrial complex, 
which, as in Russia, cannot imagine life without missiles and 
nuclear weapons. 
  However, one should not completely ignore the extreme 
scenario, in which rapidly developing nationalist sentiments 
could prompt a decision to keep nuclear forces. The idea of 
disarming this nuclear capability and taking a series of 
measures as a result of which it will become unusable, as put 
forward by the Clinton administration, seems extremely 
important. It is equally important for Ukraine to become an 
official signatory to the non-proliferation treaty as soon as 
possible, without waiting for the withdrawal of strategic 
systems from its territory. It does not matter who is capable of 
more successfully solving this problem, whether the United 
States or Russia. The most important thing is that it be solved. 
  Belarus was the first country to turn its nuclear weapons 
over to Russia and sign the treaty. This example is worthy of 
imitation and should be financially rewarded by 
Russia and the United States. 
  Kazakhstan is located in a fundamentally different 
geopolitical environment than Ukraine or Belarus. Its proximity 
to nuclear China and the "threshold" states India and Pakistan 
has prompted serious concerns over guarantees of its security in 
the event that its nuclear weapons are withdrawn. Vacillation on 
the issue of what sort of state it should be -- nuclear or 
non-nuclear -- has largely been eliminated by Russia's pledge to 
maintain its nuclear umbrella over Kazakhstan, as well as by 
strong pressure from the United States and other Western states. 
It appears that Kazakhstan has been able to reap the maximum 
dividends from this situation by ensuring its nuclear defense 
primarily at Russia's expense. In negotiations over elimination 
of nuclear arsenals Kazakhstan will most likely resist complete 
withdrawal of nuclear weapons from its territory and insist that 
Russia continue to bear the burden of the military obligations 
involved in ensuring its security. 
  Washington's approach to relations with the other former 
republics of the USSR is based on the existing nuclear 
non-proliferation system. The United States, the European states 
and Japan regularly let it be known that those CIS members 
cannot expect to develop economic relations with them if they do 
not sign the treaty and do not abide by disarmament agreements. 
On the horizon looms the threat of a "brain drain" and 
uncontrolled trade in nuclear materials and technologies with 
Third World countries wanting to build a nuclear weapon. 
  By assuming the role of "honest broker" in the dispute 
between Russia and the former republics, Washington has run into 
new problems. On the one hand, everything possible must be done 
to put an end to countries' use of nuclear weapons as a "trump 
card" in negotiations without inciting their political ambitions 
as de facto nuclear states. On the other hand, it is 
also essential that Russia be restrained from using force to 
resolve nuclear non-proliferation issues. 
  The agreement between Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and 
Belarus 
concerning joint control of strategic systems deployed in those 
republics' territory was received without any particular anxiety 
in view of the fact that it meant a reduced likelihood that any 
one republic might decide to use those weapons on its own; the 
republics were granted a veto right, not the right to use the 
systems. The "two-key" system used with American nuclear weapons 
deployed with the United States' NATO allies in Western Europe 
functioned quite satisfactorily during the Cold War and there 
was never any danger that the allies might use a nuclear weapon 
without American consent. CIS countries' participation in 
Russian-American talks on reduction of strategic arms systems 
could be fraught with additional difficulties, but only if they 
began resisting the complete withdrawal of those systems from 
their territory. In view of the fact that Ukraine and Belarus 
have proclaimed their intention of becoming nuclear-free states, 
that course of behavior would at first glance seem unlikely. It 
is more likely that the republics would be something of allies 
for the United States in its negotiations with Russia, whose 
representatives are increasingly inclined to be guided in their 
approach by old ideas (parity or equal security, strategic 
stability, etc.), failing to realize that the republics never 
shared such concepts and strove to get out from under nuclear 
tutelage. 
  However, the United States realizes the danger involved in 
playing off disputes between the republics, and is extremely 
interested in ensuring that political differences do not disrupt 
the delicate process of integrating the newly independent states 
into the world nuclear non-proliferation system. This is due to 
the need to set aside nuclear non-proliferation issues as a 
separate, independent area of relations with the CIS members. As 
indicated by the SALT II Treaty, the optimum alternative is for 
strategic weapons to be next after withdrawal of tactical 
weapons from the republics' territory, coupled with the weapons' 
subsequent destruction within the framework of agreements with 
Russia. 
  The Clinton administration has shown particular concern over 
Ukraine's position, which is to delay the process of joining the 
non-proliferation treaty as a non-nuclear state. Kiev's demands 
for security guarantees and financial compensation for getting 
rid of its nuclear weapons are perceived in Washington as an 
excuse to retain those weapons. All these things dictate a 
stricter approach to Ukraine on nuclear issues. The Clinton 
administration has let it be clearly known that the main 
condition for economic aid to Kiev is its participation in the 
Nuclear Weapons Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
  However, something else is obvious as well: political 
pressure by Russia on the issue of nuclear relations with 
Ukraine could produce diametrically opposed results. In this 
context Washington's intermediary role is all the more 
well-defined. The United States, the European countries and 
Japan will bear most of the responsibility for integrating 
Ukraine into the worldwide non-proliferation system. For its 
part, Russia could make the process easier by officially 
declaring that it does not intend to maintain its nuclear status 
and that it is willing, together with the other nuclear states, 
to see disarmament through to the end. 
  Interaction between the United States and Russia as the two 
leading nuclear powers remains the foundation of the global 
nuclear non-proliferation regime. Its effectiveness will largely 
depend on how quickly and radically the United States and Russia 
restructure their military and political relations and assign 
absolute foreign policy priority to the task of preventing the 
further proliferation of nuclear weapons. The United States and 
Russia are the ones to begin the process of creating a system of 
international security under which possession of nuclear weapons 
by any state would be considered illegal under international law 
and would be regarded as a threat to peace. Only such actions as 
that can provide a fitting response to the challenge presented 
by nuclear proliferation to the national security interests of 
the United States and Russia following the end of the Cold War.

<F P=106> [Report by Muwaffaq al-Madani from Beirut: "U.S. </F>
Specialists Arrive in Beirut for Investigation; Lebanese and 
Palestinians Smuggle Most Dangerous Explosive Material in the 
World to Lebanon"] 
  [Excerpt] Information has recently leaked from Beirut to 
the effect that some specialized Lebanese elements have produced 
gold, having acquired the red mercury substance that goes into 
the production of gold when it is mixed with copper. 
  Available information indicates that Lebanese, Palestinians, 
and four other people in one of the largest southern cities in 
Lebanon, who graduated from Russian universities, have managed 
to transport the red mercury substance and sell it in Lebanon. 
This substance is one of the most dangerous kinds used in the 
production of nuclear bombs. Western scientists say only Russia 
has this substance and knows how to manufacture it in various 
sizes. Its size could equal that of a hand grenade or a little 
smaller. 
  U.S. security men, internationally specialized in tracking 
down this substance, have arrived in Lebanon to keep under close 
surveillance several members of the group that smuggled the 
substance. A quantity of three kg of red mercury has been 
seized. 
  As a result of expanding trade, a senior Russian Army 
officer 
has offered to market three kg of red mercury for $30,000. 
  Thus, this substance was exported to one of the ports of the 
large southern Lebanese cities as part of trade commodities in a 
truck. 
  Information indicates there have been many attempts to 
market 
and sell this substance on the Lebanese market, and even in the 
Middle East. However, the dearth of information about this 
substance and the lack of ideas about its importance and how to 
use it prevented its marketing and trading. Search is now under 
way in more than one Arab and foreign capital, as reported by 
Russian security agencies, especially a high-level official who 
arrived in the Middle East and revealed the smuggling of the red 
mercury from Russia to Lebanon. The search is aimed at finding 
out whether this quantity is the only amount that leaked from 
Russia through this officer to Lebanese and Palestinian people 
and whether there are other people in other countries who have 
acquired this substance and what happened to the substance. The 
nature and shape of the substance do not particularly attract 
the attention of scientists and laboratory owners, since it is a 
white substance that looks like fine sugar and its importance 
and effectiveness have so far not been publicized. [passage

  [Text] A North Korean military team left Iran a few days 
ago. The team, led by the Air Force commander and made up of 28 
military and nuclear experts, arrived in Tehran in the second 
week of last month. The team's mission was to put the final 
touches to the Nodong-2 missile, which the Koreans are 
developing for Tehran. This is a developed Scud version with a 
range of 900 km. U.S. information revealed that Tehran was 
planning to field test this missile, but decided to postpone 
that to some other time in order to avoid a confrontation with 
Washington, which has for months now been intensifying its spy 
satellite surveillance of the Iranian territories. This is the 
second postponement after last September's for the same reasons. 
However, the North Korean team returned with new agreements 
with Tehran to intensify bilateral military and nuclear 
cooperation. The U.S. intelligence estimates say that more than 
800 North Korean military experts and officers are in Iran. 
Meanwhile, more than 53 Iranian military men are working at the 
Iranian military attache's section in Pyongyang.

  [Text] In an interview with a NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporter 
on 13 April, Yelmakov, chief of the Reactor Bureau of Russia's 
Atomic Energy Ministry, who was attending the annual conference 
on atomic power in Hiroshima City, made it clear that Russia 
will seek Japan's cooperation in developing a new-type reactor 
to burn plutonium extracted from the dismantling of nuclear 
weapons. According to the Russian official, Russia will formally 
ask Japan in the near future to cooperate with it in developing 
the new-type reactor in accordance with the Japan-Russia Atomic 
Power Agreement. 
  The new-type reactor, for the development of which Russia 
plans to seek Japan's cooperation, is a fast breeder reactor 
(BN-800) capable of generating 800,000 kw. At present, the 
building of the new-type reactor remains suspended. Russia plans 
to replace the current reactor core capable of breeding fuel 
with a new reactor core capable of burning plutonium extracted 
from the dismantling of nuclear weapons and ultra uranium 
element to process them into fuel. 
  In the interview, Yelmakov also said that Russia intends to 
promote the development of the new-type reactor as "an 
international project like the International Thermonuclear 
Fusion Research Project."

  [Text] Brussels, 13 Apr 94 (AGENCE EUROPE) - The Council of 
the European Union gave the following response to written 
question No. E-3697/93 by Mr. A. Smith: "The Council does not

shares the concerns of the honourable member of the European 
Parliament regarding the consequences of fraudulent traffic into 
the European Union of nuclear and/or radioactive material from 
the Central and Eastern European countries and the former Soviet 
Union. In this context, the Commission is currently preparing a 
communication to the Council which should make it possible to 
get a better idea of the scope of this problem as well as action 
which could be taken at Community level in terms of information.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Eastern Europe -- Parliament </F>
Approves EU Contribution to EBRD's "Nuclear Safety" Account"; as 
released by Brussels Textline database] 
  [Text] Reinforcing nuclear safety in the countries of 
Eastern Europe is a matter of great importance to the European 
Parliament, which has followed its rapporteur Mr. Adam (Soc, UK) 
and approved the Council's proposal of contributing 20 million 
Ecus to the "nuclear safety" account set up with the European 
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). In his report, 
Mr. Adam states that the first operations done in this area by 
the EBRD in Bulgaria and Lithuania seem to meet EP criteria. 
The next operations in Russia are a test of the EBRD's strategy 
and are therefore to be closely monitored by the Community 
institutions. The sums in question were included in the 1993 
budget but were not committed because there was no legal base. 
They are included in the 1994 budget as a token entry, and if 
the 1993 appropriations are to be used this year, a decision 
will have to be made before the end of March. 
  The EP wants the operations in question to be included in a 
strategic and safety action plan negotiated with the beneficiary 
countries (which should respect the main international 
agreements of security) and the interested countries to be 
endowed with an independent body responsible for safety. It 
also called for the early closure of the plants the least safe. 
During the debate, Mr. Bettini (Greens, It) criticized the 
report, calling for large-scale reconversion to "clean" energy, 
as Mr. Shevardnadze himself had proposed for all of Georgia's 
energy.

Its Research Reactor''] 
  [Text] The Plzen Skoda factory is liquidating its SR 
research reactor in Vochov near Plzen, including spent fuel and 
unused fuel. The reactor is of their own construction and 
manufacture and was used from 1970 until 1989. This information 
was provided to RUDE PRAVO by Engineer Frantisek Svitak, deputy 
director of the Skoda Nuclear Engineering Plant in Plzen. The 
Skoda plant does not need the reactor any more. It was used to 
test various measuring methods and devices, to train reactor 
operators, to train students from the West Bohemian University, 
and to conduct radiation testing for the republican Civil 
Defense organization. 
  Despite the fact that the reactor is not contaminated (it 
was 
reconstructed in 1986, and was not put into operation after that 
date), all legal standards must be met during the liquidation of 
the workplace in Vochov. Regulations regarding the handling of 
fuel are equally strict. The State Office for Nuclear Safety in 
Prague and the International Agency for Atomic Energy in Vienna 
supervise fuel handling. Moreover, any fuel handling must not 
contravene the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear 
Materials. 
  Currently, they have about 10 kilograms of uranium 235 in 
sandwich-type metallic fuel at the Skoda plant. The Slovak 
Technical university has shown interest in the reactor and fuel. 
Because of the lack of funds on the part of the customer, 
however, the negotiations failed. Prospective buyers in Germany 
have also shown interest, but did not meet requirements. The 
Nuclear Research Institute in Rez near Prague is currently 
interested in the reactor. According to Engineer Svitak, The 
Skoda plant is conducting the most promising negotiations with 
two French firms that would like to buy the research reactor and 
the fuel.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Alexandr Vondra by </F>
Stanislav Cervinka; place and date not given: ``The Czech 
Republic Will Not Export Arms Into Countries Embargoed by the 
UN''] 
  [Text] After his return from his 12-day visit to Syria, 
Pakistan, and Iraq, Deputy Foreign Minister Alexandr Vondra 
pointed to the key influence of these countries. In this 
connection we asked him: 
  Cervinka: You stressed that the Czech Republic 
does not export arms to Iran. Does this also apply to Syria and 
Pakistan? 
  Vondra: The Czech Republic has not exported any 
large volumes of military technology to these countries 
recently. Spare parts for the previously delivered technology 
is an exception. In the future, similar deals will be regulated 
by applicable laws. Each and every deal will be judged 
separately on the basis of this law. This law does not include 
a list of off-limits countries. In no case will the Czech 
Republic export arms to countries on which the UN has imposed an 
embargo. In the case of other countries, the foreign policy 
aspects of each and every deal will be considered. 
  Cervinka: How do you view developments regarding 
the Czech Republic's claims in the Middle East? 
  Vondra: It is extremely difficult to assess such a 
situation. The Czech Republic, as one of the successor states 
after Czechoslovakia, inherited claims that had been established 
in past decades due to the fact that Czechoslovakia, as a Warsaw 
Pact member, supplied many developing countries with various 
goods. Economic considerations, essential in foreign trade, were 
either secondary or totally unimportant in such cases. Many 
Third World countries still do not perceive past deals as normal 
business, but as assistance provided to them by the then Soviet 
bloc to maintain balance in the world, or develop their economy. 
This does not mean, however, that the Czech Republic will waive 
its claims. If we are to retain our chance of getting paid for 
our claims in the future, we have to search for ways that will 
encourage future cooperation that will be acceptable to both 
sides. I am convinced that this is the situation in those 
Middle East countries on which the UN embargo has not been 
imposed. This cooperation, however, will not continue in the 
spirit of the strategic intentions of the former Soviet bloc.

  [Text] Rio -- Edgar Kircher, the Furnas Electric Power 
Plants, Inc. [Furnas] adviser for environmental security, has 
reported that Angra-1 will probably be dismantled in about 15 
years, or in other words around the year 2009. 
  Furnas failed to earn a profit of nearly $100 million (97.7 
billion real cruzeiros) as a result of the fact that Angra-1 
nuclear plant has been closed for more than a year without 
producing any electrical energy. This energy should have been 
connected to the electricity system serving the southeastern 
region of the country. Angra-1 can produce energy equivalent to 
20 percent of the electricity consumed in the city of Rio de 
Janeiro. Furnas experts said that ``this loss is not really a 
loss, but a profit the company failed to make.'' 
  Angra-1 construction costs totalled about $2 billion, but 
through having been disconnected over 30 times due to faulty 
parts and equipment and to comply with court orders, the plant 
has already forced the government to spend much more than that. 
Concrete figures, however, have never been reported. Kleber 
Cosenza, head of the Furnas Power Generation Department, 
reported that Angra-1 fuel -- enriched uranium purchased from 
Urenco (a consortium from Germany, England, and the Netherlands) 
-- alone cost Furnas $20 million last year. Another $5 million 
were spent in repairing the plant. 
  Consenza added that Angra-1 is undergoing final tests for 
being put into operation again in 20 days. According to him, 
the plant is theoretically ready to be put into operation. To 
do so, however, Furnas needs the authorization of the National 
Nuclear Energy Commission and the conclusion of the emergency 
plan to evacuate Angra dos Reis residents in case of an 
accident. The evacuation plan is about to be finished, and has 
undergone a series of modifications, Consenza said. 
  Luiz Henrique Goncalves de Moraes, assistant at the Furnas 
Thermonuclear Generation Superintendency, said that this plan 
has to be reviewed so that Angra-1 can again operate. According 
to him, the new plan meets the requirements of the international 
concept establishing that in case of an accident, residents 
living in a 3 km radius around the plant must be evacuated. 
  He reported that the latest data reported by the Brazilian 
Institute for Geography and Statistics, IBGE, indicate that 
nearly 9,000 people live in this area. In accordance with the 
new plan, monitorial teams will determine small areas at a 
radius of 5 km to 15 km around the plant to be isolated. He 
said that in accordance with IBGE data nearly 70,000 people 
currently live in this wider area. 
  On the night of 5 April, Furnas experts visited Angra-1 
facilities during a visit made to the plant by a group of Sao 
Paulo environmental experts.

  [Text] Rio de Janeiro -- The National Nuclear Energy 
Commission (CNEN) has asked the United Nations for $500,000 
(492.8 million cruzeiros) to construct a subterranean silo to 
store the atomic waste produced by Angra-1 for the next 15 
years, until the plant is dismantled. 
  This was confirmed on 7 April by Ayrton Cauby, the CNEN's 
Licensing and Control superintendent. He indicated that the 
United Nations has specific resources to help developing 
countries like Brazil to resolve their atomic waste problems. 
  When dismantled, the plant itself will be stored in the 
silo. 
The atomic waste produced in the Rio de Janeiro-Sao Paulo axis 
will also be stored there. The Angra-1 reactor will remain in 
the Angra nuclear complex, wrapped in special layers of 
concrete. Cauby reported that experts of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) -- based in Vienna, Austria -- will 
visit Brazil in May to help choose the site for the silo. 
  He said the CNEN also asked the IAEA for financial help. It 
released $100,000 (98.5 million cruzeiros) for the initial work 
that will be carried out in 1994 and 1995. 
  Cauby said the CNEN's top priority is to develop the 
subterranean silo, which will not be constructed in Angra dos 
Reis (RJ) [Rio de Janeiro State]. He said: ``IAEA experts and 
technicians will choose the site for the silo to store the waste 
produced in Sao Paulo.''

    [Editorial Report] 
<H5>  Russian Envoy on Trade Obstacles, Space Projects </H5>
  Russian Ambassador to Brazil Iosif N. Podrazhanets, who 
recently assumed the post, believes that it will be very 
difficult to raise the level of commercial trade between the two 
countries, currently ranging between $300 million and $400 
million, the Sao Paulo daily GAZETA MERCANTIL reported in its 31 
March-4 April issue. The reasons were cited as threefold: 
political instability in Russia, which keeps Brazilian investors 
away; shipping costs, which are higher than in the trade between 
Brazil and the United States; and a deficiency in providing 
sufficient stimulus to the space sector. Russia, GAZETA 
continued, is determined to cooperate with Brazil in creating an 
infrastructure by supplying technology and equipment for the 
satellite launch vehicle project. Russia also wants to 
participate in the Amazon protection and surveillance project, 
but it lacks the resources to finance equipment sales. 
  The protocol of intent, signed between Brazil and Russia in 
December 1993 and intended to increase bilateral trade to $2 
billion annually, has not yet ``gotten off the ground,'' 
according to Ambassador Podrazhanets, due to difficulties in 
finding the mechanisms necessary to implement the project, 
particularly resources. ``It's difficult to find the right 
products for that type of trade,'' he said. 
  In May or June, Podrazhanets continued, the Russian minister 
of atomic energy will visit Brazil, and in the ensuing months, a 
joint economic and commercial commission meeting will be held, 
during which Russia will discuss its interest in increasing 
cooperation in the areas of space, energy, and mining. 
<H5>  Cuba Signs S&amp;T Accords With State Governments </H5>
  An article in the Sao Paulo daily O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO of 
22 
March announced that the Cuban and Sao Paulo State Governments 
will begin an S&amp;T exchange program in April that will bring a 
number of Cuban specialists to Sao Paulo state universities. In 
the article, Secretary Roberto Muller of the Secretariat of 
Science, Technology, and Economic Development remarked: ``We are 
particularly interested in the transfer of Cuban technology for 
the development of research in DNA and genetic engineering for 
plants.'' The exchange program is a result of discussions held 
on 18 March between visiting Cuban Minister of Higher Education 
Fernando Vecino Alegret and Secretary Muller, University of 
Campinas (Unicamp) Rector Carlos Vogt, and Sao Paulo State 
University (Unesp) Rector Arthur Roquete de Macedo. Secretary 
Muller further commented that the Sao Paulo state government is 
also interested in the use of sugarcane waste to generate 
thermal energy, as well as the mastery of techniques to increase 
the shelf life of cement. The agreement signed with Cuba was 
modeled along the lines of the accord signed with the Russian 
Government, O ESTADO continued. According to Muller, the 
secretariat is already studying the possibility of bringing in 
additional researchers, and will shortly be meeting with 
university rectors to review the situation. 
<H5>  Consortiums Plan Telecommunications Satellites Launch </H5>
  Sao Paulo daily FOLHA DE SAO PAULO reported on 25 March that 
Brazilian Discount Bank (Bradesco), Odebrecht construction firm, 
Monteiro Aranha, Victori Internacional, and Globopar, owned by 
businessman Roberto Marinho, formed an association with the 
French Matra Marconi Space firm, and established an enterprise 
called Latin American Satellite Systems Communications (CLASS) 
for the purpose of launching three privately owned satellites to 
serve Brazil and neighboring Southern Cone countries. A second 
consortium, formed by the Itamaraty Group owned by businessman 
Olacyr de Morais, Splice do Brasil, and the German firm Deutsche 
Aerospace will compete for the same market acting as an 
associate and commercial representative of the Argentine Nahuel 
satellite. 
  The two consortiums, according to FOLHA, want to compete 
with 
the Brazilian Telecommunications Company (Embratel) in data 
transmission and offer options for new services, particularly in 
the area of cable television. Both the Nahuel satellite and the 
three satellites of the CLASS project will operate on the KU 
band, which is higher than the frequencies of Brasilsat's C 
band, and will allow TV signals to be picked up by 6O-cm 
parabolic antennas that can even be installed on apartment 
verandas. 
  The CLASS project, which will involve investments of $300 
million, was announced on 24 March during the Fourth 
International Telecommunications and Teleinformatics Congress 
(Telexpo) in Sao Paulo. Victori International Vice President 
Joao Santelli Junior told FOLHA that the project is only now 
being made public but has been in planning since 1992. In 
November 1993, the consortium asked the Ministry of 
Communications for three orbital positions. On 22 December, 
former Telecommunications Minister Hugo Napoleao petitioned the 
UN International Telecommunications Union (UIT) to authorize the 
orbital space positions, but the UIT has not yet published its 
decision. If the request is granted, the CLASS project and the 
Nahuel consortium will still need authorization from the 
Ministry of Communications. 
  According to Olacyr de Morais of the Itamaraty Group, the 
telecommunications market has great potential and several 
competitors are vying for it. FOLHA reported that that 
consortium has more ambitious plans than simply shareholder 
participation in the Argentine Nahuel satellite and intends to 
launch its own satellite. 
  Brazilian Communications Minister Djalma Morais remarked 
that 
Embratel and the state telephone companies are interested in 
participating as shareholders in the CLASS project; there may be 
criticisms from within Embratel ranks, however, of any attempt 
to launch private satellites. Some Embratel representatives 
believe that the operation of satellites is part of the state 
telecommunications monopoly. Communications Minister Morais, 
however, is of the opinion that the satellites will only provide 
limited services and therefore will not effect the state's 
monopoly. 
  Victori International Vice President Joao Santelli Junior 
also told FOLHA that the CLASS project intends to launch the 
first satellite in 1996 and the second in 1997. He said that the 
KU band satellites will also make it possible to install 
telephone terminals at an average cost of $3,000 each in remote 
areas. The current installation cost in remote areas of Brazil 
is as much as $100,000 per terminal. 
  CNEN, SCIENTISTS FAVOR QUADRIPARTITE SAFEGUARDS 
ACCORD--Prior 
to the 9 February Brazilian Senate's approval of the 
quadripartite nuclear safeguards agreement (QSA) between Brazil, 
Argentina, the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and 
Control of Nuclear Materials (ABACC), and the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), National Nuclear Energy Commission 
(CNEN), President Marcio Costa and various scientists commented 
favorably on the agreement's impending Senate ratification in 
Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO of 8 February. O ESTADO began by 
quoting a press statement made in Rio on 7 February by CNEN 
President Marcio Costa supporting the Senate's ratification of 
the QSA which will authorize international inspections of 
Brazilian nuclear installations. Although he opined that Brazil 
will lose sovereignty in the nuclear area, the CNEN head said 
that he was in favor of its ratification in order to avoid 
retaliations by First World countries. Costa criticized Germany, 
which had earlier threatened to break the 1975 Brazil-FRG 
nuclear accord, suspend the transfer of technology, and withdraw 
support for Brazil obtaining a permanent seat in the UN Security 
Council. ``They pulled off the worst swindle in the country with 
that technology transfer story.'' 
  O ESTADO then went on to quote Ennio Candotti, former 
president and member of the council of the Brazilian Society for 
the Progress of Science (SBPC), as saying that Brazil should 
ratify the quadripartite accord and the Treaty of Tlatelolco. 
``But it is important,'' he added, ``to extend those agreements 
to the countries that today hold arsenals of nuclear arms such 
as the United States, France, Britain, and Germany itself.'' 
Candotti then commented on Germany's threats: ``I didn't even 
know that a nuclear accord with Germany was still in effect, so 
numerous have been the mistakes earmarking the 1975 treaty that 
provided for the construction of eight power plants.'' 
Furthermore, he added, ``a seat on the UN Security Council is 
not acquired through bartering agreements and disagreements.'' 
  Professor Giorgio Moscati, head of the Physics Institute's 
Experimental Physics Department of the University of Sao Paulo 
(USP), believes that Brazil should ratify the accords, O ESTADO 
continued. ``There is no reason for the country not to open up 
for a peaceful program and open itself up to international 
inspections,'' he remarked. Then Brazil will, in return, be able 
to demand that it cease being discriminated against in imports 
of products that may have a military application, he added. O 
ESTADO then noted that Professor Ivan Cunha Nascimento, head of 
the USP Applied Physics Department, is of the same opinion. 
``The accord should be ratified, simply because Brazil is 
discriminated against internationally and consequently does not 
have access to state of the art technology that may have a 
military application.'' He further explained that ``Brazil is 
considered a `sensitive' country abroad for having a nuclear 
program that is neither known nor inspected.''

  [Text] The agreement between the Energy Secretariat, headed 
by Carlos Bastos, and the National Commission for Atomic Energy 
[CNEA], headed by Manuel Mondino, materialized in a sort of 
legal document establishing the steps to be taken for the 
transformation of nuclear activities, particularly those having 
to do with the generation of electricity. The following is the 
text of this document, which constitutes an inarguable victory 
for the privatization drive pursued by the Economy Ministry: 
  ``The CNEA needs streamlining and reorganizing to adapt to 
the (electricity) market. This demands splitting two large 
areas of activity -- namely the control and licensing of nuclear 
power plants, and production, research, and development 
activities -- into different organizations.'' 
  ``For the former it would be possible to establish a unit 
that would come under the jurisdiction of the federal 
government, with resources from the National Treasury plus the 
fees or royalties that this unit would charge to companies 
subject to control.'' 
  ``The other activities would be entrusted to one or more 
joint stock companies subject to commercial laws. In other 
words, they would act as individuals under private law, and 
would therefore be affected by the bankruptcy act.'' 
  ``Initially, all the shares of these companies will belong 
to 
the state.'' 
  ``The preceding paragraph means that the state will not 
contribute -- through the Treasury -- funds to finance any 
expenditures to be incurred by these companies.'' 
  ``The Treasury will contribute the necessary funds to 
conclude the construction of the Atucha-2 power plant, according 
to a budget that will be put together in the future.'' 
  ``The shares, which will initially be controlled by the 
state, will be sold to private investors on the stock exchange 
at a later stage (same procedure as YPF [Government Oil 
Deposits]).'' 
  ``The expansion of the nuclear sector will be accomplished 
through private investments in new power plants.'' 
  ``Once the unit responsible for the control of nuclear power 
plants is operational, current and future power plants will be 
subject to the same control provisions.''

<F P=106> [Interview with Energy Secretary Carlos Bastos by </F>
unidentified reporter; place and date not given] 
  [Text] 
  CLARIN: Will the CNEA [National Commission for 
Atomic Energy] be privatized? 
  Bastos: Let us begin with something more basic. 
Let us discuss the prospects for nuclear energy. When organizing 
the field, the state reserved for itself the role of supervising 
private activities and determining policies. For most countries 
where this activity is being developed with the private sector, 
nuclear energy is considered one of the future options to 
satisfy energy demand. In Argentina we developed our own nuclear 
industry, with our own technicians, heavy water fuel, and 
companies. It would be a grave mistake to waste all this wealth. 
The Energy Secretariat, as the agency responsible for 
determining policies, is deeply interested in seeing nuclear 
energy as one of the future energy options in Argentina. 
  CLARIN: There is a study conducted by the 
Mediterranean Foundation headed by Juan Novara saying that the 
CNEA is not competitive and that nuclear energy is expensive, 
dirty, and is being abandoned throughout the world. Is this not 
contrary to what you just said? 
  Bastos: Fortunately, we have had differences of 
opinion at the Mediterranean Foundation and each one can freely 
voice one's opinion. Yes, it is a little bit contradictory. I 
do not fully share Novara's views. 
  CLARIN: But the International Atomic Energy Agency 
contends that 100 nuclear power plants are under construction at 
present. 
  Bastos: I am not an expert in that field, but to 
talk about 100 nuclear power plants is a bit too much. I do not 
believe that such a number of power plants is under construction 
... 
  CLARIN: The report specifically states that there 
are 72 power stations under construction and another 54, the 
construction of which already has been approved ... 
  Bastos: I could not give you precise data. What I 
do know, however, is that all industrial countries are trying to 
devise ways to lower the cost of future nuclear projects by 
trying to build a series of nuclear power plants having a 
standard design and improving security. In this regard, I 
disagree with Novara's assertion that atomic energy is 
expensive. Well, it is indeed expensive now because a barrel of 
oil costs $14. If the price rises to $20, things would change 
completely. 
  CLARIN: And how will nuclear activities move ahead? 
  Bastos: That is the key issue. The industry's 
organization is based on the participation of the private sector 
in risk ventures. It does not pertain to the state engaging in 
risk undertakings. The state is interested in developing 
nuclear activities but without participating as an entrepreneur. 
The CNEA cannot continue functioning as it is now; it must be 
restructured. At present it combines control with business 
activities and receives money from the Treasury for investments. 
It has been decided that the CNEA will be restructured so as to 
separate regulatory from business activities. This will have 
been concluded by December. 
  CLARIN: Will they be privatized then? 
  Bastos: That is totally reasonable. With our way 
of [answer incomplete as published] 
  CLARIN: Incorporating private capital or selling 
the shares of the private stock company? 
  Bastos: In the privatization of companies in the 
field, like Segba [Greater Buenos Aires Electrical Services] for 
example, we made what is known as a strategic sale of shares. 
We sold a percentage of the shares and the companies' control 
was transferred to the buyers of those shares. We took that 
line of action because it was impossible to reorganize those 
public companies within the framework of the state. Is the CNEA 
now in a similar situation to that of Segba? The answer is no 
because nuclear power plants are in an excellent situation. 
They have plenty of financial resources at their disposal, 
which shows that there are top-quality operation and maintenance 
groups. So what do we stand to gain by transferring the 
management of these nuclear power plants? Very little. Our 
first attempt to transfer the CNEA to the private sector will be 
made along the same lines as YPF [Government Oil Deposits]. 
  CLARIN: How much do you estimate CNEA Inc. would 
be worth? 
  Bastos: The CNEA has a positive flow of funds 
amounting to slightly over $200 million annually. 
  CLARIN: Once Atucha-II is operational its value 
will increase considerably. 
  Bastos: That is precisely the point. It is very 
difficult to make an estimate because it depends on the 
investments that will be made to complete Atucha-II. 
Nevertheless, let us suppose that of the $200 million, the net 
cash flow totals $90 million. With a rate of return for seven 
years, it would add up to $600 million, which in turn is what we 
estimated is missing to complete Atucha-II. 
  CLARIN: That is a very low estimate. The CNEA 
contributed $8.5 billion compared with the $600 million that 
could be obtained from the selling of all the shares. 
  Bastos: We go back to the starting point, when we 
said atomic energy is expensive. I said it was because a barrel 
of crude today costs $14 and these estimates are based on this 
oil price. If the prices climbs to $20 or $30, things will 
change. Even so I would not venture to say that it is a total 
loss. 
  CLARIN: But $600 million compared with $8.5 
billion ... 
  Bastos: Yes, it is true. We are not taking into 
account how much the Atucha-I and Embalse Rio Tercero power 
plants produced, whether a very low price was paid, and whether 
the benefits were transferred to consumers. State Water and 
Power Enterprise and Segba had debts to the CNEA that were not 
totally repaid ... 
  CLARIN: The CNEA argues that they owe it $500 
million ... 
  Bastos: In all likelihood the federal government 
was the one that remained as a debtor, but at the same time the 
CNEA also granted some type of credit to the government [as 
published]. Therefore, the best thing to do is start everything 
fresh. 
  CLARIN: I insist, do you not think that $600 
million is a very low price for two nuclear power plants that 
are already operational, Atucha-II -- 70 percent of which is 
already completed, and other industrial plants? 
  Bastos: I do not think so. It depends on many 
things. We will never have a 100 percent return on investment 
for Atucha-II because it is a capital-intensive sector. When 
there are construction delays, the costs are terrible and one 
has to forego obtaining a 100 percent return on investment. Is 
the CNEA to blame for the cost of Atucha-II? It is not entirely 
to blame for it. The power plant's construction involves the 
handling of 40 or more contracts. During the times of 
hyperinflation, most of them were paralyzed. 
  CLARIN: Do you approve of Manuel Mondino as a 
likely executive manager of CNEA Inc.? 
  Bastos: I am going to give you the opinion of a 
teammate. From the technical standpoint, I think that all the 
CNEA staff is excellent. The only criticism I might have is 
that they need more knowledge about business administration, but 
they can be quickly trained in this field.

<F P=106> [Editorial: ``U.S. and Indian Concerns''] </F>
  [Text] To articulate the outcome of U.S.-India talks held 
by Mr. Talbott in New Delhi, India used not Dinesh Singh, its 
Foreign Minister, but its Minister of State, Salman Khursheed. 
Not because Dinesh Singh is less competent but that is India's 
way to telling the world that despite the massacre of Muslims in 
Kashmir and elsewhere in India (the latest was Bombay), it has 
no animus against the Muslim. For one thing, having a few 
Muslim quislings on its side keeps the facade of Indian 
secularism alive and for another, people like Khursheed and 
Farooq Abdullah can always be relied upon to be more loyal than 
the king. After having shot down every proposal that Mr. 
Talbott made for peace in the Subcontinent, the Indians it seems 
used the opportunity to convey to the U.S. their desire to be 
recognised as a mini-superpower with all its concomitants -- 
nuclear weapons, large army, etc. That Mr. Talbott was 
predisposed to buy that can be gleaned by some of the 
observations he made. Referring to India's ``strong democratic 
tradition, its size, its growing economic strength,'' he said 
that it ``is a leader well beyond the confines of this region.'' 
Let us compare that with what Mr. Khursheed said. He said that 
a fresh ``geographic definition of the region,'' was called for 
because India's ``concerns go beyond Pakistan.'' Having 
accepted that premise, Mr. Talbott went on to place India at par 
with Germany and Japan in their claims for a permanent seat in 
the UN Security Council [SC]. Yet neither Germany nor Japan is, 
as of now, in occupation of a disputed territory, nor has either 
been accused of massive human rights abuses, nor has either 
waged a war against a weaker neighbour. Both are in favour of 
nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament. India's claim to 
eminence rests on its refusal to accept UN Resolutions or any 
mediation in its disputes with neighbours, has a well-documented 
record of human rights violations and is opposed to disarmament 
and NPT. And yet such is the allure that its potential market 
has for the United States that the United States arm-twist 
Pakistan to give up its major security concerns because these 
could come in the way of India's march to a mini-superpower 
status. So far as a permanent SC seat to anyone other than the 
big five is concerned, the claim of the Muslim bloc of over 50 
countries is as good as anyone else's. 
  The American case, it seems, is that Pakistan should give up 
its nuclear plans while the Indians retain their, Pakistan 
should not get the warplanes it has already paid for, or the 
missiles to counter the Indian stockpile, because it would 
slightly reduce the advantage that India has against everyone in 
the region and to regain that advantage India will have to 
divert its precious economic resources. Mr. Talbott presumably 
did not get the opportunity to ask Mr. Khursheed how much of its 
precious resources it is already diverting in order to keep an 
overwhelming advantage against its much smaller and weaker 
neighbours. The highly persuasive point that Mr. Khursheed 
makes is: ``Sophisticated weapons acquired by Pakistan have been 
used only against India.'' True, but where has India used its 
highly sophisticated weapons, of which it has far more? Logic, 
unfortunately, is not India's strongest forte, where its 
hegemonic ambitions are concerned. The United States too has, 
it seems, to address concerns of realpolitik and not political 
morality.

  [Text] Tehran, April 19, IRNA -- Iran's proposal to declare 
the Middle East a nuclear free zone requires participation and 
cooperation of all the regional countries, head of the Atomic 
Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) Reza Amrollahi said here 
Tuesday. 
  Interviwed by IRNA, Amrollahi elaborated on Iran's proposal 
to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  Amrollahi said that regarding atomic threat of the zionist 
regime and its nonpeaceful utilization of nuclear technology as 
well as its noncompliance with the international regulations 
Iran, has offered the proposal to declare the Middle East region 
a nuclear free zone. 
  He added that the proposal was on the agenda in the annual 
conference of the IAEA. 
  Amrollhai stressed that the Zionist regime has not only 
refused to accept Iran's proposal but also has rejected 
admission to the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty (NPT) [as 
received]. 
  He stated that the IAEA's director general welcomed the 
proposal during his meeting with Amrollahi here Monday.

<F P=106> [``Exclusive interview'' with Hans Blix, director of the </F>
International Atomic Energy Agency, by unidentified 
correspondent, at Teheran's' Mehrabad airport on 20 April -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] 
  Correspondent: Mr. Blix, were any major 
achievements accomplished during your talks with the Iranian 
officials? 
  Blix: Well, I came here to discuss first of all 
the arrangements of verification under a nuclear weapon-free 
zone in the Middle East. And of course Iran was one of the 
first countries in the world to endorse this idea and I think we 
have created more understanding for the techniques and the 
system of verification that the agency offers now and the kind 
of enhanced verification system that would be needed under a 
zone. So I think we have accomplished what we hope to do, to 
spread better knowledge. 
  Correspondent: A few countries, and Israel in 
particular, have not yet signed the Nonproliferation Treaty 
[NPT]. Does not this refusal to sign the treaty threaten the 
international and regional peace and stability? 
  Blix: Well, I think the ambition should be that 
all countries which do not have nuclear weapons should join a 
nonproliferation treaty, either the NPT or the Tlatelolco Treaty 
for Latin America. We have seen a great deal of progress in the 
past few years. Argentina and Brazil have joined, South Africa 
has joined the Nonproliferation Treaty, Algeria has declared 
that it will join. 
  Correspondent: And finally could you tell us about 
the IAEA's efforts to make a nuclear-free world, sir? 
  Blix: Well, it would be a little presumptuous to 
say that we are sort of instrumental in creating a nuclear 
weapon-free world, but what I can say is that I think there is 
reason for a great deal of optimism at the present time after 
the end of the Cold War. We have seen how the United States and 
Russia have now agreed to reduce their nuclear arsenals from 
some 65,000 warheads to 3,000 each. We can expect that there 
will be a treaty which will prohibit the production of nuclear 
material for weapons purposes and which very likely will lead to 
all the nuclear weapon states and India, Pakistan and Israel 
submitting all their nuclear installations to agency 
verification. We can expect, perhaps within one year, a 
complete test ban agreement so that new nuclear weapons cannot 
be even tested underground. So there is, and added to that 
then, the possibility of a nuclear weapon-free zone in the 
Middle East. I think that we are taking giant steps towards a 
world, not free from nuclear weapons, but at least much freer 
from it than it is now. And for a world really free of nuclear 
weapons I think we must also foresee a much stronger United 
Nations and a much stronger security organization and that will 
not come about in one year or perhaps even 10 years, but will 
take a longer time. But there is ground for a lot of optimism 
at the present time and of course for us in the IAEA, although 
we are not the negotiating parties, the verification of all 
these agreements will be a very important factor. And I think 
we have acquired a lot of experience in the many years of this 
and we stand ready to take on these jobs. 
  Correspondent: Thanks Dr. Blix for joining the 
IRIB English news.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] Mr. Hans Blix, director general of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, is currently in Tehran on a visit 
for holding talks on cooperation between the agency and Iran's 
Atomic Energy Organization. During his visit to Tehran, Mr. 
Hans Blix and his team--besides inspecting Iran's nuclear 
facilities and holding talks with Dr. Reza Amrollahi, head of 
Iran's Atomic Energy Organization--also met with Iran's first 
vice president and foreign minister. 
  Periodic visits of the IAEA experts to nuclear installations 
of its member states take place on a regular basis. For this 
reason the trip of Mr. Hans Blix to Tehran too has pursued the 
same goal. The visit of the IAEA experts to Iran is also 
significant because it gives an opportunity to Iran's officials 
to express the views and to confer on important regional and 
international issues related to nuclear energy. For this 
standpoint, during the meeting of the IAEA chief with Iran's 
first vice president and foreign minister, the country's views 
on the need for the peaceful use of nuclear energy were 
reiterated. 
  The Iranian officials, meanwhile, have not missed mentioning 
the point that--notwithstanding the false propaganda of the 
West, especially the United States, about Iran's nuclear 
program--it is the Israeli regime's indifference toward 
observing the principle of nuclear nonproliferation that is 
posing a real threat to peace and security in the Middle East. 
At any rate, the Islamic Republic of Iran believes that the 
peaceful use of nuclear energy--which in the modern world has 
various applications in the fields of medicine, industry, and 
research--should be recognized as a natural right of all the 
world countries and that nuclear technology should not be 
allowed to become a political tool for putting pressure against 
any country. 
  Undoubtedly the responsibility that the world bodies, 
especially the IAEA, have in this connection demands that the 
agency should deal with various countries on equal footings 
insofar as nuclear arms control is concerned. This is essential 
because only then one can speak with greater certainty about the 
various countries' cooperation with the IAEA programs and the 
positive reports of the organization experts about countries, 
including Iran--those having continuing cooperation with the 
agency--can be used in the international community in a 
desirable manner.

<F P=106> [Report from the Political Desk] </F>
  [Text] The latest program of the naval forces of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran regarding the manufacture of 
submarines, docks [preceding word in English], the 
reconstruction of vessels, warships and weapons related to 
identifying units below sea level has been announced. 
  Speaking to our correspondent, Captain Mahmud Bidel, the 
head of the research unit and self-sufficiency department of the 
naval forces referred to the exhortations of his eminence, Imam 
Khomeyni (may God be pleased with him) in 1362 [year beginning 
21 March 1983] on the need to attain self-sufficiency in the 
three branches of the armed forces and the Corps, said: 
According to the decree of His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, the 
great leader and the commander in chief of the armed forces, 
which he issued at the end of last year, a research unit was 
added to the self-sufficiency department. He added: The 
objectives of this measure were to strengthen the base of the 
country's defense. The naval forces have carried out effective 
work in the field of electronic warfare and have attained 
remarkable success. 
  The head of the research unit and self-sufficiency 
department 
of the naval forces continued: One of the most important tasks 
of this force in the aftermath of the imposed war has been to 
modernize the radar systems of the naval forces and to 
coordinate them with the latest techniques currently being used 
in the world. 
  Referring to the continued military embargo against Iran by 
world powers, Captain Bidel said: The necessary links have been 
forged with the industrial university and with the country's 
industry for the manufacture of the components needed for the 
various units of the Navy. 
  He said: According to my estimates, we saved 765 million 
rials last year on the purchase of various components for 
military equipment. Fortunately, now that we have forged the 
necessary links with the industrial university and the country's 
industry, there has been a 93-percent saving. 
  He added: Last year, the Navy succeeded in manufacturing one 
of the strategic weapons used in the naval fleet's aviation 
division. He referred to the fact that these weapons will help 
in strengthening the projects above sea level and in underwater 
defense which can assist in search, defense, and reconnaissance 
tactics. He said: These weapons were used in the joint 
Iran-Pakistan maneuvers (IR-PAK 94) and amazed the Pakistani 
naval officials and the international observers. 
  Elaborating on the fact that an underwater reconnaissance 
unit of Iran would be ready by the end of this year, Captain 
Bidel said: Armaments related to the identification of 
underwater units and fleet helicopters will be ready by the end 
of this year. Regarding the Hamzeh warship (formerly known as 
the Shahsavar) which had been completed in Azar [22 November-21 
December] last year, he said: Preliminaries for the manufacture 
of submarines that can be used for deep sea diving fitted with 
heavy-duty equipment have been initiated. 
  He added: The renovation of one hovercraft [preceding word 
in 
English] will be completed by the end of this year and it will 
become operational. Captain Bidel said that an astronomical 
system had been developed by the marine sciences academy in 
Nowshahr in collaboration with the research unit and 
self-sufficiency department of the naval forces and has been put 
into use. He stated that the preliminaries for the utilization 
of this system at the marine sciences academy in Sistan va 
Baluchestan have been completed. 
  He stressed: With the help of this system we can identify 
celestial bodies from inside the submarine. He added that the 
naval forces have attained great success in manufacturing 
underwater communications and said: The research unit and 
self-sufficiency department has set up an inverse engineering 
section, in collaboration with the Sharif industrial university 
and has implemented four projects, including duplication of the 
computers currently being used worldwide. 
  In conclusion, the head of the research unit and the self- 
sufficiency department of the naval forces said that the work 
for the construction of a 150-ton dock has been initiated in 
Bushehr and will become operational on 22 Bahman [11 February] 
this [Iranian] year. He said that this dock would be able to 
accommodate small and large vessels for repairs.

  [Text] United Nations, New York, April 20, IRNA -- Iran's 
deputy foreign minister for international affairs, Mohammad 
Javad Zarif here today called for the establishment of a zone 
free from weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East, 
formation of security and cooperation arrangements in the 
Persian Gulf area, and reduction of military expenditures 
including agreement on a ceiling for international arms purchase 
and transfer to each country in the area. 
  Addressing the United Nations Disarmament Commission, he 
also 
called for the establishment of a forum in which concerns and 
suggestions of Persian Gulf states in the area of security and 
armaments could be aired and debated. 
  He also called for the inclusion of new items on illicit 
arms 
trade on the agenda of the commission. 
  He added, ``This issue, which has very direct and close 
links 
to international drug trafficking as well as terrorism, has had 
serious consequences for the security of a number of states 
across the globe. Like terrorism and drug menace, illicit arms 
trade is an international problem, requiring international 
cooperation, and a common approach. The commission can thus 
play a very constructive role by establishing guidelines and 
pointing areas of mutual effort and cooperation.'' 
  Stressing nuclear disarmament and destruction of existing 
nuclear weapons, he said, ``It is also self evident that the 
most effective guarantee against the use of nuclear weapons is 
nuclear disarmament, including destruction of all existing 
nuclear arsenals. Furthermore, the obvious fact that no 
nonproliferation scheme will succeed so long as nuclear 
disarmament is not clearly in perspective should not be 
overlooked.'' 
  Referring to the collapse of the bipolar world order, he 
said, ``States that hold massive stockpiles of nuclear weapons 
have, at least, a moral obligation to explain to the 
international community as to what remains as the logic behind 
maintaining nuclear weapons. The world has the right to know who 
these weapons are intended for and who they are to deter any 
more.'' 
  ``It is quite shocking that no major country possessing 
nuclear weapons really came forward in this regard. At the same 
time, they seek unlimited extension of the Nonproliferation 
Treaty, making it absolutely clear that even the ultimate goal 
remains nonproliferation rather than eradication of nuclear 
weapons which is indeed the stated objective of the treaty,'' 
Zarif said. 
  Referring to the discriminations inherent in the 
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), he said, ``Probably the most 
important and fundamental flaw in the international 
nonproliferation regime is the application of double standards 
which has led to selective proliferation of nuclear weapons.'' 
  This has not only gravely undermined the authority and 
relevance of the NPT, but also had serious ramifications for 
international and regional peace and security, and retarded 
regional initiatives, he added. 
  On Israel's negative role in the establishment of a 
nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, Zarif said, ``In 
our region, the acquisition of nuclear weapons by Israel has 
foiled all efforts for the establishment of a 
nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, despite the General 
Assembly's unanimous and continuous endorsement for the past two 
decades of the idea put forward originally by Iran in 1974.'' 
  Elsewhere on the NPT Zarif said, ``The states which are 
renouncing the nuclear option through the NPT must be granted 
full access to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.'' 
  On the chemical weapons, Zarif said that the arbitrary 
limitations on transfer of material and technology has already 
had its negative effects on discussions to formulate 
verification mechanisms related to the convention on the 
prohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of 
bacteriological (biological) and toxin weapons and their 
destruction. 
  The enthusiasm of many countries to sign the convention will 
give way to reluctance and indifference when the time for 
ratification and implementation arrives, he said. 
  An intrusive verification system may hamper development in 
the field of peaceful use in another very significant area, he 
said, adding that real guarantees and commitments for removal of 
all restrictions as well as transfer of material and related 
technology by the producing countries before considering new 
verification system is necessary.

<F P=106> [Article by Kuldip Nayar: ``Deadly embrace''] </F>
  [Text] Washington does not come to the point straightaway. 
It goes over a process to evolve. Camp David confabulations 
spanned the distance between Cairo and Tel Aviv. More recently, 
the lawns of the White House witnessed the handshake between the 
Israeli Prime Minister and the PLO chief. 
  The visit of Robin Raphel, head of State Department's South 
Asia Bureau, to the subcontinent is the beginning of another 
exercise. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott comes to 
promote it. Finally, if all goes well, there may be a meeting 
between Prime Minister Narasimha Rao and Prime Minister Benazir 
Bhutto on the lawns of the White House in the presence of 
beaming and clapping President Clinton to parade `the results'. 
  lt is not that America is fumbling for what it is seeking; 
it 
is only that it wants to show that `the results' came forth 
gradually into being. Process is the key word, not pressure or 
prize, although the United States makes a liberal use of it. 
  For reasons it does not hide, the Clinton administration has 
decided to cap nuclear programmes both in India and Pakistan. 
The visit by Raphel and Talbott are part of an exercise to bring 
it about. The assumption is that both New Delhi and Islamabad 
will give in to Washington's thinking. 
  Starting with Islamabad, America has offered the bait of 38 
F-16s, which Pakistan is keen to acquire. (It made tne payment 
of $680 million nearly two years ago). The Clinton 
administration has said that it will make one-time exception to 
the Pressler amendment which forbids any military assistance or 
the sale of weapons to a country which possesses the nuclear 
device. The price demanded is the capping of nuclear programme 
by Pakistan. 
  Benazir realises that it cannot sell the proposition to a 
nation which has been told and retold that it is better to eat 
grass than to skimp on manufacturing the bomb. On the other 
hand, Benazir very much wants the F-16s. She has reportedly 
conveyed to Washington that she may be able to persuade her 
people to accept the proposition if India too caps its nuclear 
programme. 
  What leverage does Washington have with New Delhi to effect 
it? And why should Rao put his head on the block? America is 
getting together a package containing ``incentives'' which 
Talbott will spell out during his visit to India. Rao has also 
been invited to Washington from 6 May to meet Clinton and 
Congressmen. To ensure that Rao does not reject outright the 
invitation, the Hindujas in London have been brought into the 
picture. 
  Anticipating India's demand that China, should also cap its 
nuclear programme America proposes convening a larger meeting, 
including Russia and China, for arriving at some consensus. Both 
India and Pakistan will be invited. It is difficult to imagine 
China agreeing to any curb when it has not accepted even a 
moratorium on nuclear tests. 
  But the Clinton administration's eyes are set on India and 
Pakistan, not China. It expects that the meetings in Washington, 
preceded by the process which Raphel and Talbott have set into 
motion, will yield some `results'. If, despite Raphel's 
offensive observations, Rao could order red carpet treatment for 
her in the face of foreign office's opposition and even ask the 
Home Minister, S. B. Chavan, to meet her, the Prime Minister can 
be probably propitiated by the fuss America intends making 
during his visit. 
  All this is understandable from Washington's point of view. 
But the interests of New Delhi are not served by America's 
moves. Whatever agreement or concession in the nuclear field is 
envisaged, it should be offered directly to Islamabad. The 
principle of bilateralism, which has been established through 
the Simla Agreement to settle mutual differences between India 
and Pakistan, should not be diluted. By giving any function to a 
third party, particularly America, New Delhi may set a precedent 
which may one day be used in respect of Kashmir. 
  Why America has been singled out is because it is clearer 
than before that Washington wants to have a role in the region. 
Maybe, it is anticipating China's disintegration after Deng 
Xiaoping's death. Maybe, it is opposed to India emerging as a 
regional power. Maybe, it has developed a vested interest in 
Kashmir. Unlike the Bush administration, the Clinton 
administration has different strategical considerations. 
  Because of these considerations, Washington's tilt towards 
Islamabad is visible. For it, Pakistan is a dependable country 
where the army's hold makes things far easier than those in 
democratic, uncertain India. Raphel has given a peep into one 
aspect of America's policies by hinting at an independent status 
for the state of Jammu and Kashmir. However, America's UN 
representative in 1949, Henry Austin, during the discussion on 
Kashmir at the UN, said that the state's ``sovereignty'' had 
passed on to India. 
  Washington has come a long way since. Raphel is only 
annoyingly enthusiastic about-putting things across. But before 
she made them public she tested them at the Carnegie Institute 
on a group of American scholars working on the subcontinent. She 
said that America would treat India and Pakistan at par. When a 
lady scholar said that the policy reminded her of the days of 
Dulles, Raphel did not contradict her. 
  If Rao still wants to go to America, he is at liberty to do 
so. But please save us the humbug that the visit is meant to 
further consolidate the relationship between India and the 
United States.

<F P=106> [Editorial: ``Diplomatic Bankruptcy''] </F>
  [Text] President Clinton, it would seem, is desperate for a 
major foreign policy triumph. Nuclear nonproliferation and human 
rights have been at the top of his agenda. There has been no 
headway in promoting either. While Warren Christopher met his 
Waterloo in Beijing as far as human rights are concerned, his 
chief found North Korea a tough customer on nonproliferation. 
From the U.S. point of view, therefore, the need to embark on a 
bout of aggressive diplomacy in South Asia is all the greater. 
This is the backdrop of the visit of Strobe Talbott to New Delhi 
as Clinton's troubleshooter. If at least there was even a hint 
of progress in the many rounds of Indo-U.S. talks that have 
already taken place in recent months, Talbott could be expected 
to try and improve matters with significant overtures. But that 
is assuredly not the case, with Robin Raphel's endeavours having 
yielded invisible results. Talbott, in other words, is faced 
with the onerous task of convincing New Delhi of the inherent 
virtues of the Clinton administration's approach to the 
Indo-Pakistani conflict. But the worst way of making any headway 
is to offer saccharin-coated lollipops to India. 
  Strobe Talbott, apart from being a high-ranking State 
Department official, is also a scholar and a former journalist. 
He should know better than career diplomats that devising 
formulae that may look attractive on paper will make no dent 
whatsoever in India's security concerns. These concerns have 
been influenced as much by India's history and geography as by 
the bitter experience of having to deal with a neighbour which 
has waged three wars to annex Kashmir, and which it could do 
entirely because of its colossal military arsenal supplied by 
successive regimes in Washington. Total American unconcern for 
New Delhi's apprehensions born, first, of the circumstances of 
Pakistan's birth and, later, of U.S. help in nurturing a virtual 
counterweight to India, persist. Otherwise, it is hard to see 
how the policy-makers in Washington could even imagine that 
India would have evinced the slightest interest in the package 
that has been purposefully leaked to THE WASHINGTON POST. 
  According to the paper, the package provides for verified 
Pakistani capping of its production of weapons-grade nuclear 
material, U.S. lifting of the Pressler Amendment to clear the 
sale of F-16s to Pakistan, and an Indian agreement to give up 
its Prithvi and Agni missiles in response to Islamabad's 
restraint on nukes. To ask India to accept this package is to 
ask it to sign its own death warrant. If, indeed, Talbott plans 
to present this package to South Block, it only means that even 
a man of his experience and knowledge is, in effect, a stranger 
to this country. He is being wilfully naive in believing that 
Benazir Bhutto's support for the package qualifies it 
automatically for Indian endorsement. All together, it seems a 
clear case of diplomatic bankruptcy.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Subhash Kirpekar of the TIMES OF INDIA] </F>
  [Text] The relations between India and Pakistan have been 
deteriorating. The unfortunate part is that they are not 
showing any signs of improving mainly because Pakistan wants to 
internationalize the Kashmir issue which is essentially a 
bilateral matter. The proposed sale of 38 F-16 aircraft by the 
United States to Pakistan can by no stretch of imagination be 
seen as a measure to improve the ground situation and prepare 
for peace in the region. Proliferation cannot be prevented by 
delivery system for nuclear bombs. This will only trigger an 
arms race and divert funds from poverty removal and development 
programs so necessary for the malnourished and deprived 
population in both India and Pakistan. 
  The Indian position has intrinsic merits and cannot be 
wished 
away or brushed off by Washington if it genuinely wants South 
Asia as a zone of peace. In the event of the sale of F-16's by 
waiving the Pressler Amendment coming through, the Indian reply 
could well be to have as many Agni [long-range 
surface-to-surface] missiles. Interestingly, Washington wants 
New Delhi to stop the deployment of Agni missile. Washington 
has to decide then whether it should show genuine concern for 
peace in this region or superimpose this with its concern for 
the prosperity of the domestic arms lobby which stands to rack 
in $800 million by selling the F-16's. 
  If the United States is to be credible then its actions will 
have to match its words. At the moment, they do not appear to 
synchronize. And what is this capping of nuclear weapons 
capability by Islamabad that Washington is talking of? If media 
reports on Pakistan are to be believed, then the statement by 
General Beg at a recent seminar in Karachi is an eye-opener. He 
said that Pakistan has done the capping five years ago and that, 
too, without verification of nuclear installations by 
Washington. What is implied is that America should not go in 
for any verification now. Also if the capping has already been 
done by Pakistan, then the question that arises is why should 
the United States treat capping as a new concession and reward 
Pakistan with F-16's. Is this some king of massive hoax? 
  In the circumstances, what Mr. Strobe Talbott, U.S. deputy 
secretary of state in the Clinton administration, could try to 
do during his current visit to India is try to work for a 
verification package with India applying international 
inspection to check out if the use of fissile materials is 
really for peaceful purposes. Since Mr. Talbott's next halt 
after New Delhi is at Islamabad, he could repeat the same offer 
there also. 
  Washington's contradictions are quizzing. It talks of human 
rights [word indistinct] of those very countries which are the 
worst perpetrators of human rights violations. It talks of 
democracy and then assists undemocratic regimes. It talks of 
peace and prepares a conflict situation. It knows that Pakistan 
is sponsoring terrorism in Kashmir through armed secessionist 
groups. It knows Pakistan wants to grab Kashmir by force, 
something India will never permit. It knows that Pakistan 
disagrees with agreements signed by it like the Simla agreement. 
Since what was signed by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, one would have 
thought that his daughter Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto would 
have thought seriously of implementing it, but America does 
little to persuade Pakistan to shed its belligerence and 
obstinacy. The observation that Pakistan was born in sin [as 
heard] and lives on hatred of India is not off the mark. 
Successive regimes in Pakistan have thrived on India-baiting 
and bashing. At various international forums, including the 
Human Rights Commission in Geneva where Pakistan suffered a 
major diplomatic fiasco recently, it has sought to target India 
and hide its own gross violations of human rights, deny the 
fundamental rights to the people of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir 
and northern territories of Hunza, Gilgit, and Baltistan and the 
violent suppression of minorities like the Christians, Hindus, 
and the Ahmediyas.

<F P=106> [By M.K. Dhar] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, 1 April -- U.S. Deputy Secretary of State 
Strobe Talbott, who is arriving here on 6 April, will be clearly 
told that even though India is interested in knowing the Clinton 
administration's views on resolving Indo-Pak differences, 
linking of F-16 supply to Pakistan with a grand design of 
nonproliferation in South Asia is unacceptable to it. 
  India feels that the issue of Pakistan's nuclear capability 
and its capping is a bilateral matter between Islamabad and 
Washington. It cannot be expected to make a matching commitment 
to a proposition which strikes at the root of nonproliferation 
and legitimises Pakistan's clandestine nuclear weapons programme. 
  Mr. Talbott, who is expected to meet Prime Minister P.V. 
Narasimha Rao and other Union Ministers and have discussions 
with Foreign Secretary K. Srinivasan and External Affairs 
Ministry officials, is likely to unfold his package to establish 
a verifiable, comprehensive nonproliferation regime in the 
subcontinent by capping nuclear capabilities of both India and 
Pakistan and also suggesting a multilateral dialogue on arms 
control. 
  The incentives he has to offer to India to comply with the 
Clinton administration's requirements are not known, but what is 
talked about privately refers to raising the threshold on 
technologies that have so far been denied to it. The suggestion 
for a U.S.-sponsored West Asia Type Indo-Pak dialogue on Kashmir 
and other issues has been informally mooted but the Indian 
reaction will be known only when Mr. Talbott spells out his 
proposals in detail. 
  At present, India is unwilling to commit itself to any such 
negotiations without knowing their scope and usefulness. It 
will not accept anything which amounts to compromising its 
principles because on issues, such as, nonproliferation and 
Kashmir it is not easy to reconcile the views held by India and 
Pakistan, which has found a supporter in the Clinton 
administration for its nuclear adventurist role in South Asia. 
  The Assistant Secretary of State Ms. Robin Raphel, who spent 
five days here, has already tested the temperature and seen the 
disposition of New Delhi, will brief Mr. Talbott on her 
discussions with the Indian leaders and also accompany him on 
his tour of India and Pakistan. Though Ms. Raphel kept a low 
profile during her discussions in New Delhi and avoided raking 
up fresh controversies, she did not yield ground on any aspect 
of the policies that have been laid down for the Clinton 
administration in relation to India and Pakistan. It is, 
therefore, unlikely that any further pressures from the U.S. 
over the nonproliferation issue will work so long as India's 
legitimate security requirements are not met and its concept of 
complete and universal disarmament is not accepted. 
  The Indian Government believe that the Clinton 
administration 
has already taken the decision to supply 36 F-16 aircraft and an 
unspecified number of P-3 Orion antisubmarine warfare planes 
through one-time exception of the Pressler Amendment which 
currently bars U.S. military aid to Pakistan. In order to get 
the support of the Congress to the move, the administration is 
linking it with a broader South Asia initiative on 
nonproliferation including capping of the nuclear capabilities 
of both India and Pakistan. 
  But, in effect, Washington is back-sliding on its accepted 
policy of nonproliferation in South Asia. It is pre-empting the 
whole purpose of the bilateral dialogue between India and 
Pakistan by proposing a barter. F-16s, as India has pointed 
out, can be easily modified to deliver nuclear weapons as 
Pakistan had done in the case of the aircraft it received prior 
to the Pressler ban. 
  Mr. Talbott will surely be told that India is the biggest 
victim of proliferation in the region and the U.S. has condoned 
acquisition of nuclear capability by Pakistan and is trying to 
formalise it so that Islamabad can indulge in the game of 
adventurism and blackmail. Therefore, the concept of forcing 
India and Pakistan to comply with U.S. nonproliferation goals 
while adding to Islamabad's offensive capability through the 
supply of F-16 and other aircraft, is totally unacceptable to 
India. The supply of F-16s will decisively shift the military 
balance in the region in Pakistan's favour, India does not 
accept the argument that because of its superior ground forces 
it is not facing a real threat from Pakistan as there are 
limitations to deploying forces on a single front. While 
Pakistan will have, in addition to the F16s, M-11 and other 
missiles supplied to it by China deployed against India, New 
Delhi is being strongly advised against deploying the Prithvi 
missiles along its borders. 
  Though Pakistan is theoretically under sanctions over the 
issue of missile supplies from China, it is widely known that 
Beijing has maintained supplies of components of M-11 missiles 
with a range of more than 300 km. Therefore, there are no 
takers for the argument that resumption of American arms supply 
to Pakistan will not change the strategic balance in the 
subcontinent.

<F P=106> [By Diplomatic Editor] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, April 2 -- Indian defence planners have 
questioned the Clinton Administration's claim that the 36 F-16 
multirole combat aircraft proposed to be transferred to Pakistan 
under a one-time Pressler waiver are not capable of carrying 
nuclear weapons. 
  An assertion to this effect by the Deputy Secretary of State 
Strobe Talbott before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
last week was challenged by one of the members who pointed out 
that ``even a garage mechanic'' could refit the F-16 to carry 
nuclear weapons. 
  The U.S. intelligence agencies, as also disarmament experts, 
have confirmed that the F-16s supplied previously to Pakistan 
have been refitted to carry nuclear bombs. Former CIA Director 
Robert Gates had in a Senate testimony in 1992 acknowledged that 
Pakistan had equipped its F-16s to deliver nuclear weapons. The 
renowned disarmament expert Mitchell Reiss, consultant at the 
Woodrow Wilson International Centre too has asserted that the 
uranium-based Pakistani bomb could be delivered by any of the 
advanced fighter jets in Islamabad's inventory including the 
F-16. 
  India's opposition to the sale of F-16s is based not only on 
the consideration that Pakistan's offensive capability will 
increase to the extent of upsetting the balance of power, but 
also that it will boost its capacity for nuclear adventurism. 
It has also been revealed that despite the ban on military 
sales to Pakistan under the Pressler Law, the U.S. 
Administration has quietly permitted the Pakistani Armed Forces 
to buy American made arms from commercial firms. Among the 
items sold are spares for F-16s, which form the nucleus of 
Pakistan's Air Force. 
  It is argued that the spares were intended to help Pakistan 
to maintain its current arsenal. Although for years Pakistan 
was engaged in a massive, covert effort to build atomic weapons, 
U.S. governments were reluctant to take strict measures against 
it because of its assistance to Washington's efforts to arm the 
Afghan rebels who were fighting Soviet troops. Thus, Islamabad 
was rewarded for building nuclear weapons and given favoured 
treatment. 
  Official sources said here that it was too simplistic a 
proposition that Pakistan will cap its weapon-oriented nuclear 
programme for anyone to take seriously. If past performance is 
any guide no reliance can be put on Pakistan's word. Therefore, 
India cannot be expected to accept a corresponding obligation of 
capping its capability and throwing its facilities open to 
international inspection in the face of Pakistan's record. 
  There is talk of offering ``incentives'' if India agrees to 
verifiably cap its nuclear fissile material production. It is 
pointed out that due to the sanctions imposed on the Indian 
Space Research Organisation, India is forced to develop 
indigenous capabilities for manufacturing Cryogenic engines. It 
has also built parallel computers capable of performing the 
functions of super computers. There is now talk of U.S. 
allowing exports of computers with the capability of 500 MTOPS 
to 1000 MTOPS, to provide India access to high resolution 
satellite pictures and even to supply commercial nuclear 
reactors subject to international safeguards. These carrots will 
not tempt India which feels its security threatened. 
  However, there are no differences between India and the U.S. 
over a universal test ban and capping production of fissile 
materials for weapon purposes provided it is globally 
applicable. In fact, New Delhi co-sponsored with Washington a 
UN resolution proposing an international convention for fissile 
material cut-off. 
  India believes that it will commit itself to cut-off when 
all 
countries including the five declared nuclear powers, accept it. 
The U.S. Administration proposal is however, seen to be 
discriminatory as it will create two categories of nations, one 
that will be allowed to retain their huge stockpiles of fissile 
materials, and other who will have to cap, roll-back and 
ultimately eliminate their production. 
  During her recent New Delhi visit Assistant Secretary Ms 
Robin Raphel sought to convey the impression that the U.S. was 
interested in a comprehensive dialogue with India without which 
its South Asian policy would not carry much weight. She 
refrained from unfolding new policies to get the Indian reaction.

has asserted that India will not succumb to pressure from any 
country to slow down its missile development program. Talking 
to newsmen in Madras today, he said that Prithvi 
[surface-to-surface missile] has been successfully tested and it

  [Text] Chandipur-on-sea, Feb. 19 (UNI)--India's 
intermediate range ballistic missile Agni was successfully 
test-fired from the Interim Test Range (ITR) here on Saturday 
evening. 
  Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) sources 
said unlike on 7 January, when it had to be postponed owing to a 
snag in the on-board computer system, Saturday's blast-off was 
flawless. 
  However, while the tentative schedule for the blast-off was 
fixed between 7 and 5 p.m., it actually took off at 5.45 p.m. 
  Agni, which has a range of 2,500 km, is one of the five 
missiles developed under the Integrated Guided Missile 
Development Programme. The others being Prithvi, Akash, Trishul 
and Nag. 
  A network of telemetry and tracking stations at the ITR, the 
Sriharikota High Altitude Range (SHAR), Car Nicobar and naval 
ships followed the flight sequence throughout till the payload 
impacted at the designated target. The white hot object was 
tracked by the naval ships confirming the success of the mission. 
  The third launch of the test-vehicle was aimed at achieving 
longer range and advanced manoeuvrability during the re-entry 
phase of the flight for greater accuracy in guiding the payload 
to a designated target at long range. 
  The missile used a solid propellant in the first stage and a 
liquid propellant in the second stage and was fully indigenous. 
It is 21 metres in length with a take off weight of 19 tonnes 
and a payload capacity of one tonne. 
  There were no problems with the direction (azimuth) of the 
missile. Also the missile firing was stable and could do the 
critical pitch over manoeuvre--when the missile is fired in a 
vertical position and at a certain height it is deflected about 
20-25 degrees during the first stage to put the missile into its 
designated flight path.

<F P=106> [Article by Manoj Joshi: ``Agni's Launch Raises Questions''] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 21--The successful launch of the 
Agni-III technology demonstrator on Saturday begs more questions 
than it answers. The Angi-III, 21 metres in length, with a 
take-off weight of 19 tonnes, is a substantially modified 
version of Agni-I, featuring a new stage separation system as 
well as an advanced design manoeuvering-type warhead. 
  The Agni project was sanctioned in July 1983 at a cost of Rs 
35 crores for testing three launch vehicles. Now that the series 
has ended, the government must decide what to do. Does it accept 
the Western diktat and abandon efforts to deploy long-range 
missiles? Or does it continue ``testing'' and ``technology 
demonstration'' of some more different kinds of missiles ad 
infinitum? 
  The other logical option is to instruct the DRDO and 
sanction 
funds to fabricate prototypes of missiles that will be deployed 
in a specific time frame. Given the existing deployments in 
China, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Iran, India will not be 
pre-empting anyone, only reacting, somewhat belatedly, to 
existing capabilities in our region. 
  The first of the Agni series were launched after six years 
of 
efforts by 5,000 engineers and staff. The 600 sec. duration of 
the flight tested a re-entry vehicle structure as well as a 
control and guidance package. In addition a multi-node, 
automatic checkout system was also proved. The test was 
successful in fulfilling the requirements in all the parameters. 
  The second test took place on 29 May 1992, but proved to be 
a 
failure when two seconds after launch Agni-II began to veer 
off-course and came apart, plunging into the sea hundreds of 
miles away from the planned point of descent near the Car 
Nicobar islands. 
  The reason for the failure was beguilingly simple. Agni-II 
was modified by extending its length to 21m from the 19m. length 
of Agni-I. Its weight was increased from 14 to 16 tonnes. This 
change altered the vehicle's vibration characteristics which are 
measured by sensors and which report to an on-board computer 
which orders the various instruments to correct the trajectory. 
  Amazingly the scientists failed to adjust the sensors 
following the modification of the weight and length of the 
vehicle. Last year, upon a Russian consultant's advice the 
problem was resolved in one day. 
  The first attempt to launch Agni-III was made earlier this 
year and it failed when the launch had to be aborted seconds 
before ignition. Agni-III, which looks like Agni-II, has been 
sent up to test a new re-entry vehicle (warhead container). This 
RV has fins which allow it to manoeuver and hence attain greater 
accuracy. 
  Another aspect that the test is designed to prove a more 
advanced stage separation process. Agni-I used ullage motors 
which powered the vehicle for the fraction of a second when 
stage one burnt out and stage two ignited. In the case of 
Agni-III, there is a split-second period in which stage two 
ignites even before stage one has burnt out. This is a complex 
business but it must be mastered to make any modern missile. 
  What happens now? The record of tests is not a happy one. 
Technically four tests have taken place (including the aborted 
one earlier in the year) in a span of five years of which two 
have been failures. 
  Notwithstanding the current success, Agni is a technology 
test-bed too fragile and complex for becoming a rugged 
transportable weapons system. 
  The question that comes to mind is: Has the DRDO been too 
ambitious with the Agni project? The level of innovation between 
Agni-I and Agni-II was quite substantial. But there is the basic 
question of the vehicle itself which has an SLV-3 first stage 
and a modified Prithvi as the second. 
  This is all right as a test-bed but with two different 
propellents it would be too cumbersome a missile. The DRDO could 
have gone for a single-stage liquid propelled missile, something 
not very modern and fashionable, but useful with its existing 
technology. 
  Building a solid-propelled multi-stage missile means going 
to 
the ISRO for technology and that is not the easiest of processes 
given the jealousy with which that organisation guards its 
technology. 
  These and other issues need to be looked at in the coming 
months. A programme which has been delayed some four years 
already requires urgent attention now.

  [Text] New Delhi, April 20 (AFP) -- India has temporarily 
capped its ambitious Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM) 
programme, apparently because of a fiscal crunch, a newspaper 
reported Wednesday. 
  The government has indefinitely postponed further trials of 
the ``Agni'' (Fire) missile, which has a range of 2,500 
kilometers (1,560 miles), THE HINDUSTAN TIMES said. 
  The temporary capping ``is being attributed to a financial 
cruch,'' it said, but added that the postponment was seen as a 
concession to American concerns about India's missile programme. 
  Indian officials were not available to comment on the TIMES 
report. 
  The United States has been pressing India to stop 
development 
of the missile which can carry a nuclear or conventional warhead 
or put a payload weighing one tonne in orbit. 
  Washington says Agni, which forms part of India's Integrated 
Missile Development Programme launched [words indistinct] could 
lead to missile proliferation in the region. 
  India, which in 1974 carried out a nuclear test but claimed 
its nuclear programme was entirely peaceful, has described its 
missile programme as a ``nonnuclear deterrent.'' 
  The newspaper said the Defence Research Development 
Organisation (DRDO) had sought some 17 million dollars to 
conduct three more Agni test launches but the government had not 
responded, citing a shortage of funds. 
  ``Defence sources claimed that India was not going to 
abandon 
its strategic missile programme under American pressure, but 
admitted that some delays would now be inevitable,'' it said. 
  India's missle programme also envisages the development of 
an 
Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile with double the range of 
Agni. It has also developed an array of weapons systems 
including surface-to-air, surface-to-surface, anti-ship and 
anti-tank rockets. 
  The TIMES added that India had meanwhile finalised a deal to 
buy 30 fourth generation MiG-29M fighter aircraft from Russia, 
apparently in response to a U.S. proposal to sell 38 F-16 jets 
to Pakistan. 
  ``There is every possibility that India may start getting 
the 
MiG- 29M even before the US Senate gives the nod for the supply 
of F-16s to Pakistan,''it said. 
  The White House has asked the U.S. Congress for a one-time 
waiver of an amendment barring military sales to Pakistan 
because of its nuclear weapons programme to allow it deliver the 
F-16s. 
  The TIMES described the MiG-29Ms as ``highly 
sophisticated,'' 
with all-weather radar system. They are ``rated better than the 
F-16s in most respects, except for their armament load 
capacity,'' it added. 
  India has fought three wars with Pakistan and one with 
China.

  [Text] New Delhi, 1 April. India is far ahead of China and 
Pakistan in making use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes 
and emerging as an advanced country in this field, Dr. R. 
Chidambaram, Chairman, Department of Atomic Energy said here 
today. 
  While China has (?two) operational nuclear power plants and 
Pakistan only one, India has nine operational nuclear power 
plants and generates about 1,720 MW of power which is 
approximately three per cent of the total power generation of 
the country, Dr. Chidambaram said in an exclusive interview. 
  He said that the country had developed expertise in all 
stages of the nuclear fuel cycle and had created indigenous 
capabilities in designing construction and operation of nuclear 
power plants, reprocessing of spent fuel, and manufacture of the 
necessary sophisticated equipment. 
  Capabilities had been created right from exploration and 
mining atomic minerals; preparation of high purity nuclear 
materials, such as uranium, thorium, zirconium etc.; production 
of fuel elements for reactors; production of heavy water and 
health and safety instrumentation of nuclear waste management, 
he said. 
  Dr. Chidambaram said that the prime objective of the atomic 
energy programme was development, control and use of atomic 
energy solely for peaceful purposes. These included generation 
of electricity and development of nuclear applications in 
research, agriculture, industry, medicine and other areas. 
  To achieve this objective, efforts were initiated to build a 
versatile infrastructure for research facilities, trained 
scientific and technical manpower, raw material processing 
centres and the know-how and capability to manufacture nuclear 
components and electronic equipment to support the atomic energy 
programme with a view to making India truly self-reliant, he 
said. 
  As a result of these efforts, Dr. Chidambaram observed that 
India had broken the super power monopoly in this field and the 
country was today in a position to export research reactors and 
heavy water, subject to international safeguards. 
  ``Today, nine units of nuclear power plants are in operation 
in the country with a total capacity of 1,720 MW. The work in 
respect of Rajasthan Atomic Power Projects Ill and IV, and a 
unit of Kaiga Atomic Power Project in Karnataka, each unit of 
220 MW, would be commissioned soon,'' Dr. Chidambaram informed. 
  He said that the Tarapur Atomic Power Station, Rajasthan 
Atomic Power Station, Madras Atomic Power Station, Narora Atomic 
Power Station and Unit I of Kakrapar Atomic Power Project were 
presently operational. The second 220 MW unit of Kakrapar 
Atomic Power Project is expected to achieve criticality shortly, 
he added. 
  Dr. Chidambaram admitted that India's nuclear programme 
target of generating 10,000 MW of power by the end of this 
century had been slowed down due to a financial crunch. 
However, he said that such a crisis was being faced by all 
public sector units and the country's nuclear programme was no 
exception. 
  The Nuclear Power Corporation was striving to increase its 
internal resource generation. Today our nuclear power stations 
could generate an internal surplus of about Rs. [rupees] 100 
crore, but with the addition of Rajasthan and Karnataka units 
our internal resource generation would touch almost Rs. 400 
crore by 1997-98, he said. 
  Dr. Chidamabaram was of the view that at some stage going 
public would be necessary, and that there was tremendous scope 
for joint ventures in this field. Referring to low operating 
performance of nuclear power plants, which is lower than 
international standards, Dr. Chidambaram said that difficulties 
were being faced in integrating the nuclear power stations with 
the grid resulting in low operating performance. These problems 
were, however, being sorted out. 
  Referring to the safety aspect of nuclear power plants, Dr. 
Chidambaram said that the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, an 
independent body, oversaw and regulated all activities to 
enforce safety-related aspects of atomic power plants. ``The 
guidelines followed are in conformity with international 
standards, such as those prescribed by the International 
Commission on Radiological Protection,'' he asserted. 
  Dr. Chidambaram said that safety was incorporated in all 
phases of a nuclear power project or activities starting right 
from the selection of site. Safety, well engineered into the 
system as per current international standards, was pursued in 
fabrication of equipment, construction phases and maintained 
during operation phase, with review by multi-tier committees at 
different levels. Plans for emergency preparedness had also been 
implemented, he said. 
  Recently, the standing committee on energy of the Lok Sabha 
in its fourth report on ``Nuclear Plan Safety and Spent Fuel 
Management'' which was placed in Parliament last month, has held 
that the commitment of the Department of Atomic Energy to safety 
was total. The committee found that care for protection of 
environment was imbibed in the form of regular procedures for 
site design and operations of all plants. It observed that the 
Department of Atomic Energy adhered to site safety features, 
including protection against earth quakes and associated 
phenomena, extreme meteorological phenomena such as cyclones, 
floods etc. and man-induced events such as aircraft crash, fire, 
explosions, and toxic chemical handling. 
  The committee findings revealed that nuclear industry in the 
country had established a satisfactory safety record. There 
have been no fatalities caused by radiation, nor any sigificant 
occupational radiation injuries of any kind detrimental to the 
public or the environment, at any of the Indian nuclear 
facilities. 
  The committee noted that India accorded top priority to 
management of radioactive wastes right from the beginning of the 
Indian nuclear programme.

<F P=106> [Editorial: ``Pakistan-U.S. Talks -- Hope for Positive </F>
Progress''] 
  [Text] Strobe Talbott, the U.S. deputy secretary of state, 
has concluded his talks with Pakistani authorities in Islamabad. 
It was generally felt that the entire attention at the talks 
would be directed to the nuclear problem in the subcontinent and 
the supply of F-16 planes to Pakistan. However, as Talbott 
himself said, the talks were wide-ranging and encompassed not 
only specific South Asian issues but other global and regional 
issues of interest to Pakistan and the United States, too. 
Although these talks, as the press reports indicate, have not 
been conclusive and will be continued, but a big benefit 
obtained from them is that they enabled Pakistan and the United 
States to understand each other's viewpoints. 
  Pakistan repeated its proclaimed stand that it staunchly 
supports nuclear nonproliferation. However, the objective can 
be achieved only when the two major countries of South Asia both 
agree to accept identical restrictions and no country is given 
any discriminatory or preferential treatment. At his news 
conference, Talbott clarified that the United States would like 
to accomplish the objective of ending the weapons of mass 
destruction by pursuing fair means, and there is no question of 
any attempt to push Pakistan to the corner and to put any 
pressure on it unilaterally. He also held extensive talks on 
the supply of F-16 planes to Pakistan and said that the supply 
of planes is part of the proposals presented to Pakistan as a 
package. 
  The United States also made a proposal to Pakistan for 
convening a multinational conference to discuss the nuclear 
nonproliferation issue, which would include nine countries. 
Pakistan has agreed to the proposal. Talbott repeated the 
demand for an inspection of Pakistan's nuclear installations. 
Pakistan responded with alternative proposals that were not 
disclosed. The two sides have agreed that future talks will be 
held quietly without much publicity so they can deliberate on 
concrete proposals while keeping them free from political 
pressures. 
  It is satisfying to note that the government of Pakistan 
expressed its resolve to adhere to its stand on basic issues and 
refused to compromise on them. The overall attitude of the U.S. 
mission was also satisfying, and it did not demand that Pakistan 
abandon its nuclear program right away. It is only after three 
years that Pakistan and the United States have held such 
high-level extensive talks that have helped the two sides 
understand each other's viewpoint better. Now that it has been 
decided to adopt the path of quiet diplomacy, it is appropriate 
to hope that it will yield results and that the United States, 
keeping with its claim, will be able to adopt an equitable 
strategy toward the countries of South Asia. 
  Pakistan is ready to accept any reasonable proposal on 
nuclear nonproliferation. The U.S. authorities might have 
realized this fact very well during their recent talks. We hope 
that the Clinton administration will have a greater realistic 
approach to all issues after it receives the report on Talbott's 
mission and will make a decision to supply F-16 planes to 
Pakistan without making any unacceptable demand. It will not be 
incongruous to hope that the Islamabad talks will result in the 
revival of better and effective relations between Pakistan and 
the United States. Talbott's remarks that the United States 
still attaches the same importance to Pakistan as it did before 
the end of the Cold War is encouraging. If this claim is 
correct, then there is no justification for suspending the 
military assistance to Pakistan. 
  Pakistan's stand on the nuclear issue is very rational and 
legitimate. In no case can it be used as a plea for suspending 
military assistance to Pakistan. Similarly, the refusal to 
supply the F-16 planes is a totally unjustifiable action, 
because under a business deal Pakistan has paid for them and the 
U.S. Government is obligated to supply the planes. Talbott 
announced that no extraordinary importance would be given to 
India among the countries of South Asia. We hope the U.S. 
Government posture will fully conform to this claim.

<F P=106> [Editorial: ``Quiet Diplomacy''] </F>
  [Text] Mr. Strobe Talbott, after his meetings with the 
Prime Minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto and the Foreign Minister, 
Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali, does not seem to have closed the door on 
further talks with Pakistan. Pakistan's position is that it 
would relent on the NPT only if India does and the Indian 
position is that it would relent only if the nuclear powers of 
the world, including China, do. Of the two, Pakistan's position 
would seem to be more amenable to a solution than India's but it 
is harder of the two in the sense that it being absolutely the 
basic minimum, leaves no room for any concession. Any 
government giving so much as even a hint of freezing the nuclear 
programme unilaterally, leaving the Indians free to carry on 
theirs, would immediately fall. The Indian position, on the 
surface, is far less amenable to any solution, because it seeks 
to impose the NPT not on one country but on all the major powers 
of the world, but is actually softer because its nonacceptance 
does not really hurt India's vital security interests. In that 
sense it is rather a phoney condition put up as a ploy to 
extract a quid pro quo or blackmail the U.S. In the case of 
Pakistan the quid pro quo is of F-16s. Pakistan having rejected 
that, has now its back against the wall. It can retreat no 
further. That is where the hardness of Pakistan's stance comes 
in. India is angling for more and more from the U.S. before it 
allows itself to capitulate on the NPT. It has already won from 
the U.S. the promise of nonintervention in Kashmir. Mr. 
Talbott's reference to the Simla Agreement and his silence on 
Indian atrocities in Kashmir, seems to be part of that India's 
other goal is to deprive Pakistan of conventional weapons. 
Hence its insistence on blocking the delivery of F-16s to 
Pakistan. The United States, on its part, has used the bait of 
sponsorship of India for a permanent seat in the UN Security 
Council, in return for a deal on NPT. So India has kept to 
itself a number of options to play around. 
  In this game of quiet diplomacy likely to be played in the 
days to come, Pakistan it seems would hardly hold any cards in 
its hand. A time may come when it may have to choose between its 
traditional friendship with the United States and its vital 
security concerns. In contrast, the pressure on India is 
minimal. India does not have to depend on the U.S. for 
anything, inlcuding friendship. It already has a traditional 
friend -- Russia -- in the Security Council. It has actually 
used the U.S. to block Pakistan on Kashmir. The U.S. seems 
willing enough to oblige India in some other areas also. India 
suffers from no qualms to milk the U.S. diplomatically, now 
under the cover of quiet diplomacy. The options for Pakistan, 
on the other hand, are limited. But while it does not have to 
let India take advantage of the U.S. obsession with the NPT, its 
own stance on the NPT as well as on Kashmir being a moral one, 
does snot have to be compromised for the sake of expediency. 
The world, it is hoped, will come to distinguish between a 
moral position and an immoral one. It did so, after all, in the 
case of the Russian invasion of Afghanistan.

  [Text] The foreign minister, Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali, says 
supply of F-16 aircraft by the United States to Pakistan cannot 
be linked with its peaceful nuclear program. In an interview 
with BBC, he said the supply of the aircraft is a commercial 
commitment of the American Administration for which Pakistan has 
already made payments. As for the American proposals relating 
to nuclear nonproliferation presented both to Pakistan and 
India, he said multilateral aspect of these proposals is quite 
interesting. Pakistan has agreed to move forward with some 
amendment in these proposals. He said we need to know about the 
American Administration's mind on the issue. The foreign 
minister said there is now a definite change in the thinking of 
the American Administration which is now prepared to look at 
Pakistan's position more reasonably. If this kind of confidence 
continues to develop, they would find answers to their problems 
without compromising their principles.

  [Text] Riyadh, April 14 (AFP)--Saudi Arabia plans to buy 
submarines to protect its coastlines both along the Gulf and the 
Red Sea, the official news agency SPA reported Thursday. 
  Deputy Defence Minister 'Abd-al-Rahman Bin-'Abd-al-Aziz, 
quoted by SPA, told naval officers in al-Dammam on Wednesday 
that his country wanted submarines which could adapt to the Red 
Sea and the more shallow waters of the Gulf. 
  Prince 'Abd-al-Rahman did not disclose if negotiations had 
opened for buying the vessels. 
  Iran, across the oil-rich Gulf from the Saudi kingdom, 
bought 
three submarines from Russia in 1992, raising concern among its 
Arab neighbours and their Western allies which have a naval 
presence in the strategic waterway. 
  SPA also reported that the national guard on Wednesday wound 
up a week of exercises on the Gulf coast of eastern Saudi Arabia.

  [Text] Kiev April 13 UKRINFORM-TASS -- The first shipment 
of nuclear fuel cassettes has arrived from Russia at Europe's 
largest nuclear power station in Zaporizhzhe, Ukraine. It is a 
compensation for the nuclear warheads Ukraine has dismantled. 
  This means that practical implementation has begun of the 
measures envisioned in the trilateral statement signed by the 
presidents of Russia, Ukraine and the United States in Moscow in 
January. 
  According to specialists, the fuel delivered to the 
Zaporizhzhe nuclear power station will suffice to keep one of 
five power-generating units operating for a year and give 
Ukraine 5.5 to six billion kilowatt hours of cheap electricity.

  [Text] Moscow April 14 TASS -- ``The mechanism for 
implementing measures stipulated by the tri-partite statement 
made by the Presidents of Russia, Ukraine and the U.S. on 14 
January of this year has started to work,'' said a spokesman for 
the Russian Foreign Ministry. 
  Grigoriy Karasin was referring to the arrival of the first 
shipment of nuclear fuel assemblies from Russia to the Ukrainian 
Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, the largest of its kind in 
Europe. The shipment was sent as compensation for Ukraine's 
dismantled nuclear warheads. 
  As the spokesman, in accordance with the three presidents' 
statement, all nuclear warheads should be transferred from 
Ukrainian to Russian territory, where they should be dismantled 
as soon as possible. Russia is then required to compensate 
Ukraine in the form of fuel assemblies for the latter's nuclear 
energy programme, also as soon as possible. 
  In order to begin the process of compensating Ukraine, 
Russia 
agreed to provide the fuel assemblies, containing 100 tonnes of 
lowly-enriched Uranium, within ten months. In the same time 
period, at least 200 nuclear warheads from RS-18 and RS-22 
rockets will be transported from Ukraine to Russia for 
dismantling. 
  According to Russian specialists, the first shipment of fuel 
to the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant is enough to enable one of 
the plant's five reactors to work for an entire year, which will 
give Ukraine 5.5 to 6 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity.

  [Text] Moscow, 14 Apr -- ``The mechanism for putting into 
effect the measures stipulated in the trilateral declaration of 
the presidents of Ukraine, Russia and the United States on 14 
January has begun working.'' This was how Grigoriy Karasin, the 
director of the Russian Foreign Ministry's press and information 
department commented at a briefing today on reports of the 
arrival at the Zaporozhye AES, the largest in Europe, of the 
first batch of fuel installations [toplivye sborki] from Russia 
as part of compensation for dismantled nuclear warheads. 
  As the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said, all nuclear 
munitions had, in accordance with the statement by the 
presidents of the three countries, to be brought from Ukraine to 
Russia in order for them to be dismantled as rapidly as 
possible, while Russia for its part had to provide compensation 
in the form of nuclear fuel installation deliveries to Ukraine 
to meet the needs of Ukraine's nuclear power sector during the 
same period of time. 
  In order to begin the process of compensating Ukraine, 
Russia 
had undertaken to supply it over 10 months with fuel 
installations containing 100 tonnes of low-level enriched 
[nizkoobogashchennyy] uranium for nuclear power stations. A 
minimum of 200 nuclear warheads off RC-18 and RS-22 missiles 
will be taken from Ukraine to Russia in the same period to be 
dismantled. 
  In the opinion of Russian experts, the first consignment of 
fuel received by the Zaporozhye AES is enough to power one of 
the power units for a year, providing Ukraine with 5.5-5.6 
billion kilowatt hours of electricity.

  [Text] Novosibirsk April 7 TASS--The chemical plant in 
Novosibirsk is facing a tough financial situation which can 
affect the implementation of the Ukrainian nuclear disarmament 
programme. 
  The plant is the only enterprise in Russia which produces 
fuel for water-moderated water-cooled reactors which is to be 
shipped to Ukraine in exchange for its nuclear warheads. 
  The first batch of fuel assemblies was shipped to Ukraine in 
the end of March, deputy director general of the plant Vladimir 
Rozhkov told TASS on Thursday. 
  The Finance Ministry had to pay for the fuel nearly 30 
billion roubles, but the enterprise had received no money so far 
and cannot buy a number of accessories necessary for the 
production of nuclear fuel assemblies. 
  Experts of the enterprise warned that reserves will last 
only 
for one month. If production stops many Russian nuclear power 
plants will remain without fuel as well. 
  ``A disruption of nuclear fuel shipments to Ukraine is not 
ruled out because the state, which is acting as a contractor, 
does not fulfil its commitments in time,'' Rozhkov said.

  [Text] Moscow, 8 Apr -- ``The committee for conventions on 
chemical and biological weapons under the Russian president 
agreed to the transportation and storage of poisonous substances 
in a major populated area. That is why its chief Anatoliy 
Kuntsevich was dismissed by presidential decree.'' This was the 
explanation of the wording of Kuntsevich's dismissal ``for a

press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov at a briefing in the Kremlin 
today. 
  Moreover, Vyacheslav Kostikov noted that Anatoliy Kuntsevich 
had spent many years working on the creation of chemical weapons 
and ``it is difficult for a person to part from his child even 
if the child is dangerous.'' For this reason, the president's 
press secretary said, the person dealing with the destruction of 
the chemical arsenal should not be one who was involved in its 
creation.

<F P=106> [Viktor Litovkin report: ``Academician Kuntsevich Learned of </F>
His Dismissal in a Telephone Call from IZVESTIYA''] 
  [Text] The Russian president's Press Service disseminated a 
report through ITAR-TASS channels that ``a presidential edict 
has released from his post Anatoliy Demyanovich Kuntsevich, 
chairman of the Committee on Convention Problems of Chemical and 
Biological Weapons under the Russian Federation president.'' It 
also pointed out that A. Kuntsevich has been released from his 
post ``for a single gross violation of work duties.'' 
  The Press Service did not explain what kind of violation 
this 
was, and Vyacheslav Kostikov, the Russian president's press 
secretary, said at a briefing that there were such violations. 
But Kuntsevich's closest colleagues do not know of them, and he 
himself, so he declared in conversation with me, had not heard 
about this and learned of his dismissal only in a call from 
IZVESTIYA's editorial office. 
  Let us leave aside this, not the first occasion when someone 
released from a high state post learns of this from press 
reports. Particularly a prominent scientist who is one of the 
creators of the most sophisticated Soviet chemical weapons, 
winner of the Lenin Prize, hero of socialist labor, lieutenant 
general, and academician who, at the end of his scientific 
career, resolutely set about destroying these weapons. 
  Let us ask ourselves a different question: Why, after all, 
has Academician Kuntsevich been removed from his post, and what 
true reason hides behind the vague wording ``single gross 
violation of work duties''? 
  There are several answers to this question. One version was 
suggested by observers: Kuntsevich has suffered...for the 
complete failure of the case of chemical scientist Vil 
Mirzayanov, which he supposedly initiated. In conversation with 
me the academician categorically denied his involvement in the 
``Mirzayanov case,'' although he has repeatedly and harshly 
condemned Mirzayanov's action. 
  In any case, the responsibility for that shameful trial 
lies, 
in my opinion, with the law enforcement organs. 
  The reason for Academician Kuntsevich's dismissal lies far 
deeper than it seems. It lies in our country's economic and 
technical inability and unpreparedness to fulfill its 
international obligations to destroy chemical weapons. 
  The program for the destruction of these weapons has not yet 
been approved either by parliament or by the government. The 
funding of all measures connected with preparations for the 
direct salvaging of toxins and ammunition is proceeding 
extremely irregularly and plainly inadequately, not to mention 
the actual program of their destruction. This year alone the 
preparations to rid Russia of chemical weapons are to cost 10.4 
billion [currency not specified], but this [money] simply does 
not exist. 
  Academician Kuntsevich was categorically opposed to the 
destruction of chemical weapons without resolving social 
problems and without guarantees for the population resident in 
the places where they are stored and where it is proposed to 
salvage them. But sufficient funds have not been found for just 
these purposes. The program is slipping and is today under 
threat of being wrecked. 
  The Convention Committee tried to find nonbudgetary funds to 
implement the chemical disarmament program. In many ways it 
succeeded. We were given assistance in resolving these problems 
by the United States (the total amount exceeded $60 million for 
the development of a safe and efficient technology for the 
destruction of toxins), the FRG, Sweden, and the EEC, and 
contacts were initiated with NATO. I am not sure if they will 
be broken off with Kuntsevich's departure from his post, but 
they will certainly be complicated somewhat -- the academician's 
authority in international scientific circles is very great. 
  One thing remains beyond doubt -- by signing the Convention 
on the Destruction of Chemical Weapons in Paris in 1993 along 
with 155 other states, Russia assumed juridical obligations to 
start parting with them in two years' time. It will hardly be 
able to keep to this deadline.

  [Text] The Hague April 11 ITAR-TASS -- The session of the 
preparatory commission for the establishment of an international 
organisation in charge of monitoring the ban on chemical weapons 
heard a statement of the Russian delegate today. The statement 
stresses that much work has been done since the convention on 
chemical weapons was opened for signing more than a year ago. 
The work mainly concentrated on working out and coordinating 
mechanisms of implementing the convention. 
  However, according to the Russian view, much has yet to be 
done to fulfil the mandate of the preparatory commission. Few 
of the twenty-three tasks set for the commission by the Paris 
resolution are close to completion, and nearly one half of the 
total number have not yet been proper considered. 
  Moreover, the statement says, we are alarmed by the attempts 
made from time to time in the course of the preparatory 
commission's work to revise the essence of certain clauses, as 
well as to enforce interpretations of the text, which was taken 
for granted at the moment of signing. In particular, this 
concerns the correlation of the national constitutional norms 
and the granting of access to chemical installations to 
inspectors at their request, the uncertainties in the 
understanding of the key definitions, such as ``chemical 
weapons'' and ``a facility producing chemical weapons.'' In 
addition, Russia, which will have to bear the cost of 
eliminating and controlling its own stocks of chemical weapons, 
cannot agree to some of the proposals concerning the 
distribution of costs among all member-stations. 
  When signing the text of the convention on 13 January 1933 
in 
Paris, Russia which has a stock of chemical weapons with the 
total weight of the toxic substances totalling 40,000 tonnes, 
was well aware of the scale of the obligations it assumed. 
However, proceeding from an understanding that the convention 
is a major step towards global disarmament and the strengthening 
of international security, and reflects a compromise reached as 
a result of difficult many-year negotiations, Russia was among 
the first to sign this international agreement. When signing 
the convention, Russia stressed that the realisation of the 
obligations under the convention will be contiguous with a 
number of economic difficulties. This implied the lessening of 
Russia's spending on international supervision and verification 
and elaboration of economically-acceptable procedures of 
conversion of the former facilities producing chemical weapons 
to peaceful uses. Russia counted on the possibility of a 
favourable solution of these problems. 
  During the parliamentary hearings about the participation of 
the Russian Federation in international agreements on the 
elimination of chemical weapons, some committees of the State 
Duma noted the need for the final clarification of the situation 
concerning the cost of the realisation of the convention. 
Questions about Russia's spending, as well as about the vague 
idea about the final text of the convention and the uniform 
interpretation of its key terms, the amount of basic obligations 
which determine the scope of the convention will inevitably 
arise when the document is submitted for ratification by the 
Russian Parliament and will in fact predetermine the result of 
its consideration. Unfortunately, in the past year, the 
preparatory commission has failed to examine the procedure of 
payments for the verification activity and the conversion of 
chemical weapon plants to peaceful production, and no decisions 
on these matters have been made up to date. 
  Russia draws everyone's attention to the fact that the 
enforcement of the convention on chemical weapons in 1995 will 
be hampered by the failure to solve the above problems as soon 
as possible. This is necessary to allow the states that signed 
the convention to obtain a full idea about all aspects of 
implementing the convention at the stage of its ratification, 
the statement said.

  [Text] Last month, the British SUNDAY TIMES came up with 
allegations that Russia is developing biological weapons. The 
Russian Defense Ministry has strongly denied the allegations. 
Nevertheless, THE WASHINGTON POST has issued the same statement 
again recently. Vladislav Kozyakov comments: 
  What is surprising is that the authors of the publications 
about a biological weapons program allegedly under way in Russia 
refer to the White House, sources which in their turn quote 
statements by some anonymous defectors from Russia. And, 
moreover, the authors contradict each other. For one, an 
anonymous author says in THE WASHINGTON POST that he has got all 
the necessary evidence that the program exists, while another 
author states in the same newspaper that there is no evidence to 
prove the charges and therefore it can be only nonmilitary 
equipment that should be dismantled as well. 
  Hence, a question arises -- what are the reasons for 
spreading such unfounded accusations concerning the Russian 
policy in the American mass media, with reference to the 
administration's officials? 
  An agreement is effective between Russia, the United States, 
and Britain on mutual visits to biological facilities of the 
three countries. Russian experts visited several facilities of 
the kind in the United States in February-March this year. 
British and American experts carried out similar inspections in 
Russia in 1992, last October, and last January. They were 
allowed to visit any laboratories and talk with employees and 
take pictures as well. And Western experts revealed no claims 
as to the observance of the 1972 convention banning biological 
weapons. 
  As for visiting American biological facilities, Russian 
experts faced serious obstacles. For one, they were not allowed 
into a number of laboratories and one building of a former plant 
of the (Phaser) firm, producing biological weapons. Certain 
restrictions were posed on them to take pictures and they were 
also denied to make biological tests. One of the facilities was 
opened for inspection only after the Russian Embassy interfered. 
Besides, experts from Russia found out that the (Phaser) firm 
not only preserved but was modernizing the equipment designed 
earlier to produce biological warfare formulas. The information 
to that effect has been published in the Moscow-based newspaper 
IZVESTIYA. 
  Apparently there is only one way to provide strict 
observance 
of the 1972 convention banning biological weapons. The sides 
should work out a more effective control mechanism over the 
convention's implementation. Russia, for its part, intends to 
help promote the idea at the forthcoming session of the 
preparatory committee dealing with the control measures to 
observe the convention. Will the Western countries be ready for 
a stricter control system?

  [Text] Moscow April 13 ITAR-TASS -- Channel Four of British 
television is planning to screen a documentary on Wednesday that 
alleges that the Russian scientists have developed a miniature 
neutron bomb, the size of a baseball. It is developed on the 
basis of the so-called red mercury. British television has 
every right to select films for screening and advertise the 
show, but it would not be wrong to familiarize the film-makers 
and viewers with what Russian specialists and scientists think 
about it all. 
  ``It is impossible to create a neutron bomb on the basis of 
red mercury,'' Professor Sergey Yakimov, deputy director of the 
Kurchatov Institute, said in an interview with ITAR-TASS. 
  Commenting on Western media reports alleging that Russian 
scientists have made a new discovery, Professor Yakimov said 
``this does not correspond to reality, for one simple reason: 
Red mercury does not and cannot exist in nature. It is a cyanic 
acid, the formula of which can be found in school chemistry 
books. It has nothing to do with radioactive components and 
cannot be used in any branch of atomic production.'' 
  According to Yakimov, two years ago the West was put on 
tenterhooks by rumors about cold thermonuclear processes, but a 
simple scientific verification procedure revealed it was no more 
than bluff. ``I have no doubt that today's sensation is in for a 
similar end,'' he said.

<F P=106> [Article by IZVESTIYA correspondent Aleksandr Krivopalov, </F>
London: ``All of England Is Talking About `Red Mercury' and a 
New Russian Weapon''] 
  [Text] People in London are discussing a documentary 
film that was shown on Channel 4 of British television, 
concerning a new and very secret mass-destruction weapon that 
has allegedly been created in Russia. 
  The portable bomb approximately the size of a cup of tea or 
a 
small ball is presumably capable of destroying every living 
thing in the radius of a large modern city or rayon. 
  Britons engaged in collecting material concerning this for 
18 
whole months, trying to find the confirmation of rumors that 
have been disturbing the Western press for a long time -- rumors 
to the effect that secret smuggling channels are being used to 
ship out of Russia ``red mercury,'' the very existence of which 
is denied by scientific-technical experts. 
  No, asserts G. Roberts, who leads the narration in the 
sensational British television research. This substance is not a 
myth: it is, in fact, a major component in a ``clean'' 
thermonuclear bomb that has presumably been made in Russia and 
nowhere else in the world. True, his conversational partners on 
the topic of ``red mercury'' remain, as a rule, anonymous, and 
their testimony sounds, one has to admit, not too convincing. 
  The attempt to get hold of responsible and knowledgeable 
commentators finally led the film makers to Yekaterinburg, where 
they photographed scenes that greatly resemble old James Bond 
hits: secret meetings at twilight with certain unknown 
individuals who first promised to provide the needed 
information, but at the last moment disappeared, frightened by 
the consequences. 
  Nevertheless the group from England would appear to have 
succeeded in learning the secrets about the weapon that can 
become a new and even more frightening threat for all of 
mankind. They met with a Russian scientist who personally, over 
a five-year period, allegedly participated in work on this 
project. In any case the film's consultants were convinced that 
that testimony is substantiated. 
  Another eminent expert in the field of nuclear physics, 
American Professor Cohen, has stated firmly that American 
scientists, so far as one can judge from the materials that were 
collected by the British television group, are lagging seriously 
behind their Russian colleagues in this area. In Cohen's 
opinion, now it will be impossible to stop the proliferation of 
nuclear weapons in the world. 
  At the end of the film there is an interview with the head 
of 
a major German company. That entrepreneur states that he knows 
personally about proposals concerning such major sales of ``red 
mercury'' from Russia, and that he was simply terrified. 
  [Editor's note] A representative of RF Ministry of Defense 
has rejected the hypotheses concerning the existence both of 
``red mercury'' and the ``ninibomb'' that was created on its 
basis (see IZVESTIYA, No. 70).

  [Text] Mirniy (Archangelsk region) April 15 TASS -- 
``Reports about a `new Russian miniature bomb,' allegedly 
developed with the use of `red mercury,' are absolutely 
groundless,'' ITAR-TASS was told today by Lieutenant-General 
Yuriy Zhuravlev, chief of the state testing ground of the 
Russian Strategic Missile Forces. 
  ``Russia is not making or testing new types of nuclear 
weapons,'' he stressed. 
  The hullabaloo around the Russian ``top secret weapon,'' the 
general believes, was raised by those who disapprove of the 
partnership relations that are now being established between 
Russia and the West. We have seen more than once in the past 
that whenever some military-industrial complex needed new funds, 
reports immediately began to appear, claiming that this or that 
country ``is lagging behind the Russians,'' he recalled.

Sensational Document -- The Study Was Done by Military Experts 
Under the Coordination of the Foreign Intelligence Service: 
Zhirinovskiy's Earthquakes Are Threatening Romania''] 
  [Text] Related to various speculation that is being made in 
connection with the mysterious weapon mentioned by Russian 
ultra-nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, Romanian experts 
have reached the conclusion that actually one has to deal with a 
maneuver launched by special Russian bodies intended to 
intoxicate public opinion, and which, owing to lack of 
information, have managed to fool the mass media in the West and 
even in our country. Thus, they went so far as to consider the 
Elipton a sonic weapon, a biological weapon, and even a 
microwave weapon, while the true nature of this 
military-technical system was lost in the general cacophony. 
  Elipton is a weapon system based on gravitational 
interference. After the last catastrophic earthquake that shook 
Yerevan, U.S. military analysts revealed two strange things: 
The catastrophe, which seemed to be a natural one, occurred at 
a ``providential'' moment to halt Armenia's autonomist 
tendencies and it also offered the Soviet political-military 
authorities a good pretext to liquidate the Armenian nuclear 
power industry, and thus impose an acute energy dependence on 
that central republic; the second element refers to the fact 
that early-warning satellites recorded an orbital ``double 
lightning,'' which preceded, by a very short time, the 
earthquake. That was an unmistakable sign of the detonation of 
a small-size nuclear load, contravening all currently valid 
international treaties. It was easy to draw conclusions: The 
Soviets have discovered a way to trigger earthquakes. Ten 
months later, using a rocket launched from an F-15 
fighter-bomber (ASAT system), the United States managed to 
intercept, for the first time, a low-orbit satellite. The 
system was allegedly designed to destroy Soviet spy satellites, 
but actually it was the sole efficient defense to counter the 
use of the Elipton over U.S. territory. However, certain rumors 
had already reached the ears of the mass media -- it was the 
time when many people believed in an imminent and catastrophic 
reactivation of the San Andreas fault, some sources even held it 
possible that ``half of California would sink into the ocean,'' 
as a consequence of a devastating earthquake. 
  The advantages of the Elipton are obvious: It is a discreet 
weapon, and any accusations can be brushed off by saying it is a 
``phantasm,'' provided that it is used by daylight, so that its 
lightning could be camouflaged by the sun's natural light. 
  It is quite significant, that merely three days after 
Zhirinovskiy's extremely allusive statement regarding the 
Elipton, the Geophysical Institute of the Russian Academy 
organized a news conference on the issue of seismic weapons, 
although no one had explicitly talked about such a thing. That 
news conference seems to be rather the result of panic. The 
Russians did not know precisely to what extent Zhirinovskiy, the 
former GRU [Soviet Military Intelligence] agent, had divulged 
about the Elipton, and they assumed that Western journalists 
were at least aware of the exact nature of that weapons system 
and the name of the person coordinating the program, which, as 
it later turned out, was not the case at all. During this news 
conference they claimed that in fact the Elipton does not exist 
at all: ``Earthquakes cannot be triggered except in the places 
where nature has already prepared them,'' said the official 
statement, which, as a matter of fact, was quite precise. The 
statement actually confirmed previous information about the 
existence of the Elipton-type weapon systems and about their 
nature, and it also offered an exact description of the way in 
which they work. The Hammer [as published] triggers earthquakes 
wherever there is accumulated tension in the ground, which can 
be unleashed by a minimal variation of the gravitational 
acceleration. Thus, they can trigger earthquakes -- the 
magnitude of which, it is true, is very difficult to predict -- 
in areas in which over the past 1,000 years there has not been 
any seismic activity at all. 
  The Romanian state is directly vulnerable to weapons such as 
the Hammer or the Hole [as published] that are part of the 
Elipton program. Important industrial centers of our country 
and vital establishments of our defense industry are situated in 
valley areas such as Tara Barsei [central Romania, where the 
Carpathian Mountains turn], in which the triggering of 
catastrophic tornadoes could cause enormous damage to our 
industrial infrastructure. Moreover, owing to the existence of 
the seismic area in Vrancea [north-eastern Romania], the 
possible use of Hammer-type weapons there would cause a 
catastrophe in Bucharest, considering the current precarious 
state of the buildings in our capital city. 
  Such weapons might be used in the near future if a 
geopolitical conflict breaks out as a consequence of the 
unification of the Republic of Moldova with Romania or of our 
country's active integration within NATO. No methods are known 
to counter such weapons. However, one could count on warning 
signs offered by attempts to use them, which fail owing to 
insufficient precision.

  [Text] Mirny (Murmansk region) April 11 TASS -- ``Russia is 
neither producing nor testing nuclear weapons,'' ITAR-TASS was 
told by Lieutenant-General Yuriy Zhuravlev, head of the state 
testing area under Russia's Strategic Missile Command. 
  On Monday, a large group of journalists from various 
publications, information agencies, and radio and tv stations 
arrived at the top secret garrison in Mirny. They will be able 
to acquaint themselves with some of Russia's latest military 
technology, in particular, with the ``Topol'' experimental 
missile system which is expected to become part of the armed 
forces in a couple of years. 
  The journalists' arrival corresponded with celebrations of 
Cosmonaut's Day. In Mirny, this holiday is widely celebrated, 
since much has been done here for progress in space. 
  ``We have no secrets to hide from Russians and the world 
community, but our openness does not hinder our responsibility 
for the security of Russia,'' Yuriy Zhuravlev declared.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First 
Channel Network in Russian at 1425 GMT on 7 April broadcasts a 
15-minute program entitled ``The Korean Knot'' presented by 
Vitaliy Ilyashenko. The program includes a factual account by 
the correspondent on the crisis around the DPRK's nonobservance 
of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. A studio discussion is 
chaired by Ilyashenko with Aleksandr Panov, deputy minister of 
foreign affairs and Professor Anatoliy Torkunov, rector of the 
Institute of International Relations. 
  Panov says that in view of the high troop concentration on 
the border between the Korean states the situation is very 
volatile there. He goes on to call for a multilateral 
international conference on the problem, saying: ``We believe 
that we should, that it is right to use the channels in 
existence -- the Security Council, certainly -- but since the 
bilateral variant is not working, let us then go back to the 
idea of a multilateral conference. It should be said that no 
one has yet -- but we have only just put this idea forward -- no 
one has yet, as they say, swept it aside -- even the DPRK, 
although when I explained this initiative to the North Korean 
ambassador in Moscow he already knew about the initiative and 
did not react negatively to it. 
  ``Other countries are also studying it. The United States 
have come out and said that in principle they believe that such 
a conference should be well prepared -- and we agree -- and they 
have already put forward a set of positions that should be 
reinforced during the conference. These are the unconditional 
and full return of the DPRK to the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty and inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency, 
and the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. All of this 
coincides with our policy. But we need to go further. We need 
to give some sort of guarantee to North Korea and ensure the 
nonnuclear status of the Korean peninsula and the sovereignty of 
the Korean states and nonintervention in their internal affairs. 
So, there is a complex of measures to go through before we can 
solve this problem.'' 
  Asked what the treaty between Russia and the DPRK would mean 
in the event of a deterioration in the military situation on the 
Korean peninsula, Panov says: ``As the legal successor of the 
Soviet Union, Russia continues to fulfill the commitments of 
that treaty. It has not been denounced and the only thing, of 
course, is that the situation has changed, and therefore we have 
made a statement of which the DPRK has been informed: How we 
interpret the article that stipulates assistance and support for 
the DPRK in the event of an emergency situation of the kind.'' 
  ``It was stated that assistance would be given only in the 
event of an unsanctioned aggression against the DPRK. We 
ourselves will analyze the situation on the basis of our own 
sources of information and how the problems are dealt with. We 
will assess the degree of threat, the degree of aggression and 
its character, and we will operate within our legislation and 
our Constitution, and we will certainly take into account 
Russia's international obligations -- for instance those under 
the International Atomic Energy Agency Treaty and the UN 
Charter. So our position here is quite clear.'' 
  When the discussion turned to the possibility of UN 
sanctions 
against the DPRK, Panov says: ``We believe that matters should 
not be brought to the level of sanctions and that if it is 
impossible to solve this within the framework of the Security 
Council, then there is the option of a conference. That is to 
say, there is quite a way to go before we arrive at sanctions. 
We need to use every option.''

  [Text] Mirny, Arkhangelsk region April 13 TASS -- The 
setting up of a unique system of control for missile flights at 
the command post of the range has been copmpleted, ITAR-TASS was 
told by General Nikolay Yudin, chief of staff of the state range 
of strategic rocket forces in the Arkhangelsk region. 
  He said the range has become a major scientific center in 
Russia. Officers manning the command post are candidates of 
technical sciences. A computer system for flight control has 
been created at the initiative of one of them, 
Lieutenant-Colonel Yashchenko. 
  From 1992 the range has been serving the task of insurance 
and monitoring of the observance of treaty-governed obligations 
between Russia and the United States for the exchange of 
telemetric information on missile launchings, General Yudin 
said. The Russian Strategic Rocket Forces now have at their 
disposal a unique and Russia's only experimental base for 
testing all kinds of missiles, for processing and analysys of 
the information strictly in accordance with the treaty on 
strategic offensive arms. 
  As is known, a large group of journalists arrived at the 
secret garrison in Mirny on April 11. The journalists were 
given an opportunity to familiarise themselves with the latest 
equipment, specifically with the pilot sample of the missile 
complex Topol which will be adopted for service in several 
years. The arrival of journalists coincided with the 
celebration of Cosmonautics Day. It is broadly celebrated in 
Mirny as much has been done here for space exploration. ``We 
keep no secrets from the Russian and world public, but our 
openness does not lower our sense of responsibility for Russia's 
security. Russia can be confident on its security,'' General 
Yuriy Zhuravlev, chief of the range, told repoters.

  [Text] Hiroshima, 14 Apr -- The Russian Ministry of Nuclear 
Energy believes that within seven to 10 years all plutonium left 
from dismantled nuclear weapons in Russia could in principle be 
recycled on three-four breeder reactors of the new BN-800 type 
(sodium cooled fast breeder reactor - ITAR-TASS). Nikolay 
Yermakov, head of the Russian delegation at the conference of 
the Japanese nuclear industry forum, currently being held here, 
told this ITAR- TASS correspondent that a first reactor of this 
type is already being built at one of the nuclear industry 
centers in Chelyabinsk- 40, and that the local authorities have 
approved its completion within the next several years. 
  Nikolay Yermakov, who heads the directorate of nuclear 
reactors at the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry, said the 
question of Japan's purchase of highly enriched fissile 
substances from Russia's dismantled nuclear warheads is still 
``up in the air'' because Tokyo ``is not showing any activity in 
response to Russia's proposals.'' 
  The head of the Russian delegation believes that until about 
2010 Russian nuclear power engineering will continue to develop 
light- water reactors, which use thermal neutrons, because the 
county's power engineering needs are at present satisfied by 
cheap uranium. 
  However, he believes that from about the second decade of 
the 
21st century there will be a shift to a plutonium program, and a 
closed power engineering system will be built on the basis of 
breeder reactors, using both thermal and fast neutrons. ``This 
will enable us to use breeder reactors not only to produce but 
also to recycle -- that is to burn -- plutonium from light-water 
installations with a minimal emission of radioactive waste,'' he 
said.

are a means of maintaining the world military-political balance. 
The only alternative to them is a regime of total international 
confidence. This is stated in a report of the Russian 
delegation submitted to the 27th conference of the Japanese 
atomic industrial forum underway here. The report has been 
drawn up by the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy. It believes 
that the Russian nuclear complex which is experiencing difficult 
times should export more electricity generated by nuclear power 
plants and should heavier rely on the export of technologies and 
a number of materials. It should be open to international 
cooperation. 
  In view of the unstable situation in the world, while 
nuclear 
disarmament is in progress, the complex of nuclear arms is under 
certain obligations, says the report. More stable, easier 
verifiable and predictable strategic arms systems should be 
preserved while surplus, morally and obsolete provocatively 
dangerous kinds of nuclear arms should be eliminated. 
  Russia spends up to one thousand billion roubles a year to 
dismantle such armaments, according to the information of the 
Ministry of Atomic Energy. The basic stocks of arms are worn to 
over 50 per cent. A large-scale modernisation is required in 
keeping with contemporary demands, also in order to dismantle 
and utilise nuclear arms. 
  The Ministry of Atomic Energy regards as a way out a broader 
use of vast scientific and technological potential accumulated 
over the decades of the development of the atomic industry. 
``In addition to large state investment, Russia's participation 
in the market of high technologies and scientific and 
technological progress with drawing foreign capital in 
reasonable and mutually advantage proportion would be useful to 
all sides,'' says the report. ``The ministry annually receives 
80 million dollars of additional financing for scientific and 
technological projects. As a result of external financing of 
projects carried out at enterprises of the Ministry of Atomic 
Energy with the subsequent joint use.'' 
  The new generation of nuclear power and thermal stations 
with 
fuel recycling and deactivation of waste, including slow-neutron 
and fast-neutron reactors with the use of uranium-plutonium fuel 
and the uranium-thorium cycle also requires considerable 
outlays. These power plants will be much more safer because of 
features of their design including an uncontrolled chain 
reaction of nuclei. Russia views as an additional source of 
investment into the area the expansion of the export of 
electricity generated by nuclear power plants, of equipment and 
fuel for power plants, including products for the utilisation of 
weapon-grade uranium and plutonium, as well as rare-earth 
metals, medical isotopes and high-calory fertilizer which are 
produced in the framework in the nuclear complex. This 
investment will reach one billion dollars this year.

  [Text] Mirny, Arkhangelsk Region, April 12 TASS--The Topol 
(Poplar) missile complex, which has no analogues in the world, 
is not only operational with Strategic Missile Forces (SMF) to 
ensure Russia's worthy parity but is also used for peaceful 
purposes, Lieutenant-General Yuriy Zhuravlyov, chief of the 
state test site of the SMF, told ITAR-TASS on Tuesday. 
  The launch of a ``Start'' communicaitons satellite 
demonstrated the Topol's unique resources in the peaceful uses 
of outer space. A heavy-duty communications satellite is to be 
launched soon, Zhuravlyov said. 
  Within the framework of Russian defence-industry conversion 
to civilian uses, experts consider the possibility of using the 
test site facilities for participation in commercial launchings, 
in which many countries show interest. If only initial funding, 
which will subsequently bring in revenue quickly, is essential 
for implementing conversion programmes. The allocation of funds 
for the needs of the state test site of the SMF has been now 
reduced to the minimum, Zhuravlyov lamented.

<F P=106> [Tamara Smirnova report: ``Buran's Creators Have Become </F>
Watchmen''] 
  [Excerpts] Only fanatics are left here now. Each morning 
they pass through the gate of their strict-regime enterprise and 
head along winding, echoing corridors to the shops and 
departments. It is hard to believe, looking at the shrouded 
instruments and the immobile bulks of machine tools, that quite 
recently everything here was humming, blinking, and vibrating -- 
in short, life was in full swing. People were working in three 
shifts, as though possessed, not requiring a rest. There was 
something fantastic in the hush-hush Science-and-Production 
Association of Automation and Instrument Building, commonly 
known as the ``Pilyugin firm.'' [passage omitted] 
  ``My shop manufactured 42 instruments for Buran,'' Boris 
Kurochkin, leader of precision mechanics, said. ``They control 
the craft from lift-off to landing. We take a month to `lick 
into shape' a single component. Whereas it is possible to train 
a fitter in a year or two, it takes 10-15 years to `perfect' an 
assembler-fitter in precision mechanics. The shop is unique. 
It produces unique instruments. For comparison: In the past 
there was one Faberge, but we have several. An attempt was made 
to adapt our Faberges to flow production. The result was 
lamentable: They all skedaddled. One is in roofing, another 
guards a warehouse, yet another serves in a store. The 
explanation for all this is simple -- no wages. In the 
capitalist world a specialist of such caliber has earnings at 
the level of a banker. Here he makes less than a cleaning 
woman. How is it possible to keep an ace of precision mechanics 
on 40,000 rubles? Talk with the workers yourself....'' 
  The shop where gyrostabilizer platforms are assembled and 
regulated. Here the need for cleanliness is as in an operating 
theater -- specks of dust are counted per liter of air. 
Assemblers have to wear special cambric clothes. Even the 
cloths that are technically necessary to wipe surfaces are made 
of the same very fine fabric. 
  But this was in the past. This is how it was. Today there 
are no components on the work table of team leader Zinaida 
Bakhtina -- just a ball of wool and knitting needles. 
  ``Have you taken up knitting to while away the time?'' 
  ``Yes, unfortunately. There are no orders. Out of 22 work 
days we are employed for three or four, God willing. 
Specialists have gone into commerce. I am not suited for it. 
My soul does not accept what is going on in the country. A 
complete breakdown....'' 
  Valentin Bykov, chief of the testing and diagnosis 
department, is still harsher in his views: 
  ``The democrats are lying when they say we squander money. 
Russian technology is exceptionally economical -- it bears no 
comparison with U.S. technology in terms of expenditure. Our 
engineer is more qualified and competent. He lets only a 
perfected article take off. In retrospect, we have had 
considerably fewer failures than the United States. But what 
are we forced to engage in now? Some businessmen came to us 
with their problem: They said they had bought equipment to 
counterfeit fashionable jeans but were afraid to install it on 
the second floor of a dry-cleaning establishment. Were the 
machine tools too heavy, and would the building suddenly 
collapse? We carried out their instructions and received money. 
But this is hack work! I am ashamed.'' 
  There is a lot of argument in the firm about conversion. In 
principle, the science-and-production association has never 
avoided tackling national economic tasks. It has been making 
medical equipment for more than a year. Designers are drawing 
up a system for the control of nuclear stations. They are 
racking their brains over a ground-effect machine, a huge 
transport craft capable of flying over the sea at low altitudes. 
Or take an instrument to predict earthquakes. Using complex 
algorithms and taking 21 indicators into account, the apparatus 
``paints'' a portrait of the elements and predicts shocks long 
before they happen. But there has never been a demand for the 
method. The country is not creditworthy. It cannot afford the 
latest technologies. There can be no question of scientific 
developments for the long term. 
  No, it will not be a joyous festival for the creators of 
automatic space equipment. Rendered lifeless by 
poverty-stricken funding, the sector is withering day by day. 
But it is not even the beggarly existence that oppresses its 
creators but the lack of demand for their very lofty intellect. 
The country is losing its priorities in the world. The 
beautiful Buran has already been set up in Gorkiy Park to amuse 
the crowd. What will it be turned into -- a sideshow or maybe a 
bar? A bird that was born to fly has had its wings clipped. Is 
not the same fate being prepared for Russia?

  [Text] Estonian parliament on Wednesday [6 April] decided 
to join five nuclear defence conventions obliging Estonia to 
inform international community immediately of any accidents. 
  Joining Vienna and Paris conventions entitles Estonia also 
to 
certain international rights and enables the country to apply 
for help in case of accidents, Tarand said. He also stressed 
that these conventions would be a basis for negotiations if 
anything should happen when Russia removes its nuclear training 
reactors from Paldiski, a former submarine training base for the 
Soviets.

Nursultan Nazarbayev called to ban nuclear tests on the planet 
by August 1995 when the 50th anniversray of nuclear strikes on 
Hiroshima and Nagasaki is to be marked. 
  Speaking to reporters he said his people, like the Japanese, 
had suffered from nuclear weapons. 
  ``If Japan faced an open nuclear attack, the (former) USSR 
used the weapons against Kazakhstan in peace time by conducting 
a total of 527 tests'' at the Semipalatinsk range, he said, 
adding that over 100 of them were ground and air explosions. 
  Nearly half a million of people of Kazakhstan were affected 
by the blasts, according to Nazarbayev.

  [Text] Moscow April 6 TASS -- Kazakhstan palnnes to build 
its second fast-neutron reactor. It will have the capacity of 
170 megawatt. The newspaper of the Kazakh business circles 
PANORAMA road the decision was taken on the strength of the 
results of the operation in Kazakhstan foir other 20 years of 
the worlds first BM-350 fast-neutron reactor, the only one in 
the CIS that is situated not far form the city of Shevchenko. 
[sentence as received] 
  ITAR-TASS learned form Rossenergoatom concern, Russian 
nuclear energy concern, that this statement is not keeping with 
reality. A more powerful reactor, BM-600, that is regarded as 
the most reliable and most safest has long been functioning at 
the Beloyarsk nuclear power station. The project for the 
instolation at the same station of a reactor of the next 
generation of BM-800, has actually been completed. A similar 
reactor is to be assembled in the Chelyabinsk area. 
  The construction of a new nuclear power palnt in Kazakhstan 
is a state project. Funds in the amount of 15 million tenge 
have already been allocated. But the problem of design work 
thaqt is done mostly by Russian and Kazakh specialists has not 
yet been resolved.

  [Text] Kiev, [no dateline as received] -- According to 
UNIAN, during U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry's visit to 
Ukraine, Ukraine's foreign affairs minister was given a 
memorandum that explained the official U.S. position with regard 
to cooperation with Ukraine in the missiles and space sphere. 
The document, in particular, concerns the obligatory terms 
under which the United States will consider it possible to 
establish mutual relations between the two states in the 
above-mentioned sphere: Ukraine's accession to the Missile 
Technology Control Regime (MTCR), to the Treaty on the 
Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and its refusal to 
manufacture offensive missile systems according to MTCR 
categories and classifications. Stressing that the United 
States ``will not assist and will not engage in trade if such 
activity contributes to the development of systems in the MTCR 
category and even space carrier rockets,'' the U.S. side noted 
Ukraine's interest to accede to the MTCR which has recently been 
established and is ready to assist Ukraine in this. 
  During William Perry's visit, a preliminary agreement was 
also reached about the fact that the U.S. side would, at the end 
of April, conduct further talks with Ukraine on these issues. 
On 12 April, during a news conference on the occasion of World 
Aviation and Cosmonaut Day, in reply to a question from a UNIAN 
correspondent whether such talks would take place, Deputy Prime 
Minister Valeriy Shmarov said that work in this area was 
underway. Ukraine in particular is ``attempting to convince the 
U.S. to be somewhat more considered in its attitudes to the 
realities that Ukraine finds itself in.'' The deputy prime 
minister stressed, in particular, that directness and 
unambiguity in the talks could lead to Ukraine losing its rocket 
technology and personnel, and it is not known where Ukraine 
would end up tomorrow. In Valeriy Shmarov's words, in the last 
few days, a letter was received by him from William Perry in 
which the ``U.S. side agreed with us on many things,'' and 
undoubtedly by the end of April there would be consultations and 
an exchange of views on this matter. 
  Based on the course of the talks and development of events 
in 
Ukraine itself, Valeriy Shmarov expressed certainty that Ukraine 
would accede to the MTCR and will become the founder of a new 
Cocom regime. According to information received by UNIAN on the 
same day, as a political step toward Ukraine's full membership 
of MTCR, the United States has proposed the conclusion of a 
bilateral U.S.-Ukrainian agreement with the aim of acceding to 
the main principles of MTCR.

  [Text] Bonn April 12 TASS -- Replying to a question as to 
who controls nuclear weapons deployed on Ukraine's territory, 
the republic's Defence Minister V. Radetskiy, who was addressing 
a press conference at the end of his visit to Germany, said that 
at present there is a bilateral control on such weapons. But it 
is ordered by Ukraine, as ``it is her property, the minister 
emphasised. A tripartite agreement on nuclear weapons was 
signed and a time-table of its withdrawal and destruction was 
approved this year in Moscow through the U.S. mediation. The 
Ukrainian side is consistently and sincerely observing'' this 
time-table, he said. According to him, until now two train 
loads of nuclear warheads have been despatched to Russia. In 
exchange Ukraine was supposed to receive fuel for its nuclear 
power plants from Russia. But Russia has not fulfilled this 
condition for the time being. ``That is why we have been 
obliged to suspend the time-table of withdrawal, to clarify it 
and make it binding on Russia to honour its commitments,'' he 
said.

  [Text] Kiev April 12 TASS -- Over 100 Ukrainian enterprises 
and institutes have taken the most active part in design and 
production of space machinery since the very beginning of the 
space industry, Ukrainian Vice-Premier Valeriy Shmarov told a 
news conference on the day of space exploration here today. 
  In his words, Ukraine has designed and produced over 400 
spacecraft, including a series of Cosmos satellites and almost 
all satellites of the Intercosmos series, as well as Tsyklon and 
Zenit rocket-boosters. He said the republic is able to develop 
the space industry. Last year Ukraine discussed a national 
space program, which is envisaged by the state budget. 
  President of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences academician 
Boris Paton told correspondents about the contribution of 
Ukrainian scientists in the space industry. Their developments 
focused on the technologies of metal welding, cutting and 
spraying in space, which is very important for long space 
flights. 
  The news conference was also attended by director of the 
Ukrainian Government's Space Agency Vladimir Gorbulin, director 
of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences' main astronomic 
observatory Yaroslav Yatskiv and chairman of the Space 
Federation Anatoliy Zavalishin.

  [Text] The European Union's [EU] TACIS [expansion unknown] 
``Nuclear Safety'' section provides for 54 million ECU earmarked 
for Ukraine's nuclear power industry over the 1991-1993 period. 
  However, until quite recently, the promised aid failed to 
assume a material quality, having been reduced to advisory 
services. 
  In the meantime, TACIS envisages not only intellectual, but 
technical aid by way of equipment and spare parts to be supplied 
to Ukrainian nukes. 
  As Vladimir Kolesnikov, chief specialist with the State 
Committee for nuclear power utilization, disclosed in an 
interview to UKRINFORM, by August this year three Ukrainian NPPs 
[nuclear power plants] (the South Ukrainian, Rivne and 
Zaporozhye nukes) will have been supplied German Fishner-made 
equipment worth $4.5 million. The equipment will improve the 
nuke's nuclear safety systems. 
  Besides, experts of Spain's Unessa and Belgium's Tractebelle 
are working at the South Ukrainian NPP. France's Electricite de 
France sent its experts on a similar mission to the Rivne 
nuclear power plant. Both teams' aim is to enhance the plants' 
safety standards. 
  Britain's AEA Technology is to start work aimed at eventual 
deactivation of the Chernobyl NPP's first, second and third 
power generating units. 
  The Ukrainian Ministry for Chernobyl is shortly to hold 
international tenders for a feasibility study, which involves 
the Shelter project for the Chernobyl NPP's ill-fated fourth 
reactor. The project's financing will be TACIS-covered to the 
tune of 3.5 million ECU.

<F P=106> [Natalya Filipchuk report: ``The Road Has Been Chosen. How </F>
To Cover It?'' --first paragraph published in boldface] 
  [Text] On 7 and 8 April, the conference ``The Road Toward 
a Nonnuclear Future; Ecological Problems of Ukraine's Nonnuclear 
Status and Human Psychology'' was held in Kiev in the Ukrainian 
Building for Economic and Scientific and Technological Knowledge. 
  The conference was largely sponsored by the Global and 
Regional Security Institute. The Ministry of Defense and the 
Ministry of Machine Building, Military-Industrial Complex, and 
Conversion organized it. Vice prime minister Valeriy Shmarov, 
who opened the conference, made the following comment upon the 
fact: ``The Ministry of Defense is interested in new scientific 
developments as a consumer. The Ministry of Machine Building -- 
as a contractor....'' Regarding scientists, they also tried to 
specify their role in the future nuclear conversion and asked 
how long the information (partially published in the foreign 
press) that is essential for their elaborations, will be 
withheld from them. To this Shmarov replied: Foreign 
journalists know how to work and the always obtain the necessary 
information. 
  However, this strictly practical question sounded very 
routine against the background of the issues that were discussed 
at the esteemed academic gathering. Namely: political and 
legal aspects of nuclear disarmament; the development of 
programs for destroying nuclear missile weapons and ecological 
and economic problems of their implementation; how to prevent 
the spread of radiation through subsurface water; the safety of 
the population residing near potentially hazardous facilities; 
the psychological syndrome that may afflict the liquidators of 
the accident at the Chernobyl Atomic Electric Power Plant in the 
future; social guarantees for servicemen from those military 
formations that will be disbanded. With regard to the latter, 
vice premier Shmarov said this: Seventy-five percent of all the 
capital allocated for the disarmament program (according to some 
tentative estimates, it is $2.5 billion -- N. F.), will, in all 
probability, be spent on the social protection of servicemen 
dismissed from military service, on finding new working places 
for unique specialists, and on reprofiling. Incidentally, on 
this particular issue, no common language was found with the 
U.S. side. 
  A considerable sum is also allocated for ensuring ecological 
aspects of nuclear disarmament. In the opinion of the majority 
of speakers, Ukraine must abandon the idea of accumulating 
nuclear waste on its territory and utilizing (which is extremely 
expensive) the radioactive fuel in the hope to later emerge onto 
the international market with newly produced uranium, something 
upon which some specialists insist. All the more so since this 
will be difficult to accomplish in the near future. In the next 
15 years, Russia will supply uranium to the United States (500 
tonnes, in accordance with an agreement). The conference, which 
was prepared at the highest level and at which interesting and, 
the main thing, realistic reports were delivered, proved that 
Ukraine has a chance to cover that road toward a nonnuclear 
future, but there will be many problems and shocks on that road.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: ``Defense Programming Law Under </F>
Development''] 
  [Text] Yesterday, Francois Mitterrand chaired a Defense 
Council meeting on the 1995-2000 military programming law, which 
will then be adopted by the Council of Ministers before its 
submission to the spring session of Parliament. In line with 
the White Paper on Defense, the law will give precedence to 
equipment currently being manufactured as opposed to research 
and development programs (development of prototypes). According 
to a senior defense official, ``delaying large armament programs 
some more was quite a tempting option,'' but ``we preferred to 
give priority to the deployment of modern equipment in the Armed 
Forces.'' Accordingly, no further delays are expected for 
programs relating to the Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier, 
Rafale fighter aircraft, ``Triomphant''-type missile-launching 
nuclear submarines (SNLE), and Helios observation satellites. 
Orders for Leclerc tanks should keep coming in. Nevertheless, 
brand new programs will be postponed, including those concerning 
the NH-90 transport helicopter and the M5 ballistic nuclear 
missile, for which a consensus had to be found between the prime 
minister and the president of the Republic. The deployment of 
M5 missiles in SNLE submarines, a pet project of the president, 
will probably be postponed from 2005 to 2010. In exchange, the 
prime minister has reportedly agreed to commission studies on a 
land-based version of the M4/M45 missiles, which would replace 
the S3 ground- to-ground missiles installed in the Albion 
platform in 2005.

  [Text] On Friday, [15 April], the Triomphant, the first of 
France's second-generation missile-launching nuclear submarines, 
made its maiden voyage from the naval port of Cherbourg. It 
will undergo a period of testing before entering into active 
service in 1997. During the next few days, the 13,000-tonne 
vessel will make its first static submersion off Cherbourg, and 
it is scheduled to arrive in Brest within two weeks. According 
to its manufacturers, it is ``the most silent submarine in the 
world.''

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: ``SEP: Structural Qualification </F>
Testing of the Solid Fuel Engine of the Ariane 5''] 
  [Text] A key phase was passed on 11 February 1994 in the 
development of the MPS (Solid Propergol Motor), the solid fuel 
power plant of the Ariane 5. CNES [National Center of Spcae 
Studies] has commissioned Europropulsion (a subsidiary of SEP 
[European Propulsion Company] France and BPD [expansion unknown] 
Italy) with the project. Working out of the MPA University of 
Stuttgart, Man Technologie of Germany, in charge of developing 
the body of the engine, submitted the metal structure of the 
engine (the most powerful powder burning engine ever built in 
Europe) to structural qualification testing at limit internal 
and external loads up to rupture point. Preparation of the 
model and procedures had been handled by Man Technologie and 
Andritz (Austria) under prime contractorship of Societe 
Europeenne de Propulsion (Division Propulsion a Poudre et 
Composites du Haillan [Haillan Powder and Composite Propulsion 
Division]). The one-month test period illustrated the ability 
of the motor body to withstand, with the required margins, all 
stress generated on the ground and in flight by the MPS and 
Ariane 5 space rocket. Rupture occurred under a pressure of 92 
bars (1.4 times normal engine operating pressure) in accordance 
with the anticipated scenario. 
  For the third fire-up test of the MPS now being prepared at 
Kourou, engine attachment to structure will be representative of 
flight configuration. The qualification testing of 11 February 
1994 constitutes the green light of Europropulsion to continue 
this preparation work. The Ariane 5 is a program of the 
European Space Agency which has commissioned CNES with technical 
and financial management.

<F P=106> [``rmc''-signed report: ``BDI For Relaxing Arms Exports''] </F>
  [Text] Bonn -- The Federation of German Industries (BDI) 
has demanded a relaxation of the strict German arms export 
regulations. The demand was precipitated by the government's new 
white book on security policy and Bundeswehr matters that 
declares the existence of a ``modern, competitive and efficient 
arms industry to be a part of security precautions.'' The BDI 
tells Bonn that this is ``not possible at zero cost and without 
political compromise within the alliance in adjusting arms 
regulations.'' The BDI refers to the uncompromising position of 
some important European partner countries that have refused to 
follow the strict German regulations. The German arms industry 
will only regain its international competitiveness if the 
Federal Government abolishes ``the marked disadvantage that 
German companies are experiencing.''

<F P=106> [Ole Mathismoen report: ``Norway Cannot Give Much Help to </F>
the Kola''] 
  [Text] Russia cannot afford nuclear safety in the northern 
regions. And Norway cannot afford to give very much help. 
  This was Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore Godal's conclusion 
yesterday when he yesterday put before the Storting a report on 
nuclear safety and chemical weapons in the regions close to 
northern Norway. 
  The Cold War has been succeeded by major environmental 
challenges. In areas very close to Norway there are enormous 
temporary dumps of nuclear waste, several dozen abandoned 
nuclear submarines, an old and unsafe nuclear power station, and 
large quantities of nuclear arms. 
  ``It goes without saying that Russia has an indepednent 
responsibility for safety at nuclear installations and for 
solving the problems of waste. But neither Russia nor the other 
states of Eastern Europe are able to give this the highest 
priority. Such enormous resources are needed to sort all this 
out that the only possibility is broad international 
cooperation,'' the foreign minister said. He mentioned NATO, 
the EU [European Union], the European Bank for Reconstruction 
and Development, and the North Atlantic Cooperation Council as 
possible forums for such cooperation. 
  The foreign minister stressed strongly that Norway can only 
be involved in a small way in paying the bill for the biggest 
nuclear cleanup operation ever. Hitherto Norway has spent only 
36 million kroner in aid for the East. In the past it has been 
estimated that it will cost somewhere in the order of $150 
billion to clean up the nuclear chaos on the Kola Peninsula. 
  ``But Norway is assuming a lobbying role to get nuclear 
safety in northwestern Russia onto the international agenda,'' 
Godal said. But who will actually pay the bill, he was asked. 
``Russia and Europe's taxpayers will have to foot the bill,'' 
he said. 
  Asked whether Norway has plans for further short-term 
assistance for the Kola region in the absence of a larger-scale 
international aid operation, he replied: ``We are keeping the 
situation under constant observation, but we have no plans for 
measures at present. These are sensitive issues on which we 
naturally want to work closely with the Russian authorities.'' 
  In the course of last winter there were several minor 
accidents at the nuclear power station on the Kola Peninsula, 
further nuclear submarines were mothballed, and the situation 
regarding several of the temporary waste dumps -- such as the 
dump ship Lepse, for example -- deteriorated dramatically. In 
the light of this the foreign minister was asked if Finnmark is 
today facing a real nuclear threat: 
  ``The potential dangers are considerable. But the situation 
is not acute,'' Bjorn Tore Godal said. 
  Yesterday the foreign minister was able to announce that the 
Russian authorities with the foreign minister at their head have 
given permission for a third Norwegian-Russian research 
expedition to former nuclear waste dumping sites in the Kara 
Sea. Now the way is clear for an expedition to the formerly 
forbidden Ambrosimov Bay on Novaya Zemlya where there is reason 
to believe that considerable quantities of solid nuclear waste 
has been dumped. 
  The foreign minister's report to the Storting is the first 
public document on nuclear safety in the Kola region. Hitherto 
it has been the Bellona Environmental Foundation which, since 
the fall of the Iron Curtain, has constantly been digging up new 
information about the piles of radioactive waste the Cold War is 
leaving behind in the northern regions.
