  [Text] Hiroshima, April 13 KYODO -- The head of the UN 
nuclear monitoring agency, Hans Blix, on Wednesday [13 April] 
urged the early completion of nuclear safeguards inspections in 
North Korea that a team of inspectors was prevented from 
concluding last month. 
  Blix, director general of the Vienna-based International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), stressed that it is necessary to 
check a radio chemical laboratory in the Yongbyon nuclear power 
complex about 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang and a 
5,000-kilowatt experimental reactor to complete the inspections. 
  Blix is in Hiroshima for the annual meeting of the Japan 
Atomic Industrial Forum, which this year is focusing on the 
theme of eliminating nuclear weapons worldwide and promoting the 
peaceful uses of atomic energy. 
  IAEA inspectors were allowed in North Korea last month for 
their first look at North Korean nuclear facilities in more than 
a year in an effort to determine if radioactive materials had 
been diverted to military purposes. 
  Blix told reporters Wednesday that a check of the radio 
chemical laboratory was necessary to determine if it had been 
used since February 1993. 
  Blix also said that North Korea is nearing completion on 
construction of a second plutonium production line, which could 
double the North Korean output of the material needed in 
building an atomic bomb.

  [Text] Hans Blix, International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
director-general, stressed that an additional inspection of the 
radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon, which North Korea has been 
refusing, is urgent, and that IAEA inspectors should be present 
at the experimental reactor that has an output of 5,000 kw when 
its fuel is replaced. 
  Director-general Blix, now visiting Japan, held a news 
conference on 13 April and said that as the inspection of the 
radiochemical laboratory, which is believed to be a facility for 
extraction of plutonium, was not carried out, it cannot be 
determined if this facility has been used since February 1993. 
He pointed out that it will become a very serious problem if 
this situation continues for a long time. 
  Director-general Blix revealed that the project for building 
a second production line in the radiochemical laboratory is 
presently under way, and that this project will be completed 
before long. 
  Director-general Blix stressed that North Korea claimed that 
the fuel was loaded in the experimental reactor for the first 
time and that plutonium was not extracted from the fuel used in 
this reactor. An on-the-spot investigation of the reactor by the 
inspectors is necessary to verify this claim. 
  Director-general Blix pointed out that in the event that 
North Korea continues refusing comprehensive inspection of its 
nuclear facilities, there is the possibility that the IAEA will 
demand that the UN Security Council take stronger steps and 
measures.

  [Text] Vienna, April 13 KYODO -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) has asked North Korea to accept inspections 
on a key atomic site that Pyongyang barred the agency from 
checking last month, an agency spokesman said Wednesday [13 
April]. 
  The Vienna-based UN nuclear watchdog, however, has not 
received any response from the country so far, the spokesman 
said. 
  Besides additional inspections on the radiochemical 
laboratory in the Yongbyong nuclear complex, north of the 
capital, the IAEA has also demanded North Korea allow the agency 
to change film and batteries of surveillance cameras installed 
at nuclear facilities there, the spokesman said. 
  Last month, a six-member IAEA team conducted inspections on 
North Korea's seven-declared nuclear sites to check that no 
radioactive material had been diverted from the plants for 
military purposes. 
  But Pyongyang refused the team access to the laboratory, 
thus 
prompting the agency to refer the issue to the UN Security 
Council. 
  The council issued a nonbinding presidential statement March 
31 urging North Korea to grant full inspections on its nuclear 
facilities. 
  The communist country has denied it is developing a nuclear 
arsenal and warned that a war could break out on the Korean 
peninsula if it was pressed too hard on the matter.

  [Text] New York, April 20 KYODO -- North Korea has 
indicated it is willing to permit further inspections of its 
nuclear facilities if the United States simultaneously announces 
the postponement of joint military exercises with South Korea 
and reopens a third round of high-level talks with Pyongyang. 
  A special envoy of North Korean President Kim Il-song 
earlier 
this month also reportedly told Indonesian President Suharto 
that North Korea also wants a postponement to the deployment of 
U.S. patriot antimissile batteries in South Korea. 
  Pyongyang's conditions for resuming inspections of its 
nuclear facilities were revealed in a copy of an April 7 letter 
from Suharto, head of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), to UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali made public Wednesday. 
  In the letter, Suharto said North Korean Vice Foreign 
Minister Kim Chang-kyu told him Pyongyang is willing to permit 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections but 
emphasized the conditions that should be applied simultaneously. 
  Suharto said the envoy mentioned the ``postponement'' of the 
Team Spirit military exercises and the deployment of the Patriot 
missiles, but dispatches from Pyongyang in the past have firmly 
demanded the suspension of the exercises and a halt to the 
missile deployment. 
  Suharto suggested to Butrus-Ghali that North Korea is 
seeking 
the simultaneous commencement of all the steps to avoid any 
impression that it has capitulated to the demands of the IAEA, 
the U.S. and others. 
  Suharto also told North Korea that only way to resolve the 
nuclear issue peacefully would appear to be through ``a 
comprehensive and thorough implementation of inspections by the 
IAEA.'' 
  Suharto said, ``We conveyed to (North Korea) our considered 
view that it was crucial for the cause of peace in the region 
that it resolve the issue of nuclear inspection with the IAEA 
and that (North Korea's) withdrawal from the (Nuclear) 
Nonproliferation Treaty would only intensify suspicion of its 
nuclear intentions.''

  [Text] Vienna, April 20 KYODO -- North Korea has replied 
positively to an IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] 
request for inspections of a nuclear facility that Pyongyang 
barred the agency from checking last month, an agency spokesman 
said Wednesday [20 April]. 
  The spokesman said the Vienna-based International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) received a positive response from North 
Korea to the UN request and that the agency will decide how to 
deal with the issue within a few days. 
  The North appears to have agreed to inspections on a part of 
the key atomic site with certain conditions, instead of full 
inspection as the IAEA has demanded, diplomatic sources said. 
  The IAEA sent a letter to the North on April 8 urging 
Pyongyang to allow the agency to make additional inspections at 
the radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon, north of the capital. 
  The IAEA also asked North Korea to allow the agency to 
change 
film and batteries of surveillance cameras installed at all the 
declared nuclear facilities. 
  IAEA inspectors went to North Korea in early March but were 
denied access to the radiochemical laboratory. The agency said 
the tests it wanted to carry out at the laboratory were 
necessary to determine whether Pyongyang has diverted nuclear 
materials. 
  The agency on March 22 referred the matter to the UN 
Security 
Council, which issued a presidential statement March 31 urging 
the North to allow the IAEA to complete the inspections. 
  North Korea has denied it is developing a nuclear arsenal 
and 
warned a war could break out on the Korean peninsula if it was 
pressed too hard on the matter.

  [Text] Seoul, April 21 KYODO -- North Korea has told the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that it will allow 
inspectors to monitor the exchange of fuel rods at its 
5,000-kilowatt nuclear reactor at the Yongbyon nuclear site, the 
Korean Broadcasting System (KBS) reported Thursday [21 April]. 
  Pyongyang, in a telegram sent Wednesday to the UN nuclear 
watchdog, said it will exchange the fuel rods at the reactor 
soon and permit IAEA inspectors to monitor the process, 
according to KBS. 
  North Korea, however, stopped short of mentioning the 
possibility of complying with nuclear safeguard obligations by 
accepting additional inspections of its nuclear installations by 
the IAEA, KBS said. 
  The IAEA is reportedly expected to convey its position on 
the 
North Korean offer at an early date, the report said. 
  KBS said that the North Korean proposal seems to aim at 
breaking the nuclear impasse by making a counterproposal at a 
time when they are obligated to allow additional international 
inspections of the radiochemical laboratory. 
  U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry told a press conference 
Thursday that North Korea is close to removing the spent fuel 
from the 5,000-kilowatt nuclear reactor, enabling it to extract 
enough plutonium to make four or five nuclear bombs. 
  Perry pointed to the need to monitor the removal of the 
fuel, 
saying, ``We believe it is critical that this operation is 
supervised by the International Atomic Energy Agency.'' 
  A six-member IAEA inspection team went to North Korea in 
early March but was denied access to the radiochemical 
laboratory. The agency said the tests it wanted to carry out at 
the laboratory were necessary to determine whether Pyongyang has 
diverted nuclear materials. 
  The IAEA referred the matter on March 22 to the UN Security 
Council, which issued a presidential statement on March 31 
urging North Korea to allow the nuclear watchdog to complete the 
inspections. 
  North Korea denies western assertions that it is developing 
a 
nuclear arsenal, but refuses to allow international inspectors 
into some of its nuclear facilities.

  [Text] In his interview with the Japanese newspaper YOMIURI 
SHIMBUN, Hans Blix, director-general of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA], confirmed that North Korea is now 
constructing another nuclear reprocessing facility within the 
complex of nuclear facilities in Yongbyon. 
  In an interview with the paper, Director-General Hans Blix, 
who is now staying in Japan, said that he could not know when 
the facility would be completed, but when it is built, North 
Korea's capacity of producing plutonium -- which will be used 
for a nuclear weapons program -- would double. 
  Director-General Blix stressed that the IAEA needs to 
inspect 
two nuclear facilities which North Korea did not report to the 
IAEA before in addition to its overall inspection [chonmyon 
sachal] of the complex of nuclear facilities in Yongbyon.

  [Text] North Korea was learnt to have recently proposed to 
the United States that they resume unofficial working-level 
contacts to discuss means for a breakthrough in the nuclear 
issue. This comes at a time when the United States has beefed 
up firm actions against North Korea's unwillingness to accept 
nuclear inspections, through consecutive contacts with the ROK, 
China, and Japan. The talks, however, are unlikely to be 
realized by next week since U.S. Defense Secretary Perry and 
Robert Gallucci, the special envoy on the North Korean nuclear 
issue, will be visiting the ROK, China, and Japan. North Korea 
also does not usually make moves before or after Kim Il- song's 
birthday on 15 April. 
  A high-level U.S. source on 13 April assessed that North 
Korea proposed the contact to determine the true intentions of 
the United States since the United States and the ROK have taken 
active moves with China, Japan, and Russia aimed at 
strengthening the international cooperative system following the 
adoption of the UN Security Council President's statement 
calling on North Korea to accept inspections. North Korea 
apparently hopes to resume contacts in order to open a dialogue 
channel with the United States prior to the next phase of action 
the UN Security Council may pursue following the early May 
deadline in the Council President's statement, the source added.

<F P=106> [``Japan's Nuclear Armament has Reached Danger Line -- White </F>
Paper of DPRK Foreign Ministry'' -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 11 (KCNA) -- The Foreign Ministry 
of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea published a white 
paper on Monday [11 April] exposing Japan's nuclear armament 
which has reached the danger line. 
  ``The `Monju,' the first fast breeder reactor of Japan, was 
put into normal operation on April 5 in defiance of the bitter 
denunciation and concern worldwide. This means a dangerous step 
in Japan's nuclear armament,'' the white paper says. 
  ``Japan's nuclear armament which is being promoted on the 
danger line,'' it notes, ``is an open challenge to the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and the desire of 
mankind to build a nuclear- free world. This is a question of 
which the international community must take a serious view.'' 
  Follows a summary of the white paper: 
  1. Japan has sought its nuclear armament from long ago. 
  Its ambition for nuclear armament has been fully revealed in 
remarks of successive Japanese authorities and official 
documents. 
  Article 9 of the ``Constitution of the State of Japan'' 
(Peace Constitution) which was adopted in November 1946 under 
the strong internal and external demand and pressure says: ``The 
Japanese people, sincerely aspiring after international peace 
based on justice and order, shall abandon for good and all war, 
armed threat and armed action through the invocation of state 
power as a means of resolving international disputes. To this 
end, they shall not possess the Army, the Navy, the Airforce and 
other war potential and not recognize the right of belligerency 
of the state.'' 
  The successive Japanese authorities, however, urged by the 
desire to turn the country into a military power, a nuclear 
power, have tried by hook or by crook to justify their nuclear 
armament scheme from the 1950s, totally denying or arbitrarily 
interpreting the Constitution itself. 
  On May 7, 1957, the prime minister of Japan, Nobusuke Kishi, 
said at the Budget Committee of the House of Councillors: ``If 
anyone simply mention the nuclear weapon, all people say it 
contravenes the Constitution. But such interpretation of the 
Constitution is wrong. ... [ellipses as received] Without 
looking into the future development, we cannot say uniformly 
that it is wrong to mention any kind of nuclear weapon.'' 
(Japanese book ``Japan's Nuclear Arming Which Has Reached This 
Stage,'' 1975) 
  The Japanese authorities' wild design for nuclear armament 
was dealt a hard blow by the movement for the ban on atomic and 
hydrogen bombs which had gained strength within and without 
Japan from the 1950s. This compelled the Japanese Prime 
Minister Eisaku Sato, quite upset, to announce at the Diet in 
1968 the ``three nonnuclear principles'' -- not to manufacture, 
possess and introduce any nuclear weapon. 
  For this announcement, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. 
  On June 2, 1969, however, he said at a plenary session of 
the 
House of Representatives that ``the `three nonnuclear 
principles' can be altered any time when the policy is changed 
or the cabinet is replaced by another'' (the above-mentioned 
book), making it plain that these principles advocated by him 
were a rhetoric to deceive public opinion at home and abroad. 
  On March 2, 1978, the Japanese Foreign Minister, Sunao 
Sonoda, stated at the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of 
Representatives that ``it is not that Japan cannot possess 
nuclear weapons, restricted by the provision of the Constitution 
itself'' (the JIJI press, March 2, 1978). And, at the Budget 
Committee of the House of Councillors on March 15, 1984, the 
Japanese Prime Minister, Yasuhiro Nakasone, answering an 
interpellation by a Komei Dietman, said that ``Japan may possess 
atomic power, if it is for defence.'' (Japanese ASAHI SHIMBUN, 
March 16, 1984). 
  Entering the 1990s, the Japanese authorities, vociferating 
about the changed international situation, have openly revealed 
their scheme to step up their nuclear armament at the final 
stage. 
  Notably, Japan intends to work out within this year 
``General 
Principles of the Defence Programme Reflecting the End of the 
Cold War and Domestic Situation,'' holding forth upon the need 
to build up ``defence capabilities to promptly and accurately 
cope with the possible dangerous events'' in neighbouring 
countries such as ``nuclear suspicion'' and ``missile 
development'' by the DPRK. 
  Japan openly manifested its design to arm itself with 
nuclear 
weapons even on UN rostrums. 
  Till the first half of the 1960s, the Japanese Government, 
though reluctantly, voted for resolutions on the prohibition of 
the use of nuclear weapons and ban on nuclear weapons at the UN 
General Assembly. From the latter half of the decade, however, 
it voted against or abstained from voting on such resolutions, 
thus disclosing its intention to become a military power, a 
nuclear power, at any cost by making haste with nuclear 
development in full scale and producing and stockpiling nuclear 
weapons. Explaining the reason why they voted against or 
abstained from voting on the resolutions, they said ``total ban 
on the use of nuclear weapons is incompatible with nuclear 
deterrent'' and it ``might destroy the nuclear equilibrium.'' 
But, in actuality, this was an open and undisguised revelation 
on the UN rostrums of Japan's ulterior intention to produce and 
possess nuclear weapons and pave the way for overseas aggression 
so that they could use them in case of emergency. 
  Thus Japan has overtly and covertly manoeuvred ever since 
the 
1950s to adopt its nuclear armament as a policy and legalize it 
under the veil of ``three nonnuclear principles,'' opposing and 
distorting the ``Peace Constitution.'' 
  2. Japan's nuclear armament has reached the danger line. 
  The nuclear policy of Japan is being promoted in two 
directions, that is, solving the problem of power by nuclear 
energy and, at the same time, securing a large quantity of 
plutonium for the manufacture of nuclear weapons by itself to 
proceed with nuclear armament any moment. 
  In July 1966, the first nuclear power station went into 
operation in Japan. Since then the Japanese Government has 
considered the construction of nuclear power stations as an 
important state policy for solving the problem of energy. 
  According to the director of the high centre of Social 
Sciences of France, in 1976, the United States made such special 
concessions to Japan as approving its civilian nuclear 
development and promising it a continued supply of 
highly-enriched uranium under a far looser inspection system 
than other allies in reward for its ratification of the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty. As a result, Japan has been able to 
freely reprocess nuclear materials and develop advanced 
technologies for its rearmament. (Radio France Culture, 
November 5, 1993). 
  Japan has already installed sufficient nuclear facilities 
for 
its nuclear arming. 
  At the beginning, the United States, with a view to 
controlling the nuclear development by Japan, sold to it only 
light water reactors feeding on U.S.-made enriched uranium and 
prohibited it from developing atomic reactors of other types. 
Under this condition, Japan developed a new-type converter 
mainly feeding on Canadian natural uranium with an investment of 
404 million dollars. Situated in Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture, this 
reactor has been in a full-scale operation since 1979. 
(Japanese book ``Imidas'' 1992). In this way, Japan has gained 
relative independence in nuclear development, freeing itself 
from the control of the United States. 
  According to the ``White Paper on Nuclear Energy'' published 
by the Japanese Government in 1993, Japan has 16 nuclear power 
stations with 46 reactors in operation, which are capable of 
producing 37.36 million kw. This means that Japan ranks third 
in the world after the United States and France in the total 
designed capacity of nuclear facilities. 
  1993 alone witnessed the commissioning of 12 new reactors, 
and 9 units of facilities with a total capacity of 8.9 million 
kw are under construction. In all this, Japan annually uses 
some 3,000 tons of nuclear materials. 
  Japan may become a dangerous nuclear power with its capacity 
of nuclear weapon production largely expanded when 10 nuclear 
power stations, one fast breeder reactor, one uranium enriching 
plant, one radioactive waste storage (low standard) which are 
now under construction and four nuclear power stations including 
one new-type converter, one reprocessing plant and one 
radioactive waste storage (high standard) now projected are put 
into operation (Japanese book ``Imidas,'' 1992). 
  Japan has secured enough nuclear materials to arm itself 
with 
nuclear weapons. 
  Japan set itself a long-range goal of depending upon fast 
breeder reactors feeding on plutonium in the 1950s when it 
started the development of atomic energy and it has produced and 
stockpiled a large quantity of nuclear materials by operating 
reprocessing plants from the middle of the 1970s. 
  Japan has stockpiled 26 tons of plutonium which far 
surpasses 
the quantity needed for the peaceful purpose. It is enough to 
manufacture more than 3,000 atomic bombs of Nagasaki type. 
(Japanese magazine ``BUNGEI SHUNJU,'' June 1992). 
  Japan buckled down to the implementation of its ``great 
programme for the use of plutonium'' at the beginning of 1992. 
  In the period from 1975 to 1992, it brought in one ton of 
plutonium from Britain in top secrecy and reportedly shipped in 
1.5 tons of plutonium from France in 1993. 
  What offers particular problem is that Japan plans to secure 
about 100 tons of plutonium by the year 2010, though the amount 
of plutonium actually needed by Japan is estimated at 85 tons. 
(KYODO News Service, October 5, 1992). This means that, by 
2010, Japan will store 15 more tons of plutonium than needed for 
the peaceful purpose, which is enough to manufacture some 2,000 
nuclear bombs. Therefore, Japan's claim that it has stockpiled 
``an appropriate amount of plutonium for economic development'' 
can never be justified. 
  A latest report on the nonproliferation of nuclear materials 
including plutonium, which an influential advisory agency worked 
out, entrusted by the U.S. Defence Department, expressed deep 
concern over Japan's nuclear armament and said Japan should be 
urged to fundamentally reexamine its nuclear policy, demanding a 
stop to the project of the demonstration reactor for a fast 
breeder reactor. 
  Urging Japan to reduce the scale of the construction of 
nuclear power stations with 12 reactors feeding on plutonium 
planned to be completed by the year 2005 (to two) and stop the 
construction of a new-type demonstration reactor following the 
``Monju'' and the construction of the reprocessing plant no. 2 
in Rokashomura, Aomori Prefecture, the report said potential 
fear of Japan's nuclear arming is sprouting within the U.S. 
Government. (Japanese MAINICHI SHIMBUN, November 10, 1993). 
  Voice of America on April 6,1994 said that the commissioning 
of a fast breeder reactor in Japan is arousing serious 
apprehensions and uneasiness in the European countries and the 
United States, to say nothing of its neighbouring nations, and 
it is foreseen that it would give a greater shock to the acute 
nuclear issue. This indicates that Japan might become one of 
the largest nuclear state in the near future, the radio added. 
  Japan is possessed of modern means of nuclear delivery. 
  The socalled ``Self-Reliant Defence Programme'' worked out 
by 
the Japanese Defence Agency in 1969 makes it plain that Japan 
would continue to develop and possess domestic nuclear weapons 
and ballistic missiles for their delivery. (Japanese ASAHI 
EVENING NEWS, June 27, 1969). 
  Japan's system of launching nuclear warheads was established 
already during the ``Third Program of Readjustment of the 
Defence Capacities'' (1967-1971). The Japanese Defence Agency 
completed the ``domestic production'' of cruise missiles in 1985 
in cooperation with the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and other 
companies. This cruise missile is a sophisticated guided 
missile which is available for the delivery of nuclear warheads 
and conventional warheads. 
  The Japanese ``Self-Defense Forces'' successfully carried 
out 
a test launching of a Japanese ground-to-warship missile (SSM-1) 
at the Pacific Missile Centre of the U.S. Navy in California in 
the summer of 1987. (the Japanese magazine ``SEKAI SEIJI.'' 
First semimonthly number of January 1990). 
  As of December 1991, Japan was possessed of 393 155-mm 
howitzers and 132 203.2-mm howitzers which can fire nuclear 
warheads. The number of its nuclear-capable planes is on the 
steady increase. 
  It had secured 145 new-type fighter-bombers ``F-15'' with an 
action radius of 1,052 km by 1991. It plans to increase its 
number to 180- 200 by the end of 1994. 
  It developed a new fighter-bomber ``FSX'' by remodeling the 
``F-16'' in 1993 and plans to introduce 130 of it by the year 
2000. 
  On February 4, 1994, Japan successfully launched a new 
``H2''-type rocket no. 1 developed entirely by its independent 
technology at the cosmodrome in Tanegashima, Kagoshima 
Prefecture. This rocket is tantamount to 50 metres in length 
and 260 tons in weight and can be converted easily for a 
military purpose. 
  The former director of the Atomic Energy Research Centre of 
Rikkyo University, Japan, stated that Japan has been able to 
make substantial material and technological preparations for 
manufacturing high-performance nuclear weapons in one month or 
so. More than 150 companies and over 3,300 factories are 
involved in the manufacture of nuclear warheads in Japan. In 
recent years, investments in this domain have sharply increased 
to jump from 1.73 million dollars in 1954 to 360 million dollars 
in 1991. (the Indian paper WORUM, March 11, 1994). 
  In actuality, Japan has built perfect material and 
technological foundations for the manufacture of nuclear 
weapons. Concern over Japan's nuclear armament is expressed by 
government authorities of Western countries including the United 
States. 
  If Japan is armed with nuclear weapons, it will pose the 
most 
serious and grave threat to the Korean peninsula and, 
furthermore, it will harass peace and security of Asia and the 
rest of the world. 
  With Japan's nuclear armament reaching the danger line, the 
danger of the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula being 
made meaningless is increasing. 
  Though Japan is promoting its nuclear armament on the danger 
line, the United States and other Western countries are turning 
blind eyes to this and carrying on a hysteric pressure campaign 
over the fictitious ``suspected nuclear development'' by the 
DPRK. This policy of double standard, in fact, eggs Japan on to 
nuclear armament. 
  The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
expresses the belief that the governments, parliaments, 
political parties and organisations of all the anti-nuke and 
nonnuclear states and international organisations and 
peaceloving people of the world will heighten vigilance against 
the dangerous moves of the Japanese authorities for nuclear 
armament and make positive contributions to the peace and 
security of Asia and the world by checking and frustrating them.

<F P=106> [``DPRK Foreign Ministry Warns the U.S. and IAEA Not To </F>
Resort To Pressure''--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 20 (KCNA) -- The Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in 
a memorandum today warns that if the United States and the 
secretariat of the International Atomic Energy Agency continue 
to resort to the unreasonable pressure campaign, the nuclear 
issue will remain unresolved indefinitely and it will only 
entail irretrievable consequences jeopardizing peace and 
security in Asia and the rest of the world. 
  The memorandum was published in connection with the fact 
that 
the United States and its satellite forces have resorted to the 
one-track course of pressure by enjoining fullscope inspections 
on the DPRK with disregard to the unique status of the DPRK 
which has temporarily suspended the effectuation of its declared 
withdrawal from the treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear 
Weapons (NPT). It throws a revealing light on the major 
obstacles to the solution of the nuclear issue and the truth 
behind them. 
  It says that although the United States and the secretariat 
of the IAEA recognized the DPRK's unique status following the 
temporary suspension of the effectuation of its announced 
withdrawal from the NPT, they are still talking about the 
``noncompliance with the safeguards agreement'' and ``full 
inspection.'' ``Such action clearly shows that they are using 
the safeguards agreement as a leverage for attaining their 
dishonest political objectives of strangling the DPRK's 
system,'' it notes. 
  Pointing out that the inspection activities that befit the 
DPRK's current unique status are only the inspection activities 
necessary for maintaining the continuity of safeguards, it 
declares: ``How long the DPRK's unique status will last depends 
entirely on when the United States renounces its nuclear threat 
against the DPRK and its policy of antagonizing and strangling 
it and, at the same time, when the agency redresses its 
partiality and injustice to the DPRK.'' 
  The memorandum further says: 
  ``The DPRK's unique status would naturally terminate if 
further round of DPRK-USA talks take place and the simultaneous 
action steps are carried into practice with a view to resolving 
the nuclear issue once and for all on the principle of the 
proposed package solution.'' 
  It notes that the IAEA secretariat and the United Nations 
Security Council, both in support of the U.S. policy of 
antagonising and strangling the DPRK, are openly applying their 
extremely discriminatory and prejudiced double standards to the 
DPRK's ``nuclear issue.'' 
  ``Unless the United States renounces its policy of hostility 
and nuclear threat campaign against the DPRK and unless the IAEA 
secretariat redresses its partiality and injustice to the DPRK, 
the DPRK's reinstatement in the treaty will remain absolutely 
inconceivable and, therefore, full implementation of the 
safeguards agreement will have no sense of word at the present 
stage,'' states the memorandum, and continues: 
  ``The DPRK sincerely wants the nuclear issue to be resolved 
impartially. To this end, the United States and the IAEA 
secretariat must clearly realise their responsibility for the 
origination of the nuclear issue and for its current complexity, 
stop resorting to the unreasonable and contradictory method of 
double standards and pressure, and must seek unprejudiced and 
substantial ways to resolve the nuclear issue once and for all.''

  [Excerpts] Cairo, 8 Apr (MENA) -- Chinese Ambassador in 
Cairo Yang Fuchang has said his country's government and people 
welcome President Husni Mubarak's forthcoming visit to Beijing. 
In an interview with MENA, he said President Mubarak is an old 
friend of China and that this visit will be his sixth trip to 
China. He noted that every time he visits China, President 
Mubarak gives new momentum to the good traditional bilateral 
relations. [passage omitted] 
  The Chinese ambassador stressed the need to honor Security 
Council Resolutions 242 and 338 on the Middle East and hoped 
that the Jerusalem issue will be resolved through negotiations. 
  On lifting the economic sanctions on Iraq, he explained that 
they were imposed under particular circumstances but that if we 
now look at the situation objectively, we will find that Iraq 
has responded to the Council's recent resolutions. So, he said, 
sanctions on the humanitarian level must be lifted, primarily to 
secure food and medicine for the Iraqi people and, as the 
implementation of the resolutions continues, other sanctions can 
be lifted, something that is currently being discussed at the 
Security Council. 
  On China's arms sales to Pakistan, he said the purchase and 
sale of arms is something normal in relations between states. 
The United States, France, and other big powers also sell arms. 
He added: Our selling arms to Pakistan does not mean we 
support one party at the expense of another. And it does not 
mean there is intervention in other countries' internal affairs, 
so the situation in the region is not aggravated. 
  Commenting on the Korean issue, the Chinese ambassador said 
his country believes that the best way to solve the problem is 
through negotiations between the United States and Korea, 
between Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency, and 
between the two Koreas. He said China stresses that the Korean 
Peninsula should be free of nuclear weapons and it believes the 
imposition of sanctions does not help to solve problems but 
rather complicates them. [passage omitted]

``The United States Deploys Guided Missiles and the DPRK 
Opposes the Exertion of Pressure''] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, 7 Apr (XINHUA) -- Acting on U.S. 
President Clinton's 21 March orders, two U.S. transport ships 
carrying 48 Patriot missile launchers set sail from Oakland in 
early April and are scheduled to arrive in the ROK before the 
end of the month. It has been reported the Patriots will be 
deployed around Seoul. 
  As early as the beginning of this year, the United States 
and 
the ROK agreed in principle to deploy Patriot missiles on U.S. 
military bases in the ROK to deal with ``threats from the 
North.'' The missile deployment plan was strongly criticized by 
the DPRK. Later, the situation on the Korean Peninsula became 
relaxed; the Patriot missile deployment plan was shelved after 
the DPRK reached agreements separately with the IAEA and the 
United States on the settlement of the nuclear issue, and North 
and South Korea resumed consultations on an exchange of special 
envoys. 
  Recently, the settlement of the DPRK nuclear issue again 
encountered difficulties as the various parties have completely 
different appraisals of the results of the IAEA's early March 
inspection of the DPRK's nuclear facilities. Against such a 
background, the United States has revived its plan to deploy 
Patriot missiles in the ROK. 
  The U.S. deployment of Patriot missiles aroused strong 
opposition from the DPRK. On 28 March, a DPRK Foreign Ministry 
spokesman issued a statement saying the Patriot missiles to be 
deployed to the ROK are an improved model, which can be used as 
an offensive weapon and can hit any target on the Korean 
Peninsula due to the local terrain. For this reason, the U.S. 
description of the Patriot deployment as ``purely defensive'' is 
groundless. Moreover, the deployment seriously violates 
relevant provisions of the Korea armistice agreement and it is a 
``dangerous military action'' intensifying the situation on the 
Korean Peninsula. The DPRK has repeatedly reiterated that it 
hopes the nuclear issue will be resolved through dialogue, and 
the exertion of pressure will not resolve the issue but will 
only make it more complex. 
  Over the last several days, there have been mass rallies in 
Pyongyang, Haeju, and Kaesong Cities, opposing the U.S. 
deployment of nuclear weapons in the ROK; and criticizing the 
U.S. action as an ``open threat'' to the DPRK and as an 
intentional act to worsen the situation on the Korean Peninsula. 
Participants in the rallies have demanded the United States 
halt the Patriot missile deployment immediately, and have said 
they will be on the alert against the U.S. action.

the aid of Russian experts. 
  An informed Iranian source told reporters today that an 
agreement was reached with the Russian authorities a few months 
ago on the implementation of the first phase of the facility. 
  Construction of the project, which will take four years to 
operate with full capacity, started in March, the source said. 
As much as 30,000 tonnes of necessary materials were

  [Text] Tokyo, April 7 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa said Thursday [7 April] Japan will allocate 11 million 
dollars to Kazakhstan to help dismantle its nuclear weapons, 
Foreign Ministry officials said. 
  Hosokawa made the announcement in a meeting with Kazakhstan 
President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who arrived in Japan on 
Wednesday for a four-day visit. 
  The amount is part of a total of 100 million dollars Japan 
pledged last year to help four former Soviet republics -- 
Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan -- dismantle their 
nuclear weapons. 
  The officials said detailed use of the 11 million dollars 
will be decided in discussions between the two sides at a 
committee on cooperation for the destruction of nuclear weapons. 
  Hosokawa praised Kazakhstan's efforts to denuclearize, 
democratize and shift toward a market-oriented economy, they 
said. 
  Kazakhstan joined the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) 
as a nonnuclear weapon state last November. 
  Nazarbayev, 53, asked for Japanese cooperation in helping 
his 
country tackle environmental pollution at the Semipalatinsk 
nuclear testing site and in the Aral Sea, the officials said. 
  Specifically, he requested cooperation in providing medical 
equipment for hospitals treating people exposed to radioactivity 
near Semipalatinsk. 
  Hosokawa said Japan will seriously consider cooperation with 
the hospitals, which the ministry officials said is expected to 
be covered by the 11 million dollars. 
  An estimated 233 million tons of radioactive substances are 
believed to be left in Kazakhstan. 
  As for environmental problems in the Aral Sea, Hosokawa said 
the problem should be solved internationally but added Japan 
would study what it can do, the officials said. 
  Also during the 30-minute meeting, followed by an hourlong 
dinner, Nazarbayev, 53, said he supports Japan's bid to become a 
permanent member of the UN Security Council. 
  A joint statement signed by the two leaders prior to the 
meeting said Kazakhstan ``expressed the hope'' that Japan would 
become a permanent member of the Security Council and ``fulfill 
its relevant responsibilities.'' 
  Hosokawa told Nazarbayev Japan intends to fulfill its 
responsibilities within its capabilities, the officials said. 
  On the international front, the Kazakhstan president 
proposed 
holding a conference covering the whole of Asia to build trust. 
  Hosokawa agreed on the importance of creating trust in Asia 
but expressed reluctance to set up a forum covering the whole 
region such as the conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe (CSCE). 
  Nazarbayev asked Japan to offer its manufacturing technology 
to Central Asia and suggested setting up a committee between 
Japan and Kazakhstan to study such a possibility. 
  Hosokawa suggested the two sides utilize the existing 
bilateral economic committee. 
  Nazarbayev also offered a list of 1,394 Japanese prisoners 
of 
war detained in Siberia who died in Kazakhstan, the officials 
said. 
  On Friday, Nazarbayev is to meet Emperor Akihito and Empress 
Michiko and give a press conference later in the day.

  [Text] Cairo, 14 Apr (MENA)--The newspaper AL-AKHBAR has 
voiced astonishment at the U.S. Administration overlooking 
Israel's nuclear capability. It asserts that this oversight is 
not the result of ignorance, because the Israeli nuclear 
enterprise is known to all intelligence services. 
  In an editorial today, AL-AKHBAR refers to remarks made by 
U.S. sources that Israel will acquire 45 F-15E combat aircraft. 
It points out that this is the first time the United States has 
agreed to sell this sophisticated type of aircraft and says that 
these planes will enable the Israeli air force to carry out 
strikes against Libya, Iraq, and Iran. 
  AL-AKHBAR remarks that this raises questions about the U.S. 
position on Israel and causes much astonishment. 
  The paper asserts that the U.S. attitude to nuclear weapon 
proliferation is contradictory; while it pressures North Korea 
to open its nuclear facilities to international inspection, 
going as far as to threaten air strikes against it, it 
disregards any discussion of Israel's nuclear weapons, long 
deployed in the Negev. 
  AL-AKHBAR denounces the Israeli Government's refusal to sign 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in clear defiance of the 
international community. The paper says the Israeli 
intelligence services occasionally leak reports about the 
country's nuclear weapons so as to frighten Arab countries near 
and far.

  [Text] Seoul, April 12 (YONHAP) -- Wu Xueqian, visiting 
vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference, said Tuesday he believed that North Korea could not 
develop nuclear weapons even if it wanted to because of Chinese 
people's opposition. 
  The senior Chinese official said there would be no nuclear 
war nor armaments on the Korean peninsula at a lunch meeting 
with National Assembly Speaker Yi Man-sop. 
  ``China is strongly opposed to it (North Korea's nuclear 
weapons development),'' he was quoted as saying. He stressed a 
peaceful solution to the problem while acknowledging the 
difficulties ahead. 
  Speaker Yi, saying China's growing economy would be affected 
if war erupted on the Korean peninsula, reiterated Seoul's call 
for Beijing to play a greater role in persuading Pyongyang to 
give up its nuclear program. 
  Wu was invited to a dinner banquet later by ruling 
Democratic 
Liberal Party (DLP) Executive Chairman Kim Chong-pil to meet 
more DLP members.

  [Editorial Report] London ITV Television Network in English 
at 2000 GMT on 13 April in its ``Dispatches'' program carries a 
45-minute report entitled ``Pocket Neutron,'' in which 
correspondent Gwyn Roberts reviews the findings of an 18-month 
investigation he conducted into red mercury, a chemical compound 
allegedly used by the Russians to develop a smaller, more 
efficient nuclear warhead. 
  The program opens with various shots of a border crossing in 
Como, northern Italy, and goes on to include a brief interview 
with Italian Magistrate Romano Dolce on the smuggling of red 
mercury through Italy. Asked about its final destination, 
Dolce, speaking in Italian with English subtitles, says: 
``Israel, Iraq, Iran, South Africa, and the rest of the world. 
Even Western countries like the United States seem interested 
in red mercury. Why should it be top secret? Why this silence? 
Why this fear of talking about it?'' 
  Brief clips are then shown of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy during 
his visit to Serbia in February this year, followed by various 
street scenes in Moscow. Roberts then introduces a recording 
of an interview he conducted with an unidentified Kremlin 
official who, he says, has access to full government 
intelligence. 
  Roberts asks: ``What proof do you have that there is such a 
substance?'' The official replies: ``The hardest evidence is 
the report prepared by the first chief directorate of the KGB. 
This report was prepared especially for Boris Yeltsin. The 
conclusion of this report is that there is no doubt that red 
mercury exists.'' 
  Roberts asks: ``What military applications of red mercury 
are 
listed in the KGB report?'' 
  The official states: ``The production of fuses of high 
precision for conventional bombs. The production of fuses for 
nuclear bombs. The production of military equipment coating to 
avoid radar detection, production of warheads for self-guided 
missiles of high precision.'' 
  Asked whether red mercury represents new technology, the 
official replies: ``I think it does.'' He goes on to say that 
Iraq, Libya, Israel, and South Africa all wish to purchase red 
mercury because they all want nuclear weapons. 
  Roberts is then seen at the Moscow metro where he meets an 
unidentified former nuclear chemist who worked at a secret plant 
in the Urals. They are then seen in an apartment where the 
chemist is interviewed. Roberts asks why everyone denies that 
red mercury exists. The chemist replies: ``Because of reasons 
of secrecy.'' Roberts asks: ``Why should they want to keep it 
secret?'' The chemist says: ``Because it is the latest 
technology. If it is available to the Third World it may be a 
serious danger to existing order.'' 
  Still photographs are then shown of containers labeled RM 
2020, followed by clips of diagrams of how red mercury can be 
used and a government document on the existence of the 
substance. A person described as the head of the Promocology 
company exhibits what purports to be the raw material for RM 
2020. Scenes of the Moscow White House siege of 1993 are then 
shown. 
  Roberts then interviews an unidentified military scientist 
in 
Moscow, who he says worked as a nuclear physicist producing RM 
2020 for five years. 
  Roberts asks: ``Why is red mercury such a mystery?'' 
  The scientist replies: ``The fact is that it is the latest 
technology which allows an atom bomb to be made very simply.'' 
  Roberts asks: ``So you are saying that with red mercury and 
nuclear materials an atom bomb could be easily assembled by 
Third World countries?'' 
  The scientist replies: ``Yes, that could happen.'' 
  Asked how red mercury would be used, the scientist states: 
``It can reduce the critical mass and increase the power of the 
explosion.'' 
  The program continues by showing extensive shots of the 
nuclear research center at Dubna, including close-up clips of 
the accelerator and other equipment, followed by footage of the 
military scientist meeting with British nuclear expert Frank 
Barnaby. The program then shows U.S. nuclear expert Dr. Ted 
Taylor videotaping questions to be put to the Russian military 
scientist, cutting to shots of Russian elections. 
  The program then shows street scenes in Ekaterinburg and a 
meeting with former nuclear physicist Yevgeniy Korolov, who 
replies to Dr. Taylor's questions. 
  Korolov says: ``This technoloy is one of the most complex 
and 
one of the most dangerous. It enables you to create 
micro-nuclear charges. This means it can be used for nuclear 
terrorism.'' 
  The program continues with more shots of Ekaterinburg, 
followed by a meeting with another nuclear scientist willing to 
talk about red mercury who is shown Dr. Taylor's videotape 
questions. The scientist is then seen driving Roberts into the 
Urals to a plant where red mercury powder is said to be 
manufactured, showing medium and long shots of the plant against 
a snow-covered backdrop, followed by footage of a covert meeting 
with a weapons designer willing to answer Dr. Taylor's 
questions. His typewritten answers are shown to maintain his 
anonymity. 
  The program concludes with a visit by Roberts to a security 
company near Bonn, which trades with Russia and has business 
links with secret military plants producing radioactive 
isotopes. A document acquired in Ekaterinburg is shown which 
demonstrates that this company wishes to purchase 1,000 kg of RM 
2020, cutting to what is described as a list of the chemical 
properties of RM 2020.

  [Text] Hangzhou, April 19 (XINHUA) -- The Qinshan nuclear 
power plant, the first designed and built by China itself, has 
started commercial operation. 
  According to local officials, the power plant in coastal 
Zhejiang Province, has so far generated 2.93 billion kwh of 
electricity, and the waste gas, waste water and trash produced 
are far below the limits set by the central government. 
  The officials attributed the achievement to the effective 
measures adopted by the Qinshan nuclear power corporation. 
  For instance, the company has used TV, radio and exhibitions 
to enhance consciousness of safety in production among workers 
in a bid to ensure that the nuclear power plant operates safely 
on a long-term basis. 
  The Qinshan nuclear power plant started full-load trial 
operation in July 1992. Its construction began in 1985 and took 
six years to complete.

  [Text] The 900-MW large nuclear plant fuel package [zu 
jian 4809 0115] production line has been comprehensively 
completed in the Yibin Nuclear Fuel Package Plant and was 
formally put into production a few days ago. This is a 
gratifying step toward realizing the goal of equipping the Daya 
Bay Nuclear Power Plant with homemade fuel. 
  As China's only nuclear power plant fuel package production 
base, since its founding in 1991, the broad masses of workers, 
cadres, engineers, and technicians in the Yibin Nuclear Fuel 
Package Plant have labored under an excessive workload and, 
after two years and seven months of efforts, the plant has 
smoothly passed the following five rigorous tests one after 
another: The test by the State Bureau for Nuclear Safety; the 
simultaneous acceptance test of the three aspects of 
environmental protection by the State Environmental Protection 
Bureau; the project construction appraisal by French 
specialists; the industrial approval test; and the product 
approval test. The plant will begin to provide the No. 2 
Generating Unit of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant with [words 
indistinct]. This will enable us to provide large nuclear power 
plants with as much homemade fuel packages as possible.

  [Text] Seoul, April 15 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Government announced Friday it has decided to withdraw 
unconditionally its demand on an inter-Korean envoy exchange as 
a condition for Pyongyang to hold further high-level talks with 
Washington. 
  The decision represents a major concession by South Korea 
and 
the United States and will likely raise the pressure on North 
Korea to allow additional checks of its nuclear facilities. 
  The government also said it will accept all North Korean 
escapees from Pyongyang-run logging camps in Siberia wishing to 
settle here.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
editorials carried by ROK vernacular newspapers on 16 April on 
the ROK Government's withdrawal of the demand for an exchange of 
envoys before the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled ``Aftermath of the Abandonment of the 
Proposal that Special Envoys Be Exchanged Before U.S.-North 
Korean Talks.'' 
  The editorial reports that the exchange of special envoys 
was 
``not an idea from which one can expect much.'' It then writes: 
``We must be wary of the possibility that U.S.-North Korean 
talks will proceed toward the direction of turning a blind eye 
to North Korea's possible possession of one or two nuclear 
weapons.'' 
  The editorial continues: ``If U.S.-North Korean talks are 
held as a result of the ROK Government's abandonment of the 
proposal that special envoys be exchanged before U.S.-North 
Korean talks, those talks must provide ways to ensure the 
transparency of the North Korean nuclear issue.'' It concludes: 
``We must show North Korea that its efforts toward a military 
buildup in the post-cold war era will only hasten its own 
destruction.'' 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled ``Abandonment of the Exchange of Special 
Envoys and the Reformulation of Policies.'' 
  The editorial reports that from the beginning the special 
envoy exchange plan was unrealistic and inefficient and that 
even if the North and South had exchanged special envoys, those 
envoys would have merely been busy visiting the North and South. 
  The editorial continues: ``The ROK Government must 
consolidate cooperative relations with the United States and 
propose North-South dialogue to North Korea, separately from 
U.S.-North Korean negotiations, to resume the operation of the 
North-South Joint Nuclear Control Committee to ensure that the 
North and South pursue mutual inspections and achieve the 
denuclearization of this region.'' The editorial continues that 
the ``ROK Government must boldly allow North-South economic 
cooperation'' if North Korea accepts inspections from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency and special inspections of 
its two unreported facilities. 
  The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries on page 3 an 
800-word 
editorial entitled ``We Must Lead North Korea to Dialogue.'' 
  The editorial describes the government's abandonment of the 
special envoy plan as an ``important change'' in the policy 
toward North Korea. The editorial writes that the abandonment 
of the special envoy plan can serve as an ``efficient means to 
pressure North Korea,'' adding: ``This is because this may warn 
North Korea that if it rejects reforms and opening up and 
pursues its nuclear program, its system can be shaken entirely. 
It is important for us to find means to lead North Korea to beg 
for dialogue with South Korea.'' 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled ``North Korea Must Take Corresponding 
Measures.'' 
  The editorial first writes that the government's abandonment 
of the special envoy plan can serve as a ``breakthrough in 
resolving the North Korean nuclear issue.'' It then asks the 
related government ministries to realize that North Korea's 
``ultimate goal is to buy time to develop nuclear weapons, 
rather than merely using the nuclear card in diplomacy.'' The 
editorial concludes: ``As long as the reason we abandoned the 
exchange of special envoys is clear, North Korea must take 
corresponding measures as a matter of course. It must 
unconditionally receive additional inspections by early May as 
demanded by the UN Security Council president's statement. It 
must no longer try to get concessions from the United States and 
leave South Korea out in the cold.''

<F P=106> [``Perilous Development'' -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 19 (KCNA) -- Two transports of the 
U.S. Navy loaded with Patriot missiles to be deployed in South 
Korea arrived at Pusan port on Monday, says a report from Seoul. 
  The unloading of 48 launching pads, 192 Patriot missiles and 
84 stinger missiles has begun. Their frontline deployment will 
reportedly be completed by the 29th of this month. 
  The second batch of Patriot missiles will shortly arrive to 
be deployed by the same date, the report says. 
  The shipment of Patriot to South Korea by the United States 
and the South Korean puppet clique is a very dangerous 
development leading the military situation on the Korean 
peninsula to the brink of war. This is a vivid indication that 
the rash scheme of the United States and the Kim Yong-sam 
traitor clique to overpower our Republic militarily has already 
entered a practical stage. 
  Our people and the Asian people are deeply concerned over 
the 
reckless military action of the U.S. and the South Korean puppet 
clique. 
  The U.S. authorities claim that the Patriot is ``a defensive 
weapon.'' But it is a nonsense. In the Korean peninsula which 
is not large, it can also be used as an attack weapon capable of 
striking any spot. It is known to everyone that the target of 
its strike can be freely altered by the warhead it is tipped 
with. 
  The shipment of the new-type Patriot to South Korea by the 
United States and the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is an open new 
war provocation act to pose a military threat to the DPRK and 
deal a preemptive strike at it. 
  The fact proves that the United States, from the very 
beginning, did not have the intention to solve the nuclear issue 
on the Korean peninsula through dialogue and negotiation but has 
used the problem as an expedient to overpower our Republic, 
motivated by its outdated hostile policy to stifle it. 
  In trying to subdue us with the help of outside forces by 
bringing in without hesitation even the Patriot, a mass 
destruction weapon, the South Korean puppet clique stands naked 
once again revealing its ugly color to the world as a 
never-to-be-condoned flunkeyist traitor and warmaniac. 
  It is a foolish dream for the United States and the South 
Korean puppet clique to try to overpower us with strength. It 
is the unshakable will of our people to answer strength with 
strength. 
  The United States and the South Korean puppet clique must 
not 
act rashly but promptly stop the deployment of the new-type 
missiles in South Korea, clearly seeing the unshakable will of 
our people.

  [Excerpt] Tokyo, April 19 KYODO -- Japan will back down 
from its plan to promote plutonium use for nuclear recycling, 
International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai said 
Tuesday [19 April]. 
  Kumagai was referring to reported calls by the Advisory 
Committee for Energy, his advisory organ, for reviewing Japan's 
policy in favor of plutonium use as a way to meet energy demand 
in the future. 
  The committee is now formulating a report on Japan's new 
energy policy by accounting for recent rapid changes in the 
energy field. 
  Speaking before a regular press conference, Kumagai said the 
committee is moving toward a consensus against active use of 
plutonium. 
  ``Discussion so far by the committee seems to be 
convincing,'' Kumagai said. 
  Japan has come under global criticism for its plutonium 
policy as leading to nuclear proliferation. Doubt has also been 
cast at home over the feasibility of commercial use of 
plutonium. [passage omitted]

  [Text] At a news conference held after the ``Monju'' 
plutonium-fueled fast breeder reactor reached criticality, 
Ishiwata Takao, president of the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel 
Development Corporation [Donen], disclosed that Donen is 
studying the possibility of building a ``recycle experiment 
reactor'' as an experiment and research reactor to replace the 
``Monju.'' This will allow Japan to technically handle issues 
of nuclear nonproliferation as well as environmental problems. 
The idea under consideration by Donen is that a fast breeder 
reactor and a spent-fuel reprocessing plant are constructed to 
simultaneously burn ultra-uranium elements mixed in with spent 
fuel and plutonium. This idea would remove concerns about the 
extraction of pure plutonium and its conversion into nuclear 
weapons.

    [Editorial Report] Seoul vernacular newspapers on 19 April 
react to the talks on the North Korean nuclear issue between 
Robert Gallucci, U.S. assistant secretary of state, and ROK 
officials, including Nuclear Ambassador Kim Sam-hun, held in 
Seoul on 18 April. 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries a 1,000-word article by 
reporter Pak Tu-sik on page 3 which welcomes the ``simple and 
clear'' demand for North Korea's allowance of additional nuclear 
inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, 
made in the recent Seoul talks between the ROK and the United 
States. The article reports: ``It seems that, for the time 
being, the United States and the ROK will concentrate their 
efforts on creating an atmosphere for North Korea to allow 
additional inspections by the IAEA.'' 
  The article reports that ``the United States will strongly 
demand that South and North Korea hold a dialogue on 
implementing the declaration on denuclearization of the Korean 
peninsula'' and conduct bilateral nuclear inspection after the 
third round of U.S.-North Korea talks, ``which will likely be 
held in Geneva in May as soon as the IAEA inspection team enters 
North Korea if North Korea meets the IAEA demand.'' 
  The article also expects that ``the South-North Joint 
Nuclear 
Control Committee will be held if the North Korea-IAEA and North 
Korea-U.S. dialogue is successfully held'' and that ``this will 
make progress in resolving the nuclear issue.'' 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries a 400-word article by Chong 
Pyong-chin on page 1 which reports that in the 18 April talks, 
the ROK ``asked the United States to propose a contact with 
North Korea first'' and that the United States said it ``will 
consider proposing to North Korea to hold a contact before the 
end of this week.'' The article concludes by noting that ``it is 
highly possible for North Korea and the United States to hold a 
contact in New York sometime this week.'' 
  The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN carries a 900-word article 
by Pak Chong-mun on page 2 on the result of the talks between 
Robert Gallucci and ROK Government officials. While reporting 
that the ROK and the United States ``failed to make any clear 
decision'' on the nuclear issue, the South-North dialogue, and 
the U.S.-North Korea talks, the article notes as a ``tangible 
result'' of the talks that the ROK and U.S. authorities ``have 
shared the view that the U.S.-North Korea talks and South-North 
dialogue should be promoted in a harmonious way of complementary 
cooperation.'' Pointing out the ``inevitability of sharing a 
view on South-North dialogue between the ROK and the United 
States'' because of the linkage between South-North dialogue and 
the U.S. interests, the article stresses additional agreements 
on South-North dialogue must be reached between the ROK and the 
United States if North Korea allows additional nuclear 
inspections. 
  The article expects no tangible result for resolving the 
nuclear issue from U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry's 
upcoming visit to the ROK, noting the ``flexible situation'' 
regarding this issue. 
  The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO also carries reporter Kang 
Yong-chin's 1,000-word article expecting that a working-level 
contact will be held between the United States and North Korea 
before the end of this week. Citing an unidentified government 
official's remarks, the article reports that the United States 
will no longer allow North Korea to ``attempt to stall for 
time'' since, through repeated negotiations with North Korea, 
the United States is now able to easily grasp North Korea's 
intent.

  [Text] Pusan, South Korea, April 18 (YONHAP) -- Two U.S. 
Navy transport ships carrying Patriot missiles arrived in the 
southeastern port of Pusan on Monday [18 April]. 
  The 13,000-ton ``Comet'' and 16,460-ton ``Meteor'' left the 
U.S. Navy Base in Oakland bound for Pusan on March 23, with an 
undisclosed number of Patriot launch pads and other equipment 
aboard. 
  These missiles, in addition to others due to arrive sometime 
in the future, are expected to be deployed at military bases 
here by April 29, military officials said. 
  The Patriot anti-missile missiles are a more advanced 
version 
than those used during the Gulf war in 1991. 
  A military official said, ``the Patriot anti-missile 
missiles 
will considerably reinforce the air defense capability here. It 
is the most effective defense system against possible air 
attack.''

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports published in Seoul vernacular newspapers on 21 April 
reacting to the decision to resume the Team Spirit joint 
military exercise and the deployment of Patriot missiles. 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 3 an 
800-word editorial entitled ``North Korea Should Understand the 
Significance of the Decision on Team Spirit.'' Asserting that 
the most effective means to counter the North Korean nuclear 
issue is firm coordination between the ROK and the United 
States, the editorial writes military cooperation between the 
two countries is imperative in the current situation. 
  The editorial welcomes the decision of ROK and U.S. defense 
ministers to strengthen combined war preparedness writing that 
it is a very timely tuning of strategy as suspicions surrounding 
North Korea's nuclear development have not been cleared. 
  Defining the resumption of the Team Spirit exercise as an 
``inevitable decision,'' the editorial stresses that ``such a 
security coordination system should remain firm until it is 
confirmed that North Korea has no nuclear weapons,'' and that 
``North Korea should stop trying to avoid nuclear inspections 
with various excuses.'' 
  The editorial shows concern over foreign reports that the 
United States asked the ROK to be armed with modern weapons as 
the selection of weapons should be decided by the ROK, not the 
United States. 
  The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO publishes on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled ``Reinforcement of Defense Posture is 
Fundamental.'' 
  The editorial welcomes the decision of the ROK and U.S. 
defense ministers to resume the Team Spirit exercise and to 
reinforce the combined forces saying that it was a ``natural,'' 
``inevitable,'' and ``appropriate'' decision. 
  Regarding the issue of purchasing more modern arms, the 
editorial writes the decision should be made according to ROK's 
conditions and abilities, adding that the Yulgok project may be 
adjusted but should not be influenced by U.S. defense industry's 
demands. 
  The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN publishes on page 3 an 
800-word editorial entitled ``Unlimited Armament Competition is 
Not Appropriate.'' 
  Consenting to the theory that military superiority deters 
war, the editorial writes, however, making the Korean peninsula 
an unlimited exhibition place of modern arms cannot be tolerated. 
  Noting the remarks of Edward Warner, U.S. assistant 
secretary 
of defense, that modern heavy arms will be deployed to the ROK 
by the end of summer, the editorial writes the United States is 
trying to deploy another new weapon after safely deploying 
Patriot missiles as a result of the ``sea of fire'' remarks by 
North Korea. 
  The editorial writes the current situation cannot be 
described as a crisis, citing Kim Il-song's recent appeasement 
remarks and the fact that South Koreans were not threatened by 
the ``sea of fire'' remarks. The editorial notes that it is the 
United States that more frequently talks about the possibility 
of war on the Korean peninsula. 
  The editorial concludes by warning that ``excessive 
deployment of modern arms might stimulate North Korea's desire 
to develop nuclear weapons to overcome the gap in military 
capacity in a single blow.''

<F P=106> [Report by Bvenjamin Yeh] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, April 12 (CNA) -- Premier Lien chan 
emphasized Tuesday that the Republic of China [ROC] is a 
peace-loving country and has no plans to manufacture nuclear 
weapons. 
  ``This is the principle the government has adhered to and it 
should be understood by the world,'' Lien said in reply to an 
inquiry on the issue by Democratic Progressive Party legislator 
Chou Po-lung. 
  Although Chou is an opponent of Taiwan's fourth nuclear 
power 
plant project, he nevertheless suggested that the government 
accelerate the development of nuclear devices as a hedge against 
the Mainland Chinese threat. 
  ``Peace in the region can be maintained only by the creation 
of mutual assurance of destruction over the skies of the Taiwan 
Strait,'' Chou said. 
  He said developing nuclear weapons is necessary if Taiwan 
wants to be independent of Mainland China. He warned, however, 
that announcing independence without a deterrent force to back 
up the proclamation would invite disaster.

<F P=106> [Report by reporter Lu Chao-lung (0712 2507 7127)] </F>
  [Text] Taipei -- It was disclosed that the Army will spend 
more than NT$ [New Taiwan Dollars] 10 billion for the purchase 
of 200 Patriot missiles of an improved version to equip three 
missile companies to be deployed in northern Taiwan to guard 
against tactical missiles and air defense. The Patriot is the 
only missile that has had actually been able to counterstrike 
other missiles. 
  During a luncheon with Legislator Wang Tien-chin yesterday 
[13 April], Lt. General Chang Kuang-chin, deputy commander in 
chief of the Army, and other high-ranking Army officers briefed 
him in detail about the purchasing plan. The Army was quite 
impressed with Wang's recent rather professional questions on 
Patriot missiles. 
  It was disclosed that, after extensive assessment, the Army 
is able to combat the problem of launching Patriot missiles even 
under circumstances that the Republic of China [ROC] lacks 
satellite navigation for missile launching. A high-ranking 
general also confirmed that the launching of Patriot missiles 
will not be affected by lack of satellite navigation. Army 
officers also learned from a study trip in the United States 
last July that the U.S. Army does not consider the Patriot 
outdated and will continue to improve the missile. 
  Regarding how accurate the missile is in hitting a target, 
information provided by the Army shows that Patriot missiles can 
be 40 to 70 percent accurate in hitting a target. The 
information is based on various sources, including briefings at 
the U.S. Congress given by an assistant chief of staff of the 
U.S. tactical planning units. 
  It was pointed out that Patriot missiles have been improved 
four times and the system the ROC Army will purchase is the 
latest. On the basis of the tactical capabilities it 
demonstrated in the Persian Gulf War, this model has gone 
through the U.S. Army's tactical tests and thus has a better 
launching control system.

  [Text] Fighting between the Army of Serbian Republic [of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina] and members of the so-called Army of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is taking place on a part of the front 
between Gorazde, Cajnice, and Foca. The worst fighting is 
taking place in the Obrecevo region and along the Drina river, 
between Vitkovici and Foca, where the Muslim units are trying to 
recapture the positions that they lost. 
  In addition to using all the available arms, the Muslims are 
also using chemical agents produced in the goldsmithing plant in 
Vitkovici. The Serbian military sources claim that these agents 
are produced with the most primitive technology. The Serbian 
fighters who crushed the strong Muslim offensive from Gorazde, 
involving some 10,000 well-armed Alija's [Izetbegovic] soldiers, 
are continuing to rout the Muslim forces from the torched 
Serbian villages on the right bank of the Drina.

  [Excerpt] Sarajevo, April 10 (AFP) -- The Moslem-led 
Bosnian presidency Saturday [9 April] evening accused Serbs of 
killing ``many people'' in a gas attack on the eastern 
Moslem-held enclave of Gorazde. 
  A spokesman for the presidency here was unable to give 
casualty figures, saying reports varied widely with some 
mentioning thousands of dead. 
  In Istanbul, Bosnian Vice-President Eyup Ganic told AFP that 
``hundreds'' of people had been killed during the course of 
three chemical attacks on Gorazde on Saturday. ``This is 
genocide under UN supervision,'' he said. 
  Ganic added that he would be flying to New York on Sunday, 
at 
the demand of President Alija Izetbegovic, to demand an 
emergency meeting of the UN Security Council. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Alma-ata [Almaty], April 27 (XINHUA) -- Chinese 
Premier Li Peng, addressing a press conference here this 
afternoon, stated that a complete nuclear test ban should be 
established through negotiations. 
  Asked about China's attitude towards such a policy, Li said 
that while China is a nuclear country, its nuclear weapons take 
up only a very small portion of the world's total. 
  ``China has initiated the proposition of not using nuclear 
weapons first and not resorting to threats with nuclear 
weapons,'' he noted. 
  He pointed out that the Chinese Government always stands for 
a complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear 
weapons, and for the realization of a complete nuclear test ban 
in such a context. 
  Towards that aim, he said: ``the Chinese Government holds 
that it is of positive significance to reach a pact on a 
complete nuclear test ban through negotiations.'' 
  He added that China has stated clearly that it would work 
towards reaching such a treaty in 1996. 
  ``At the moment, China is positively participating in 
negotiations on a complete nuclear test ban of the Geneva 
Disarmament Conference,'' he said.

  [Text] Beijing, May 3 (AFP) -- The Chinese foreign ministry 
said Tuesday it was ``not aware'' of any upcoming nuclear test 
by China, as announced by the Japanese government. ``China 
keeps the attitude of utmost restraint towards nuclear tests. 
The number of nuclear tests it has conducted has been quite 
limited,'' a ministry spokesman said. ``I am not aware of any 
nuclear test in the near future.'' 
  Deputy Japanese Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito on Monday 
said China would soon carry out a nuclear test, and called on 
Beijing to scrap the operation. A western expert in Beijing 
said ``it would not be surprising'' if there were a nuclear test 
in the near future, as China carries out such tests in the 
spring and the autumn for climatic reasons. 
  China's last nuclear explosion took place at the underground 
Lop Nor site, in the northwest of the country, on 5 October. It 
was the 38th test -- other counts put it as the 39th -- carried 
out in the autonomous region of Xinjiang since 1964. Foreign 
experts said the test, with a yield of 70 to 80 kilotonnes, was 
apparently part of a miniaturisation programme aimed at 
developing a multiple-warhead missile. 
  The United States has carried out around 950 nuclear tests, 
Russia about 600, France 200 and Britain 60.

  [By reporter Gao Jianxin (7559 1696 2450]) 
  [Text] United Nations, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Chinese 
Ambassador to the UN Disarmament Commission Hou Zhitong pointed 
out in his speech on 19 April that the time is quite ripe for 
China, the United States, Britain, France, and Russia to sign a 
treaty undertaking not to threaten the use of, or to use, 
nuclear arms against non-nuclear-weapon states and not to be the 
first to use nuclear weapons against each other under any 
circumstances. 
  Hou Zhitong said: This treaty, when reached among the five 
countries during their negotiations on a comprehensive nuclear 
test-ban treaty, will greatly reduce the risk of a nuclear war, 
enhance their security, and create a favorable condition for 
achieving comprehensive nuclear test ban and advance the nuclear 
disarmament process. 
  He said: China's proposal has received Russia's support. 
China hopes that the United States, Britain, and France will 
also respond to it in a positive way so that negotiations can 
begin at an early date to conclude this treaty. 
  Hou Zhitong also explained China's position and views ``on 
the role of science and technology in international security, 
disarmament, and other relevant fields'' as well as on 
``international arms transfer.'' He said: Currently, a number 
of countries have indicated that they would liberalize export 
control of relevant semi-finished materials and technologies. 
At the same time, there are countries considering the 
establishment of new export control regime. Nuclear 
nonproliferation should not hinder international scientific and 
technological cooperation, much less be used by a few countries 
as an excuse for blocking a large number of developing countries 
from obtaining and developing science and technology for 
peaceful purpose. 
  He also pointed out: China has always opposed unrestricted 
international arms transfers. As is known to all, the key to 
solving the problem of unrestricted arms transfers lay in the 
political will of a few countries which have the most advanced 
industries and most arms exports.

  [Text] Beijing, 25 Apr (XINHUA) -- At the invitation of the 
Chinese State Nuclear Safety Bureau, an International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] team on international evaluation of nuclear 
safety control today began the evaluation of the effectiveness 
of China's nuclear safety supervision and control. 
  The team consists of experts from the United States, France, 
Britain, Spain, and Belgium, as well as IAEA officials. During 
their stay in Beijing, the team members will listen to the State 
Nuclear Safety Bureau's briefings on nuclear safety supervision 
and control system, organizations and functions, the formulation 
of nuclear safety law and its evaluation and enforcement, as 
well as nuclear contingency plans in China. They will also hold 
special talks with the state bureau on the aforesaid topics. In 
addition, the team members will visit Shenzhen to hold talks 
with Guangdong's Dayawan Nuclear Plant and the state bureau's 
Guangdong Supervision Station to familiarize themselves with the 
Chinese state bureau's nuclear safety supervision and control 
over the operating units. 
  International evaluation of nuclear safety control is a form 
of international cooperation activity, through which IAEA 
organizes international nuclear safety experts to evaluate the 
effectiveness of nuclear safety supervision and control carried 
by the nuclear safety agency of a certain member state. The 
purpose of the evaluation is to obtain firsthand information 
about the member state's nuclear safety supervision and control, 
to summarize successful experiences, to make suggestions for 
improvement, and to exchange experiences in order to raise all 
member states' level in nuclear safety supervision and control. 
  According to a state bureau official, international 
evaluation of nuclear safety control is to be requested by 
member states on a voluntary basis and to be organized and 
carried out by the IAEA. Since the inauguration of the State 
Nuclear Safety Bureau in 1984, China has adopted relatively 
comprehensive nuclear safety regulations and supervision system. 
The international evaluation, the first to be conducted on 
China's nuclear safety supervision and control in 10 years, will 
help improve China's nuclear safety work, enhance its influence 
on the world, and promote its international cooperation in 
nuclear safety. 
  The IAEA team, which arrived in Beijing 24 April, will 
complete the evaluation on 9 May.

Hsiao-yang (2799 1420 3152) and Shih Ping (0670 0365): ``Huian 
Chosen as the Site for the Fujian Nuclear Power Plant; 
Feasibility Studies Have Been Approved''] 
  [Text] Quanzhou, 23rd--Shanqian Township in Fujian's Huian 
County has been chosen as the site for the third nuclear power 
plant, after the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant in Guangdong and 
the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant in Zhejiang. A feasibility 
study on the site was approved a few days ago. 
  The township in Huian County is the only site among the 
three 
initially picked by state nuclear power departments in Fujian 
that is not near an earthquake zone. Following numerous surveys 
and scientific demonstrations, concerned experts finally 
determined that Shanqian Township was the best site for a 
nuclear power plant in the province. The new plant will be 
located in the middle region of coastal Fujian at the mouth of 
Quanzhou Wan, near a hillside and facing the sea, and is 140 km 
north of Fuzhou and 20 km south of Quanzhou. 
  The Huian Nuclear Power Plant project plans to build six 
900,000 kw generating units with a total installed capacity 5.4 
million kw, commanding over 50 billion yuan in total investment. 
Phase one has been listed in the ``Ninth Five-Year Plan'' and 
will include two 900,000 kw generating units requiring 30 
billion yuan in total investment. The units will be integrated 
with the eastern and central China power grids. 
  Huian County has begun the early phase of preparations for 
the nuclear power plant project in Shanqian township, which 
includes resettling villagers and educating people about nuclear 
power. 
  According to the electricity departments, because the 
project 
requires a huge amount of capital and the province itself is 
short on construction funds, the departments concerned are 
hoping to solve the funding problem by inviting bids and 
attracting foreign capital.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Kim Ho-sam: ``The South Korean Puppets' </F>
Maneuver To Develop Nuclear Weapons Has Reached a Grave Stage''] 
  [Text] Realizing denuclearization on the Korean peninsula 
today is a consistent demand of the people at home and abroad. 
Denuclearization in Northeast Asia cannot be realized if the 
Korean peninsula does not become a nuclear-free zone, and if 
Northeast Asia does not realize denuclearization, we cannot 
expect peace and security in Asia and the rest of the world. 
  Therefore, realizing the denuclearization of the Korean 
peninsula is a grave task of the times. Nevertheless, while 
running counter to the intention and demand of the times, the 
South Korean puppets today are conspiring with outside forces to 
all the more heatedly develop nuclear weapons. 
  A concrete example of this is the fact that the South Korean 
puppets are promoting to develop a fast-breeding reactor. A 
fast-breeding reactor is an atomic reactor that produces 
high-purity plutonium, which is raw material for producing 
nuclear weapons. 
  The South Korean puppets have promoted the development of 
the 
fast-breeding reactor for a long time. Since the 1980's the 
South Korean puppets had started the development of the 
fast-breeding reactor and it has currently reached a very grave 
stage. In 1984, the South Korean puppets concluded an agreement 
with a European country, which possesses the most advanced 
technology in the world in developing the fast-breeding reactor, 
to introduce the high-breeding reactor. It thus started to 
introduce its core technology, design, and experimental reactor 
facilities. In the late 1980's, it completed various 
technological preparations and experiments necessary to develop 
positive reactors. Also in the 1990's, after going through the 
experimental stage, it started to develop it on a full-scale. 
  According to nuclear experts, the conceptional and budgetary 
design of the positive reactors has already been completed in 
South Korea, and the overall amount that has been invested is 
118.3 billion won. 
  Currently, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is receiving 
support and recognition from the world's social circles on 
developing the fast-breeder reactor, and is carrying out 
diplomatic activities by bustling about here and there to 
demonstrate a legitimate justification. 
  The puppets are not only all the more producing plutonium 
within South Korea, but they are also bringing more of it in 
from other countries and are appropriately maintaining the 
production process itself to reprocess it. 
  The so-called chairman of the Foreign Affairs and 
Unification 
Committee of the South Korea National Assembly said that we 
cannot transfer other countries' nuclear fuel. This clearly 
shows how much the South Korean puppets are persistently 
clinging to nuclear development. 
  Regardless of all the facts, in an interview with THE LOS 
ANGELES TIMES, traitor Kim Yong-sam said that they do not have 
any intention at all to independently develop nuclear weapons. 
This is a poor excuse to avoid criticism from the world 
community, which is leaning toward them. This shows how much he 
is filled with falsehood and hypocrisy. 
  Papers of various countries, including the United States and 
Great Britain, view that plutonium already stored by South Korea 
amounts to 10 tonnes and that it will increase to 24 tonnes in 
the year 2000. As such, even though the South Korean puppets 
are acting as the shock brigade for their nuclear development, 
they are trying to mislead the world as if we have some kind of 
a nuclear problem. 
  On 4 May, traitor Kim Yong-sam said that during the past one 
year we have continued nuclear development and that North Korean 
nuclear development must be restrained in whatever way. Such a 
remark by traitor Kim Yong-sam is aimed at completing their goal 
of being armed with nuclear weapons by accelerating the 
development of their nuclear weapons under the protection of the 
U.S. nuclear umbrella by making it so that the nuclear issue on 
the Korean peninsula cannot reach a package settlement at the 
DPRK-U.S. talks in whatever way. 
  Nevertheless, nothing will be gained regardless of how the 
South Korean puppets plot to harm us with the nuclear issue. 
The world's people who treasure justice and truth and love 
peace have a clear insight of the true nature of the scheme 
being carried out by the South Korean puppets. 
  The more the Kim Yong-sam ring accelerates their nuclear 
development by finding fault with our so-called nuclear 
suspicions, the more their true nature will be revealed before 
the world's people. The South Korean puppets must correctly 
know that their reckless maneuver to develop nuclear weapons 
will only bring about a result of digging their own graves. 
They must immediately stop the play of putting the calamity of 
a nuclear disaster on the heads of the fellow countrymen.

<F P=106> [White Paper on the ROK's Development of Fast-Breeding </F>
Reactor issued by the Central Committee of the South Korea 
National Democratic Front on 2 May] 
  [Text] According to the VOICE OF NATIONAL SALVATION from 
Seoul, the South Korea National Democratic Front [SKNDF] Central 
Committee issued the following white paper on 2 May exposing the 
South Korean puppet clique's attempt to accelerate its nuclear 
armament by developing fast-breeding reactors: 
<H5>  The White Paper on the ROK's Development of Fast-Breeding </H5>
Reactors 
<H5>  1. The Blitz [chongyokchok] Development of Fast-Breeding </H5>
Reactors 
  According to the Atomic Energy Commission [AEC]'s June 1992 
final decision on its plan for atomic energy research and 
development, the ROK is supposed to complete the development of 
positive reactors [silchungno], which is the third stage of 
fast-breeding reactor development, 19 years ahead of Japan, 
which has now started to operate prototype reactors [wonhyongno]. 
  In order to realize this plan, the ROK is using the same 
blitz mosaic method of synthesizing various countries' 
technologies that is used to develop nuclear weapons. 
  The ambition of ROK rulers to develop fast-breeding reactors 
began in the eighties. According to a report on the 
proliferation of mass-killing weapons which is a secret document 
of the Russian bureau of foreign intelligence, the ROK 
authorities agreed early in 1984 with a European country that 
possessed the most advanced technology in developing 
fast-breeding reactors, to introduce its fast-breeding reactors 
and thus began to introduce core technologies, designs, and 
experimental reactor facilities [silhomno solbidul]. The 
Institute of Atomic Energy Research thus secretly developed an 
experimental reactor, whose diameter was 1 meter, at the end of 
the eighties, and has used it in the various technological 
experiments required in the development of prototype and 
positive reactors. 
  In the nineties, the Chongwadae [presidential offices] 
ruling 
group began to develop the prototype reactor in cooperation with 
Japan. On 25 May 1990, the government authorities and Japan 
signed an agreement on cooperation in the atomic energy field, 
and agreed to promote technological exchanges and joint research 
on atomic energy. In an ROK-Japan conference on atomic energy 
held on 9 November 1990, they conspired [moui] to jointly 
promote the development of next-generation reactors. 
  In an exclusive secret meeting between Kim Yong-sam and 
Hosokawa in Kyongju on 6 November 1993, they even secretly 
signed an agreement on ROK-Japan joint promotion to develop 
nuclear weapons in return for calling off Japan's repayment for 
its past crimes. 
  When they began to suddenly [chongyokchoguro] introduce 
technology and experience for the development of prototype 
reactors from Japan, the government authorities decided to 
invest about 2 trillion won in atomic energy research and 
development, such as the development of a fast-breeding reactor. 
They began to push ahead with the development of a prototype 
reactor in 1992, mobilizing all experts concerned with [words 
indistinct]. 
  Regarding this, NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN dated 29 July 1992 
reported: the ROK has already started to develop fast-breeding 
reactors, hastening its mid- and long-term plans. 
  According to the ROK experts on nuclear development, the 
design of a prototype fast-breeding reactor was turned over to 
Korea Heavy Industries by the Institute of Atomic Energy 
Research, and they have not only started to produce facilities 
of the prototype reactor but also completed a basic study on 
positive reactors, drafted a conceptional design, and set aside 
budgeting for it, with an investment of 118.3 billion won. 
  Today, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is busy seeking 
justification from the international community regarding the 
lawfulness of the fast-breeding reactor development. 
  In October 1993, the Kim Yong-sam group held an 
international 
symposium on next-generation reactors in Seoul and even had some 
quarters of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
promise to cooperate in the ROK plan to develop next-generation 
reactors. 
  At that time, in a public notice issued in a news conference 
in Seoul, Greenpeace exposed and denounced that, far from 
discussing scientific and technological problems, this symposium 
was a meeting to encourage construction for producing plutonium 
in the ROK, as well as an insidious meeting that would bring the 
danger of nuclear war closer to East Asia. 
<H5>  2. The Ulterior Motive Behind the Development of the </H5>
Fast-Breeding Reactor 
  Throughout the world, the fast-breeding reactor is 
acknowledged as lacking economic advantages and safety. For 
this reason, the countries developing it either suspended its 
operation or closed it down--the United States in 1977, France 
seven years after its initiation of operations, and Britain in 
1994. Germany gave up operating a test reactor which it had 
built. 
  (Frank Hanabby), a British nuclear physicist, who visited 
Japan recently, likened the Monju, the Japanese reactor for 
producing high-purity plutonium which was put into operation 
sometime ago, to a nuclear explosion waiting to happen. 
Meanwhile, South Korea and Japan are desperately engaged in the 
development of a fast-breeding reactor. This is directly 
connected with their ambition to develop nuclear weapons. We 
are making this statement based on the following grounds: 
First, if the South Korean authorities develop the 
fast-breeding reactor, they can multiply and produce a large 
quantity of plutonium for the production of nuclear bombs. The 
December 1991 issue of MAL magazine stated that since the 
fast-breeding reactor is a device justifying the massive 
stockpile and production of plutonium, which is the raw material 
for nuclear weapons, the country operating it should have little 
difficulty in producing nuclear weapons. The South Korean 
ruling group is attempting to secure a large quantity of 
plutonium through the development of the fast-breeding reactor. 
  Second, the development of the fast-breeding reactor 
provides 
a pretext justifying the purchase of plutonium from a foreign 
country. Because the fast-breeding reactor is a reactor which 
feeds on plutonium, if the fast-breeding reactor is developed, 
South Korea can massively and legitimately import plutonium and 
the dioxide of highly-enriched uranium, which the authorities 
have secretly been importing from Britain. (Kim Chi-o), atomic 
energy policy officer of the Ministry of Science and Technology, 
has stated that plutonium, the raw nuclear material that is to 
be used in the fast-breeding reactor, will be imported from a 
foreign country. 
  Third, the fast-breeding reactor must be equipped with 
reprocessing facilities. WOLGAN CHOSON, April 1990 issue, noted 
that the introduction of the fast-breeding reactor is a 
prerequisite to the construction of a reprocessing plant, adding 
that since the introduction of the fast-breeding reactor is 
almost certain, the construction of a reprocessing plant is a 
question of time. 
  Chong Chae-mun, chairman of the National Assembly Foreign 
and 
Unification Affairs Committee, openly calling for a review of 
the North-South agreements of 1991, asserting, ``We cannot 
continue depending on another country for nuclear fuel.'' This 
clearly illustrates how frenziedly the Kim Yong-sam ring is 
attempting to provide reprocessing facilities with the 
development of the fast- breeding reactor. 
  Fourth, the development of the fast-breeding reactor is in 
itself a process to develop a nuclear bomb. Technologically, 
the theory of designing the fast-breeding reactor and that of 
designing the nuclear bomb are the same. Therefore, the 
technology for the development of the fast-breeding reactor 
means in many respects the transfer of the technology for the 
development of a nuclear bomb. Furthermore, nuclear physicists 
say that the high-purity plutonium obtained from the 
fast-breeding reactor can be used for the production of a 
nuclear bomb with the appropriate critical mass [imgye 
chillyang]. 
  The stern reality clearly proves that the traitorous ruling 
group in the South scrapped the joint declaration on 
denuclearization on the Korean peninsula agreed upon between the 
North and the South and that it is persistently engaged in the 
development of nuclear weapons. Their attempt to extract 
plutonium by developing the fast-breeding reactor, the monster 
called a time-bomb, which is prone to horrible accidents, and to 
make criminal nuclear weapons that will destroy the entire 
nation, is an unpardonable antinational crime. 
  The persons in authority should not only abolish the heavy 
water reactor and the multi-purpose research reactor but suspend 
the development of the fast-breeding reactor immediately. The 
international reactionary forces, including Japan, should stop 
acts of conspiring with the Kim Yong-sam ring in its development 
of the fast-breeding reactor directly connected with the 
development of nuclear bombs. 
  Our SKNDF and patriotic masses will certainly check and 
frustrate the Kim Yong-sam ring's development of the 
fast-breeding reactor for nuclear armament and its maneuvers to 
secure a large quantity of plutonium. We express the hope that 
the world's fair opinion will wage vigorous activities to trace 
to the end and stop the South Korean rulers' maneuvers to 
develop the fast-breeding reactor and nuclear weapons.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
editorials and articles published in Seoul vernacular dailies on 
21 April on the reportedly pacifying gesture by North Korean 
President Kim Il-song during his recent interview with William 
Taylor, vice president of the Center for Strategic and 
International Studies, CSIS, and other Western media, such as 
CNN, THE WASHINGTON TIMES, and Japanese NHK Television. 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled ``From the Sea of Fire to Fishing.'' The 
editorial begins: ``Until recently, U.S. media was uproarious 
in reporting that a war would break out on the Korean peninsula 
at any time. Now, a person called vice president of the U.S. 
CSIS, who interviewed Kim Il-song, states that he can confirm 
Kim's pacifying attitude. Noting this rapidly fluctuating 
scene, we are led to believe that Kim Il-song's game with the 
South, the United States, and the media is working. Uproarious 
commotions occurred in Western media concerning 'war clouds on 
the Korean peninsula' in reaction to `the sea of fire' remark. 
Several days later, when Kim Il-song said: `I wish to visit 
the United States to fish and hunt,' a U.S. figure said there is 
no war danger. Kim is certainly toying with our side. As 
revealed in Kim Il-song's meeting with Western figures, he is 
informed on the nuclear issue, he is resolved not to ultimately 
abandon the nuclear program while continuing to deny possessing 
nuclear weapons, and he will keep trying to win a package 
solution using the nuclear card.'' The editorial concludes: 
``We should solidify our security posture and maintain a firm 
ROK-U.S. cooperative alliance, rather than readily reacting to 
the North's game, which does not display any honesty. We should 
not hastily be tempted to meetings or talks with the North.'' 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 5 a 1,300-word 
article by reporter An Hui-chang entitled: ``Kim Il-song's 
Pacifying Scheme -- Well-Planned Propaganda Offensive Aimed at 
Deranging the South.'' The article notes that ``The `smile 
operation' shows that North Korean President Kim Il-song himself 
is undertaking must have been well-planned.'' The article then 
notes: ``For the show, North Korea displayed a `dovish gesture' 
to the world through an actor called Kim Il-song. The show is 
also aimed at deranging the South. North Korea had to stage a 
show like this because it is thoroughly isolated from the world 
opinion owing to its incomplete compliance with the ad hoc 
inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA. 
Furthermore, the recently reported issue of North Korean 
loggers and escapees from the North brought to light the North 
Korean human rights issue, a disgrace to North Korea.'' The 
article concludes: ``The true North Korean intent behind the 
pacifying show by Kim Il-song will be revealed in the near 
future.'' 
  CHOSON ILBO carries on page 5 a 1,000-word article by Kim 
Chol entitled: ``The ROK and the United States Taken by 
Surprise.'' The article notes that ``Using a Western broadcast 
covering the news connected with the tension on the Korean 
peninsula and his 82d birthday, North Korean President Kim 
Il-song took the United States and the ROK by surprise. Kim 
tried to replace his image of a hooligan with an image of a 
neighborly grandfather, a good citizen one can meet anywhere, 
and a friendly figure for the American people.'' The article 
notes that Kim Il-song's pacifying gesture is likely to confuse 
ROK's North Korean policy and inspire the reunification 
advocates who are not aware of the true nature of the North 
Korean rulers. The article then notes North Korea has succeeded 
in enhancing its position, as was expected, in using the nuclear 
card in view of the present stage of development. The article 
notes: ``Kim Il-song's nuclear strategy consists of two stages. 
One is to improve relations with the United States by using the 
nuclear issue as a weapon for the North Korean system, which is 
left as a solitary island in the post-cold war era.'' The 
article continues: ``The second stage of Kim Il-song's strategy 
is to force the U.S. Forces out of the ROK, ultimately through 
the improvement of relations with the United States.'' 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO carries on page 3 an article by Pak 
Che-kyun entitled: ``Kim Il-song's Remarks on His Readiness To 
Abolish the Radiochemical Laboratory.'' The article notes Kim 
Il-song's remarks in a written interview with Western media that 
he is prepared to abolish the radiochemical laboratory, provided 
that the United States assists North Korea to install 
light-water reactors. The article notes the complexity involved 
in assisting North Korea to install light-water reactors because 
it would mean the United States has to spend $1 to 2 billion per 
reactor, not to mention the 10 years required for the 
construction of the reactor. The article notes: ``U.S. 
assistance to North Korea for the light-water reactor means the 
improvement of relations between the United States and North 
Korea, which will probably lead to the establishment of 
diplomatic relations between the two countries.'' The editorial 
concludes: ``It is not likely that the ROK and the United 
States will accede to President Kim's proposal at this stage, 
which President Kim will no doubt be aware of. Therefore, while 
unwilling at heart to abolish the radiochemical laboratory, he 
is urging the United States to improve its relations with North 
Korea, using the light-water reactor card, stressing that North 
Korea has no intention of developing nuclear weapons, according 
to an analysis of relevant government officials.'' 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries on page 3 a 900-word 
article by Kim Pong-son entitled: ``The Government's View on Kim 
Il-song's Remark Hinting of Abolishing the Radiochemical 
Laboratory.'' 
  Reporting that the ROK Government reaction was mixed on his 
remark, the article notes those who have an upbeat view hold 
that ``such a remark is an indirect expression of change in its 
previous stance that `North Korean-U.S. talks are an 
prerequisite for additional inspections,''' whereas those with a 
negative view maintain ``his remark clearly shows that North 
Korea intends to earn more time by adding conditions regarding 
light-water reactors.'' 
  The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO carries on page 3 a 700-word 
article by Kim Yong-ha. Noting the huge differences in their 
capacity to extract plutonium from light-water reactors and 
graphite reactors, the article notes ``if North Korea's 
intention to install light-water reactors is true, it can be 
interpreted as an intention to suspend its nuclear development.'' 
  The article concludes: ``The clearest sign that can be seen 
from President Kim Il-song's remark is that `North Korea's 
nuclear card' is becoming ineffective. Hence North Korea's 
gesture implies that North Korea, being driven into a corner, 
seeks an exit that serves its interests.'' 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 5 an 800-word 
article by Washington-based correspondent Yi Sang-sok entitled: 
``Kim Il-song's Pacifying Remarks.'' 
  Enumerating on North Korea leadership's moderate tone, the 
article writes: ``With this pacifying attitude, North Korea 
aims to earn the time necessary for nuclear development, to 
disintegrate the ROK-U.S. cooperative system, and to deepen the 
confrontation between ROK hardliners and moderates.'' The 
article continues that Kim Il-song ``in effect asked the world 
to take him at his world that he had no nuclear ambitions, 
giving no hint of welcoming IAEA inspections.'' 
  Noting that the North Korean nuclear issue is back to the 
point it had started, the article analyzes ``in view of this, 
there is a dominant feeling around U.S. political circles that 
the United States should not be entangled in President Kim 
Il-song's pacifying attitude and that it should firmly push 
ahead with its previous scenario of imposing pressure if North 
Korea fails to meet the early-May deadline.'' 
  The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries on page 3 an 
800-word 
editorial entitled: ``We Should Not Get Dazzled by a Peace 
Offensive.'' 
  Referring to U.S. and Japanese media welcoming Kim Il-song's 
remarks for its moderate tone, the editorial questions: ``How 
can we believe that he is telling the truth? What we need now 
is his remark that North Korea will unconditionally accept 
overall inspections and carrying it into practice. To one's 
great regret, he has not uttered a word on this even though he 
has made countless flowery remarks.'' 
  Denouncing North Korea's invariable communist-type disguised 
tactics, the editorial holds that ``regardless of such a peace 
offensive, the deployment of Patriot missiles and the Team 
Spirit exercise should not be suspended. The UN Security 
Council should adopt sanctions against North Korea unless it 
accepts IAEA inspections. What is more, we should show more 
positive interest in the human rights condition in North Korea 
to make North Korea acknowledge the necessity of accepting 
nuclear inspections and holding inter-Korean talks.'' 
  Recalling the recent student demonstrations opposing the 
deployment of Patriots, the editorial warns that ``the people 
and public sentiment should not be deceived by North Korea's 
peace offensive.'' The article concludes that ``in this 
perspective, the members of the National Federation of General 
Student Councils should remember that they are playing into 
North Korea's hands.''

<F P=106> [``Hanminjon on Development of Fast Breeder Reactor in S. </F>
Korea''--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 5 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of 
the South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) published 
a white paper on 2 May denouncing the South Korean puppet clique 
for stepping up nuclear armament through the development of the 
fast breeder reactor, according to the Seoul-based radio Voice 
of National Salvation. 
  The South Korean rulers' design to develop the fast breeder 
reactor began in the '80s and they started the development of a 
prototype reactor in cooperation with Japan at the beginning of 
the '90s, the white paper said, and continued: 
  The ``government'' authorities signed an agreement on 
cooperation in the field of atomic energy with Japan on 25 May 
1990, and agreed with it to ``promote the exchange and joint 
study of atomic technologies.'' It discussed with Japan ``the 
joint promotion of the development of technologies of the 
next-generation atomic reactor'' at the ``South Korea-Japan 
consultative meeting on atomic energy'' held on 9 November 1990. 
  At the tete-a-tete between Kim Yong-sam and Morihiro 
Hosokawa 
in Kyongju on November 6, 1993, they agreed in secrecy to 
proceed with the joint development of nuclear weapons on 
condition that South Korea makes a clean sheat of Japan's past 
crimes. 
  The ``government'' authorities decided to invest about 2,000 
billion won in the researches and development of atomic energy 
including the development of the fast breeder reactor and began 
developing a prototype reactor in 1992. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique are now running about to get 
the international community to recognize the ``legality'' of the 
development of the fast breeder reactor. They hosted an 
``international symposium on the reactors of next generation'' 
in October 1993, in Seoul at which they wrested a promise from 
some officials of the International Atomic Energy Agency to 
``cooperate in the development of the next-generation reactor in 
South Korea.'' 
  Noting that the development of the fast breeder reactor 
accelerated by South Korea with desperate efforts together with 
Japan, though its economic advantage and stability are not 
guaranteed in the world, is motivated by their design of nuclear 
arms development, the white paper explained the following 
reasons: 
  Firstly, the development of the fast breeder reactor makes 
it 
possible to breed large quantities of plutonium necessary for 
nuclear bombs. 
  Secondly, it offers a ground for justifying the purchase of 
plutonium from other countries. 
  Thirdly, the fast-breeder reactor must be accompanied by 
reprocessing facilities. This fully explains why the Kim 
Yong-sam group is trying so desperately to possess reprocessing 
facilities through the development of the fast breeder reactor. 
  Fourthly, the development of the fast-breeder reactor itself 
is a process of nuclear bomb development. The designing of the 
fast-breeder reactor is identical with that of nuclear bombs 
from the technical point of view. 
  This stark fact clearly proves that it is none other than 
the 
South Korean ruling group of traitors that reduced to a piece of 
waste paper long ago the joint declaration on denuclearization 
agreed on between the North and the South and have been hell 
bent on nuclear arms development on the Korean peninsula. 
  The white paper demanded that the South Korean authorities 
eliminate the pressurized heavy water reactor and the 
multi-purpose research reactor and, at the same time, promptly 
stop the development of the fast-breeder reactor and that the 
international reactionary forces including Japan discontinue 
working hand in glove with the Kim Yong-sam group in the 
development of the fast breeder reactor directly linked to the 
production of nuclear bombs. 
  It expressed the hope that the unbiased opinion of the world 
will persistently keep tabs on the development of the 
fast-breeder reactor and nuclear weapons by the South Korean 
rulers and invigorate the activities for checking it.

  [Text] Seoul, April 28 (YONHAP) -- Japan's envoy asserted 
Thursday that his country would not go nuclear even if North 
Korea possessed atomic weapons. 
  ``This (North Korean) nuclear issue has become a top 
priority 
issue and a symbolic issue for Japanese-Korean cooperation in 
the international society,'' Japanese Ambassador to Seoul Toshio 
Goto said at a luncheon hosted by the Korean Council on Foreign 
Relations. 
  ``I would like to assure you, new Prime Minister Hata stands 
firm on this issue,'' he said. 
  Asked about the possibility of expanding bilateral military 
cooperation through such means as conducting joint drills, the 
ambassador said it could happen but first required careful 
consideration. 
  South Korea's defense minister visited Japan recently and 
agreed on exchange calls by naval vessels, an important symbolic 
gesture for two countries whose history is stained by more than 
three decades of colonial rule that culminated with the end of 
World War II. 
  ``...It's a matter requiring delicate consideration from the 
standpoint of the sentiments of the Korean people,'' said Goto, 
referring to the colonial years. 
  He voiced hope that a time will come when people on both 
sides can cooperate ``without prejudice.'' 
  Certain media reports were raising ``unfounded suspicions'' 
that Japan might change its non-nuclear policies should North 
Korea develop nuclear weapons, the envoy pointed out. 
  ``There is no such possibility that Japan would decide to go 
nuclear... I would like to stress here that nuclearization 
would run counter to Japan's national interest,'' said Goto. 
  The ambassador highlighted regional stability and three key 
tasks involved--encouraging coordination to settle regional 
conflicts, cooperating in promoting region-wide political and 
security dialogue, and enhancing the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) forum as the region's economic engine. 
  On bilateral terms, he agreed with South Korean President 
Kim 
Yong-sam's view that an accurate recognition of history is the 
only way to point their ties in a future-and world-oriented 
direction. 
  ``I fully share the view that the Japan-Korea relationship 
is 
moving beyond the bilateral framework and has reached the phase 
of promoting cooperation in the Asia-pacific region and, 
moreover, in the international community,'' he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 7 KYODO -- Japan will aim to establish a 
new nuclear fuel system that burns off part of spent nuclear 
fuel, plutonium and uranium together without separating the 
toxic chemicals, government sources said Saturday [7 May]. 
  The Atomic Energy Commission, the country's top atomic 
energy 
policy board led by Science and Technology Agency chief Mikio 
Omi, has made the decision, taking into consideration outcries 
both at home and abroad over Japan's policy to reproduce pure 
plutonium that can be used for nuclear weapons, the sources said. 
  Under the new nuclear fuel cycle, curium and neptunium, 
which 
have a long half-life and thus are difficult to dispose of, will 
be extracted from radioactive waste contained in spent nuclear 
fuel along with plutonium and uranium to be used as new fuel, 
they said. 
  The current system separates spent nuclear fuel into 
plutonium, uranium and radioactive waste. 
  The reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel was initially 
developed as military technology to make atomic bombs and there 
are recent concerns over use of plutonium for making nuclear 
weapons. 
  North Korea, suspected of developing a nuclear arsenal, is 
allegedly using the technology. 
  The new system, however, will not reproduce pure plutonium 
that can be used for nuclear bombs, thus reducing concern over 
nuclear proliferation, the sources said. 
  The commission hopes to develop the technology by 2030, the 
target year for use of plutonium-fueled fast-breeder reactors, 
after constructing an experimental reactor and a reprocessing 
factory for the new system, the sources said. 
  On 5 April, Japan's new plutonium-fueled fast-breeder 
reactor 
``Monju'' reached criticality, the point at which the reaction 
in fissionable material is sufficient to sustain a chain 
reaction. 
  Japan has made fast-breeder reactors a cornerstone of its 
nuclear power policy. Such reactors produce more fissionable 
material than they consume. 
  At present, some 30% of Japan's electricity is 
generated by 
42 nuclear reactors throughout the country.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Yi Chang-min from Tokyo] </F>
  [Text] Quoting the U.S. military and aviation journal, AIR 
SPACE DAILY, in a report dispatched from Washington, Japan's 
SANKEI SHIMBUN reported on 23 April that soon after developing 
the Nodong No. 1 missile, North Korea is developing a new 
missile which has a shooting range of up to 6,000 km. 
  According to SANKEI SHIMBUN, there are two types of the new 
missile. This was discovered in February at the North Korean 
Sannudong Research Development Institute through the U.S. 
reconnaissance satellite. Each type consists of two-stage 
rockets [kakkak idanisikuro toeoitta]. 
  The U.S. intelligence authorities stated that the new 
missile 
was named, Taepodong-1 and Taepodong-2. They estimate that the 
first stage is 18 m long and its diameter is 2.4 m and the 
second stage is 14 m long and its diameter is 1.3 m. 
  SANKEI SHIMBUN reported: ``If the shooting range is 6,000 
km, 
Guam as well as all of Japan, including Okinawa, can be a 
target. AIR SPACE DAILY reported that if North Korea is 
successful in developing this missile, it will emerge as a big 
military power in the East Asian region.'' 
  SANKEI SHIMBUN also reported: ``Great Britain's military 
journal, JANE'S DEFENSE WEEKLY, reported that the missile North 
Korea is developing has a shooting range of over 2,000 km. 
However, this is the first time it is revealed that its 
shooting range is in fact 6,000 km. If North Korea completes the 
development of this missile, the entire East Asian region would 
be greatly threatened.''

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 27 Apr (EFE) -- Manuel Mondino, 
president of the National Commission for Atomic Energy (CNEA), 
has said that Argentina wants to consolidate its position as a 
nuclear technology exporting country, adding that the agency 
exported for a total of $300 million between 1977 and 1993. 
  Mondino told EFE: ``Over the past two decades the country 
has 
won a place in the competitive international market, thanks to 
the quality of its exports and the degree of technology 
transfer.'' 
  The CNEA is a state organization, associated with private 
capital to design and develop projects and conduct research in 
the areas of nuclear power plants, fuel cycles, radioisotopes, 
radiation, and technology services. 
  Argentina has signed several agreements for the peaceful use 
of nuclear energy, and is a member of various safeguard 
agreements. Nuclear agency representatives exhibited the results 
of their latest research efforts during a recent American 
continent experts' meeting in southern Argentina. 
  ``On that occasion we explained that the CNEA provided 16 
percent of the electricity consumed by the country through its 
two nuclear plants, which places us in first place as an energy 
producer,'' Mondino said. 
  The CNEA president said that on the occasion there were also 
lectures on the application of radioisotopes, which is a vital 
product for the early diagnosis of several diseases, in nuclear 
medicine. 
  In the area of exports, the most important deals were the 
export of reactors to Peru, Algeria, and Egypt, the sale of 
uranium dioxide to Germany, and a plant for the production of 
radio-medicines to Cuba. The CNEA also closed deals with 
Canada, Iran, Rumania, and Turkey. 
  Argentina produces 8 percent of the total world Cobalt 60 
production. Cobalt 60 is used in nuclear medicine, the 
preservation of food, the elimination of pests that attack crops 
and livestock, and to improve industrial yields. The 
radioactive material is produced in the Embalse Nuclear Plant, 
and the surplus is exported to the United States, France, Chile, 
Colombia, Mexico, and Belgium, Manuel Mondino said. 
  Regarding Argentina's development of nuclear projects for 
peaceful use, as compared with the rest of Latin America, 
Mondino said that his country and Brazil ``have the most 
advanced projects, closely followed by Mexico.'' 
  Mondino expressed enthusiasm for the plant to irradiate 
waste 
that is being developed by CNEA scientists, stressing that Chile 
has shown interest in the project because it is redesigning its 
own sewage disposal network. 
  The CNEA has 5,682 agents throughout the country. Among its 
most important installations are two operating nuclear plants, 
one nuclear plant in an advanced state of construction, three 
atomic centers, one reactor for the production of radioisotopes, 
and one plant for food irradiation. 
  The agency also has a cell for the production of sealed 
cobalt 60 sources, two heavy water plants--one experimental and 
one industrial--one uranium enrichment plant, one Nuclear 
Medicine School, and one Physics and Nuclear Energy Institute, 
which is considered one of the most important in Latin America.

  [Text] National Commission for Atomic Energy (CNEA) sources 
have estimated that the Atucha-2 nuclear power plant, which has 
been under construction since 1982, will become fully 
operational in 1997, and not next year, as CNEA Chairman Manuel 
Mondino announced recently in a news conference. 
  The Atucha-2 reactor was forged in Japan and welded in 
Germany. The 1,000 metric ton reactor was manufactured of fine 
steel and a manganese-molybdenum-nickel alloy. The 14 meter 
high reactor has been stored for seven years in a warehouse 200 
meters from the area where it will be finally installed. 
  During German Research and Technology Minister Paul 
Krueger's 
visit to Atucha-2 on 4 May, many spiderwebs on the reactor's 
support base were noticed. A heart crossed by an arrow, drawn 
with chalk on the reactor's metallic structure, was also 
noticed. The CNEA sources admitted that ``no date has been set 
for the installation'' of the reactor. CNEA sources involved in 
the project's management emphasized that the engine room and the 
engineering work have nearly been completed, but admitted that 
the assembly stage is stuck. Atucha-2's estimated cost totals 
about $3 billion. 
  The sources said that the project, which is under 
construction a few meters from the Atucha-1 nuclear power plant 
near the Parana de las Palmas River in Buenos Aires Province, 
has been delayed ``considerably.'' The sources estimated this 
delay at ``four to five years.'' In the sources' opinion, 
Atucha-2's construction problems arose from the Malvinas war, 
when the international loans that had been agreed for its 
financing were discontinued, and later from budget constraints 
and the hyperinflation of 1989. 
  The sources said that Atucha-2 ``was a result of the maximum 
use of Atucha-1.'' The sources explained that the new reactor 
``is 20 percent larger'' than Atucha-1, but will produce ``more 
than double the energy of Atucha-1.'' While Atucha-1 has an 
output of 350 megawatts, using natural uranium and heavy water 
with 233 fuel elements, Atucha-2 will use the same system but 
will produce 745 megawatts with 451 fuel elements.

  [Text] Brasilia -- Admiral Mario Cesar Flores, head of the 
Strategic Affairs Secretariat [SAE], yesterday characterized as 
``foolishly absurd'' allegations that the sale of Brazilian 
enriched uranium to the U.S. company Nuexco would endanger the 
reloading of the Angra-1 nuclear plant. In its latest edition, 
the magazine ISTOE reports that Nuclear Industries of Brazil 
(INB) has sold the enriched uranium at a cost of $1.7 million. 
  Flores said: The transaction will not bring any problems to 
the Brazilian nuclear program. He added that he would release 
today all the figures concerning Brazilian uranium reserves. 
  Flores said he learned about the transaction after the 
contract had been signed, as INB is empowered to make these 
sales on its own. He said this was a good deal for INB, as the 
money it has obtained through this sale will make it possible to 
reactivate already this year the uranium mine of Pocos de 
Caldas, in Minas Gerais State. 
  Regarding the possibility that the Brazilian uranium could 
be 
diverted to countries like Iraq, Iran, or India--to make 
bombs--Flores was even more emphatic. 
  He said: It would be paranoid to believe that Canada, one of 
the most active verifiers of the use of nuclear energy, could 
divert the material. Canada, Flores said, is the ultimate 
destination of the Brazilian uranium sold to Nuexco.

  [Text] In a controversial operation, which is suspicious in 
some experts' opinion, Brazil is participating in the explosive 
international atomic market. On 20 April, ISTOE learned about a 
deal (renting yellow cake [two preceding words in English] and 
enriched uranium to the U.S. enterprise Nuexco) that left the 
Brazilian strategic reserves at zero. Some suspect that Brazil 
may be indirectly feeding an Iraqi or Iranian atomic bomb. 
Others warn about the risk Brazil is running of being the victim 
of a ``nuclear swindle [calote nuclear].'' Brazilian Nuclear 
Industries (INB) President Roberto Franca celebrated the 
transaction as the first step toward the financial independence 
of the state-owned uranium-producing company: ``I made an open 
commercial transaction through bidding.'' For $1.7 million, the 
INB rented out the fuel for periods ranging from six to 18 
months. The fuel will begin being returned in August. Nuexco 
sent the Brazilian fuel to Canada. Professor Bernardino Ponte, 
who was an International Atomic Energy Agency surveyor for 12 
years, found the news strange. He said: ``Canada does not use 
uranium oxide produced by Brazil, which has a low 
concentration.'' To those who want to solve the mystery, 
professor Ponte suggests they read the book YELLOW CAKE [two 
preceding words in English] by journalist Alexandre Baumgarten, 
who was murdered in 1982. In the book, the journalist discusses 
the trafficking in Brazilian uranium to be used in the 
production of atomic bombs in Iraq, Iran, and India. Strategic 
Affairs Secretary Admiral Mario Flores told ISTOE on 22 April: 
``I do not believe Canada would accept playing this sort of 
role. Canada is one of the most active controllers of the use of 
nuclear energy.'' Adm. Flores was asked about the issue before 
the business was closed. The INB president confirmed: ``I 
believe the material was really transferred to Canada because 
part of the fuel that was stored in Brazil was shipped to 
Canada.'' According to Franca, what Nuexco did with the fuel is 
not Brazil's problem. Corvette Captain Sergio Porto da Luz, 
adviser to the Chamber of Deputies National Defense Committee, 
doubts the negotiation's strategic virtues. The problem is that 
the 200 metric tons that must be returned in August are crucial 
for the production of pills to recharge Angra-1. This operation 
is expected to take place in the beginning of 1995. ``The U.S. 
company may not have fuel available at the established moment 
and decided to pay us for it in cash,'' Porto da Luz fears. 
Franca answers: ``Nuexco has given us all guarantees, 
particularly because it has its own mines.'' The funds from the 
transaction have been used to reactivate the Pocos de Caldas 
mine. By July, the pills stock will have been reduced to 80 
metric tons, which is less than half the pills necessary to 
recharge Angra-1.

<F P=106> [Article by Virginia Silveira] </F>
  [Text] Sao Jose dos Campos -- By the next decade Brazil 
should be joining the restricted club of countries that have 
mastered the most advanced technology to obtain the enriched 
uranium (235) that is used as fuel for nuclear reactors. The 
Institute of Advanced Studies (IEAv) at the Aerospace Technical 
Center [Centro Tecnico Aeroespacial--CTA] in Sao Jose dos Campos 
is already producing uranium 235 through the method of 
separating isotopes with laser beams via atomic vapor. 
  The separation of uranium isotopes is an activity that 
currently demands heavy investment. Colonel Hugo Pereira 
Chaves, director of IEAv, says that among all the methods 
currently known (gaseous diffusion, ultra centrifuge, molecular) 
for uranium enrichment, the atomic process is best from the 
economic point of view. This method, he adds, is also best from 
the ecological point of view, given that the radioactive waste 
may be recycled and treated. 
  The most widely used fuel element for nuclear reactors is 
uranium, whose natural composition is as follows: 99.3 percent 
is made up of an isotope with an atomic weight of 238, and 0.7 
percent of an isotope with an atomic weight of 235. Most of the 
existing nuclear reactors need ``enriched'' uranium. This means 
increasing the 235 isotope content, which is radioactive, to a 
concentration of greater than 3 percent. 
  The physical principle of the atomic separation method is 
based on the different abilities of the 235 and 238 isotopes to 
absorb light from well defined frequencies, that is, light of 
specific colors. The atomic process works with uranium in its 
metallic form. The separation of 235 and 238 isotopes undergoes 
three stages. 
  The metallic uranium is placed in a container heated to 
3,000 
degrees [scale not specified]. The uranium vapor generated by 
the high temperature is absorbed by laser irradiation at a 
frequency that attracts the 235 atoms to a metallic plaque, from 
which they are extracted. 
  According to Col. Pereira Chaves, the IEAv has attained a 
level of 50 percent uranium enrichment during the process of 
exciting the 235 molecules. Extraction of uranium, however, has 
yet not been possible at such a level, he said. He did not 
reveal the level of enrichment already attained by the IEAv, as 
it is an industrial secret. 
<H5>  The United States </H5>
  Col. Pereira Chaves reported that the United States has 
already managed a 30 percent enrichment in its tests--of which 
very little is known. The industrial development of this 
process is still not known in any other country of the world. 
The Americans have already decided that the atomic separation 
process with laser beams must be adopted by the United States on 
a commercial scale in the next century. 
  Atomic separation, Pereira Chaves said, will replace the 
current gaseous diffusion process that is underway. ``Between 
1972 and 1988 the United States invested $700 million in the 
atomic process. An industrial scale demonstration will require 
an additional $946 million,'' he added, according to IEAv 
estimates. 
  The IEAv, according to Pereira Chaves, has allotted only $71 
million to its uranium enrichment program with laser beams since 
1981. Part of these resources, nearly $41 million, were 
financed by the Aeronautics Ministry, and the rest came from the 
National Nuclear Energy Commission (CNEN), the Funding Authority 
for Studies and Projects (Finep), and the Strategic Affairs 
Secretariat. 
  For the project to develop satisfactorily, Pereira Chaves 
said, the institute would need something between $1.5 and $2 
million per year. In the past three years, however, the 
institute has been receiving less than $1 million per year for 
the maintenance of its entire project structure, Chaves said. 
<H5>  Molecular Process </H5>
  In addition to the atomic process, the IEAv has concentrated 
its research on uranium enrichment by laser beam through the 
molecular method. The molecular method, according to Chaves, 
uses uranium hexaflouride gas (UF6) mixed with a lighter gas 
(carrier gas). The mixture is accelerated in a supersonic (high 
speed) pipe, and is then cooled to a temperature of minus 190 
degrees Celsius. 
  ``Under those conditions UF6 molecules that have the uranium 
235 isotope absorb laser radiation of a different frequency than 
that absorbed by the molecules of uranium 238,'' Chaves said. 
  The molecular process, according to the director, is also 
being studied as one of the alternatives that could be adopted 
by Brazil for the industrial-scale production of uranium 235. 
``The advantage of the molecular separation method is that 
there is a facility in Resende (Rio de Janeiro), which was built 
under an agreement signed with Germany in 1979,'' he said. 
  Another advantage is that researchers are already familiar 
with the entire corrosion process caused by UF6, which they have 
learned to control. The metallic uranium corrosion process 
(used for atomic separation) is still unknown to them. 
<H5>  Lower Cost </H5>
  Research with the atomic separation method, however, is at a 
more advanced stage, as it has succeeded in separating uranium 
235, though at a laboratory level. Production costs, according 
to the IEAv, are 23 percent lower than those for traditional 
enrichment processes. ``Until 1985, a total investment of $9.7 
million was considered necessary for the operation, maintenance, 
research, and development of the atomic separation method,'' 
Chaves said. 
  The figures, according to Chaves, are included in a study 
made in the United States and published by the NUCLEONICS WEEK 
newspaper. Based on the study, the United States invested in the 
expansion of its uranium enrichment capacity through the laser 
separation process. 
  In Brazil, uranium 235 is produced at an industrial scale by 
the ultracentrifuge method, which is based on the mass 
difference between isotopes. The Navy Ministry has a research 
center that specializes in producing uranium through this method.

  [Text] Colombo, April 28 (AFP) -- Sri Lankan authorities 
released an Egypt-bound cargo of chemicals detained at the main 
port here on suspicion that it could be used to make nerve gas, 
officials said Thursday. 
  The three containers of phosporous pentasulphide arrived 
here 
four weeks ago from the Indian port of Bombay for transshipment 
to a consignee in Egypt, port officials said. 
  The Defence Ministry ordered the containers to be released 
this week following investigations regarding the end use of the 
cargo. The chemical is used to make pesticides and is also an 
ingredient in the manufacture of nerve gas. 
  The Egyptian embassy in Colombo had informed the authorities 
that the cargo was intended for the legitimate use of one of its 
chemical plants, the Dyestuffs and Chemicals of Kafar Dawar.

<F P=106> [By Satish Kumar] </F>
  [Text] Dr. A.Q. Khan represents the national pride of 
Pakistan. The story of his achievement is the story of 
Pakistan's nuclear bomb, the story of how faith and 
determination on the part of a nation can convert a dream into a 
reality. 
  Dr. Khan was not an ordinary person, but his own country 
took 
time in recognising his talent. A highly qualified engineer in 
physical metallurgy, and a specialist in uranium enrichment, 
when he applied for a job in the Pakistan Steel Mills in Karachi 
in 1967, he was rejected. He returned to Holland to pursue 
further research in his field. 
  After India's nuclear explosion of May 1974, Dr. Khan wrote 
to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto offering to return to Pakistan. Mr. 
Bhutto examined the background and experience of Dr. Khan and 
encouraged him to return. When finally, in January 1976, Dr. 
Khan accepted the offer and declared his intention to return, 
Mr. Bhutto got excited, thumped his fist on the table, and said, 
``I will see the Hindu bastards now.'' 
  The project was launched straightaway. An important element 
in its implementation was the selection of an appropriate site 
for establishment of the uranium enrichment plant. Dr. Khan and 
his colleagues inspected a number of sites, viz. Haripur, 
Tarbela, Hassan Abdal, Cambelpur, Fateh-Jang, Bannu, Kohat, 
Sargodha and others. Finally, Kahuta, a few miles south-east of 
Islamabad, was chosen because of being close to the capital, 
located in the middle of the mountains, and somewhat isolated. 
  The accomplishment of uranium enrichment up to the desired 
level has rightly been described as the story of a miracle by 
Mr. Zahid Malik, a close friend of Dr. A.Q. Khan, and the author 
of the book ``Dr. A.Q. Khan and the Islamic Bomb.'' The story 
began in August 1975 when the Pakistan Embassy at Brussels 
enquired about high frequency inverters from a company in 
Holland. These highly sensitive electronic instruments control 
the spinning of the centrifuge and Pakistan procured them from 
at least four countries. 
  Western authors who have been trying to chase Pakistan's 
nuclear weapons programme admit that tracking these Pakistani 
purchase was difficult detective work. The purchasers' expert 
handling of secret purchases and their daring and expert actions 
always placed then one step ahead of the foreign detective and 
secret agencies deployed to stop the supply of nuclear materials 
to Pakistan. In the business of nuclear equipment which has 
billion of dollars worth of black market, nobody in 1978 knew 
what Pakistan was up to. Regular purchases had started in 1976. 
  In March 1979, the CIA informed the U.S. government that 
Pakistan was commissioning the centrifuge plant for the 
production of weapon-grade uranium and that the already 
installed inverters were sufficient for ten thousand centrifuges 
enough to produce one hundred and fifty kilograms of enriched 
uranium per year. This was sufficient for six to seven nuclear 
bombs. America immediately took up this matter through its 
Ambassador. The economic aid that was to be given to Pakistan 
in April 1979 was gradually reduced and finally stopped 
completely. 
  Pakistan's dream of having a nuclear bomb goes back to the 
days of the 1965 war, when it felt disillusioned by America's 
suspension of military aid. About a year and a half to two 
years after the war, a request was made by Pakistan for a 
plutonium reprocessing plant to a French firm, SGN [expansion 
unknown]. Within a few weeks of becoming the President and 
Chief Martial Law Administrator of Pakistan, Zulfiqar Ali 
Bhutto, on 20 January 1972 convened a meeting of selected 
Pakistani scientists from home and abroad at Multan. At this 
meeting, Mr. Bhutto stressed upon the scientists his wish for 
Pakistan to be a nuclear power as soon as possible. 
  His chief scientific advisors, Dr. Abdus Salam and Dr.I.H. 
Usmani declared it to be impossible because Pakistan did not 
have the basic infrastructure. Mr. Bhutto would not take ``No'' 
for an answer. According to Mr. Bhutto's Press Secretary Khalid 
Hassan, Mr. Bhutto decided to remove Dr. I.H. Usmani and 
appointed Mr. Munir Ahmad Khan as the new Chairman of Pakistan 
Atomic Energy Commission. According to Zahid Malik, Dr. Abdul 
Salam and Mr. Munir Ahmad Khan further convinced Mr. Bhutto that 
a reprocessing plant was necessary for the Pakistani bomb. 
Therefore in 1972, Pakistan entered into negotiations and made 
a formal request to France for the procurement of a reprocessing 
plant. In March 1973, Pakistan entered into an agreement and 
signed a contract with the SGN for the preliminary design of the 
plant. 
  On 8 August 1976, U.S. Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, 
came to Pakistan and offered to supply 100 A-7 Corsair jet 
fighters if it agreed to cancel the reprocessing plant deal. At 
the same time, stoppage of all military and civil aid under 
Symington amendment was threatened if it did not. In April 
1977, Bhutto, while addressing the National Assembly, attributed 
the political agitation against him to ``a certain power against 
Pakistan.'' Later in 1977, when Mr. Agha Shahi was in Paris to 
work out the modalities of executing the contract, the French 
Foreign Minister offered to supply a ``Coprocessing Plant'' in 
place of the Reprocessing Plant.'' 
  In January 1978, President Carter again visited Paris and 
held discussions with Mr. Giscard d' Estaing. Prior to his 
departure for Paris, Mr. Carter had already granted landing 
rights for the French ``Concorde'' at Kennedy airport. The 
prospect of the sale of Concordes to the U.S. seemed more 
lucrative to France than the sale of a reprocessing plant to 
Pakistan. France began to yield to American pressure. On 5 
June 1978, France finally decided not to execute the contract. 
  But Pakistan's efforts to acquire nuclear weapon capability 
through the uranium route continued unabated. Pakistan acquired 
this capability by the end of 1986 and found a way of announcing 
it to the world in early 1987. Zahid Malik has taken great 
pains to establish the point that Indian journalist Kuldip 
Nayar's interview with Dr. A. Q. Khan on the basis of which 
Nayar had written that Pakistan had already acquired the atomic 
bomb was ``concocted.'' The interview which took place in 
Islamabad on 29 January 1987 was published by the London 
OBSERVER on 29 February. Mushahid Hussain who took Nayar to 
A.Q. Khan's house has also been castigated. One wonders, 
however, how a massive intrusion of this sort into a most highly 
guarded secret domain of Pakistan could have taken place without 
some official design behind it. More so, when the context was 
the ongoing military exercise by India called the 'Brasstacks'. 
In any case, General Ziaul Huq did not lag behind in announcing 
to the world through a series of interviews particularly the one 
with the TIME magazine in March 1987, that Pakistan had acquired 
the nuclear capability.

<F P=106> ['Adnan Husayn report: ``Kurdish Sources Tell AL-SHARQ </F>
AL-AWSAT: The Chemicals Smuggled Into Iraq Came From Iran''] 
  [Text] London -- Iraqi Kurdish sources who wished to remain 
anonymous have stated that the two trucks loaded with materials 
used in the manufacture of chemical weapons seized last month by 
the police of the Kurdish Government in the northern region of 
Iraq came from Iran. 
  The sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday that the 
Kurdish 
drivers of the two trucks admitted that they crossed the border 
from Iran and intended to drive the two trucks to areas under 
the control of the Iraqi Government and deliver them to an Iraqi 
party known to them. 
  Officials of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK], led by 
Jalal Talabani, had stated on Saturday that on the night of 
17-18 April the Kurdish police impounded the two trucks, which 
were carrying 19 tons of sodium phosphate, which is used in the 
production of chemical weapons, and mustard gas, and that ``the 
consignment was exported from the PRC and passed through a 
country neighboring Iraq.'' 
  The Kurdish sources said that the two trucks were seized in 
the area of Darbandikhan, which is only a few kilometers from 
the Iraqi-Iranian border. They declined to give more details 
because ``the interrogation of the two drivers is not over yet.'' 
  Under the second Gulf war ceasefire terms, Iraq is not 
allowed to produce, import, or use chemical, biological, or 
nuclear weapons, or long range missiles or materials used in the 
manufacture of such missiles.

  [Text] Official sources in New Delhi have clarified that 
there is no change in India's stand on Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty. New Delhi believes that nuclear nonproliferation must be 
universal, comprehensive and nondiscriminatory. The sources 
said the prime minister had categorically stated this position 
in his recent address to the Army commanders conference. They 
were reacting to press reports that the BJP [Bharatiya Janata 
Party] leader, Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee, expressed the view that 
the prime minister's observations over the issue needs 
clarification. 
  The sources said Mr. Narasimha Rao in his speech made it 
clear that any attempt to restrict India's nuclear option will 
be unacceptable and unrealistic in view of Pakistan having 
acquired nuclear weapon capability. There is also proliferation 
of such weapons recently.

<F P=106> [Article by political commentator Nikhil Chakravartty] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. has a whole battery of think tanks with an 
enormous amount of material at their disposal. And these think 
tanks are supposed to help in the moulding of public opinion and 
Government policies. And yet, when it comes to the actual 
application of policies, the U.S. Administration has been 
displaying an amazing lack of coherent thinking and mature 
understanding of the impact of its policies on the rest of the 
world. It has hardly covered itself with glory in Somalia nor 
has Bosnia added a feather on its cap. 
  In this rather messy background, the Deputy Secretary, Mr. 
Strobe Talbott's Indo-Pak safari last week has been a rather 
pedestrian exercise without an indication of any fresh thinking 
on South Asia. Granted that he was far more cautious and 
sophisticated than his impulsive under-secretary, Mr. Talbott's 
visit has been no path-breaking achievement. Mr. Talbott came, 
saw but hardly conquered. 
  In New Delhi, he bravely tried to assure that Washington 
intends ``to cultivate good relations with India for the sake of 
that relationship and to do the same with Pakistan.'' In other 
words, New Delhi should not be concerned with what Washington 
would be doing with Islamabad. Consequently, it is not India's 
business to bother about what the U.S. would be giving or 
denying to Pakistan: That should be treated as a bilateral 
issue between two countries, just as Pakistan should treat any 
Indo-U.S. deal as of no consequence for itself. On paper this 
sounds like good logic, but in reality it is naive indeed. The 
strategic importance of Pakistan in the Pentagon's future 
projections in Central Asia and the Persian Gulf zone has hardly 
gone down even after the end of the Cold War. The potential 
turbulence that stretches from Xinjiang to Iran calls for a U.S. 
foothold in this region, and that is what Pakistan can provide. 
  During Mr. Talbott's talks, there was a feeling in New Delhi 
that the ingenious formula--offering of F-16s in exchange for 
Islamabad agreeing to cap its nuclear weapons programme--would 
be a nonstarter as no Government in Pakistan would agree to give 
up its nuclear weapons programme. However, after his Islamabad 
talks--which he described as a ``total success''--it is becoming 
clear that what the Clinton Administration is immediately 
concerned with is the disposal of the F-16 fleet along with 
other lethal items for which the one-time waiver of the Pressler 
Amendment is being pressed in the U.S. Congress. 
  The immediate compulsion of the Clinton Administration is to 
sell the product of the giant aircraft and missile manufacturers 
in the U.S. Senator Pressler has already exposed this with 
regard to the F-16 offer to Pakistan. And if Mr. Narasimha Rao 
is willing, President Clinton will readily offer to sell another 
consignment of aircraft to India. Let us not forget the rumpus 
over our cryogenic rocket deal with Russia which was bullied to 
go back on its contract to make room for the promotion of the 
American rocket products. And now the pressure is being mounted 
on New Delhi to abandon its missile programme. ``If you need 
rockets or missiles, we are ready to sell our stuff, why make 
yours'' seems to be the latest jingle in the U.S. arms bazaar. 
  The question arises: What about the widely advertised 
mission to cap Pakistan's nuclear weapons programme? In New 
Delhi, Mr. Talbott elaborated on the deal with Pakistan as ``an 
equation'' with ``strict unambiguous conditionality''--of which 
one half is the release of F-16s and the other half is 
``agreement in advance to a veritable cap'' on Pakistan's 
nuclear programme. Two days later at Islamabad, he threw more 
light. In carefully worded comments it was stated that the U.S. 
and Pakistan have agreed to go in for ``further consideration'' 
of the U.S. proposal. And this joint effort would be for 
``developing our approach'' to the equation. And for all that 
only a ``preliminary accord'' has been reached. And when 
further consideration was completed and ``an approach'' was 
developed, then they would come to produce the goal of capping, 
then reducing and finally eliminating nuclear weapons. A fairly 
protracted process which may even outlive the Clinton 
Administration. But the supply of F-16s would be immediate. 
  In New Delhi, Mr. Talbott sought to underplay the issue of 
F-16s as having only ``a potent symbolism'' in the South Asian 
region and urged the need ``to look beyond symbolism to 
reality.'' However, such pseudophilosophical profundities can 
hardly conceal reality. With protocol politeness Mr. Narasimha 
Rao had to gently warn Mr. Talbott that the supply of F-16s 
would be a matter of serious concern for our defence and this 
would compel the Government to go in for counter-measure 
jeopardising Indian economy. 
  The nonproliferation drive of the U.S. Administration hardly 
impresses the Third World. Behind the tenacious drive to disarm 
Iraq and current threats to North Korea, as also the pressure on 
India and Pakistan to abandon the nuclear option, there is a 
clear move to perpetuate the dominance of the nuclear powers 
over those countries which are denied these weapons--the very 
basis of the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty]. 
  Secondly, Washington's calculation that if Pakistan could be 
cajoled to agree to cap its nuclear weapons programme then it 
will be possible to persuade India to follow suit, is made 
invalid by fact that the nuclear threat to India does not come 
from Pakistan alone but also and more seriously from China, and 
now from other Central Asian countries particularly Kazakhstan 
which has a portion of the huge nuclear stockpile of the former 
Soviet Union. And why should India leave out the danger of 
nuclear threat from Israel which had once made a sneaking attack 
on Pakistan's nuclear arsenal at Kahuta? So, if one is really 
serious about dispelling Indian threat perception, one has to 
extend much beyond a two-country arrangement between India and 
Pakistan, or even the latest version of 5+2+2 (i.e., the five 
permanent members of Security Council including China, plus 
Japan and Germany along with India and Pakistan) that is heavily 
weighed against India. 
  Thirdly, the Indian perception is that the nuclear powers 
are 
not serious about reversing the nuclear arms race towards 
nuclear disarmament. Had they been genuinely serious about 
nuclear disarmament, then why did they not readily respond to 
Rajiv Gandhi's initiative when he placed before the UN special 
session in 1988 a detailed and realistic Action Plan--which was 
updated by Mr. Narasimha Rao in his intervention before the 
special session of UN Security Council in 1993? There has 
always been a condescendingly polite appreciation of the Indian 
initiative without any effort at any serious follow-up 
discussions by the big bosses of the nuclear corporate club. 
  Here is a foretaste of the new form of world overlordship 
through nuclear monopoly of a select group of powers with the 
U.S. at the head, and to ensure economic domination through 
control of world trade as GATT represents, in which 
discrimination is sought to be practised even through 
non-economic means. In this context, the arms sale is first on 
the priority list for the U.S. The message is clear for all VIP 
visitors to Washington: Don't bother to make your own weapons, 
that is only a fetish. Instead, buy it from us.

<F P=106> [By Avinash Singh] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, 19 April -- Further trials of the 
indigenously-developed intermediate range missile, Agni, have 
been postponed indefinitely. The temporary capping of the Agni 
missile programme is being attributed to a financial crunch. 
  The Defence Research Development Organisation (DRDO) had 
sought Rs. [rupees] 50 crore to conduct three more test launches 
in the near future, but the Government has not responded to the 
request. The postponement of the Agni programme is being 
interpreted as a concession to American concern about India's 
missile programme. 
  The Clinton Administration has demanded that India's 
short-range missile, Prithvi, which is ready for induction in 
the armed forces, should also not be deployed. Army sources, 
however, say that they do not have any specific instructions 
about Prithvi as yet. 
  Defence sources further claimed that India was not going to 
abandon its strategic missile programme under American pressure, 
but admitted that some delays would now be inevitable. Agni has 
been successfully test-launched thrice between 1989 and 1994. 
But at least six more tests are needed before it can be 
considered for deployment. 
  Meanwhile, India is learnt to have finalised purchase of 30 
fourth generation MiG-29M fighter aircraft from Russia. These 
highly sophisticated, look-down-and-shoot-down planes are 
equipped with the Doppler radar system which function in all 
weather conditions. 
  The finalisation of the MiG-29M deal is evidently India's 
response to the proposed sale of 38 F-16 deep-penetration 
aircraft to Pakistan by the U.S. The MiG-29's will be acquired 
in two batches, with a score of planes joining the Indian Air 
Force over a three-month period starting in May. 
  Known for their extreme manoeuvrability and high visibility 
range, the fly-by-wire Tumansky R-33D turbo engine-fitted 
MiG-29M's are rated to be better than the F-16's in most 
respects, except for their armament load capacity. The Russian 
planes, however, cost a fraction of their American counterpart, 
and the price of the MiG deal is estimated at Rs. 270 crores. 
  There is every possibility that India may start getting the 
MiG-29M even before the U.S. Senate gives the nod for supply of 
F-16's to Pakistan. 
  Highly placed sources confirmed that the purchase order for 
MiG-29M's was placed during the visit of Army Chief General B.C. 
Joshi to Moscow in March this year. However, officials in South 
Block said the Chief of the Army Staff had gone to Moscow to 
hold talks on spares that have not been forthcoming since the 
disintegration of the former USSR. 
  But the officials did not rule out the possibility of buying 
MiG-29M's to augment the MiG-29 fleet. The Mikoyan series 
aircraft are comparable to the American F/A-18 Hornets. They 
are very effective against low-flying targets because of the 
shoot-down facility. 
  The MiG-29's have a combat radius of 1,150 km (620 nautical 
miles) in a single sortie as compared to the F-16's 845 km. The 
Russian aircraft has a maximum speed level of mach 2.23, which 
is equal to 2,335 kmph or 1,260 knots. 
  The F-16's, however, have nine external pylons and can carry 
an armament load of up to 4,700 kg. This is more than the 
MiG-29's capacity of 3,600 kg, which are loaded on to six pylons. 
  But the MiG-29's are fitted with AA-10 and AA-11 air-to-air 
missiles and also have additional cavities to carry bombs and 
rockets. The Doppler radar and a six-barrel 30 mm Gattling-type 
guns are the other distinct features of the MiG-29. 
  Meanwhile, it is understood that India has sorted out the 
problem of spares for the armed forces. Sources disclosed that 
India okayed the MiG-29M deal only after an assurance that the 
Bangalore-based Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) would serve 
as the service outlet for all types of MiG's for the entire 
South and South-East Asia region. 
  Sources in the South Block said India was in the process of 
selling a particular series of the aircraft to Malaysia, whose 
Air Force personnel were trained in Pathankot recently. 
  India is also in the process of negotiating with the 
Malayasian Government on the sale of Russian Mi-25 attack 
helicopters. These helicopters are used for anti-armour warfare 
and can provide an airborne platform to achieve tactical battle 
area supremacy. The Mi-25 is believed to be an answer to the 
American Cobra helicopter. 
  Meanwhile, Agni, successfully test-launched twice, has 
signalled India's emergence as a growing power in the entire 
Asian region. The 1,800-2,500 km range missile can cover a large 
part of China, West Asia and South Asia. 
  Even if the Americans are likely to use every means to make 
India sign the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), 
ministerial sources said India would not under any circumstances 
abandon its missile programme. But the sources did not rule out 
a delay in the missile plans. 
  While the Agni continues to be India's best bargaining 
block, 
the Prithvi missiles are ready for induction in the Army.

  [Text] New Delhi, Feb 20 -- India's efforts to master 
ballistic missile technology has crossed a major milestone with 
the successful test of the Agni missile on Saturday. This was 
the third test of the two-stage missile. Agni was first 
successfully tested in May 1989 and the second partially 
successful test took place in April 1992. 
  Possessing a potential range of over 2,000 km, the Agni is 
India's first Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM). 
Described as a ``technology demonstrator,'' the missile can 
deliver one tonne payload. This is twice the estimated weight of 
nuclear warhead and the success means that India can deliver a 
nuclear strike if it chooses to weaponise. 
  The focus of the launch was to guide better end more 
accurately, a sophisticated re-entry vehicle or the warhead of 
the missile. ``Other gains are incidental,'' says a highly 
placed source at the Defence Research and Development 
Organisation (DRDO). 
  But, Saturday's test is also expected to prove an extension 
of the missile's range, though no confirmation on this count is 
as yet available. Experts account the 19 tonne weight of the 
missile, which is five tonnes more than the weapon tested in 
1989, primarily due to the excess fuel it is carrying. This 
would be translated to an extended range, it is presumed. 
  The 21-metre Agni tested on Saturday is also longer in 
comparison to the weapon launched in 1989. The Agni on its 
maiden flight had measured 19 metres. 
  While modifications on the warhead are possible, prelaunch 
indications suggested that the re-entry vehicle is of a 
manoeuvering type. Small fins were attached at the base to 
facilitate the warhead's movement. 
<H5>  Challenging Task </H5>
  Controlling the flight path of the re-entry vehicle is a 
particularly challenging task. The warhead which moves towards 
the target at a rapid speed crosses the earth's atmosphere. 
Making the warhead withstand the high temperatures (around 3000 
degree Celsius) it encounters poses a major challenge to 
scientists. Keeping the warhead stable during this phase is also 
vital. 
  One of the unique features of the Agni re-entry vehicle is 
its heat shield. A carbon-carbon composite heat shield enables 
it to withstand temperatures 5,000 degree Celsius. In addition, 
the heat shield is ablative. It melts and chars and its outer 
layers peel off. It takes away the heat, layer by layer. 
  Guiding the warhead is also difficult because the vehicle 
during its final phase can be jammed. However, DRDO scientists 
have discounted this possibility. 
  Apparently Agni's re-entry vehicle resembles the Pershing II 
warhead. The guidance technology on the Pershing II is so 
accurate that the warhead lands within 45 metres of the target 
area. 
<H5>  Two-Stage Configuration </H5>
  The Agni posses a unique two-stage configuration. While the 
missile is hurled into space by a solid fuel booster, the liquid 
fuelled second stage leads missile warhead to its predesignated 
target. 
  With premium on accuracy, the choice of a liquid second 
stage 
was deliberate. 
  DRDO scientists, under whose overall supervision the missile 
programme is being carried out, agree that the first stage 
rocket is based on an indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle 
(SLV-3) design. The liquid fuel stage is based on the Prithvi 
design. But auxiliary propulsion is added to the missile to 
enable it to fly higher.

<F P=106> [Article by C. Raja Mohan: ``Agni: India Should Stand Up to </F>
Pressures''] 
  [Text] Washington, Feb. 20--With the successful third test 
firing of the medium range Agni, an important phase in India's 
missile development has come to an end. The scientific community 
of the Indian Defence Research and Development Organisation 
(DRDO) has delivered in a grand manner. It has proudly propelled 
India into the league of great powers. Now it is up to the Prime 
Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, and the military services to 
put the missile technology that has been demonstrated to the 
best possible political and strategic use. There has been some 
political dithering and vacillation in the past in the face of 
external pressures to forego the development of India's missile 
technology. Hopefully that phase of hesitation too has come to 
an end. 
  The DRDO has now successfully demonstrated the key aspects 
of 
long range missile technology, effective integration of 
different stages of the medium range missile and re-entry of the 
warhead and its terminal guidance have now been proven. The Agni 
missile can deliver a payload of one tonne over a distance of 
1,500 km or a smaller warhead of 500 kg over a longer range of 
2,500 km. The design of such payloads for the missile is well 
within the competence of Indian scientists. 
  The leadership of the Indian military and political 
establishment must now take the appropriate organisational, 
financial and political decisions in conformity with the 
national security needs. The late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi 
had approved three test firings of the Agni missile as part of 
technology demonstration of India's long range missile 
capabilities. Mr. Rao now has the opportunity to transform this 
technological demonstration into all important strategic asset. 
  To be sure, India must expect some negative reaction, 
particularly from the U.S. to the successful testing of the Agni 
missile. It is certainly likely that Washington may not lift the 
sanctions against the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) 
that expire in May 1994. If New Delhi can signal that it is 
fully prepared to brush aside these pressures and proceed with 
the operationalisation of the Agni missile, it will earn 
grudging respect from the U.S. The alternative option of giving 
up the development and deployment of the Agni can only be 
disgraceful. 
<H5>  Humiliating MTCR Conditions </H5>
  It is possible that the U.S. will dangle the prospect of 
lifting the sanctions on ISRO and even a membership of the 
Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), if India is ready to 
forego its missile development. Any such proposal deserves 
nothing but contempt. India should not allow the U.S. or any 
other nation to set Indian technological priorities. Besides, 
the conditions for entry into the MTCR have been humiliating. 
When Argentina was allowed into the MTCR last year, the U.S. 
demanded and got rights to verify the complete destruction of 
all components of its Condor missile programme. Brazil had last 
week applied for the membership of the MTCR. It remains to be 
seen what kind of conditions the U.S. will demand before it lets 
in Brazil. India can join the MTCR only on one basis: in return 
for abiding by the export control regulations of the MTCR, New 
Delhi will have full access to the civilian space technologies. 
India must make it clear it will accept restrictions on its 
missile development and deployment only as part of a larger 
global regime of missile disarmament. 
  There is little reason for India to be frightened by the 
current rhetoric on nonproliferation or the immediate threats to 
impose more restrictions on technology transfer to India. The 
debate on export controls in the U.S. is undergoing a major 
transformation. The American business community and the Commerce 
Department are pushing for a substantive liberalisation of 
export controls, driven as they are by the need to promote 
American jobs and exports. The U.S. Defence Department, too, 
motivated by the desire to protect the competitiveness of 
American aerospace industry and its technological base, has come 
round to supporting the loosening of export controls except in 
the so-called ``choke-point'' technologies that are critical for 
the manufacture of mass destruction weapons. Traditionally, the 
Pentagon has been the most vocal opponent of liberal American 
technology exports. As India expands its abilities to develop 
and export space related technologies including missiles, the 
U.S. will find that it is in its own interest to get India 
participate in the missile technology control regime, as an 
equal partner. In the final analysis, it is only those countries 
that can show the determination to stand up to pressures that 
will be accepted as great powers. 
  The Indian Government has two options on the Agni missile. 
It 
can decide on early deployment of a limited number of medium 
range missiles. Or it can authorise more tests of the missile to 
improve the overall design and reliability. The improvements in 
particular could focus on a better ``aspect ratio,'' by reducing 
the height of the missile and increasing its width. 
  India is said to have appropriate capability in solid 
propulsion technology to achieve this. In any event, further 
work on the improvement of the missile and an early decision on 
its operational deployment need not be mutually exclusive.

  [Text] New Delhi, March 2--The Government has decided not 
to induct Agni, the indigenously-developed intermediate range 
ballistic missile (IRBM), into the armed forces at this stage, 
though the missile was successfully test-fired on February 19 as 
a technology-demonstrator. 
  Instead, the Government for the time being, wants efforts 
concentrated on refining certain parameters of Agni, it is 
learnt. 
  When the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme was 
conceived in 1983 and the decision taken later to have three 
test-firings of the missile, it was not decided what to do after 
this was achieved. However, the issue was considered in some 
detail at the highest political level recently. 
  India's decision to develop its own IRBM was frowned upon by 
the West, especially the United States, because a missile of 
Agni's capability can deliver a nuclear payload and leave the 
enemy with no response time. However, no foreign power has made 
any public pronouncement after India's capability was proved in 
the IRBM field last month. Nor did other Governments express 
themselves through official or diplomatic channels. 
  It is to be seen if the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State 
for 
South Asia, Ms. Robin Raphel, broaches the subject when she 
comes here for discussion this month. 
  Among the parameters of Agni that the decision-makers want 
refined is the guidance system of the missile so as to reduce 
the Circular Error Probable (CEP). The effort is to increase the 
accuracy of the IRBM.

<F P=106> [Article by Atul Aneja, New Delhi: ``Agni Takes India's </F>
Progress to the Skies''] 
  [Text] The successful third test of the Agni long range 
missile last week has set the stage for a potential Indo-U.S. 
row on nonproliferation. But with growing domestic, industrial, 
and academic pressure, Washington may find it difficult to arm 
twist New Delhi into scrapping its ambitious missile programme. 
  After the confirmation on 19 February that India is 
technologically moving towards a position from where it can 
deliver a nuclear device at a target about 2000 km away, the 
U.S. may announce new penalties to halt India's drive to master 
intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) know-how. New 
American laws on high-technology exports are round the corner. 
  Indications from Washington suggest that the two-year ban on 
the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), imposed in May 
1992, may be extended. With nonproliferation high on the Clinton 
Administration's agenda, Agni's successful test may only prompt 
the U.S. to order further restrictions. Already, the Clinton 
Administration has said that it wants to discuss with New Delhi, 
the steps to ``meet our overall nonproliferation goals and the 
requirements for waiving sanctions'' against ISRO. 
  But, the U.S. has to contend with a powerful counterview. In 
the American debate on export controls, it is being argued that 
the restrictive regimes have not had the desired impact on 
proliferation. On the contrary, countries subjected to 
restrictions have gone ahead with their programmes. Some of them 
have even emerged competitors to American industry. The Council 
of Competitiveness, an organisation including chief executives 
of American business, university representatives and organised 
labour members, in a recent report has brought these arguments 
into focus. The study notes that the denial of super-computers 
to India and China have been a ``significant factor'' in driving 
these countries to master super-computing capabilities. 
  ``The Chinese manufacturer poses a threat to western 
manufacturers in the Chinese market, and the Indian manufacturer 
has enjoyed a modest success in the world market,'' the study 
observes. 
  On other counts too, the curbs have made a negative impact 
on 
American industry. As many as 120,000 American jobs were 
affected by these decisions, the study estimates. The U.S. also 
lost $6,000 millions in exports. 
  Though the U.S. Congress is willing to look afresh at the 
export controls, the State Department continues to feel that 
restrictive regimes are useful tools. Nevertheless, Congress is 
considering a new export control package. Some of the ideas call 
for liberalising and simplifying export codes. Others aim at 
tightening restrictions on dual use exports. 
  Despite the predominance of indigenous material in Indian 
missiles, American restrictions can affect India in a few 
critical areas. Indian missiles are still dependent on 
sophisticated American components. Some advanced chips, which 
can stand the rigours of military use, are purchased from the 
U.S. 
  Indigenising is difficult because of Western curbs on the 
supply of machinery to fabricate components of such precision. 
From a commercial viewpoint, the enormous costs inhibit this. In 
addition, purchases from third sources are difficult. Most 
countries which possess these items are members of the 
multilateral Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). 
  Theoretically, India, at the moment, will have to contend 
with the U.S.-led regime of western technology restrictions, 
targeting Indian space and missile programmes. Restrictions 
inhibiting the flow of sophisticated technology are imposed 
under the MTCR. 
  Made up of 22 countries, the regime aims at restricting 
missile development outside a predominantly western club. It 
provides for punitive action against any country developing 
missiles which can cause mass destruction more than 300 km. 
away. Penalties are enforced, mainly by denying advanced 
technology, which have both a military and civil use. 
  MTCR members have or are expected to frame domestic laws 
restricting export of dual use knowhow. Laws have to be 
supplemented by lists of such technologies. Thus, after the MTCR 
charter was signed by seven developed countries in 1987, the 
U.S. passed the National Defence Authorisation Act (NDAA). In 
May 1992, the NDAA was invoked to impose a two-year ban on 
technology sales to the Indian Space Research Organisation along 
with the Russian space agency, Glavkosmos. Validation licences, 
which could permit American companies to sell items to the ISRO 
were put on hold for two years. It was argued that the cryogenic 
engines ISRO intended to procure from Russia could enable India 
to develop an Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile (ICBM). The 
GSLV [Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle] rocket which 
would enable India to launch satellites in the geosynchronous 
orbit could also yield the strategic missile, it was felt. 
  Apparently, American fears were reinforced when India, for 
the second time in April 1992, tested the Agni missile. The 
SLV-3 rocket which was developed by the ISRO was modified to 
become the first stage of the Agni. 
  Countering the American argument, India felt that the real 
U.S. concern was not security. A Geosynchronous Satellite Launch 
Vehicle would have enabled India to quickly enter the lucrative 
satellite launch market, so far the domain of the West, though 
China has broken into these exclusive western preserves. 
  Tightening the screws on India further, the U.S. Commerce 
Department in 1992, made suitable amendments to target specific 
space and missile related projects. Amending the Export 
Administration Regulations (EAR), an interim order was passed to 
lay new restrictions on a range of projects. U.S. companies were 
told to obtain special validation licences destined for the Agni 
and Prithvi projects of the integrated guided missile 
development programme. 
  ISRO's SLV-3, the Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle (ASLV), 
the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and the (GSLV) also 
featured on this list. Since the restrictions were project 
centred, all enterprises in the U.S. and India which contributed 
to them were affected. As many as 78 institutions and 107 Indian 
industries contribute to the ISRO's programmes. 
  After trying to scare India with the restrictions it can 
impose, the U.S. may now make a fresh bid to force the country 
to join the MTCR. But, this move is unlikely to succeed. Like 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), which India rejects, 
the MTCR is also discriminatory. Countries have joined the MTCR 
either as members or adherents. Unlike the original seven 
western trading partners, adherents do not participate in MTCR 
meetings. Neither are they involved in moving amendments and 
resolutions. It is extremely doubtful that adherents find access 
to sophisticated western technology, as a reward for 
acquiescence. Argentina, a MTCR adherent, had faced the 
humiliation of destroying the assemblies of the Condor 2 
launchers, in the presence of Western verifiers. 
  After Agni's launch, India will have to choose from one of 
the three options: convert Agni from a test to a ``battlefield'' 
weapon, continue with experiments after stating an intent only 
to develop and demonstrate IRBM technology, or drop the project 
altogether. 
  One view making the rounds among defence experts here is 
that 
India should develop the missile, but not fit it with warheads. 
Retaining the option to ``arm'' the missile can also signal that 
India is driven not by belligerence, but with a desire to 
enhance security. This non-provocative deployment, with the 
deterrence spin-off in the neighbourhood, is also consistent 
with India's global position on missile development. Destruction 
of missiles is the responsibility of all, not of a select few. 
  The move will have a significant impact. The powerful 
commercial lobby in the U.S. which says that restrictions on 
large countries, such as India and China, are potentially 
counterproductive, can also be armed with a new argument. This 
could well open the debate among MTCR members to include India 
as a missile power, and not as an adherent. There is a free 
exchange of technology among key MTCR members. But the regime 
enjoins on the members not to supply these items outside their 
fold. 
  In the face of possible retaliation from the U.S. scientists 
have argued that there are ways to break the restrictions 
log-jam. One way to overcome dependence on items such as 
military grade chips, is to buy commercial grade components, 
which are available more easily. Technologically, it is feasible 
to use these chips in military hardware, after screening them 
suitably.

<F P=106> [Article by K.K. Katyal: ``Agreement with IAEA on Tarapur </F>
Plant''] 
  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 23 -- Through an agreement with the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], India has volunteered 
to keep the Tarapur nuclear power plant under international 
safeguards. India was not legally bound to do so, after the 
expiry of the arrangement with the U.S. for the supply of 
enriched uranium, but has taken this step as a goodwill gesture 
-- in the belief that it would be helpful in the efforts to keep 
the plant operational with the help of the reprocessed spent 
fuel at a later stage. 
  The draft agreement, submitted by India in December last to 
the IAEA, has been approved by its board of governors at a 
meeting which began in Vienna on 21 February -- according to 
information received by the Department of Atomic Energy and, 
perhaps, also by the External Affairs Ministry. 
  The temporary bilateral arrangement between India and the 
IAEA, that had been in force after the expiry of the 10-year 
agreement with the U.S. on 24 October last, has now been put on 
a permanent basis. Before that date, the safeguards were 
applicable at a trilateral level, involving the U.S., the 
original supplier of enriched uranium. 
<H5>  Chequered History </H5>
  The Tarapur arrangements have a chequered history. While the 
agreement was still valid, the U.S. found it difficult to 
continue the supply because of the imperatives of its domestic 
legislation. As a result, France came in the picture -- and 
enriched uranium was made available to India, though under the 
framework of the Indo-U.S. agreement. France, as such, had no 
independent standing and it stopped the supplies at the end of 
the time-frame envisaged in the agreement with Washington. 
  The agreement with the IAEA has no major immediate 
implications, as the plant has enough fuel in stock to keep it 
going for two to three years. India was under no obligation to 
approach Vienna with the voluntary offer, but it was done as a 
confidence-building measure and to dispel misunderstandings 
about the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. This, New 
Delhi calculates, would also facilitate its job in working for a 
long-term arrangement as the plant has a life of another 15 
years. 
  The U.S. -- as also France -- had expressed unwillingness to 
extend the arrangement after 24 October 1993. Also, the U.S. did 
not accept India's plea to secure enriched uranium from other 
sources. The other course open to India was to reprocess the 
spent fuel which, in any case, posed major storage problems. 
This point figured in the discussions in Washington in September 
last by then Foreign Secretary, Mr. J.N. Dixit. The U.S. was 
non-committal -- it neither said ``no,'' nor ``yes.'' Efforts in 
that direction are to be continued. 
  The acceptance of continued international safeguards for the 
Tarapur plant does not mean a departure from India's stand 
against the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty or its variants, 
suggested by the industrialised nations. The Vienna agreement 
means extensions of the international safeguards for Tarapur, 
that had been in force for the last 10 years -- now under a 
bilateral arrangement.

<F P=106> [Editorial: ``Accord on Tarapur''] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi has done well to subject the use of 
indigenous fuel for the Tarapur atomic power station to 
international safeguards by involving the International Atomic 
Energy Agency, thereby sending out the message that there is 
nothing unduly secretive about the country's nuclear 
installations. It will be noted that the gesture is voluntary 
and it should make it easier for the Agency to respond. Ever 
since the Americans and then the French stopped the supply of 
enriched uranium for the Tarapur plant, governed by the 30-year 
agreement drawn up in 1963, its continued operation has been 
uncertain because of the non-availability of basic fuel. The 
only way to keep the plant was to substitute mixed-oxide fuel 
(MOX) for the imported uranium, the availability of MOX being 
dependent on plutonium extracted from the plant's spent fuel. 
Washington earlier tried to put a spoke in the wheel by claiming 
ownership of the spent fuel at the plant, but it could not make 
any headway because of New Delhi's determined opposition. The 
decision to put the indigenous fuel under IAEA [International 
Atomic Energy Agency] inspection is one way of showing the world 
that Indian nuclear expertise has come of age, not something 
that can be expected to be warmly welcomed in many parts of the 
World. 
  Indeed, the old game of smearing the Indian nuclear effort 
has once again begun in right earnest as the date for review of 
the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty comes up. In October last 
year, the CIA is reported to have told a Senate committee that 
India had ``no valid economic case to make for separating 
plutonium or enriching uranium,'' letting the cat out of the bag 
with the lament that ``reprocessing and enrichment would make 
India independent of foreign suppliers of enriched uranium.'' 
More recently, a report was run on the popular U.S. television 
programme ``Sixty Minutes'' which said that the Indian nuclear 
programme was a ``dangerous failure'' which could lead to health 
problems. It quoted a British academic as saying that there was 
no other country ``with as bad a record'' in this field. Such 
comments can be contrasted with the recent statement of the IAEA 
Assistant Director-General for Nuclear Safety that India had 
made substantial progress in implementing the required safety 
standards ``which are comparable to internationally acceptable 
levels.'' The assault on the country's nuclear programme is 
likely to increase and the propaganda will intensify in the 
months ahead and for a variety of reasons. The idea to involve 
the Agency is a good one and the involvement should be extended.

  [Text] Coimbatore, Feb. 20--``India is leap-frogging in the 
most guarded area of space technology and, through its 
progressive self-reliant approach, it has shown to the world its 
capability in the launch vehicle technology,'' Dr. S.C. Gupta, 
Member, Space Commission, said on Sunday. 
  Delivering the GRD [expansion not given] endowment lecture 
at 
the PSG [expansion not given] College of Technology here, Dr. 
Gupta said that with the successful launching of SLV-3 
[Satellite Launch Vehicle] and the ASLV [Augmented Satellite 
Launch Vehicle] and the nearly-successful launch of the PSLV 
[Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle], the launch vehicle technology 
in India had truly arrived. Operationalisation of the ASLV and 
the PSLV was round the corner, as the ASLV-D4 would be launched 
by April and the PSLV-D2 in the middle of this year. 
  With the operationalisation of the PSLV, India would be able 
to launch its own remote-sensing satellites of one-tonne class. 
This was equivalent to launching 2.5-tonne class satellites on 
low earth orbits. This meant India had built up from 40-kg 
capability in 1980 to 100 kg capability in 1992 and would have 
2,500 kg capability in 1994. 
  Though much advancement had been achieved in the space 
technology economic and technological constraints were still 
felt. Funding was liberal but it was being done on a 
project-to-project basis. It was imperative to broaden the 
resource base. By involving academic and research and 
development institutions, on the one hand, and industries, on 
the other, the resource base could be enlarged. 
  To a question by Mr. G.R. Karthikeyan, managing trustee of 
the PSG Institutions, Dr. Gupta said India's approach was 
``progressive self-reliance'' in space technology. Whatever 
technology available elsewhere would be supplemented with 
domestic resources. The objective was to attain 
cost-effectiveness and time-effectiveness. 
  Mr. Karthikeyan suggested introduction of Tamil medium in 
management courses.

  [Text] New Delhi, April 20 (HTC) -- In a cautiously worded, 
handwritten note, an official spokesperson of the Government of 
India today sought to clarify the report on the Agni missile 
plan being temporarily capped, which appeared in this newspaper 
today. 
  While describing the report as ``unfounded and baseless,'' 
the note asserted that ``after the recent successful flight of 
Agni, all the objectives set for this mission have been 
achieved.'' This, in fact, suggests that the project is being 
abandoned altogether, whereas the HT report had only said it was 
being put on hold for the present. 
  While not contradicting that the DRDO [Defense Research and 
Development Organization] had been denied the [Indian Rupees] Rs 
5 crore it had sought for conducting three more Agni test 
flights, the official note says that fund requirements of 
different departments are decided ``in relation to progress of 
various projects. Individual scheme-wise allocation is not 
undertaken at the Government level.''

  [Text] The first indigenously-built cryogenic engine to 
power the Geostationary Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) of the 
Indian space programme will be ready in four years. 
  Impressed with the performance of the Space Department, the 
Government is likely to double the Plan outlay on space research 
in the on-going Eighth Plan period from 1,804 crore to 
Rs.[rupees] 3,500 crore, originally sought by the department. 
  This is revealed in the tenth report submitted to the 
Standing Committee of Parliament on Science and Technology, 
comprising members of both Houses. 
  Though the contract between the Indian Space Research 
Organisation (ISRO) and the Russian space organisation 
Glavkosmos had been modified under the threat of U.S. sanctions, 
ISRO was in a position to develop indigenous technology, the 
panel said. 
  The committee was informed by the representatives of the 
Space Dapartment that industries like L&amp;T [Larsen and 
Toubro], 
Walchand Industries, Godrej, NOCIL [National Organic Chemical 
Industries Limited] and Andhra Sugar had been involved in 
producing various subsystems and hardware for the cryogenic 
engine. 
  Secretary (Space) Dr. K. Kasturirangan informed the 
committee 
that according to the modified agreement with Glavkosmos, in 
addition to the supply of the originally planned two cryogenic 
blocks, two more flight stages and two ground models would be 
supplied in lieu of the technology transfer, within the original 
agreement cost of Rs. 235 crore. 
  ISRO has also exercised the option to buy three additional 
cryo stages at a cost of U.S. $3 million each as negotiated in 
the original contract, Dr. Kasturirangan told the committee. 
  The committee was also informed that, for this programme, 
the 
Government has approved an outlay of Rs. 245 crore. 
  The body wanted the Department of Space to make concerted 
efforts in this direction because with the realisation of the 
cryo stage, if the GSLV is operationalised, the Indian launch 
services would be priced much lower than the current 
international market price. 
  The indigenous cryogenic engine, burning liquid oxygen and 
gaseous hydrogen, will power the upper-most stage of the GSLV 
which will give ISRO the capability to launch 2.5-tonne class 
communication satellites into geostationary orbits. Such a 
capabilily, married to the ISRO's success in fabricating 
low-priced satellites, would provide the Indian space 
organisation a major slot in the international space launch 
market. 
  The committee was informed that the work relating to GSLV 
was 
proceeding and that, so far, 216 technologies or processes 
developed had been transferred to the firms. 
  ISRO representatives told the committee that the next flight 
of the PSLV (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle) would take place 
later this year. Asked about the reason for the failure of the 
PSLV's first flight last September when it failed to place the 
IRS-1E [Indian Remote Sensing-1E] satellite into orbit, they 
told the committee that the launch was ``almost a success'' and 
that barring a software implementation error, all the stages and 
their sub-systems had performed very well.

  [Text] Bandar Abbas (Hormozgan), April 26, IRNA -- The 
week-long ``Thamen al-A'emmeh'' missile maneuvers started in the 
strategic Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf waters Tuesday. 
  Surface-to-sea missile, warships and electronic units of the 
Armed Forces along with naval units of the Islamic Revolution 
Gaurd Corps (IRGC) are involved in the exercise, code-named 
after the 8th infallible imam of the Prophet's household, 'Ali 
Bin-Musa al-Redha whose birth anniversary the Muslim world 
celebrated this week (11 Dhu al-qa'dah 148 a.h. -- 765 a.d.). 
  Units participating in the exercise will stage marine 
warfare 
and launch attacks on hypothetical enemy targets and test new 
marine war tactics under the command of the Khatam al-Anbiya HQ. 
  Meanwhile the three repaired warships, Tiran, Khadang and 
Zobin, and also a repaired R-H [as received] helicopter -- all 
four which had sustained heavy damages during the Iraqi imposed 
war (1980-88) -- are taking part in the maneuvers. 
  Captain Rahimi who supervised the repairment of the damaged 
warships told IRNA in Bushehr today that the repairs have saved 
the country 15 million dollars. 
  Captain Nek-Payam also told IRNA that the R-H helicopter 
which was destroyed 70 percent by the enemy was repaired by 
Iranian experts at a cost of rls. [rials] 100 million. 
  According to the captain the helicopter will help sweep 
mines 
from the sea bed.

  [Text] Bushehr--JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI correspondent: We have 
begun to build the Bushehr Power Plant. 
  An informed source at the Bushehr Power Plant said this to 
our correspondent, adding that following initial agreements with 
the Russians a few months ago, their experts began working on 
the first unit of the Bushehr Power Plant early this [Iranian] 
year [beginning 21 March 1994]. This unit is to be completed in 
four years, and will have a 1,000-megawatt output. 
  He added: So far 30,000 tonnes of the power plant's main 
parts have been brought into the country from Germany and are 
being kept in suitable storage areas. About 7,000 tonnes of the 
main parts of the power plant, which have been paid for and 
legally belong to the Islamic Republic of Iran, have been packed 
and sent to ports, and are ready for shipment to Iran, but 
regrettably they are being held up because the German Government 
will not issue an export permit on the basis of empty pretexts. 
  He added that unfortunately there is no information on what 
state these parts are in. 
  The informed source said that fortunately 90 percent of the 
damage inflicted during the imposed war has been repaired by the 
able hands of Iranian experts and the remaining 10 percent is 
currently being repaired. 
  It should be noted that the agreement for the construction 
of 
the Bushehr Power Plant was signed on 10 Tir 1355 [1 July 1976] 
between the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization [IAEO] and 
Kraftwerk Union of Germany for 7.8 billion DM [German marks]. 
On the basis of this agreement, the German company was to build 
a nuclear power plant approximately 18 km southwest of Bushehr, 
consisting of two pressurized light water units, each with an 
output of 3765 thermal megawatts and 1296 megawatts. Of the 
aforementioned amount, Iran has paid 5.8 billion DM. In 
addition, separate agreements for supplying the necessary fuel 
and 200,000 cubic meters of pure water needed by the power plant 
were signed. Thus, a total of 137,394,000 DM and $43 million 
has been paid by the IAEO to Germany. 
  According to the same report, so far progress has been made 
on about 85 percent of the construction works, and about 65 
percent of the mechanical and electrical works in the power 
plant.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Dr. Reza Amrollahi, vice president </F>
for atomic energy and director of the Iranian Atomic Energy 
Organization, IAEO; Engineer Dr. Mashayekhi, IAEO international 
affairs adviser; and Dr. Mohammad Reza Ayatollahi, Iranian 
representative at the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA; 
by unidentified announcer and citizens in the weekly phone-in 
program ``In Line With The People, In Step With Officials'' -- 
live] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted including quotations from 
Khamene'i and Khomeyni about the futility of nuclear weapons] 
  Announcer: Could you please answer the question 
which was posed on whether the hostile propaganda of western 
media has had any negative effect on the course of the 
activities of the Atomic Energy Organization [AEO] and what 
steps are being taken to confront all that propaganda? 
  Amrollahi: We are witnessing a psychological war 
in the world by the news media of certain countries. If you 
watched CNN a few days ago you would have seen that a CNN 
correspondent came and asked one of the officials of our country 
-- I think it was Mr. Kharrazi [Iran's permanent ambassador] in 
the United Nations. He said: First, you have purchased 
submarines? Second, You have increased your defense budget. 
Third, you have nuclear capability. In other words, they have 
a number of presuppositions. It does not matter what the 
answers are. They only wish to instill certain ideas in the 
minds of their listeners. We see this very clearly. At least, 
I and all my colleagues feel this with all our being that they 
are not after finding out the truth. They only wish to 
indoctrinate those who are unfamiliar with our works, those in 
foreign countries, and wish to tell them that Iran wishes to do 
this or that. 
  I wish to ask a few questions of those who make such 
insinuations: Have we not signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty? Are we not a member of the IAEA? Do we not accept the 
nuclear treaty of the IAEA [as heard]? Why does the usurping 
Zionist regime not sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty? 
Why does it not accept the IAEA's nuclear treaty? Why do they 
not ask such questions of the latter? This shows that they have 
some ulterior motives, and they wish to insinuate certain things 
in the minds of the people abroad who are not in our country and 
who are not reached by our mass media. In brief, let me say 
that such hostile propaganda will have no effect on our work. 
However, I do not deny that they will influence the minds of 
the people who have nothing to do with us and who live outside 
our borders. [passage omitted answering a question about a small 
number of solar energy reactors which are planned for some 
remote villages outside the electricity grid]. 
  Announcer: There was a question about the use of 
nuclear energy in Iran. 
  Amrollahi: See. All our people know more or less 
that our most important aim is to complete our nuclear reactor 
which we have, which is incomplete. Eighty percent of its work 
is completed, and by today's estimate more than $10 billion has 
been invested in it. In my view, in any country where there is 
such an investment in a project eighty percent of which has been 
completed, any sane person would try to complete it so as to 
generate electricity by it. We have made this huge investment, 
and the whole world knows that a nuclear reactor only produces 
electricity. This is what we are after. Our country is short 
of electricity and the best return on our investment is to 
complete it and to make use of it. 
  Let me also answer the other question which was asked about 
who is completing it. Unfortunately, the Germans fell short in 
this connection. They did not help and did not finish this 
project. They have kept us waiting for 14 or 15 years. Finally, 
we signed a contract with Russia. Work has been started for 
some time and they are finishing it. [passage omitted on history 
of nuclear energy in Iran]. 
  Announcer: Dr. Amrollahi, when do you think the 
Bushehr reactor will be completed? 
  Amrollahi: God willing, according to the talks 
which we have with the Russians, it will be definitely completed 
in less than four years and will produce energy. 
  Announcer: Concerning [nuclear] disarmament -- 
although of course we cannot call it disarmament, let us say 
about nonproliferation -- Dr. Ayatollahi and Dr. Mashayekhi can 
you please tell us something in this connection? 
  Ayatollahi: [passage omitted on the dangers of 
nuclear weapons for the environment, the use of atomic weapons 
at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the nonproliferation treaty; 
asserting that not only the countries which do not have nuclear 
weapons should not produce them, but the big powers which also 
have them should get rid of them]. Concerning this western 
propaganda and the motivation behind that propaganda, all our 
nation, every hezbollahi member of the society knows the truth. 
However, let me refer to just one reason behind all this 
propaganda. This is my own personal analysis, and I may be able 
to produce some evidence for what I am saying. 
  After the collapse of the former Soviet Union the American 
spy agency [CIA] was made bankrupt. This is why you see the CIA 
director going to the U.S. Senate and beginning threats against 
the Islamic Republic of Iran. He engages in this propaganda 
claiming that the Islamic Republic of Iran is pursuing a policy 
for the production of nuclear weapons and that Americans should 
be vigilant. There he is trying to save himself from bankruptcy, 
he wants to prevent the closure of his organization, he wishes 
to safeguard the budget of his organization, and wishes to 
safeguard his own prestige. At the same time, he wishes to 
initiate a new propaganda line that the Islamic Republic of Iran 
poses a threat. 
  Yes, Iran objects to the western democracy which is 
following 
a domineering policy in the world in such an absurd way. It 
questions that system and threatens it with its logical 
arguments. The whole world knows this. However, in an attempt 
to cast aspersions on the Islamic Republic of Iran and to 
distort the truth and achieve their goals at least in the short 
term, they are engaged in this propaganda. Let me also say that 
we do not pay any attention to all this propaganda. It will not 
have the slightest effect upon the decisions of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran and Iran's nuclear industry. We know that 
their propaganda is flimsy and no one will believe them. The 
IAEA is the only official international agency which is composed 
of various nations and the Islamic Republic of Iran is also an 
active member. That organization expresses its views. We have 
also announced truthfully and bravely that we are not after such 
a policy. From the outset we have believed that the policy of 
[acquiring] nuclear weapons is wrong and we will not pursue a 
wrong path. If you are suspicious and have some evidence for 
your suspicion, come and inspect. We have no objection. So 
far, they have also come. We have invited them. They have come 
and inspected and have admitted and confessed [that Iran does 
not have nuclear weapons]. The admission of this official 
organization as an international authority as regards the 
nuclear industry is sufficient for us, even though western media 
engages in all sorts of propaganda. 
  Unidentified citizen: I would like to ask a 
question about the role played by the country's Atomic Energy 
Organization in supplying our electricity requirement? I would 
also like to ask what happened to the Bushehr nuclear power 
station, and will it boost the power generation when it is 
completed? 
  Mashayekhi: Bushehr nuclear power station 
comprises two 1250 megawatt units. It was started by the 
Germans before the revolution and it was 85 percent complete 
during the last days of the Shah's regime. Unfortunately it was 
abandoned by the German side. [passage omitted giving reasons 
for interruption of the project during the Iran-Iraq war]. 
  Today we are trying to reach an agreement with the Russian 
Government to complete the project. Of course work has started 
already and the Russians are studying the project so as to 
install their own equipment. God willing we will then see 
completion of the first project during the coming years. We can 
probably begin the operation of our first nuclear power station 
in four years time. 
  Announcer: God willing. Is it economical to 
depend on nuclear energy in Iran? 
  Mashayekhi: The world has answered this question 
already. You witness that most of the world countries are today 
striving to expand their nuclear power stations to generate 
electricity. Fossil fuel pollutes the environment and will run 
out. The world in the 21st century will have to face the 
problem of generating its electricity requirement by nuclear 
power. We are also one of those countries which should make the 
necessary investment today. [passage omitted]. The Supreme 
Energy Council has approved that we should supply 20 percent of 
the country's energy requirements by nuclear power stations. 
  Amrollahi: I wish to conclude the discussion by 
mentioning something about our proposal for the creation of a 
nuclear free-zone. The Islamic Republic of Iran is pursuing 
this proposal every year and has been doing so for a number of 
years. It is appropriate to mention here that the regional 
countries are siding with us gradually on this issue. The only 
real saboteur of this proposal is the regime occupying 
Jerusalem. May God's peace and mercy be upon you all.

  [Text] Damascus, April 30 (AFP)--An Iraqi Kurdish 
opposition group on Saturday alleged China was supplying Iraq 
with chemical weapons through a third country. 
  ``Kurdish police intercepted on the night of 17 April two 
trucks carrying 19 tonnes of sodium phosphate used to make 
mustard gas and chemical weapons,'' a statement by the Patriotic 
Union of Kurdistan (PUK) said. 
  The chemicals were smuggled into Iraq through a 
``neighbouring'' third country, according to the statement 
received here by AFP which did not identify the country. 
  The truck drivers ``admitted during questioning'' they were 
trying to transport the chemicals through Kurdish-controlled 
northern Iraq to regions controlled by the Iraqi central 
government.

<F P=106> [Silvia Aloisi report: ``Al-Qadhdhafi's Secret Weapon'' -- </F>
all Libyan place names as published] 
  [Text] Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi's deadly secret is hidden in 
the sandy desert, at Tarhunah, 65 kilometers south-east of 
Tripoli. It is here that the Libyan leader is having an 
enormous installation built for the production of chemical 
weapons, thus complementing the existing production plant at 
Rabta. 
  For years the U.S. secret service had suspected al-Qadhdhafi 
of planning to build a second chemical plant. Rabta 
technological center's Pharma-150 plant was detected by the 
Pentagon in 1988, thanks to photographs taken by the Keyhole 
satellite. It was immediately defined as ``the greatest 
chemical weapon production plant in the Third World. It was 
pointless for Tripoli's colonel to deny the facts and say that 
the plant was only a harmless pharmaceuticals factory.'' First 
Ronald Reagan and later George Bush repeatedly threatened to 
bomb the plant unless al-Qadhdhafi agreed to an international 
inspection. The use of force, however, proved unnecessary, 
since in March 1990 the Rabta plant was half-destroyed by a 
mysterious fire, which the Libyan authorities attributed to 
Western-instigated sabotage. 
  The Tripoli government has not forgotten American threats 
nor, above all, the allied bombing of Iraqi military 
installations during the Gulf War and, subsequently, in 1993. 
Al-Qadhdhafi's decision to have the suspect plant and materials 
transported to a new secret site was therefore predictable. 
This, in fact, would enable him to open the doors of the 
entirely rebuilt Rabta plant to UN inspectors, as a sign of 
goodwill toward the West. 
  The construction of the new Tarhunah plant was entrusted to 
the Jowfe state-owned enterprise, a bogus company which was set 
up to purchase the necessary equipment for building the plant 
and manufacturing poison gas. The plant, which is scheduled to 
become operational by 1995, will be capable of producing mustard 
gas at the rate of 1,000 metric tons a year, Sarin gas (90 
metric tons), and Soman gas (1,300 metric tons). All of these 
substances are highly toxic to human beings: A small drop is 
enough to kill an individual within a few minutes. 
  Suspicions concerning Tripoli's intentions were aroused by 
the discovery, in England, of a Jowfe purchase order for two 
chemical production installations. The contract, worth half a 
million pounds sterling (approximately 1.2 billion lire), had 
been awarded to the Multinational Engineering Group company, 
which is part of the British APV company. The deal was 
camouflaged by means of a three-way operation: Jowfe contacted 
APV's Malaysian subsidiary APV Hills and Hills, which passed on 
the order to its parent company in London. In addition to the 
equipment, the order included materials for gas production and, 
in particular, pinacolone alcohol, the basic component for the 
production of Soman nerve gas. 
  Other toxic substances were supplied to Jowfe by the Belgian 
company Hassco, based in Ostend. Among them, ethylene oxide, 
used for manufacturing mustard gas and incendiary bombs, and 
dimethylamine, a component of Tabun nerve gas. It is difficult, 
however, to draw up precise accusations since many toxic 
products used for chemical weapons are commonly used as 
fertilizers or pesticides, and are therefore not included in the 
international list of ``risk'' substances whose export is 
forbidden. Ethylene oxide, for example, is used for the 
production of industrial resins and detergents. 
  However, the nature of the Tarhunah plant, which is 
officially presented as a petrochemical complex, also seems to 
be confirmed by the type of materials bought for its 
construction. Libya is currently subjected to an international 
embargo because of its involvement in the 1988 terrorist action 
against a Pan Am Boeing 747 over Lockerbie. Tripoli is refusing 
to extradite the two Libyan agents who are suspected of having 
planted the bomb in the airliner. However, getting round the UN 
embargo was easy: In fact, the Jowfe company obtained -- from 
Switzerland -- the technical specifications for the construction 
of parallel underground tunnels, 150 meters long, designed by 
the Sauer engineering company of Salzburg (Austria). This type 
of tunnel is commonly used in other secret military 
installations. Furthermore, Libya purchased chemical weapon 
production equipment whose internal components are covered with 
enamel or teflon -- materials that are extremely resistant to 
corrosive toxic substances. A sophisticated Swiss 
air-purification plant -- protected by special fire-resistant 
materials -- and a computerized system enabling instruments to 
function automatically are considered further evidence for the 
military intended use of the Tarhunah complex. 
  Libya did not subscribe to the international convention 
against the proliferation of chemical weapons, which was signed 
in Paris in January 1993, and it has always refused to have its 
chemical installations open to international inspection. The 
Tripoli government supports the position taken by the majority 
of Arab League countries, which make their possible adhesion to 
the convention conditional upon international inspection of 
Israel's secret nuclear installations. In fact, chemical 
weapons are considered the Arab countries' response to the 
Jewish state's nuclear potential. 
  The discovery of the Tarhunah plant may trigger off a new 
crisis between Tripoli's colonel and the West. The Libyan 
Government is already facing trouble on its internal front, 
following the violent anti-regime revolt which broke out last 
March in the small town of Bani Walid -- although al-Qadhdhafi's 
personal power does not seem to be seriously called into 
question. The colonel survived the administrations of his 
long-standing enemies, Reagan and Bush. But Bill Clinton may 
well decide that the moment has come to resume the hostilities.

  Announcer Tatyana Komarova: We would now like to 
show you for the first time footage our correspondent managed to 
film. Missiles brought out of Belarus under an agreement are 
being placed on alert duty in Russia. 
  Mikhail Zotov: In the village of Manan-Muchash, 
which means -- short end -- in the Mari language, not far from 
Yoshkar-Ola, a regiment equipped with missiles brought out of 
Belarus under the trilateral agreement has been placed on alert 
duty. You can see the missiles behind me. They are the newest 
strategic missiles, codenamed Topol, SS-25. 
  The military says these strategic mobile missile complexes 
have no computer program devised to eliminate targets in any 
country that might be a potential adversary. However, the 
on-board electronic systems are capable of retargeting the 
complex within a few seconds. Radar-proof warheads can reach any 
point in the opposite hemisphere. 
  Despite the fact that the army is troubled by many problems, 
the missile troops are relatively well-off, and in the words of 
Maj Gen (Nikolay Moroz), are capable of maintaining a guaranteed 
minimum of security and independence for Russia. 
  Meanwhile, the West is keeping a close watch on the Topols 
in 
Mari territory. Radar stations have registered the fact that 
our neighbors' satellites were monitoring the redeployment of 
the missiles. Space, however, remains the only place from where 
an outsider can watch Russian strategic missiles being placed on 
alert duty. On the ground it is only reporters from Ostankino's 
First Channel who can do it. [Video shows a truck-mounted

in Moscow's Artillery and Missile Forces Academy. A film crew 
from the Segodnya program were the only journalists present. 
  Correspondent Ivliyev: The nuclear strategic 
missiles based in Kazakhstan belong to Russia -- this is the 
sensational news reported today by the Colonel General Igor 
Sergeyev, commander in chief of strategic missile forces, at a 
briefing for foreign military attaches which took place in the 
Dzerzhinskiy Military Academy. 
  [Begin Sergeyev recording] A month ago, on 28 
March, an agreement was reached during the Russian-Kazakhstan 
talks on giving Russian status to the formations and units of 
strategic missile forces stationed temporarily on Kazakhstan 
territory. A timescale was also agreed for the withdrawal of 
nuclear warheads to Russian territory. [end recording] 
  Ivliyev: The agreement reached means that the 
personnel of the missile forces receive Russian citizenship. 
After the stage by stage withdrawal of missile force units from 
Kazakhstan is completed, the launch shafts will be dismantled, 
apparently by Russian specialists. Thus all three CIS states -- 
Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan -- on whose territory nuclear 
weaponry remained after the collapse of the USSR, now have a 
treaty with Russia on its removal. In a few years, if these 
countries fulfill their obligations, Igor Sergeyev stressed, 
they will become non-nuclear states.

  [Text] The second international conference -- Moskon '94 -- 
on the problems of chemical weapons has opened in Moscow. It is 
being held by the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Russian 
Committee for Conventional Problems. (Sergey Bogdanov), 
chairman of an international commission for preparing the 
implementation of the convention, told journalists that 
recruiting personnel and providing special equipment will cost 
Russia $18 million. 
  According to experts, within 10 years over 110,000 tonnes of 
toxic substances are to be destroyed in the world, including 
40,000 tonnes belonging to Russia and 30,000 to the United 
States.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 20 TASS -- Ratification by Russia of 
the Convention on Chemical Disarmament is designed to stabilize 
the situation in the entire world, said Lieutenant-General 
Anatoliy Kuntsevich, a full member of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences. He opened here on Wednesday the second international 
conference on chemical disarmament, ``Moskon '94,'' with a 
presentation on problems of elimination of chemical warfare 
agents. 
  Kuntsevich said Russia now possesses the world's biggest 
stock of toxic agents. According to official data, it has 
accumulated on its territory over 40,000 tons of products by the 
military chemical complex, which is enough to poison every 
living being on the globe. 
  The issue of recycling chemical warfare agents is out of the 
scope of Russia's interests. Participants in the conference 
noted that introduction of imperfect technologies might create 
hotbeds of ecological tension not only on the cites of war gases 
elimination but also in other regions. Experience gained in 
this sphere by other countries, in particular by the United 
States, cannot be copied in Russia. Developments by Russian 
researchers are opposed by foreign experts just out of 
considerations of competition. Some Western theoreticians and 
industrialists insist that lewisite be incinerated, while 
Russian specialists suggest extracting highly-pure arsenic out 
of this hazard chemical agent. 
  Russian supplies of this valuable material used in making 
solar energy plants designed to replace atomic stations in the 
next century will somewhat squeeze Western arsenic producers on 
the world market. Thus, purely scientific problems raised by 
participants in the forum are acquiring a very different meaning. 
  Professor Vladlen Malyshev, adviser to the head of the 
Committee for Conventional Problems of Chemical and Biological 
Weapons under the Russian president, told TASS that ``Moskon 
'94'' had drawn chemical researchers from many countries. In 
coordination with their colleagues from the Russian Academy of 
Sciences and producers, they are seeking for ways of safest 
destruction of Russia's huge stock-piles of toxic agents. In 
doing this, the adviser said, we should first of all take into 
account humane ecological problems and national interests. 
  ``At the same time, researchers and specialists of the 
military chemical complex understand quite well that 
ratification by Russia of the convention on chemical disarmament 
will stabilize the situation across the world, but this truth 
should also become an axiom for politicians, lawmakers and the 
public at large,'' Malyshev stressed.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 22 TASS -- ``Russia has absolutely 
unique technologies for the complex reprocessing of chemical 
warfare agents and nuclear wastes, which have no match in the 
world,'' member of the Engineering Academy Mikhail Sviderskiy 
said on Thursday, addressing a plenary meeting of the second 
international conference for chemical disarmament -- ``Moskon 
'94.'' 
  According to Sviderskiy, Russian scientists have developed 
and experimentally tested several production cycles for the 
complex reprocessing of chemical warfare agents and nuclear 
wastes. This allowed them to obtain new materials with quite 
unusual characteristics which, in the opinion of the expert, may 
be used in 21st-century technologies. 
  Sviderskiy said that the simultaneous reprocessing of 
chemical warfare agents and nuclear wastes would allow 
scientists not only to obtain materials with unique properties, 
but also to utilise huge quantities of depleted uranium 
accumulating on the planet. In order to process it into 
valuable products, Sviderskiy believes, ``we need an 
international programme involving all the advanced countries. 
Excessive amounts of nuclear wastes have been accumulated in the 
United States, France, Britain, Germany, and also Russia. They 
are just as dangerous for the planet's ecology as the existing 
stockpiles of chemical warfare agents.'' 
  ITAR-TASS was told by Academician Valentin Fedorov, who is 
also attending the conference, that chemical disarmament should 
not only make up for the spendings made on the production of 
chemical warfare agents, but should also yield profits to the 
Russian treasury. In his opinion, only the reprocessing of 
lewisite into extra-pure arsenic will yield Russia profits 
running into many billions and will provide top-quality raw 
materials for new technologies in the most advanced sectors of 
industry. ``We must not forget,'' the scientist stressed, ``that 
Georgia, our traditional supplier of arsenic, has stopped 
selling it to Russia. In the meantime, the need for pure 
materials of this group is growing. For instance, the United 
States will need more than 100 tonnes of extra-pure arsenic by 
the end of this century only for its electronic industry. Other 
countries are also badly in need of arsenic.'' 
  Chemical disarmament, based on technologies proposed by 
Russian scientists, Fedorov believes, meet the national 
interests of Russia. ``We must rely on our own forces, and we 
have no right to wait for somebody else to resolve our Russian 
problems,'' he stated.

<F P=106> [Oleg Zolotov report: ``No Reduction in Secrecy''] </F>
  [Text] ``Moskon '94,'' the Second International Conference 
on Chemical Disarmament, ended yesterday in Moscow. It had been 
opened by Academician Anatoliy Kuntsevich, who only two weeks 
ago headed the Russian president's Committee for the 
Conventional Problems of Chemical and Biological Weapons. 
  As expected, the organizers did everything possible to 
exclude critics of official chemical disarmament programs from 
the forum. However, three dissident scientists -- namely Lev 
Fedorov, Vladimir Uglev, and Vladimir Petrenko -- managed to get 
in in the capacity of unofficial guests. But only 
representatives of the press were able to discover their point 
of view: All three were refused a place on the rostrum. 
Vladimir Uglev said in conversation with TRUD's correspondent 
that this was dictated by the Russian authorities' wish to dodge 
a decision on fundamental questions. In his words, whereas our 
American partners are attentively monitoring the quantitative 
indicators of the destruction of toxic substances, the methods 
of destroying these substances, which themselves present a 
serious threat to human beings, are still being kept secret and 
are monitored by no one. 
  The reasons for Kuntsevich's dismissal from the chairmanship 
of the president's committee are still unknown. Many link it to 
the fact that the academician's stance on chemical disarmament 
questions had started to encroach on Defense Ministry interests. 
His approaches required additional expenditure, and this 
displeased many people. As for Kuntsevich himself, he said in 
conversation with TRUD's correspondent: 
  ``I do not know why I was fired. As an ex-military man, I 
refuse to comment on the fact.''

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Sitnikov] </F>
  [Text] United Nations April 26 TASS -- President Boris 
Yeltsin reaffirmed Russia's adherence to continue the moratorium 
on nuclear tests, General Secretary of the Geneva Disarmament 
Conference Vladimir Petrovskiy said at a press conference held 
at the UN Headquarters today. 
  ``During talks with the UN secretary-general at the 
beginning 
of April, President Boris Yeltsin had expressed Russia's 
adherence to continue the moratorium on nuclear tests which was 
initially declared by ex-Soviet president Gorbachev,'' 
Petrovskiy said. 
  Petrovskiy noted that similar steps taken by other nuclear 
states would considerably help the multilateral talks on 
concluding a universal nuclear test ban treaty, now underway in 
Geneva. He called ``realistic'' the conclusion of such a treaty 
by the end of 1996. He said that a draft treaty will be 
presented for consideration in June this year. 
  In this context, he said that participants in the 
disarmament 
conference welcome the decision adopted by the United States in 
March to extend the moratorium on nuclear tests until September, 
1995 as an ``important contribution to the cration of a 
favourable climate for talks.'' ``It is important to acknowledge 
that for the first time not only the U.S., Russia and Great 
Britain, but France and China are also now taking part in the 
talks, which directly affect their nuclear interests,'' 
Petrovskiy noted.

<F P=106> [Igor Chernov report under the ``Details'' rubric: ``Do You </F>
Want a `Cylinder'?''] 
  [Text] Sochi -- Staffers of the Sochi service of the 
Russian FCS [Federal Counterintelligence Service] and the 
militia have detained a resident of the resort who was trying to 
sell approximately 7 kg of a radioactive substance. Experts are 
now determining the exact weight and composition of this 
``bomb,'' but it is conjectured that enriched uranium-238 was in 
three cylindrical containers with a diameter of 15 cm and a 
length of 40 cm. 
  Aleksey Shishkov, chief of the FCS Sochi service, has 
reported that preliminary measurements showed that the 
radioactive background created by the containers exceeded the 
maximum permissible norms by a factor of two and that the 
cylinders posed a great danger. Incidentally, the owner of the 
commodity (it would be premature to name him) had put the 
containers inside tubes, but it ``shone'' pretty well even 
through the additional protection. 
  Intelligence officers are not yet saying how they happened 
upon the uranium dealer. It is only known that two capsules 
were first removed from two hiding places, while the third was 
discovered on the citizen when he was detained. He was arrested 
last weekend in the very center of Sochi. It is assumed that he 
intended to sell the containers to foreigners for a large sum in 
dollars. 
  Criminal proceedings have been instituted, envisaging 
punishment not only for stealing radioactive substances but also 
for violating the regulations governing their storage. The most 
interesting question, to which the answer must be found, is 
this: How and from where did the dangerous capsules get to the 
Black Sea? According to militia staffers, the threads of the 
crime lead to the Urals region....

    [Editorial Report] Moscow NTV in Russian at 1800 GMT on 22 
April on the `Today' program carries a report on the Plesetsk 
missile test center in the town of (Mirnyy) in Arkhangelsk 
oblast. The correspondent says the site is not shown on maps 
because it is where military missiles have been tested since 
1957. He says the country knew nothing of these tests for 
decades, including the successes or failures. 
  A film shows an aerial view of the town, a convoy of 
unidentified missiles on the road, and a missile transporter 
erector launcher [TEL] driving down a forest road. 
  The correspondent says these scenes are being shown for the 
first time, adding that disasters during missile launches in 
1973 and 1980 resulted in the deaths of more than 50 people. 
Video clips then show an explosion, with two soldiers dragging a 
third past flames. 
  The correspondent then interviews an unidentified lieutenant 
colonel in front of a memorial. The lieutenant says: ``I took 
part in organizing the funerals. Of course, it left a big 
impression. When I come here, I can see that moment.'' 
  The correspondent continues: ``The Plesetsk range was not 
only a testing center. Events connected with the Cuban missile 
crisis in the 1960's form a special page in its history. Soviet 
missiles had been delivered to Cuba. The United States decided 
to destroy them from the air.'' 
  A video recording shows TELs manoeuvring and being driven 
out 
of hangars and along a road. The video then shows Major General 
Nikolay Moroz, assistant commander in chief of the Missile 
Forces, identified by caption, who says. ``When it became known 
that the Soviet Union had 12 missiles with the range to reach 
America, this fact had a great influence on the politicians.'' 
  The correspondent says: ``Some of these missiles were aimed 
at the United States from Plesetsk. Today there is a different 
atmosphere at the range. This is the secret computer center. 
Here they follow American missile testing. Moscow and 
Washington have agreed to exchange information on these kinds 
tests, and in accordance with the agreements the Americans have 
installed this equipment in PLesetsk. The Russian specialists 
have installed their own control instruments in the United 
State. Today the soldiers at Plesetsk are not only studying 
launches of other people's missiles; they are also developing 
Russian military missiles for the 21st Century. The Plesetsk 
state missile testing range. The fourth-generation Topol 
[SS-25] missile is being developed here'' [as heard]. The video 
shows the correspondent standing in front of an SS-25 road unit.

<F P=106> [Viktor Litovkin report: ``U.S. Equipment Idle at Russian </F>
Missile Range''] 
  [Text] The racks visible in this photograph are on the 
third floor of the Russian Strategic Missile Forces' State Test 
Range located in the town of Mirnyy, Arkhangelsk Oblast. It is 
equipment made by the U.S. firm of ``Metrum-97'' [name as 
transliterated] for reproducing telemetry data. More precisely, 
it is a magnetic tape player for decoding the flight parameters 
of strategic missiles developed and launched on test flights by 
the United States. 
  It was supplied here last year under a bilateral agreement 
between the countries, when the second Strategic Arms Reduction 
Treaty (START II) was signed. Similar Russian-made equipment -- 
in six rather than two racks -- has been set up on U.S. soil 
near Washington by our officers. 
  It was assumed that when the two states' parliaments 
ratified 
the treaty, the countries would, as a mark of the trust between 
them, exchange telemetry and other information on the 
performance of their new and old strategic missiles, their 
behavior in flight, and other important information which would 
allow the generals, politicians, and missile designers to take a 
calm and very respectful view of both sides' scientific and 
technical developments and to monitor them with greater 
confidence. 
  They even exchanged as a goodwill gesture reels of magnetic 
tape recordings of previous test telemetry -- the Americans gave 
us information on their ground-launched missile, while we gave 
them information on our sea-launched missile. Once again, they 
sent us one spool, while we sent them several. 
  This is not a question of excessive generosity. It is simply 
that the Americans take the information on their missiles' 
behavior in flight from a single satellite, while our testers 
have to take the information from nine measuring stations sited 
along the country's northern seaboard. From Mirnyy to 
Kamchatka. There are stations in Naryan-Mar, Taymyr, Yakutsk, 
and even on Novaya 
  Zemlya. The information is sent back by military couriers. 
This is when aircraft are flying and reindeer are not roaming 
the tundra. [sentence as published] 
  Because of this the countries set the timetable for the 
exchange of telemetry at 50 days. Less than that would be 
impossible. Otherwise there might be suspicions of dishonesty. 
It would then have to be proved that there was no way out from 
Novaya Zemlya. That would be no justification in 
military-diplomatic circles -- especially as delivery of 
magnetic tapes is subsequently provided for by diplomatic pouch. 
  But, so far, there is nothing to deliver. Apart from the 
so-called demonstration reels, the high contracting parties have 
not exchanged anything else. Our parliament -- neither the old 
one nor the new one -- has not ratified START II. 
  A whole telemetry exchange department has been set up at the 
Russian test range. Colonel Aleksandr Vasilyev, its deputy 
chief, agreed to be photographed alongside the U.S. equipment 
for this newspaper. He says that they are not wasting time but 
are preparing to do serious work on the transatlantic missile 
information. In principle they are already ready to do so. 
  So the ball is now in the State Duma's court.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 4 TASS -- Ukraine has removed to Russia 
180 strategic nuclear missiles as of today, Igor Sergeyev, 
commander of the Russian strategic missile forces, said. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday, Sergeyev said 
that the missiles will be scrapped at Russian plants as 
envisaged by the agreements signed by Russia, Ukraine and the 
United States and START-1 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. 
  Sergeyev recalled that under the Lisbon Protocol, 
Byelorussia 
[Belarus], Kazakhstan and Ukraine are also parties to the treaty 
which has been ratified by the U.S., Russia, Byelorussia, and 
Kazakhstan. 
  He stressed that Russia has already scrapped over 350 
missiles and about 300 missile launchers. He added, however, 
that the implementation of the treaty depends not only on 
Russia, but also other ex-Soviet republics which posses nuclear 
weapons. 
  Russia has signed an agreement with Byelorussia to transfer 
a 
group of strategic missile troops in Byelorussia under Russia's 
control. Russia is also withdrawing strategic missile units 
from that republic. 
  A similar agreement was signed with Kazakhstan in March 
1994. 
Both sides are now working on an agreement on the elimination of 
missile facilities.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Litovkin of IZVESTIYA: ``Nuclear Alert </F>
Canceled. Warheads Being Removed in Ukraine and Kazakhstan''] 
  [Text] At long last the problem that perturbed the whole 
world after the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the 
emergence in its place of four states with over 350 strategic 
missiles with nuclear warheads on their territory is close to a 
solution. Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belorussia [Belarus] have 
begun to consistently fulfill their juridical commitments 
regarding nuclear disarmament. 
  ``All 46 RS-24 heavy missiles stationed in Ukraine have been 
deactivated,'' Colonel General Igor Sergeyev, commander in chief 
of the Strategic Missile Forces, has declared. ``Ukraine, and 
also Kazakhstan and Belorussia, the other CIS countries where 
our nuclear missile weapons are stationed for the moment, are 
honestly and consistently fulfilling their international 
commitments regarding nuclear disarmament.'' 
  He made this statement at a meeting with foreign countries' 
military attaches in Moscow. ``The deactivation of missiles,'' 
the general explained to your IZVESTIYA correspondent, ``means 
that their nuclear warheads have been removed and have been 
replaced by a special technical equivalent in order to ensure 
the normal, accident-free functioning of missile systems, while 
the missiles themselves no longer have targeting information 
[lisheny poletnykh zadaniy]. They no longer threaten anyone.'' 
  The commander in chief also disclosed that 20 missile 
complexes of the RS-18 liquid-fueled missile whose guaranteed 
operational lifetime had expired have been removed from alert 
status, the rocket fuel and oxidant have been pumped out of 
them, and the missiles have been readied for recycling 
[utilizatsiya]. Already 120 nuclear warheads have been 
withdrawn to Russia, and the rest will be dispatched to Russian 
plants in accordance with the Russian-Ukrainian timetable in 
conformity with the trilateral agreement concluded between 
Russia, Ukraine, and the United States in January of this year. 
  Operational control of the missile complexes in Ukraine is 
exercised from Moscow, administrative control from Kiev. 
  Agreement has also been reached with Kazakhstan on granting 
Russian status to the strategic missile units stationed on that 
sovereign state's territory. As IZVESTIYA has already noted, 
there are 104 RS-20 (SS-18 in the NATO classification) missiles 
with the biggest launch weight of 211 tonnes, with a throwweight 
of 8.8 tonnes, and with 10 nuclear warheads on each missile in 
the country. Now over a period of 14 months these warheads will 
be removed from the missiles and withdrawn to Russian plants. 
  The recovery of missiles from silos and their dispatch for 
recycling will take much more time and effort, but are to be 
completed within three years. But Kazakhstan will become 
totally nuclear-free as early as 1995. (Forty Tu-95MS strategic 
bombers and 240 cruise missiles were withdrawn from its 
territory a few months ago.) Admittedly, questions of paying 
for the process of eliminating the nuclear-missile complex on 
the state's territory have still not been resolved, but, judging 
by the present state of intergovernmental relations between 
Moscow and Alma-Ata [Almaty], the funding of the work to destroy 
the missile silos will not cause great problems and 
disagreements. 
  There are no disagreements between Moscow and Minsk on the 
question of withdrawing strategic missiles from Belorussia's 
territory. The ``Topol'' missiles are leaving Lida and Mozyr on 
schedule, as IZVESTIYA reported in issue No 50 for 17 March. 
  Russia has now eliminated 302 launchers for its strategic 
missiles and 403 missiles, and a further 600 will have been 
destroyed by the year 2003. It is honestly fulfilling its 
commitments under the START I treaty and is laying the 
foundation for fulfilling the START II treaty. 
  According to the commander in chief of the Strategic Missile 
Forces, strategic nuclear weapon delivery vehicles are 
decreasing by one-third in our country and strategic missile 
warheads [golovnyye chasti] by a factor of more than six. By 
January 1996 the Strategic Missile Forces personnel will have 
been cut by 25,000 men and the central apparatus of the Main 
Staff and directorates will have been cut by 20 percent. Russia 
currently has 1,050 launchers, and by the end of the century 
there will be 800. Further reductions in strategic arms and 
their development now depend also on the other states in the 
``nuclear club.'' 
  Military experts and specialists in international relations 
familiar with the problem of the nuclear disarmament of Ukraine 
and Kazakhstan know that the process of reaching agreement here 
was by no means simple and straightforward. It took great 
efforts by the states' leaders, parliaments, and generals and, 
naturally, by the U.S. Administration, Britain, and France and a 
certain amount of political and economic pressure before the 
parties to the multilateral dialogue were able to reach 
agreement. 
  But the main thing has been achieved. The Treaty on the 
Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, of which Russia and the 
United States are guarantors as countries keeping the treaty in 
their state archives, will not be violated. The world community 
has ensured that the nuclear club has not grown. And this means 
there is the hope that no other states possessing these terrible 
weapons of mass destruction will appear on the planet. 
  There is another conclusion that must be drawn from this 
fact: The world community, provided that there is consensus 
within it, is capable of solving many other problems of tricky 
relations between states and within them by peaceful means. All 
this takes is goodwill and awareness of its responsibility to 
the peoples.

    Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian at 0400 GMT on 24 
April carries a 2-minute report by Mayak correspondent Andrey 
Murashev from Tomsk region on the situation at the Siberian 
chemical combine, which ``is fraught with catastrophic 
consequences.'' 
  He says: ``This is how the staff of the enterprise has 
described the situation. In a letter addressed to Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Atomic Energy Minister Viktor 
Mikhaylov, it has stated that work on a defense order and 
production of electric power and heat bring only losses to the 
enterprise. On 1 April, the debt for weapon-grade plutonium was 
22 billion rubles, and for energy sources produced, 11 billion 
rubles. The enterprise developed a conversion program, which is 
being implemented at present and which includes, for example, 
the production of low-grade uranium for nuclear power 
engineering. But the payment for these orders will be made only 
at the end of the year.'' 
  Murashev says that due to the shortage of money, the combine 
cannot buy raw materials or pay wages to its staff, which 
demands that the Russian Government clear its debts and provide 
the long-promised credits. He points out that Russia's 
international commitments with regard to nuclear disarmament 
could be affected if the combine were to grind to a halt. 
  The correspondent went on to recall that the Siberian 
chemical combine was a major enterprise of nuclear production. 
``Two out of three nuclear reactors in the country that work for 
defense are situated here, in the closed town of Seversk, 
formerly known as Tomsk-7.''

<F P=106> [Viktor Litovkin report: ``Russia's Missile Guard Increased </F>
by Nine Topols''] 
  [Text] Yoshkar-Ola-Moscow -- This was unprecedented. The 
until recently top secret strategic missile regiment belonging 
to the Kiev-Zhitomir Order of Kutuzov Missile Division deployed 
in Yoshkar-Ola inaugurated the performance of alert duty in the 
presence of Mariy-El Republic President Vladislav Zotin and 
before the gaze of television journalists, pressmen, and 
photographers, among whom were IZVESTIYA special correspondents. 
  The regiment comprises nine RS-12M Topol road-mobile 
delivery 
vehicles. Journalists were shown the holy of holies -- the 
alert forces' fixed command post which controls the launch of 
missiles, the launch area equipment, its protection and defense 
system, and the guard quarters where the missilemen perform 
their alert duty -- and had all the questions that interest us, 
including where the missiles are targeted, answered. 
  Before giving you that answer I would inform you that the 
regiment was assembled out of different pieces, as it were. Its 
officer backbone is made up of men who served in the missile 
unit belonging to the 43d Vinnitsa Army stationed in the 
settlement of Lebedin, Suma Oblast, Ukraine. The regiment was 
once equipped with SS-20 Pioneer intermediate-range missiles, 
which were destroyed some years ago under the Treaty on 
Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles. The new 
equipment was received last August from the city of Postava, 
Belorussia [Belorus], from the Topol strategic missile division 
which was disbanded there and withdrawn from the republic's 
territory. 
  These systems replaced some of the RS-12 (SS-13 according to 
the U.S. classification system) fixed-site missiles with which 
the Yoshkar-Ola division is equipped. Officer retraining took 
six months, and they entered on alert duty on their new systems 
on 19 April. 
  It is also interesting that the regiment disbanded in 
Ukraine 
was created in Akhtyrka in 1655. It was the oldest military 
unit in Russia and had taken part in the Battle of Poltava. By 
edict of Empress Elizabeth the regiment was named the Akhtyrka 
Hussars. It was commanded at the battle of Borodino by General 
Denis Davydov, who took it as far as Paris. Lermontov and 
Alyabyev served there... 
  Now its colors and combat decorations, including the Orders 
of the Red Banner, Kutuzov, and Bogdan Khmelnistskiy are kept in 
the Central Museum of the Armed Forces. 
  The missile officers, I was told by assistant commander 
Lieutenant Colonel Vitaliy Lezhanin, have asked the Defense 
Ministry leadership to restore the memorabilia and the honorary 
title to them, but only time will tell whether the General Staff 
will heed them. In the opinion of those who perform alert duty 
today, they have every right. 
  Colonel Vladimir Kashkin, the commander of the regiment, 
told 
me that he doesn't know what his missiles are targeted on. Only 
the General Staff has such information. But division commander 
Major General Musa Tsegoyev clarified the position, stating that 
under the strategic missile agreement with the United States 
strategic missiles have ``zero'' targeting and that their 
mission will only be programmed at a time of threat. They 
maintain watch to deter any potential aggressor so that never 
comes to pass. 
  The missilemen's unprecedented openness in inviting 
journalists to see the regiment's entry on alert duty is, in my 
view, not just a desire on their part to report gradually on the 
execution of their international commitments. There is another 
reason for this too. As is well known, the former Russian 
Supreme Soviet did not ratify START, but the reequipping of the 
missile division in Yoshkar-Ola and the disbandment of strategic 
regiments in Belorussia and Ukraine constitute the 
implementation of that treaty. 
  Russia will keep its word, although the parliamentarians 
have 
not turned this word into law.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow April 21 TASS -- Russia possesses unique 
technologies for comprehensive processing of combat toxic agents 
and nuclear waste, according to Professor Mikhail Sviderskiy. 
  Speaking at an international conference on chemical 
disarmament in Moscow on Thursday, Sviderskiy, who is a member 
of the Russian Engineering Academy, said that Russian scientists 
have developed and tested such technologies. They allowed them 
to make new materials with unique qualities which, according to 
specialists, will be widely used in the 21st century. 
  The new technologies also provide for processing used 
uranium 
into valuable materials. He said, however, that further 
research and experiments will require international 
participation. The United States, France, Britain and Germany 
could also benefit from the use of these technologies as they 
all face the same problem -- utilisation of radioactive waste. 
  Academician Valentin Fedotov said that chemical disarmament 
must not only make up for the cost of manufactured toxic agents, 
but also augment state coffers. In his view, the processing of 
lewisite (liquid vesicant) into super pure arsenic may earn 
Russia billions of roubles and hard currency and provide the 
industry with high-quality materials. 
  Georgia, traditional supplier of arsenic, has stopped 
selling 
it to Russia which needs it for its electronics industry, 
Fedotov said. He noted that, the demand for super pure arsenic 
in the U.S. electronics industry will exceed 100 tonnes by the 
end of the century. 
  The academician stressed that new technologies meet Russia's 
national interests. ``We must count only on ourselves and have 
no right to wait for someone else to solve our problems for 
us,'' he said.

  [Text] The dumping of radioactive waste from Pacific Fleet 
submarines might be forced by the fact that there is nowhere to 
store the waste. Tankers with waste docked near the factory 
wharf of Zvezda in Bolshoy Kamen are filled to capacity, and can 
contain no more dangerous cargo. An ITAR-TASS correspondent was 
told this by Vladimir Ignatenko, representative of Russian 
president in the Maritime Kray. He said the government should 
have allocated funds to build a facility for processing the 
waste, but not a single ruble has been allocated for this 
purpose so far. Meanwhile, one of the tankers, which contains 
794 tonnes of waste, is in a dilapidated condition. Either the 
factory has to be stopped so that the already critical mass of 
radioactive liquid will not increase, or else it has to be 
dumped at sea. However, this may take place only after 
coordinating it with the Russian president, said Vladimir 
Ignatenko.

  [Text] The commander of the Strategic Forces Division, 
General (Mosad Sagoyev), says that Russia is loyal to its 
international obligations under the SALT II treaty [as heard]. 
A group of journalists was allowed to visit the division, that 
is deployed in the Volga region. They visited the headquarters 
and got acquainted with combat equipment of the division. 
  General (Sagoyev) reported that the SS-20 medium range 
missiles had been liquidated in keeping with the treaty. As for 
the strategic missiles, they are targeted nowhere. They will be 
assigned a special task, the commander said, only in case of an 
attack on Russia.

<F P=106> [From the ``Itogi'' newscast: Video report from Kazakhstan </F>
by Aleksandr Gerasimov, identified by caption] 
  [Text] [Gerasimov over aerial view from 
helicopter] ``Zone of consequences of the politics of the 
absurd'' -- this is probably the most apt description of the 
stationing locations of Strategic Missile Forces units in 
Kazakhstan. This is the fourth year since the disintegration of 
the Soviet Union, and the leaders of the nuclear republics have 
still not reached agreement on the division of nuclear weapons. 
These weapons, used as a deterrent until recently, are being 
turned into an instrument of political blackmail. Those who 
stand to lose from this are our own security, and the thousands 
of servicemen serving in the missile forces. [video shows 
aerial view from helicopter, truck-mounted missiles on the move, 
extensive closeups of missile silo interior, two servicemen in a 
missile control room, more closeups of missiles] 
  Formally, anything located on Kazakhstani territory belongs 
to Kazakhstan. At the same time, Alma-Ata [Almaty] has acceded 
to the offensive arms reduction treaty and does not regard 
itself as the owner of nuclear missiles. However, as a result 
of the cooling of relations between Kazakhstan and Russia, which 
followed the rejection of Nazarbayev's concept of the ruble 
zone, nobody is currently able to clearly define the nuclear 
weapons' status. [video shows more closeups of giant 
missiles] 
  [Gerasimov to camera and over video of missiles above 
ground] The nuclear weapons concerned are 104 of the 
world's most powerful strategic missiles--the SS-18--deployed in 
two divisions on the territory of Kazakhstan. The prevailing 
view is that these are Russian divisions. However, unlike in 
other armies, no state flag is flying above the headquarters. 
Admittedly, the main orders and the wages come from Moscow. 
Both the officers who have sworn allegiance to Russia, and the 
men who have taken the Kazakhstani oath and whose knowledge of 
Russian is poor, but who serve under Russian service 
regulations, are being paid in Russian rubles. 
  [Unidentified Russian officer addressing 
servicemen] No. 12 Platoon don gas masks! [video 
shows lineup of servicemen donning gas masks] 
  [Gerasimov over video of gas mask exercise] At 
the same time, Alma-Ata is also issuing menacing orders. Their 
implementation has resulted in the accumulation at nuclear bases 
of an impermissibly large number of warheads which have come to 
the end of their guaranteed service life. 
  [Akhmet Khashchegulgov, missile division commander, 
identified by caption] The accumulation of nuclear warheads 
in the missile division is in excess of the set norms. This is 
primarily the result of a decision by the leadership of the 
Republic of Kazakhstan banning the removal of nuclear warheads, 
missiles, missile fuel components, and other types of hardware 
from the territory of Kazakhstan. 
  [Gerasimov over more video of missile silo and control 
room scenes] According to our information from the Russian 
Government, the explanation for this stance adopted by Alma-Ata 
is President Nazarbayev's intention during his upcoming visit to 
Moscow to demand compensation for the highly enriched uranium 
contained in nuclear charges. In addition, strategic missiles 
offer a good bargaining chip in the political horse-trading 
between the two states whose relations are far from 
straightforward. 
  Officers here take the view that nuclear safety can be 
guaranteed only if their divisions are given the status of 
Russian military bases. For some reason, they believe here that 
this will be resolved during the upcoming meeting between 
Yeltsin and Nazarbayev. 
  Perhaps when this meeting has taken place, the local 
Kazakhstani authorities will stop cutting off the electricity 
and water supply to the military garrisons. In that case 
officers' children will no longer have to freeze in schools and 
kindergartens, and the officers on duty will no longer have to 
struggle to maintain the survivability of the nuclear missiles. 
Commanders will be able to find the money needed to repair heat 
supply networks, and the pipes for this work will no longer have 
to be flown in from Moscow. [video shows everyday life scenes, 
children] 
  To Senior Lieutenant Mikhail Kryukov and Major Vasiliy 
Salashnov, who are on alert duty deep down under ground, empty 
shelves in the garrison's stores are nothing new. Just like 
their comrades, they are constantly ready to implement orders. 
Nonetheless, most of the officers are dreaming about returning 
to Russia where conditions of service are more comfortable. 
Many of them remain in Kazakhstan only because of speedier 
promotion and because 12 months of service counts for 18 months 
here. [video shows more missile installations, store 
scenes] 
  Meanwhile, certain circumstances seem to indicate that 
Kazakhstan's leadership is not really seeking to improve 
relations with Russia. So for example, a strategic installation 
-- a Kazakhstani air defense unit located near the missile 
division at Derzhavinsk -- is completely snowed under. When the 
Kazakhstani air defense troops were still Soviet troops they 
protected the nuclear missiles from air attacks. Now the 
station is deserted. 
  A Kazakhstani-U.S. joint venture for extracting high-grade 
metals from missile silos which are being taken out of service 
is being set up in Alma-Ata. It appears that the Kazakhstanis 
trust Moscow less and less. The Russian authorities, in turn, 
are taking no steps toward a rapprochement with Kazakhstan.

installations in Kazakhstan]

<F P=106> [Viktor Krokhmalyuk commentary: ``Beware: Disinformation!''] </F>
  [Text] KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA published an article by its 
correspondent Olga Musafirova under the title ``The Hetman 
[Bohdan Khmelnytskyy] With a Nuclear Mace; There Is No Strength 
To Hold It, and It Is Terrifying To Drop It.... Khmelnytskyy Is 
Agitated by Rumors.'' Here is a quotation from that 
publication: At the site near Bohdanivtsi, 20 liquid-fuel SS-18 
missiles seem to have been disabled and dismantled. There arose 
some problems with the storage of the ``liquid,'' and heptyl, a 
poison of group ``S'' that is extremely toxic for all living 
organisms, is already poisoning the surrounding woods. 
  In this connection, a news conference was held at Ukraine's 
Security Service Administration in Khmelnytskyy Oblast. 
  What actually happened? Missile specialist Ye. Arkhypov has 
this to say: 
  ``Today, about 90 launchers have been taken off the 
alert--one regiment here and one--in Pervomaysk. The technology 
for pouring out the liquid fuel is such that no environmental 
damage may occur as a result. It is carried out by the method 
involving high pressure, and, therefore, not a single drop of 
heptyl may get either into the soil or onto the people servicing 
these operations.'' 
  Colonel Ye. Arkhypov also said that the system of control 
over the course of dangerous operations has a triple and, in 
some cases, fivefold guarantee. Work on servicing missile sites 
is conducted, as usual, according to plan and systematically, 
and specialists from all countries arrive there, so that it 
would hardly be possible to conceal any problems from them. 
  In the near future, Khmelnytskyy missile specialists are 
expecting U.S. ecological safety inspectors; they will see what 
they themselves want to see and not what the Ukrainian side will 
recommend. Therefore, it is unlikely that our missile 
specialists may conceal anything even if they wanted to. 
  As emphasized at the news conference, nuclear fuel is too 
valuable a commodity to export or to sell at a very cheap price 
to CIS countries, in particular, to Russia, as some people are 
suggesting. The fuel remains on site, and then some of it is 
sent to special arsenals for storage and some--for processing at 
chemical plants. Such a component of propellant fuel as the 
oxidizing agent is a very important product for manufacturing 
mineral fertilizers. Today, we must also think about Ukraine's 
space future. 
  Recently, an accord was signed with Kazakhstan on the joint 
use of Baykonur. We will be able to operate Ukrainian missiles 
with our own fuel instead of paying thousands and millions of 
dollars for this. 
  I will add my personal remark: Even following the 
KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA material under the provocative title 
``Khmelnytskyy Is Agitated by Rumors,'' the situation in the 
town is calm, and I did not see any signs of fear, panic, or 
complaints against the missile specialists stationed here.

<F P=106> [``D.Gd.'' report: ``Military Report Describes Emeraude </F>
Accident''] 
  [Text] No human error and no nuclear contamination: Those 
are the main conclusions of the military commission of inquiry 
set up to look into the accident on board of the nuclear-powered 
attack submarine [SNA] Emeraude on 30 March, in which 10 crew 
members died. In a communique summarizing the report (150 pages 
sent to the public prosecutor in Marseilles), the Defense 
Ministry reconstructed the accident which occurred during 
maneuvers off Toulon. According to this version of events, the 
submarine was submerged at 190 meters. Between two training 
phases, the commander (who was among the victims) carried out a 
``section inspection'' in the turbo-alternator compartment that 
``had been planned several weeks earlier to be done on that 
day.'' 
  At 10:35, 12 men were in the compartment when ``a leak 
occurred in the sea water refrigeration collector.'' This leak 
was not, therefore, in the external hull but in an internal 
pipe. The ``energy'' officer left the compartment to return to 
the central navigation station, while emergency maneuvers were 
made to resurface the vessel in 100 seconds: Power was upped to 
increase speed, the sea water circuits were closed to prevent 
flooding, and the ballast tanks were emptied to accelerate 
resurfacing. 
  It was probably this combination of operations that led to 
``overpressure in one of the condensers,'' and then the 
``breaking of a clack plug, causing steam to pour into the 
compartment.'' Ten submariners were killed instantly by 
barotraumatism causing their eardrums and lungs to explode. One 
man managed to survive by taking refuge in the forward section 
of the compartment. The communique added: ``The commission of 
inquiry found no evidence of human error attributable to the 
crew members at the time of the accident.'' Our sources tell us 
that a mechanic responsible for closing two outlets to stop the 
steam escaping when the ascent was started, only had time to 
close one of them before he was killed. The Defense Ministry 
authorized the six SNA's that had been recalled for checks to 
once again take to the sea, instructing the ``immediate closure 
of the steam circuits in the event of a water leak.'' However, 
it would appear difficult to implement steam shutdown when a 
water leak appears, since it is necessary for rapid resurfacing.

<F P=106> [Patrice-Henry Desaubliaux report: ``Armed Forces: 613.1 </F>
Billion Francs Over Six Years''] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The aim is for France 
(represented by a head of state and a prime minister who have 
not been elected on the same program and who do not refer to the 
same ideology) to maintain its world ranking as second largest 
Western military power. France wishes to maintain its autonomy 
of intervention wherever its interests are at stake. At the 
same time, it wishes to be the driving force in the building of 
a European defense. 
  Edouard Balladur and [Defense Minister] Francois Leotard are 
determined to carry through this programming law without waiting 
for [the presidential election in] 1995. Some people in the RPR 
[Rally for the Republic] and UDF [Union for French Democracy] 
had suggested to postpone the exercise until after the 
presidential election. The prime minister did not follow this 
expedient advice. Precisely because of the importance which he 
personally attaches to defense and security questions, it is he 
who decided on an increase of 0.5 percent, contrary to the aims 
of the law on controlling public spending. 
  The method adopted consisted of giving preference to what is 
reasonable over what is spectacular and adopting an attitude of 
great caution. It is in 1997 that we will see whether it is 
financially possible to launch several new programs like the 
future large transport plane, the second nuclear aircraft 
carrier, the NH-90 helicopter, the future sea-to-sea missile... 
  Between now and then, efforts will be made to successfully 
complete the major programs already started: the new generation 
of missile-launching nuclear submarines (Triomphant and 
Temeraire, due to come into service in 1996 and 1998); the 
Leclerc tank (310 will be supplied in the year 2000); the 
nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle; and the 
Navy's Rafale plane (operational in 1999); the Tigre helicopter 
(first deliveries in the year 2001); the Air Force Rafale from 
the year 2001-2002 (with a delay of one year mainly due to 
technological problems). 
  The only major program which will be launched as soon as the 
law comes into force is the development of the ATPGD (Precision 
Weapon Fired over a Long Distance) missile. What is it? 
Although the concept has virtually been defined, the program 
has not yet been finally decided. It will be a cruise missile 
of the Tomahawk type, in other words subsonic like the Apache, 
or supersonic like the medium-range air-to-surface missile, 
capable of covering between 500 and 1,000 km and reaching its 
target with an accuracy of approximately 1 meter. Its warhead 
would be exclusively conventional. 
  The austerity requirement called for a further reduction in 
the nuclear deterrence effort. Nuclear funds, which, less than 
10 years ago, formed almost one-third of the Armed Forces' 
equipment budget, have already fallen below 25 percent and will 
fall further until they only account for one-fifth of Section V. 
In six years, 134 billion francs [Fr] will nonetheless be 
devoted to it, of which Fr10 billion will be just for the Palen 
simulation program intended to reduce the number of nuclear 
tests. These tests are not mentioned much in the bill. 
Everybody knows that the subject is taboo until the 
presidential election in May 1995, although all the necessary 
steps have been taken to resume them without delay. 
  With regard to manning levels, the draft programming law 
continues the reduction started over recent years, but with much 
less brutality. Leotard is not Joxe. The general staffs have 
been consulted, and fairly broadly heeded. In all, 42,100 jobs 
will be eliminated in six years, of which 25,700 will be 
conscripts, 12,800 civilians, and 3,600 regular soldiers. 
However, 11,700 new jobs will be created which results in a 
figure of 30,400 job losses. 
  The Army will lose 16,872 jobs; although it is to gain 5,801 
in regular soldiers, it is to lose 19,185 conscripts and 3,500 
civilians. In the year 2000, it will have 227,000 men (the Joxe 
plan made provision for 225,000 in 1997). It will keep eight 
out of the nine divisions it has now and the 13 it still had in 
1990. 
  The Navy will lose 2,461 jobs: 2,161 conscripts and 500 
civilians. It will gain 200 regular posts. In the year 2000, 
it will have 68,441 men (compared with 70,902 today). 
  The Air Force will lose 6,098 jobs: 1,628 will be regular 
Air Force personnel; 4,100 conscripts; and 370 civilians. In 
the year 2000, it will have fallen from 94,869 to 88,771 men. 
  The gendarmerie is the only branch of the Armed Forces to 
see 
its manning levels increase. It is to gain 750 men in its 
regular force, 1,000 conscripts, and 226 civilians. And it will 
thus become the second largest branch of the Armed Forces with 
95,000 men (as against 93,024 in 1994). 
  The 11,700 jobs created will relate to intelligence (500 
civilians), professionalization (8,200 of which 7,000 will be 
engaged by the Army), the gendarmerie (almost 2,000 posts 
created), officers (382 naval officers, 123 petty officers, and 
500 armaments engineers). 
  This bill must now be submitted to the Assemblies. The 
deputies will debate it on 24 May and the senators in June. It 
is not customary for it to generate amendments. However, 
Edouard Balladur and Francois Leotard are prepared for a broad 
debate, even outside Parliament. They are fairly calm. They 
think it likely that criticisms will be expressed in the ranks 
of the majority. Some will think that too much is being spent 
on defense. Others will say that they would have liked a more 
generous law making it possible to launch new programs (for 
instance in the antimissile sphere) and at the same time to 
satisfy all the industrial sectors of defense and to maintain 
their 330,000 jobs. But, when it comes to the vote, there 
should be broad agreement.

<F P=106> [Report by Peter Scherer: ``Illegal Dealing in Nuclear </F>
Material Soaring''] 
  [Text] Wiesbaden -- The Hesse Office of Criminal 
Investigations (LKA) has reported a ``marked increase'' in 
illegal trafficking of radioactive material. The office said 
yesterday that three incidents of nuclear crimes were registered 
in 1991, while the number increased to nine in 1992, and 
rocketed to 30 in 1993. From January 1992 to the end of 
February 1993, almost 200 incidents from all over Germany were 
reported to the Federal Office for Criminal Investigations. 
  According to German security authorities, the nuclear crimes 
scene is dominated by Russians, Poles, and Czechs. The material 
comes from national installations in Eastern Europe and is 
smuggled to Germany from there, evading existing security 
systems. 
  Quite frequently, the hot material is smuggled to Germany 
via 
the Baltic states, Poland, and southeastern European countries. 
The LKA said that due to economic difficulties in the East, the 
FRG is ``particularly attractive.'' Yet, the efforts of the 
nuclear dealers to make profitable deals in Germany usually fail 
because there is no illegal market for ultimate consumers of 
radioactive material--at least according to information 
available so far. Nevertheless, the LKA fears that radioactive 
substances will continue to be available in Germany. 
  According to information made available to DIE WELT, 
smugglers use military installations of Russian troops stationed 
in the former GDR as intermediate stores for substances like 
uranium-238. The material, of which 40 kilograms were recently 
offered in Germany's black market, is said to have come from 
Siberia on military transport aircraft. DIE WELT has a drawing 
of the special container in which the dealers are said to have 
taken uranium to customers in Hamburg. 
  The German mediator and transporter of the Russian-Polish 
nuclear cartel is an engineer from Saxony who claims to have 
access to the Russian uranium stockpile. The man also offers 
specially treated, and thus radioactive, mercury products for 
anti-radar coatings of items such as tanks or reconnaissance 
satellites, which makes them unrecognizable to radar imaging. 
Price per kilo: 50,000 marks. Photocopies of the Russian 
original certificates have also been made available to DIE WELT. 
  In 1993, the Hesse LKA carried out investigations on 92 
suspects, 65 of whom were foreigners--mainly Eastern Europeans. 
In several cases indications of organized crime emerged during 
these investigations, the Hesse LKA said. Several uranium 
pellets and 500 grams of osmium-186 have been seized. There 
have been some cases of dealers offering nuclear substances 
fraudulently, the LKA said. 
  The Hesse investigators have also found that non-radioactive 
substances, such as scandium, europium, cobalt, osmium, and red 
mercury are ``increasingly'' appearing in the illegal markets. 
Police assure that so far no radioactive substances that are 
suitable for producing arms have been seized. Nevertheless, 
smuggling and dealing in nuclear material involves considerable 
danger, both for the smugglers and for the population, because 
improper handling of the material can cause most severe 
radiation damage.

<F P=106> [Report by Ugur Sefkat: ``Turkey Will Buy Missiles From </F>
Russia''] 
  [Text] Turkey and the Russian Federation have moved to 
cooperate on defense. National Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan 
has revealed that Turkey will buy long-range missiles from the 
Russian Federation. He also said that he agreed with Defense 
Minister Pavel Grachev to help Turkey to acquire Russia's 
technology in ballistic missiles. 
  Golhan stressed that he held talks with Pavel Grachev, who 
is 
one of Russia's most influential officials, when he visited the 
Russian Federation some time ago. He asserted: ``Defense 
Ministry officials in Russia informed me that they are prepared 
to sell various types of arms.'' 
  Golhan said that Turkey has moved to acquire missiles 
because 
Iran and Syria already have them in their military inventories. 
He asserted: ``Russia has very advanced missiles. We will 
cooperate with it to help Turkey acquire its missile technology. 
We have particular problems with our neighbors from the point 
of view of missiles and nuclear weapons. Iran and Syria have 
long-range missiles. So Turkey must equip itself accordingly. 
Turkey has never been an aggressor country. It does not intend 
to become one. We covet no country's territory. But we must 
maintain a deterrent force. Turkey is committed to the Treaty 
on Conventional Forces in Europe. We are not competing with our 
neighbors to acquire arms. But we do not want Turkey to be 
regarded as a weak country. A significant opportunity exists 
for cooperation with the Russian Federation to modernize the 
Turkish Armed Forces in every area.'' 
  Golhan stressed that Turkey has concluded a framework 
agreement with the Russian Federation for technical cooperation 
in defense. He said: ``Everything has been included in that 
framework agreement. They agree to cooperate on issues relating 
to their missile technology. Experts from the two countries 
will work to realize their cooperation.'' 
  Iran, Iraq, and Syria have many Scud missiles. Iran has 
reportedly cooperated with the DPRK to increase the range of its 
missiles and improve its missile technology. According to U.S. 
intelligence reports, Iran has acquired technology on guided 
missiles. It is working to produce a missile with its own 
resources. 
  Iraq used Scud-B missiles during the Gulf war. But the 
technology that was used in the production of those missiles was 
old. Consequently they were not effective. The Scud-B missiles 
are 90 cm in diameter, weigh 6,300 kg, and have a range of 300 
km. They may miss their targets by 600-800 meters. They may 
operate with solid or liquid fuel and deliver chemical or 
nuclear warheads. The Russian Federation has long-range 
missiles, which have been produced with modern technology. 
  Turkey signed the agreement known as the Missile Technology 
Control Regime in 1993. The United States, the Russian 
Federation, and many Western countries also signed that 
agreement, which bans the sale of missiles with a range of over 
300 km and that can deliver warheads heavier than 500 kg. The 
agreement also limits the transfer of the technology required 
for the production of such missiles. Iran and Syria, which 
possess long-range missiles, have not signed that agreement. 
  The Russian Federation's SS-21 missiles are not included in 
that agreement. The SS-21 missiles, which were developed in 
1976 to deliver conventional warheads, have a range of 120-200 
km. They are launched from mobile launchers. Reportedly, the 
technology used in the production of the Scud missiles is 20 
years older than the technology used in the production of the 
SS-21 missiles. The arming of the SS-21 missiles with warheads 
capable of causing mass destruction has been banned. Turkey has 
acquired military equipment and arms from Russia in the past.

  [Text] Paris, April 21 (YONHAP) -- North Korea sent a 
message to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on 
Wednesday [20 April] proposing that IAEA inspectors witness the 
upcoming change of fuel bars at their 5-megawatt atomic reactor 
in Yonbyon. 
  The message said the fuel bars of the atomic reactor would 
be 
changed in a few weeks. 
  Sources in Vienna said the proposal was North Korea's first 
response toward the demand by the world community for additional 
international inspections of their nuclear facilities. 
  In the message, North Korea did not say whether they would 
accept additional inspections of six other nuclear facilities. 
  North Korea claims that the atomic reactor has been in 
operation since 1986 and that they never changed its fuel bars 
after 1989 when some fuel bars were changed due to a mechanical 
trouble, during which they said they extracted 90 grams of 
plutonium on an experimental basis. 
  A YONHAP report from Berlin said IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer 
confirmed that a contact of some sort was going on with North 
Korea. 
  He said that IAEA Director-General Hans Blix would decide 
whether to accept the North Korean proposal probably Thursday 
afternoon. 
  The IAEA had an emergency meeting Thursday morning to review 
the North Korean overture, the report said.

  [Text] Seoul, April 22 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] was studying Friday the meaning of North 
Korea's request for IAEA inspectors to be ``present'' when 
nuclear fuel rods are changed at its five-megawatt reactor. 
  The IAEA specifically wants to find out whether ``presence'' 
means simple ``observation'' or activity that would allow the 
collection of samples, a senior South Korean Government official 
said. 
  The IAEA will not accept the North Korean proposal if it 
just 
involves observation or limited participation. 
  In their negotiations in Vienna, the IAEA is demanding that 
its inspectors be allowed to collect samples of the waste 
material produced during the changing of nuclear fuel rods, the 
official said. 
  If the IAEA could collect samples of such waste material, it 
would be able to estimate how much plutonium North Korea had 
extracted since the five-megawatt reactor went into operation in 
1986. 
  ``The IAEA is in contact with North Korea in order to find 
out the exact definition of the word `presence' of IAEA 
inspectors,'' the official said, adding that the nuclear 
watchdog is expected to make a decision soon on Pyongyang's 
proposal after analyzing its political and technical intentions. 
  North Korea has not made its position clear on additional 
IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities, requested by the UN 
Security Council president's statement. 
  The official also denied press reports that North Korea had 
offered conditions to the United States on further IAEA checks.

  [Text] Seoul, April 22 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) has officially informed North Korea that 
its inspectors will be present when nuclear fuel rods are 
changed at the 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon, as proposed by 
Pyongyang. 
  One senior South Korean Government official said, ``the IAEA 
has made a decision to accept the North Korean proposal and 
conveyed its intention to send its inspectors to North Korea so 
that they can be present for the changing of nuclear fuel rods 
at the 5-megawatt reactor.'' 
  As a result, IAEA inspectors could arrive in North Korea 
sometime next week as the nuclear fuel rods will likely be 
replaced in early or mid-May. 
  The UN Security Council, in a statement by its president, 
urged North Korea to accept additional IAEA inspections before 
the middle of next month. 
  ``The IAEA has told North Korea to ensure safety measures 
needed by IAEA experts during the nuclear fuel rod changing,'' 
the official said, indicating that the agency and Pyongyang are 
still negotiating follow-up measures to the rod replacement and 
problems related to further checks. 
  In particular, the IAEA is said to be stressing the need for 
additional inspections of the 5-megawatt reactor and a 
radiochemical laboratory, which Pyongyang refused to allow last 
time, he said.

  [Text] Washington, April 22 (YONHAP) -- Pyongyang cannot 
accept an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) proposal for 
inspection of its radiochemical laboratory, a senior North 
Korean official said Thursday. 
  Kim Chong-su, deputy chief of the North Korean mission to 
the 
United Nations, said Pyongyang is willing to allow IAEA 
inspectors to witness the changing of fuel rods at the Yongbyon 
nuclear reactor, but that it cannot accept additional checks of 
the radiochemical laboratory. 
  He said, ``We have allowed every inspection to ensure the 
continuity of nuclear safeguards. We have shown everything to 
the IAEA, and the proposal for additional inspection of the 
laboratory is an absurd demand.'' 
  North Korea sent a message to the agency Wednesday proposing 
that IAEA inspectors witness the upcoming changing of fuel rods 
at the country's five-megawatt nuclear reactor at Yongbyon.

  [Text] REUTER news agency has reported that it is unlikely 
that an International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection 
team will soon enter North Korea to witness the changing of fuel 
rods at North Korea's nuclear reactor in Yongbyon. 
  Denying ROK media reports that an advance team would leave 
for North Korea over the weekend, spokesman Kyd said those 
reports are groundless. Spokesman Kyd admitted that the advance 
team did prepare to leave for North Korea. However, since North 
Korea has not responded to a list of IAEA inspections so far, 
chances are slim that the team would arrive in North Korea by 28 
April, he added.

<F P=106> [``Fuel Rod of Experimental Nuclear Power Station To Be </F>
Replaced in DPRK'' -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 27 (KCNA) -- According to a 
spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea, the DPRK will soon begin the replacement of 
the fuel rod according to the operation plan of the 5 megawatt 
experimental nuclear power station for the present as part of 
the undertakings for the normalization of our peaceful nuclear 
activities. 
  Answering a question put by KCNA today, the spokesman said: 
  Consistent is our stand to show the honesty of our nuclear 
activities, although the replacement of the fuel rod is being 
made while we are still in a unique status following the 
temporary suspension of the effectuation of our declared 
withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
  Hence, we decided to voluntarily notify the International 
Atomic Energy Agency of our plan for the replacement of fuel rod 
and, especially, to allow inspectors of the IAEA to observe the 
process of replacement of the fuel rod so that they may verify 
that nuclear materials are not diverted to non-peaceful 
purposes, and promptly issued entry visas to the inspectors as 
requested by the agency. 
  If inspection activities falling within the scope of routine 
and ad hoc inspections are raised in the course of the 
replacement of the fuel rod, they may be allowed after the 
nuclear issue is settled in a package deal at future DPRK-U.S. 
talks. 
  We will leave the fuel rod to be replaced this time strictly 
under the containment and surveillance of the IAEA and fully 
provide the continuity of safeguards data. 
  We are studying the problem of ``additional inspection'' of 
the radiochemical laboratory raised during the March inspection 
activities of the IAEA in close relations with the attitude of 
the United States and the IAEA Secretariat. 
  Hence, we have already notified them that we are willing to 
allow an ``additional inspection'' as an exception after 
examining their future behavior in keeping with the change of 
the current situation surrounding the exchange of special envoys 
between the North and South. 
  If the United States and the IAEA Secretariat, ignoring our 
good will, rudely demand sampling and other inspection 
activities in disregard of our unique status at the time of the 
replacement of the fuel rod, we will have to regard it as a 
sinister political intention to continue more openly the 
campaign for stifling the DPRK over its peaceful nuclear 
activities. 
  When an irrevocable complex situation is created by that, we 
cannot hold ourselves responsible for it at all. 
  If the United States and the IAEA Secretariat respect our 
unique status and take a fair attitude and position, looking 
straight at the current situation, another opportunity of 
finding a fundamental solution to the nuclear issue will be 
created.

  [Text] Seoul, April 29 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) informed North Korea on 27 April that it 
would send inspectors to Pyongyang to witness the change of fuel 
bars at a 5-megawatt atomic reactor in Yongbyon on the condition 
that the two sides discuss the issue of taking sample materials 
on used fuel later, a diplomatic source here in Seoul said on 
Friday. 
  The source said that IAEA plans to send five inspectors to 
North Korea and asked Pyongyang to issue visas to three 
inspectors in addition to the two who had already obtained visas. 
  If things go on smoothly, the five IAEA inspectors would 
leave Vienna where the IAEA Secretariat is located on April 30 
and fly into Pyongyang via Beijing on May 2 or 3. 
  ``IAEA's position is that sample of after-use fuel should be 
taken without fail at the time of the change of fuel bars,'' the 
source said. 
  ``I understand that IAEA chose to send inspectors on the 
condition of the later discussion of sample taking inasmuch as 
the deadline for fuel rod change is imminent.'' 
  The five IAEA inspectors will not only witness the change of 
fuel bars but will also conduct routine checks such as the 
change of films and battery of surveillance camera, the source 
said. 
  A North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman said on April 27 
they would accept seven items out of the eight-point inspection 
demanded by IAEA with the sole exception of sample taking. 
  Besides, North Korea expressed the willingness to place 
after-use fuel rods under IAEA surveillance until sample is 
taken under an agreement they would reach with IAEA.

  [Text] Seoul, April 27 KYODO -- North Korea has rejected a 
request from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to 
sample and analyze fuel at a key nuclear facility, a South 
Korean daily reported Wednesday [27 April]. 
  Pyongyang told the IAEA Monday that the IAEA's request to 
inspect a 5,000-kilowatt nuclear reactor in Yongbyon, some 90 
kilometers north of Pyongyang, is inappropriate, the TONG-A ILBO 
said. 
  The IAEA is insisting that North Korea allow a full check of 
North Korea's nuclear stockpiles, in addition to monitoring 
replacement of fuel rods at the nuclear plant. 
  In a front-page story dispatched from Vienna, the daily 
quoted North Korean diplomat Yun Ho-chin as saying that he 
notified the IAEA it would not be granted permission to conduct 
eight tests when the fuel rods are exchanged at the nuclear 
reactor. 
  The IAEA says the inspections would reveal the current level 
of North Korea's nuclear program and how much plutonium has 
already been recovered from the spent nuclear fuel. 
  Yun, a counselor at the North Korean Embassy in Austria, 
said 
the IAEA can ensure that nuclear materials are not being 
diverted to military purposes when it observes the removal of 
the reactor core, according to the report. 
  North Korea has nothing more to say to the IAEA, Yun was 
quoted saying. 
  The Yongbyon reactor was started up in 1986. Its fuel rods 
are almost exhausted and are due for replacement. The reactor 
was previously shut down for 100 days in 1989 for unknown 
reasons. 
  The nuclear complex at Yongbyon has been the focus of 
Western 
allegations that North Korea is engaged in a covert nuclear arms 
development program.

  [Text] North Korea rejected the International Atomic Energy 
Agency's [IAEA] new proposal that the IAEA conduct gamma mapping 
and analysis on used nuclear fuel later. Accordingly, the IAEA 
has canceled the plan to send five inspectors to North Korea. 
  IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer said: North Korea sent a reply to 
the IAEA's new proposal on 29 April, and an analysis of the 
reply message by IAEA high-level policy makers has come to the 
conclusion that it is unsatisfactory [manjoksuropchi motan 
kosuro kyollonul naeryoddago]. 
  He stressed: The IAEA has canceled the planned visit to 
North Korea by the five inspectors, who were supposed to leave 
for the country today [30 April], since North Korea notified 
that it cannot meet the IAEA's demand that North Korea allow the 
inspection team to conduct necessary inspection activities when 
fuel rods are changed. 
  Hans Meyer also said that the IAEA plans to discuss the 
change of fuel rods with North Korea again early next week.

  [Text] Vienna, May 2 KYODO -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) has renewed its demand that North Korea 
allow it to conduct full inspections at the time of refueling at 
an experimental reactor in Yongbyon, an IAEA spokesman said 
Monday [2 May]. 
  The spokesman said the Vienna-based nuclear watchdog body 
made the demand in a letter sent to North Korea on Sunday. 
  The IAEA wants to send an inspection team to North Korea to 
oversee the refueling which involves the replacement of fuel 
rods at the 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon, 90 kilometers north 
of Pyongyang. 
  The Yongbyon complex has been the focus of allegations that 
North Korea is pursuing a clandestine nuclear weapons program. 
  North Korea on April 29 offered to allow IAEA inspectors to 
be present at the unloading of spent fuel rods from the reactor, 
but said it would not permit the IAEA to measure radioactivity 
levels or take samples. 
  The IAEA later indicated that North Korea's terms were 
unacceptable. 
  North Korea had indicated it would like to conduct the 
refueling as early as late April. 
  The latest IAEA message to North Korea indicates that the 
agency has not budged from the insistence that it wants full 
inspections of the facility and that it will consider a failure 
to allow this as an infringement of the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty. 
  U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry said in Seoul on April 
21 that North Korea will be able to acquire enough plutonium 
``within weeks'' to make four to five nuclear bombs with the 
fuel rod change at the reactor.

<F P=106> [Report by Cha Man-sun from Vienna] </F>
  [Text] Although North Korea has rejected essential 
inspection activities during its replacement of nuclear fuel 
rods, the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] has assumed 
a position of immediately dispatching an inspection team to 
North Korea and not discarding dialogue with the DPRK in 
expectation of a change in the North's basic position through 
contact with the United States. 
  The IAEA is hoping that North Korea, in the face of the 
report to be presented by IAEA Director-General Hans Blix at the 
UN Security Council in mid-May, will show a positive response 
through contact with the United States and that dialogue with 
North Korea will be maintained. The IAEA is also keeping the 
five-member inspection team, who have already obtained entry 
visas to North Korea, on standby. 
  It is a basic position of the IAEA that it determines if 
North Korea converted used nuclear material through inspection 
activities during North Korea's replacement of nuclear fuel 
rods, and to provide a perfect surveillance system to prevent 
North Korea from converting used nuclear material in the future. 
  North Korea rejected IAEA's essential inspection activities 
through which IAEA can verify if used nuclear material was 
converted and revealed its intention to use this issue as a 
negotiating card during contact with the United States to gain 
support for its light-water reactor. 
  Apart from such moves by North Korea, North Korea linked the 
nuclear issue with the third round of U.S.-North Korean 
high-level talks during the recent working-level contact with 
the United States. Thus, it is likely that in the event the 
North Korean demand is accepted during the upcoming U.S.-North 
Korean contact in New York, North Korea will accept the IAEA 
demand for substantive inspection activities.

  [Text] In response to a question from a Korean Central News 
Agency reporter regarding the replacement of fuel rods at the 
five-megawatt experimental nuclear power station, a spokesman 
for the DPRK Foreign Ministry today gave the following answer: 
  In connection with the replacement of fuel rods at the 
five-megawatt experimental nuclear power station, we and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] Secretariat recently 
exchanged many telex messages. Under our special position 
[tuksuhan chiwi] in which we temporarily suspended the 
effectuation of the withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty [NPT], out of a consistent position to show the 
irreproachability [kyolbaeksong] of our nuclear activities, we 
decided to subject the upcoming replacement of fuel rods to the 
thorough surveillance of the agency. Therefore, we decided to 
allow agency inspectors to observe [iphoe] the replacement of 
fuel rods to verify that the nuclear material is not diverted 
for other, nonpeaceful purposes [tarun pipyonghwajok mokchoge 
yuyong]. 
  The agency's observance activities, which we decided to 
allow, include the observance [kwanchuk] of the replacement of 
fuel rods, containment and surveillance [pongswaewa kamsi] of 
all replaced fuels, and all other contents of inspection 
sufficient enough to ensure the continuity of safeguards 
[tamboui yonsoksongul pojanghanunde chungbunhan sachal 
naeyongduri]. We also immediately issued visas for the five 
inspectors, which the agency requested. As shown, we made all 
possible efforts to prove the transparency [tumyongsong] of our 
nuclear activities even though we are under a special position. 
  Nevertheless, the IAEA Secretariat is now making an 
unreasonable request [pudanghan yongu] to select, preserve, and 
measure [sontaek pogwanhago chukchong] some fuel rods during the 
fuel rod replacement. 
  They say that they would select and measure fuel rods. This 
is tantamount to an attempt to conduct regular and irregular 
inspections [chonggi mit pijonggi sachal] in disregard to our 
special position in which we temporarily suspended the 
withdrawal from the NPT. This can in no way be allowed [tojohui 
hoyongdoelsu opta]. 
  The only inspection activity that we can allow as a 
voluntary 
goodwill measure at present is an inspection purely to ensure 
the continuity of safeguards to prove that the nuclear material 
is not diverted for other purposes in compliance with our 
special position [hyondangyeeso uriga chawonjogin sonuiui 
chochiro hoyonghaejulsu innun sachal hwaltongun uriui tuksu 
chiwie matke haengmunchiri tarunmochoge 
yuyongdoejiannundanungosul hwaginhanun sunsu tamboui yonsoksong 
pojangul wihan sachal ppunida]. 
  Allowing the agency to subject all replaced fuel rods to its 
containment and surveillance and to verify that they are not 
diverted for other purposes is the expression of our greatest 
goodwill [uriui choedaeui sonuiui pyosi]. 
  The IAEA Secretariat, however, is insisting on unfair 
demands, while openly ignoring our special position. This is 
clear proof that the IAEA Secretariat is still treating us with 
prejudice, while using suspicions of us as an excuse and that 
the IAEA's partiality keeps expanding. 
  The IAEA Secretariat, which has in the past fabricated 
inconsistencies by eliminating [word indistinct] samples, this 
time wants to measure selected parts of the fuel rods. This 
proves that it intends to continue to cling to the anti-Republic 
pressure commotion by eventually making new inconsistencies. 
  What cannot be overlooked is that the IAEA Secretariat is 
still not sending an inspection team, even though we have this 
time allowed inspections to ensure the continuity of safeguards 
and the so-called unfinished inspections, which was raised in 
the last inspection conducted in March. 
  This clearly shows that the IAEA Secretariat has been 
pursuing insidious political objectives by raising our nuclear 
issue at the IAEA Board of Governors meeting and the UN Security 
Council. If we allow the measurement of selected parts of the 
fuel rods under such circumstances, the IAEA Secretariat is sure 
to fabricate a new pretext in the anti-Republic pressure 
commotion. We can no longer let the IAEA Secretariat use our 
nuclear issue in the political game. 
  In case the IAEA Secretariat does not accept our reasonable 
proposal and insists on its unfair demands to the end, we cannot 
but replace the fuel rods in accordance with our operation plan. 
  In technical and security aspects, the replacement of the 
fuel rods is an urgent matter that cannot be delayed any more. 
Whether the IAEA inspectors are there to observe or not, the 
spent fuel counter, thermal luminescence detectors, and 
surveillance equipment installed by the IAEA in the experimental 
nuclear power plant are still operational, therefore, our fuel 
rod replacement work will be under thorough IAEA surveillance. 
  We will place all replaced fuel from the fuel rods under 
IAEA 
control and will allow examination when the nuclear issue is 
resolved in a package deal in future DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  In the event the IAEA Secretariat drives the situation to 
extremes, despite our maximum generosity and good intentions, 
correspondingly, we will resolutely counter this [urinun ungdang 
kue tanhohi taechohae nagal kosida]. 
  With the resolution of the nuclear issue now reaching a 
gateway stage [kwanmunjok taemok], the IAEA Secretariat should 
think more deeply.

  [Text] Berlin, May 2 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] sent another letter to North Korea Monday 
urging the communist state to let IAEA experts undertake 
inspections when it changes fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor 
in Yongbyon, sources close to the agency said. Such inspections 
are necessary under the nuclear safeguards agreement, the IAEA 
has reportedly pointed out. 
  The agency sent a second letter after determining that North 
Korea's reply on 29 April to its first letter was 
unsatisfactory. Monday's letter was sent to ascertain North 
Korea's true intentions, the sources said Tuesday. 
  In its reply, Pyongyang told the nuclear watchdog that the 
fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor must be changed soon and 
requested an early dispatch of IAEA inspectors. It made no 
commitment, however, on IAEA requests laid down as conditions 
for the presence of its inspectors at the refueling. North Korea 
only agreed to allow the inspectors to be present when it 
removes spent fuel rods from the reactor. 
  It gave no clear reply to ``the IAEA's flexible technical 
and 
compromising plans'' on taking samples in order to determine the 
extent of plutonium extraction and the reactor's operating 
condition. 
  The IAEA, in its initial letter sent early last week, told 
North Korea it was willing to compromise and take random samples 
of the spent rods, seal them and analyze them later. 
  Although the North Koreans themselves suggested that the 
IAEA 
be present during the refueling of the five-megawatt reactor, 
they have failed to make an offer that would allow satisfactory 
inspection activities, the sources said. As a result, the IAEA 
sent the second letter seeking to confirm North Korea's exact 
intentions, they added.

<F P=106> [Cha Man-sun Reports from Vienna] </F>
  [Text] On 3 May, Hans Blix, secretary general of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], sent an urgent 
telegram to North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam in an 
attempt to make a breakthrough in the issue of witnessing the 
changing of fuel rods at North Korea's nuclear reactor in 
Yonbyon. 
  In the telegram, he emphasized that the IAEA would sent its 
inspectors if North Korea accepts the demands set forth by the 
IAEA, and pointed out that the changing of nuclear fuel rods 
without witnesses may lead to a serious situation under which 
the transparency of North Korea's nuclear development cannot be 
guaranteed. 
  It was reported that Secretary General Hans Blix may have 
stressed that the IAEA would be compelled to report to the UN 
Security Council of its inability to confirm whether nuclear 
materials are being diverted in the event that the nuclear fuel 
rods are changed without the presence of inspectors. 
  Considering that all previous communications have been made 
through a working-level channel, the IAEA secretary general's 
urgent telegram is taken to be a very unusual step that hints of 
an acute situation and that can be interpreted as an ultimatum 
regarding the changing of nuclear fuel rods. This step was taken 
as the situation turned more serious as North Korea recently 
reiterated its position to go ahead with the changing of its 
nuclear fuel rods in a statement released by the North Korean 
Foreign Ministry.

  [Text] It has been learned that the visit to North Korea by 
an inspection team will be realized around this weekend at the 
earliest as North Korea and the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA] have narrowed their opinions as to the issues of 
additional inspections and the witnessing of the change of 
nuclear fuel rods. 
  Today, one diplomatic source in Seoul said: As letters have 
been exchanged between North Korea and the IAEA, the differences 
of opinion between the two sides have now nearly been settled. 
The IAEA says it will begin inspections of whatever is settled 
first, either the additional inspections or the witnessing of 
the change of nuclear fuel rods. It is believed that the IAEA 
will conduct other inspections when it visits North Korea.

  [Text] Seoul, May 7 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean Government 
decided Saturday [7 May] that additional action by the UN 
Security Council against North Korea is unavoidable if Pyongyang 
does not accept by next week an IAEA (International Atomic 
Energy Agency) presence during the changing of fuel rods at the 
5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon. 
  The decision was made at a Unification and National Security 
Policy Coordination meeting presided over by new Deputy Premier 
and National Unification Minister Yi Hong-ku. 
  ``Our government position is that if North Korea presses 
ahead with changing the fuel rods by themselves, it would be 
unavoidable to take additional steps against the North,'' Yi 
said. 
  Emerging from the meeting, the deputy premier said North 
Korea has thus far maintained that it cannot allow the 
collection of samples from the reactor's spent fuel rods. 
  The meeting also decided to step up the existing system of 
cooperation with the United States, the United Nations and the 
IAEA with respect to the nuclear question. 
  As to when any additional action might come, Yi said not 
much 
time is left. 
  ``The recent UN Security Council presidential statement has 
set mid-May as the deadline for North Korea's acceptance of 
additional IAEA inspections,'' he said. 
  Noting that the North Koreans' attitude remained somewhat 
ambiguous, the deputy premier said their position would become 
clear either this weekend or early next week. 
  Yi added, however, that if North Korea expressly promises to 
allow IAEA sampling of fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor, it 
could be taken as a sign of progress. 
  It is still unclear, he said, whether North Korea has begun 
to change the fuel rods on its own. 
  North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam, in a message to 
the IAEA, said Friday his country could allow additional 
inspections of its nuclear facilities, including taking samples 
from a glove box at the key radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon. 
  But Kim said he could not promise permission to collect 
samples from the fuel rods at the 5-megawatt atomic reactor, a 
source said.

  [Text] Beijing, May 3 (XINHUA) -- China and Japan signed a 
``cooperation arrangement on nuclear safety'' here today, making 
Japan China's seventh partner in the endeavor for nuclear safety 
following the United States, France, Germany and some other 
industrialized countries. 
  The agreement was signed by Huang Qitao, vice-minister of 
China's State Science and Technology Commission and director 
general of the National Nuclear Safety Administration (NNSA), 
and Youki Kawata, director general of the Agency of Natural 
Resources and Energy under the Japanese Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry. 
  Under the agreement, the two contracting parties will 
strengthen cooperation on the safety administration of 
commercial nuclear power plants in the two countries, exchange 
information and experts so as to ensure nuclear safety. 
  In a meeting with Kawata prior to the signing ceremony, 
Huang 
said that the agreement will usher in a new period for 
Sino-Japanese cooperation in nuclear safety. 
  Kawata expressed the conviction that more effective 
cooperation in nuclear safety will help boost the overall 
Japan-China cooperation. 
  A month ago, the NNSA, a government organ independently 
exercising administration over nuclear safety in China, 
concluded a cooperation agreement for nuclear safety with the 
Nuclear Safety Bureau of Japan's Science and Technology Agency.

  [Text] New York, April 28 (YONHAP) -- North Korea and the 
United States met behind closed doors Thursday [28 April] to 
discuss a diplomatic solution to the dispute over Pyongyang's 
nuclear program, sources here said. 
  Washington expressed its willingness to hold a third round 
of 
high-level talks with Pyongyang as well as suspend ``Team 
Spirit,'' the annual joint South Korean-U.S. military exercise, 
if North Korea permits additional outside nuclear inspections 
and agrees to resume inter-Korean dialogue. 
  The United States said North Korea should allow the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] to observe the 
refueling of the 5-megawatt reactor at Yongbyon and satisfy the 
IAEA's calls for collection of samples and other technical work, 
informed sources said. 
  The State Department announced that at the working-level 
contact Thursday, the U.S. side conveyed a letter from Robert 
Gallucci, assistant secretary for political and military 
affairs, in response to a written message from Kang Sok-chu, 
North Korea's first vice foreign minister. 
  The State Department said it expects that North Korea will 
answer the letter soon. 
  Gallucci reportedly said in the message the United States 
will hold further high-level talks and suspend Team Spirit if 
North Korea maintains the continuity of nuclear safeguards by 
allowing additional inspections, the sources said. 
  North Korea did not present any new proposals, instead just 
listening to the U.S. position, but will likely disclose its 
stance at the next contact expected early next week, sources 
said. 
  The meeting was made at the request of the U.S. side. 
  The State Department's North Korea desk officer, C. Kenneth 
Quinones, led the Americans while the councilor at the North 
Korean mission to the United Nations, Han Song-yol, headed the 
other side. 
  The two nations agreed at their 25 February contact that 
North Korea would accept IAEA inspections of seven declared 
nuclear sites, that they would hold a third round of high-level 
talks, that Team Spirit would be suspended this year, and that 
South and North Korea would exchange special envoys. 
  But North Korea refused to exchange special envoys and did 
not accept IAEA checks of a radiochemical laboratory, in effect 
breaking the agreement.

  [Text] Sao Paulo, 22 Apr (EFE) -- In a final declaration 
issued at the end of the fourth meeting of foreign ministers, 
the Rio Group and the EU today agreed to call for a total ban on 
nuclear tests in the world and condemned every form of terrorism. 
  Regarding their commitment to disarmament and to 
nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the 
participants of the fourth Rio Group-EU ministerial meeting 
expressed their complete agreement in condemning every form of 
nuclear testing. 
  The Sao Paulo Declaration, which was approved by 13 foreign 
ministers of the Rio Group and representatives of the EU member 
countries, states: ``The ministers (of the Rio Group and the 
EU) agree on proposing the signing of a multilateral treaty that 
would impose a total ban on nuclear tests and would be fully 
verifiable.'' 
  In the Sao Paulo Declaration, the Rio Group and the EU also 
expressed their total condemnation of terrorism. 
  The declaration states: ``The ministers...condemn without 
reservations -- as an unjustifiable crime--every act of 
terrorism, irrespective of who perpetrates them, where, or why, 
because acts of terrorism endanger and claim the lives of human 
beings. They also undermine human dignity and are a threat to 
democracy and to a state of law.'' 
  The ministerial meeting between the Rio Group and the EU is 
the fourth since bilateral talks were institutionalized by the 
Rome Declaration (1990). The meeting, which is being held at 
the Latin American Parliament (Parlatino) building in the city 
of Sao Paulo, is scheduled to close on 23 April but the final 
declaration was released today. 
  In addition to condemning nuclear tests, the Rio Group-EU 
ministers praised the ``recent progress made in consolidating 
the regime for a total ban on nuclear weapons in Latin America 
and the Caribbean as established in the Tlatelolco Treaty.'' 
  The declaration also expressed support for the Convention 
Banning the Development, Production, Storage, and Use of 
Chemical Weapons and Their Destruction, and revealed their 
resolve to adopt specific measures to fully implement the 
Convention on Biological Weapons. 
  The Rio Group and the EU also voiced their desire to 
cooperate to give openness to international arms trade. 
  The latter point was specifically requested by Andean 
countries like Colombia, which has been affected by arms 
trafficking financed by narcotrafficking and terrorist 
organizations. 
  The two blocs' representatives agreed to promote a UN 
Registry of Conventional Weapons with a view to effectively 
controlling arms possession around the world. 
  In the Sao Paulo Declaration, which consists of 19 points 
focusing on economic and political issues, the Rio Group and the 
EU reaffirm their respect for democracy and the principles of 
free trade. 
  The Rio Group and the EU also have agreed to define a new 
model of bilateral relations in which the Latin American 
countries would have greater participation in various 
international issues such as world security and the reform of 
the UN Charter. 
  The Latin American countries also expressed their concern 
about the social, environmental, and labor conditions some 
European nations are starting to impose on their trade with 
developing countries. 
  The continuation and expansion of the Generalized System of 
Preferences (GSP), which expires this year and regulates trade 
between the EU and Latin American countries, was another request 
made by the Rio Group that was included in the final declaration. 
  The Sao Paulo meeting was attended by all of the foreign 
ministers of the Rio Group--which consists of Argentina, 
Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, 
Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Attending the meeting as 
observers were the ministers of Trinidad and Tobago and 
Guatemala, representing the Caribbean and Central America, 
respectively. 
  The EU was represented by the foreign ministers of Spain and 
Portugal; Greek Alternate Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos, 
who is vice president of the EU; deputy ministers; and deputy 
ministers of the other members of the ``Group of 12'' (Denmark, 
Germany, Italy, United Kingdom, Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg, 
the Netherlands, and France).

  [Text] Beijing, April 20 (XINHUA) -- A training course for 
60 operators from Pakistan's Cashma Nuclear Power Plant opened 
today at the post-graduate school under the China National 
Nuclear Corporation (CNNC). 
  The 300,000 kilowatt Cashma is modeled after the Qinshan 
Nuclear Power Plant in coastal Zhejiang Province, which was 
designed and built entirely by China itself. It is the first 
nuclear power plant China has ever exported to a foreign country. 
  The contract obliged CNNC to provide training in basic 
theories to Pakistani engineers and technicians to ensure 
Cashma's safe operation and maintenance. The trainees are to 
receive on-job training at Qinshan at the end of the course. 
  According to CNNC officials, some 62 Chinese scientists were 
organized to prepare a set of 17 textbooks in 14 subjects for 
the training course, which were examined and approved by the 
China Institute of Atomic Energy, the National Nuclear Safety 
Administration and the prestigious Qinghua University. 
  The textbooks were accepted by the Pakistani side, the 
officials said.

<F P=106> [Article by S.H. Venkatramani] </F>
  [Text] There has been considerable media cerebration about 
the precise diplomatic strategy that India should adopt to 
prevent and pre-empt the United States from selling F-16s to 
Pakistan. The debate has begun to acquire a certain sense of 
urgency because of the impending visit of the Prime Minister, 
Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, to the U.S. What has accentuated the 
strategic importance of carrying conviction to Capitol Hill on 
the F-16s is the attempt by the U.S. Deputy Secretary of State, 
Mr. Strobe Talbott, during his just concluded visit to Delhi, to 
convince India about the strategic wisdom of the U.S. parting 
with 38 F-16s to Pakistan in return for the latter capping its 
nuclear programme. 
  Our sense of judgement is clouded at the moment by the 
political and emotional aftermath of the significant recent 
visits of Mr. Talbott and his immediate junior, the U.S. 
Assistant Secretary of State, Ms. Robin Raphel. On the one 
hand, Mr. Rao felt a compelling political need to talk tough 
with Mr. Talbott; on the other, Delhi could not help but betray 
its sense of lurking fear about the F-16s adversely altering the 
balance of power in the subcontinent. I would argue that it is 
a deep-rooted sense of culture and conviction, independent of 
the immediate provocation, that we have to exhibit in responding 
to the question of the U.S. sale of F-16s to Pakistan. Instead 
of giving the impression that we are merely opposing the sale of 
the F-16s, we should broaden the base of the diplomatic debate 
to discuss the nuclear question per se. 
  We have consistently refused to sign the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] on the ground that it was 
discriminatory. We have taken an issue-based position on the 
NPT. I think it similarly behooves us as a nation to take a 
principled stand on the broader nuclear question itself, instead 
of treating the F-16s as an immediate expediency. 
  What this means is that we have to take a position not only 
against the sale of F-16s to Pakistan; we have to fight against 
the unwitting dissemination of American nuclear weapons 
technology around the globe; more, we have to crusade against 
the spread of U.S. nuclear reactor technology itself to the rest 
of the world. 
  India should seize the F-16 opportunity to nail the American 
nuclear lie. Delhi can take up the cause of effectively proving 
that there is no such thing as a safe nuclear reactor 
technology. Every nuclear reactor produces, among several other 
radioactive by-products, 400 to 500 pounds of plutonium 
annually. You need just 10 to 20 pounds of plutonium to make a 
bomb. Therefore, the yearly radioactive waste discharged by an 
average nuclear reactor holds enough toxic potential for the 
manufacture of anything from 20 to 50 atomic bombs. Through 
plutonium, nuclear reactor technology and nuclear weapons 
technology have become inseparably interlinked. 
  The ecological hazardous potential of plutonium should not 
be 
underestimated at all. Named after Pluto, the Greek God of the 
underworld, plutonium is the most long-lived radioactive 
by-product of a nuclear reactor; it remains poisonous for at 
least 500,000 years. Just think for a moment that this stretch 
of time is more than 100 times longer than the entire span of 
recorded history. It is more than 50 times longer than the time 
that has elapsed from the end of the Ice Age to the present day. 
  Less than one millionth of a gram of plutonium can cause 
cancer. One pound of plutonium, if uniformly distributed 
throughout the earth, can afflict every human being with lung 
cancer. It is crucially important to realise that plutonium in 
the environment does not vanish with the death of an infected 
organism. A contaminated dead animal, for instance, may be 
eaten by another animal; it may also rot away, and mix with the 
soil. In any case, plutonium will remain in the environment, 
and will continue to poison one organism after another, one 
living being after another, for half a million years. 
  It has been authoritatively estimated that if the American 
nuclear industry expands according to current projections, and 
somehow manages to miraculously contain its plutonium with 99.99 
percent perfection, it will be responsible for 500,000 fatal 
lung cancers every year for 50 years after 2020 AD. This 
incidentally will amount to a 25 percent increase in the total 
death rate in the U.S. It is to be clearly understood that 
there is no putting the clock back on plutonium after it gets 
created as a byproduct; there is no unscrambling of the 
scrambled egg; there is absolutely no foolproof method of 
containing plutonium after it is made. As American nuclear 
technology seeps to the rest of the world, tonnes of plutonium 
are bound to get routinely transported across highways and 
through rail roads. 
  India should work for adequate universal appreciation of the 
fact that at every step in the process of generating nuclear 
energy there, is continuous and invisible radioactive poisoning 
of both the workers in the nuclear industry and the entire 
natural environment. From the mining, milling and enrichment of 
uranium to the fabrication of fuel rods, the operation of a 
nuclear reactor and the handling of nuclear waste, there is 
radioactive contamination of the human and physical environment 
at every stage. The radioactive substances that continuously 
escape into the atmosphere from the site of a nuclear reactor 
emit a range of subatomic particles that can penetrate your skin 
and damage your body cells. You also stand the risk of taking 
in radioactively polluted food or water that can do you 
incalculable internal harm. 
  All the advancements in American technology have not yet 
found a solution to the serious problem of decommissioning a 
nuclear reactor at the end of its useful life. The development 
and proliferation of the so-called faster breeder reactors only 
carries the nuclear risk a step further. These reactors use 
plutonium itself as a fuel and are much more dangerous than the 
ordinary commercial reactors. India can demonstrate its 
deep-rooted ecological sensitivity by driving the point home to 
the world at large that there is no such thing as a safe level 
of nuclear radiation, contrary to what the American nuclear 
industry would have us believe. It is relevant to note that 
Ralph Nader had made the point somewhere that nuclear power has 
become in many ways America's ``technological Vietnam.'' 
  It would be a little sad if Mr. Narasimha Rao were to cosy 
up 
to Uncle Sam to stop the sale of F-16s to Pakistan. The 
Pressler amendment and the F-16 should be just flea-bites in the 
Indian-world-view. If India were to take up the cause of the 
development of technology for effectively harnessing solar 
energy, like, for instance, the development of commercially 
viable photovoltaic cells to covert sunlight into electricity, 
well, that would, mesh in with our native culture of concern for 
the environment. After recently espousing the cause of ``the 
middle path'' in the U.K., it will only be in the fitness of 
things if Mr. Rao were to give a call, for a transition from a 
poisonous nuclear era to a promising solar age, in the U.S. Mr. 
Rao should take the bull of the American nuclear industry by the 
horns rather than merely oppose the sale of F-16s.

  [Text] The United States can transport uranium from the 
nuclear arms plants of the former Soviet Union across Finland. 
The Council of State has granted a lower responsibility in the 
event of accidents with regard to the transportation of 
low-level uranium. The decision was made because of plans by an 
American company to import diluted uranium extracted from 
nuclear arms to the United States to be used as fuel in nuclear 
power plants. 
  The uranium is transported by cargo ships, which can now 
visit Finnish harbors to collect cargo.

  [Excerpt] Beijing, April 30 KYODO -- Chinese Foreign 
Minister Qian Qichen indicated Friday [29 April] that China is 
not well-informed on North Korea's nuclear development program 
despite its friendly ties with Pyongyang, Japanese officials 
said. 
  Qian told a Japanese delegation led by House of Councillors 
President Bunbei Hara that China does not know for sure for what 
purpose North Korea is trying to develop nuclear facilities, the 
officials said. Qian said he cannot determine whether North 
Korea wants to use the facilities peacefully or develop nuclear 
weapons, or to use the nuclear issue as a means of improving 
relations with the United States, according to the Japanese 
officials. 
  North Korea has been accused of trying to develop a nuclear 
arsenal and of refusing to accept full inspection by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  Qian also said that as the North Korean nuclear issue has 
had 
effects on Japan and South Korea particularly, China will try to 
find a solution through dialogue, the officials said. The 
foreign minister, noting Pyongyang's dissatisfaction with 
China's establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea, 
said Beijing set up ties with Seoul so as not to isolate North 
Korea, the officials said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] With German ``know-how'' and 20 million German marks 
[DM] (for 1993-94) for the time being, the FRG Government wants 
to accelerate the abolition of chemical and nuclear means of 
mass destruction in Russia and Ukraine. At the moment, the 
Russians can destroy only about 2,000 nuclear warheads per year. 
On the territory of the former Soviet Union there are 30,000 
nuclear warheads and, in Russia alone, 40,000 tonnes of chemical 
weapons. It would take 15 to 20 years to destroy these stocks. 
  An internal paper of the Foreign Ministry says that, in 
October 1993, an agreement was concluded with the Defense 
Ministry in Moscow on the construction of a pilot plant for the 
destruction of the chemical combat agents lewisite and yperite 
in the area of Saratov (final price DM62 million). A mobile 
laboratory for the analysis of combat agents was handed over to 
the Russians already in December 1993. The costs for the 
``disarmament aid for chemical weapons'' in 1993: about DM5 
million. For the accelerated disarmament of their nuclear 
weapons Russia and Ukraine have asked the Federal Government 
this year for equipment as well as control and safety systems at 
a value of about DM17 million.

  [Text] Seoul, April 29 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Defense 
Minister Yi Pyong-tae signed a ``memorandum of understanding on 
bilateral military exchanges between Korea and Russia '94-95,'' 
which puts emphasis on exchange of personnel, at a meeting 
Friday with his Russian counterpart Pavel Grachev in Moscow, the 
South Korean Defense Ministry said. 
  Yi and Grachev talked about major international issues in 
Northest Asia, including Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions, the 
ministry said. The two ministers shared the view that the 
suspected North Korean nuclear problem should be checked to 
ensure peace in Northeast Asia and that the North must return to 
the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty to assume its responsibility 
as a member of international community, the ministry said. 
  The two agreed to enhance bilateral military cooperation 
including exchanges of students and military personnel, the 
ministry said. 
  In accordance with the agreement, Mikhail Kolesnikov, 
Russian 
chief of General Staff, will visit South Korea during the second 
half of the year while South Korea's vice defense minister and 
the Air Force chief of Staff will visit Russia next year, 
according to the ministry. Russian Defense Minister Pavel 
Grachev will reciprocate with his Seoul visit next year, the 
ministry said. 
  The two sides agreed that South Korean military officers be 
assigned to Russian military education centers to help them 
learn the Russian language and enhance understanding between the 
two countries, the ministry said. 
  South Korean Naval Academy cadets will also be allowed to 
call at Russian ports while on their tour of foreign countries 
in their training ships, the ministry said. 
  The two also exchanged views on Russia's idea of repaying 
Korean loans in kind, particularly in weapons, the ministry said. 
  During his stay in Russia, Yi will meet with Russian Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
and other high-ranking officials, the ministry said. Yi will 
also visit major Russian military facilities including tank 
units before leaving for Germany on May 3.

  [Text] Moscow, April 22 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has 
persistently tried to attract competent Russian rocket engineers 
since 1990, with more than 20 Russian scientists having made 
their way to the Stalinist country via China to work in 
Pyongyang, a vernacular Russian newspaper reported Friday. 
  The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA (Communist Youth's Truth) said it 
believed some scientists were assisting Pyongyang's nuclear 
development by computer mail from home since the Russian 
Government has barred them from traveling to North Korea, adding 
that controlling the scientists was impossible at present. 
  North Korea signed a contract with the defunct Soviet Union 
in August 1990 to import 200 rocket experts, but it was 
nullified with Seoul and Moscow's normalization of diplomatic 
ties and Seoul's promise of a loan, it reported. 
  Anatoly Rubtsov, a Russian solid state physicist and now a 
member of North Korea's Science Academy, told the paper that 
Pyongyang approached him at a Beijing seminar in April 1991 
after its original plan failed. 
  After accepting Pyongyang's offer, he bribed the Russian 
Foreign Ministry with U.S. dollars and obtained 200 blank 
passports. He was paid by the North Korean Embassy in Moscow. 
  Rubtosov said he was able to lure 36 Russian engineers, many 
of them experts in the rocket field. They told security 
officers they ``wanted to use their knowledge anywhere 
regardless of politics'' when they and their families were 
detained at Moscow's Sheremetievo Airport in October 1992 while 
trying to get to Pyongyang. 
  A reliable document shows that despite the government ban, 
more than 20 Russian scientists have made their way to North 
Korea via China, the paper said. Living under pseudonyms, they 
are reportedly paid 3,000-4,000 dollars per month. But some, 
preferring not to take the risk, instead provide information by 
computer mail from their homes in Russia, the paper said.

  [Text] Kiev [no dateline as received] -- Our country will 
have a share of $16 million in the $100 million aid package 
allocated by the Japanese Government for nuclear arms 
dismantling in Kazakhstan, Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, the 
Japanese Embassy told UNIAN on 4 May. Japan is expecting 
Ukraine to submit specific projects for this amount. 
  According to Ukraine's Foreign Ministry, the two countries 
are working on a joint declaration on principles of relations 
and cooperation between Ukraine and Japan, a memorandum on 
mutual understanding between the two countries' Foreign 
Ministries, and an intergovernmental agreement on mutual 
encouragement and protection of investments. They are also 
working on the issue of Ukraine's succession to the laws and 
agreements that regulated the relations between Japan and the 
former USSR.

  [Text] Lima, 28 Apr (EFE) -- The Peruvian police guarantee 
that the Shining Path [SL] terrorist group has split. In a 
report released today by the Counterterrorism Directorate, the 
police speculate on the possibility of a clash between the two 
factions into which the group has allegedly split. 
  The report states that the leaders who support peace -- 
which 
government officials believe is led by Abimael Guzman, the SL 
founder and leader -- have been expelled. The other faction 
does not regard him as a leader -- although it recognizes him as 
"ideologist" -- because he "does not address (the party or the 
war) from jail." 
  Government officials believe the faction that does not 
accept 
Guzman's leadership believes the alleged peace proposal is not 
genuine, they consider it a government "hoax." 
  The police report points out that the group split after the 
establishment -- under the leadership of Oscar Ramirez Durand, 
alias "Feliciano" -- of a new central committee in March in the 
Huanta Province mountains. This new central committee agreed to 
pursue the war that began in 1980. 
  The police report states that this group described the 
members of the central committee allegedly headed by Guzman as 
"debased people, traitors, weaklings, and old revisionists." 
  Government officials state that the rejoinder issued by 
Guzman's loyal followers was disclosed in a communique also 
dated March. In this communique, Guzman's loyal followers 
charge the rebels with feigning loyalty to their leader and with 
"undermining the party" over "personal and opportunist 
ambitions." 
  Therefore, the police believe "the internal dispute has 
entered the elimination phase and a settlement of accounts has 
not been ruled out."

  [Text] Lima, 23 Apr (EFE) -- It appears that "Ricardo Z" 
has become the new leader of Peru's Maoist gang Shining Path 
[SL] after ousting Oscar Alberto Ramirez, aka "Feliciano." So 
far, Peruvian intelligence services have been unable to 
establish the real identity of "Ricardo Z." 
  According to sources in the intelligence services, it seems 
that after Abimael Guzman was arrested, almost a year and a half 
ago, "Ricardo Z" stepped into the shoes of SL's imprisoned 
founder and main ideologist. 
  Many analysts have reported that "Ricardo Z" could be one of 
the four SL leaders still at large, including Julio Cesar 
Mezzich, aka "El Doctorcito" ["the little doctor"], and Teresa 
Durand. 
  They do not rule out the possibility that second-level SL 
leaders may have ousted their superiors, or that "Feliciano" -- 
who took over after Guzman was arrested on 12 September 1992 -- 
is now calling himself "Ricardo Z." 
  The Lima daily EXPRESO quoted the National Counterterrorism 
Directorate (Dincote) as stating that Ramirez could have changed 
his alias to evade security forces, which according to military 
sources are on his tracks in the mountains of Ayacucho 
Department. 
  Dincote claims that "Ramirez has changed his alias to avoid 
an impending arrest." The same source indicated that another SL 
leader could have taken the alias "Feliciano." 
  The news media also speculate that "Ricardo Z" could well be 
a leader of Colombian drug traffickers who are afraid of losing 
coca plantations in the Peruvian jungle, which they control with 
SL's help. 
  "Ricardo Z" could also be a SL military leader who has 
staged 
a "coup d'etat" against the organization's high command. 
  Former Deputy Alberto Valencia, an expert in subversion, 
told 
EXPRESO that he is under the impression that Teresa Durand, 
known as "the strongest military commander," could be calling 
herself "Ricardo Z." 
  Valencia does not believe that Ramirez could be "Ricardo Z," 
although he did say that Ramirez had been entrusted with 
organizing the SL "people's guerrilla army." According to 
Valencia "neither could Mezzich be `Ricardo Z,' as he has lost 
power and is looked upon as an upstart." 
  All the experts agree that security forces are bound to 
defeat the SL, which has been going downhill since Guzman and 90 
percent of the SL high command were arrested in September 1992. 
  A military offensive is currently under way in Leoncio 
Prado, 
a jungle province of Huanuco Department, Peru's central mountain 
region. The objective of this offensive is to eliminate SL 
columns which are operating in the area, because these columns 
appear to be the strongest force SL has left. 
  Various circles have criticized "Operation Aries," and there 
are witnesses who claim that the military have used helicopters 
to bomb civilians who are fleeing from the area.

<F P=106> [Report by Luisa Amelia Rodriguez from the "National </F>
Newscast"] 
  [Text] The Technical Judicial Police [PTJ] have ruled out 
terrorism in this morning's bomb blast, which occurred at 0642 
on the No. 1207 Caracas subway train. At the time of the blast, 
the subway train was moving westward and headed toward the 
Parque del Este station. Five people were injured in the 
explosion. 
  As we announced during our noon newscast, PTJ investigations 
are currently centered on a group of youngsters believed to be 
students at the Don Bosco Industrial Vocational School. 
Witnesses reported that they had seen the students behaving 
oddly in the subway car in which the explosion took place. The 
students left the subway train at the Los Cortijos station just 
a few minutes before the pipe bomb exploded. 
  PTJ Chief of Homicide Leonardo Pia Baruta has the following 
explanation: 
  [Begin recording] Baruta: At this time, the 
Homicide Division is continuing its investigation into the 
explosive device [words indistinct] in which four [as heard] 
people were slightly injured. We have collected some evidence, 
such as leaflets that had been scattered throughout the subway 
car. We also collected some of the residue of the chemicals 
used in the bomb. 
  Unidentified reporter: Could this incident be 
interpreted as a reactivation of terrorist activities in our 
country? 
  Baruta: In no way whatsoever. We cannot speak 
about terrorism or anything of the sort. I would prefer to 
associate it with a student protest. It was probably caused by 
some youngsters who, as result of their immaturity and youth, 
detonated this pipe bomb. [end recording] 
  In this way, the PTJ has ruled out the hypothesis that 
terrorism was behind the Caracas subway explosion.

    [Editorial Report] Cairo ROSE AL-YUSUF in Arabic on 25 
April publishes on pages 14 and 15 a 2,200-word investigative 
report by Wa'il al-Ibrashi under the headline: "Top Secret and 
Published for the First Time." "Arrest of a Kuwaiti in Cairo on 
Charges of Financing Terrorism, and Search for Saudi Arms 
Dealer." Under this banner headline, the writer says that on 1 
April the State Security Investigations Department arrested a 
Kuwaiti called 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Mujaybil in a furnished 
apartment and took him for questioning on charges of "financing 
terrorism and supporting the extremists." During his 
interrogation, al-Mujaybil said that he is a member of an 
officially registered Kuwaiti society called "the Society for 
the Revival of Islamic Heritage." This society is headed by 
Shaykh Khalid Sultan Bin-'Isa and is managed by Shaykh 'Abdallah 
al-'Atiqi. He said he came to Egypt a few days ago to extend 
some aid to a number of benevolent enterprises in Egypt. 
  Egyptian security sources, according to the writer, have 
denied the story that al-Mujaybil came to extend aid to 
benevolent enterprises, saying that he was arrested red-handed. 
He was arrested in Cairo after several days and not when he 
arrived. The investigation sources revealed that a member of an 
extremist group who was under surveillance and owns a printing 
press for printing and publishing religious books and leaflets 
was seen more than once meeting with the Kuwaiti 'Abd-al-Rahman 
al-Mujaybil immediately after the latter's arrival in Cairo. 
When the security forces stormed the house of the printing 
press owner, they discovered a check for a large sum of money 
paid to him by 'Abd-al-Rahman al- Mujaybil, as well as large 
sums of foreign currency. Al-Mujaybil claimed under 
interrogation that he gave the check to the printing press owner 
to pay for printing a book because the cost in Egypt is less 
than any other place, and that his relationship to the man is 
purely professional. However, the security authorities were not 
convinced and the investigation is continuing. 
  Meanwhile, the writer continues, the security authorities in 
Egypt and in more than one Arab country--such as Algeria, Yemen, 
and Jordan--are looking for a Saudi arms dealer called Nasir 
Mashhur al-Ruwayli, classified as the "most dangerous arms and 
drug smuggler across Arab borders." He uses drug smuggling to 
conclude arms deals. He smuggles these arms to Arab countries 
where there is intensive extremist activity, particularly Egypt, 
Algeria, Yemen, and Jordan. The writer says that al-Ruwayli is 
wanted in Saudi Arabia and several other Arab countries.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mustafa al-Liddawi, representative of the </F>
Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, in Lebanon by an 
unidentified correspondent; date and place not given] 
  [Excerpts] AL-SHIRA': There were reports 
recently about the existence of an Islamic-Islamic dialogue in 
which you were involved. What is the dialogue about and has it 
had any results? 
  Al-Liddawi: The Palestinian problem is going 
through its most critical phases at present. Years of suffering 
and sacrifice have been forgotten and ignored. All our 
Palestinian people's rights have also been bypassed and ignored 
and there is no more talk about the Palestinian people's dream 
of returning to the homeland and establishing their independent 
state on all the national soil. 
  Thus, in view of the gravity of the plot and the great 
sacrifices already made, we had to stand firm against the 
squandering of our rights and those squandering them in order to 
protect our people's right to their territories and homeland. 
The Islamic Resistance Movement [Hamas] was eager to consult 
all partners in the battle with a common destiny in order to 
discuss how to frustrate this genocidal plot. The dialogue was 
not limited to a specific party but to all those who are loyal 
to this cause. We were prompted in this by the accelerated 
squandering of our rights and our belief that all must be 
involved in a coordinated and organized move to foil this plot. 
  AL-SHIRA': With which Arab Islamic forces is Hamas 
meeting? How do you justify the methods followed, specifically 
those in Egypt and Algeria? 
  Al-Liddawi: As written in its charter, Hamas 
believes that Palestine is an Islamic awqaf land, that is, it 
belongs to all Muslims everywhere, regardless of their race, and 
to all Muslim generations throughout the ages. Hence the burden 
of liberating it falls on the shoulders of all Muslims. 
  On this premise, Hamas believes that it should have solid 
ties with all the Islamic and Arab parties whose objective is to 
liberate Palestine and restore the Palestinian people's 
legitimate and historic rights. Hamas believes that all the 
Arab and Islamic efforts must unite to liberate Palestine. 
Hamas needs the efforts of everyone who is faithful to the 
Palestinian people and their cause, even if we have differences 
with some of them over ideas and ideologies. 
  As for what is happening in Egypt and Algeria, the Hamas 
policy is not to interfere in the affairs of others; this is 
based on our desire to maintain the uniqueness of the 
Palestinian cause. Hence, we do not interfere. But at the same 
time, we call on all the parties to refer their differences to 
the Koran and the true Islamic path. We also call on all of 
them to begin a dialogue in order to end all the illusions and 
deceptions that the enemies of this Islamic nation are trying to 
plant in our midst to create more divisions and differences. 
  AL-SHIRA': You stand accused of impeding the work 
of the Palestinian forces' alliance by rejecting the election of 
an alternative leadership to 'Arafat and because of your bad 
relations with the Democratic Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine [DFLP] which reached their nadir when you killed one 
of its military officials, "Yusuf Abu-Lafi," in the occupied 
territories? 
  Al-Liddawi: [passage omitted] We are seeking 
comprehensive Palestinian elections for the Palestinian people, 
wherever they are. We do not want flashy and formal elections 
that do not bring the best for our people or which are held 
through popular conferences where the conferees are not allowed 
any freedom of opinion. 
  As for our differences with the DFLP, we were deeply pained 
by what happened and our pain increased when the DFLP opted to 
discuss some of the problems between the two sides in the media 
and in front of those who gloat over these differences. I do 
not want to rehash the problem's details, for we jointly put an 
end to it. But I hope that the brothers in the DFLP will 
embrace the principle of coordination with us and that none of 
us will resort to publicizing our differences in the media. The 
DFLP will find that Hamas is ready to deal with it on the basis 
of coordination and respect for each other, especially as we are 
both going through such difficult times. 
  AL-SHIRA': Your killing of Abu-Lafi could trigger 
a Kabul-style conflict in the occupied territories. The 
elements of strife are there. What do you plan to do to avoid 
this scenario? 
  Al-Liddawi: As I said in my last answer, we seek 
closer coordination everywhere. We want to cooperate seriously 
with other groups in order to serve the Palestinian cause. We 
want to harass the enemy with more painful operations. We want 
to contain any problem, however big, by referring it to the 
joint coordination committee. We should not pay attention to 
press reports and allegations, for these normally throw fuel on 
the fire. [passage omitted] 
  AL-SHIRA': There were attempts to initiate a 
dialogue between you and 'Arafat after the al-Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre. How far have these attempts gone? 
  Al-Liddawi: There will be no dialogue with 'Arafat 
until he withdraws from the settlement process and renounces the 
Oslo agreement. There have been no dialogues with 'Arafat 
following his recent involvement in the quagmire of the Oslo 
agreement. 
  But at the same time, we might meet with Fatah members 
inside 
the occupied homeland to solve local problems and avert any 
further aggravation of the existing bad situation between the 
two movements. Such meetings would also help prevent the 
struggle from dissolving into infighting. We must make every 
possible effort to insure that such infighting never occurs.

  [Text] A responsible Palestinian source within Fatah has 
told AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI that he doubts that all of the 
resistance operations that have been carried out against the 
Israelis in the occupied territories are the making of Hamas, as 
Israel declares. 
  The source said Fatah fighters are still practicing 
resistance to pressure the Israelis and are carrying out 
military operations. The source said that the person who carried 
out the 'Afula operation was from Fatah [see 13 April Terrorism 
Report]. 
  Last week, the chief of the Israeli police said that the 
Palestinian youth who carried out an operation in Jerusalem was 
a Hamas member, but it turned out later that he was a Fatah 
supporter who wanted to avenge the death of a friend killed by 
the Israelis a few days before near Jerusalem.

  [Excerpt] Following sharp differences within the ranks of 
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General 
Command [PFLP-GC], led by Ahmad Jibril, Mustafa Khamis, a 
PFLP-GC leader, today decided to split from the PFLP-GC and form 
what he called the Popular Front-General Islamic Command. 
  Mustafa Khamis, who was a member of the PFLP-GC Central 
Committee and member of the Palestine National Council, said 
today in Amman that he has decided, along with a group of the 
cadres operating in the territories, to split in the wake of 
severe financial and administrative corruption within PFLP-GC 
ranks. 
  The group that split from the PFLP-GC, led by Mustafa 
Khamis, 
accuses Ahmad Jibril and the PFLP-GC leadership of no longer 
being able to run the PFLP-GC, saying their fighting is not in 
the interest of the Palestinian people and its cause. 
  Khamis said Jibril's nationalist attitude and his arrogance 
have driven him to destroy the PFLP-GC, noting that the decision 
to split follows the failure of the PFLP-GC leaders to persuade 
Jibril to change his unilateral conduct during the meetings of 
the PFLP-GC Central Committee, held in Damascus last month.

<F P=106> [Report by Pinhas 'Inbari] </F>
  [Text] The agreement between Fatah and Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement] in Gaza contains a secret clause in which 
Hamas pledges not to attack the Qatif Bloc settlements, our 
correspondent has learned from Fatah sources in the territories. 
According to the sources, this reflects the most recent Hamas 
line -- namely, that the organization will not obstruct 
Palestinian rule in Gaza and Jericho. The sources claim that 
this clause has created tension between the Islamic Jihad and 
Hamas, as well as between two Hamas branches: the pro-peace 
Ahmad Yasin branch and the branch comprising the 10 rejectionist 
organizations that oppose the agreement. 
  [A related report by Dan Avidan on page 2 of Tel Aviv DAVAR 
in Hebrew on 26 April cites "Arab sources" as saying that "PLO 
and Hamas delegations are conducting secret negotiations in 
Cairo in an attempt to conceptualize the ties between the two 
movements on the eve of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho" and that "the PLO-Hamas 
encounter was arranged through the mediation of Hamad 
Abu-al-Nasr and Sayf al-Din al-Banna, leaders of the Muslim 
Brotherhood movement in Egypt."]

<F P=106> ['Ali al-Salih report: "Hamas Denies Secret Negotiation </F>
With Israel"] 
  [Excerpts] London -- A senior official in the Palestinian 
Hamas movement has denied the existence of any secret contacts 
between his movement and Israel. He also denied that the 
initiative launched by Dr. Musa Abu-Marzuq, head of the 
movement's Political Bureau, indicates the existence of such 
contacts or any change in the movement's policy and strategy. 
  Abu-Hamdan, Hamas representative in Tehran, told AL-SHARQ 
AL-AWSAT that this information is untrue and designed to distort 
the movement's position. 
  Abu-Hamdan added that "the attempt to leak this false 
information is aimed at trying to provoke the negotiating 
Palestinian side into offering further concessions, especially 
as Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres stated after his 
recent meeting with Yasir 'Arafat that the agreement could be 
somewhat delayed." 
  As is known, contacts have been made in the past between 
Israel and Hamas officials held in Israeli jails, including 
Shaykh Ahmad Yasin, the movement's spiritual leader. On this 
question the Hamas representative in Tehran said that "past 
contacts had their own circumstances and were made with the 
detained brothers." He added that "Israel asked some detained 
brothers to convey messages to the movement's leadership abroad. 
Their reply was clear, namely that there could be no 
negotiations or contacts between jailer and prisoner. Hamas 
explained its position on these contacts at the time." 
  Asked whether the truce initiative to which Dr. Abu-Marzuq 
stressed his commitment means Hamas' recognition of Israel and a 
willingness to accept the principle of negotiating with the 
Hebrew state, especially as the initiative was announced in the 
wake of operations carried out by the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam 
battalions inside the green strip in 'Afula and Hadera and 
Israel's moves to tighten the noose around the movement in both 
Jordan and other Arab and foreign states, Abu-Hamdan said that 
"the truce that Dr. Abu-Marzuq announced does not mean 
recognition of Israel's right to occupy or remain in any part of 
the Palestinian territories." 
  He went on: "Dr. Abu-Marzuq's proposal is very clear: It 
means accepting a truce in order to hold free elections and, if 
Hamas wins those elections, it means accepting its program, 
which rejects Israel's existence." 
  Abu-Hamdan added that "Hamas did not request the truce. What 
Dr. Abu-Marzuq said was that, if Israel wants to extricate 
itself from its dilemma and if it requests a truce, we will 
agree." 
  Asked whether Hamas should extricate its enemy from his 
dilemma -- if Israel is in fact suffering one -- Abu-Hamdan said 
that "we are not interested in extricating Israel from its 
dilemma. Israel tried to extricate itself from the dilemma 
following its failure to protect its security after our 
operations, which hurt it, by trying to turn the conflict with 
it into an inter-Arab conflict, but it failed." 
  Asked whether the new initiative is not an attempt by Hamas 
to escape pressures which face it in Jordan and those which it 
might face in other Arab and foreign countries, Abu-Hamdan said 
that "there is understanding in Hamas of Jordan's and Syria's 
circumstances, because any harm inflicted on their stability 
weakens the Palestinian cause. Thus we are interested in this 
question, and the statements made by the head of the Political 
Bureau indicate that." [passage omitted] 
  On the possibility of a meeting between 'Arafat and the 
Hamas 
leadership, as reported recently, Abu-Hamdan said that "our 
position on a meeting with 'Arafat has been very clear since the 
signing of the Oslo agreement, namely that we will not meet with 
him unless he backtracks on the agreement and returns to a 
struggle program around which all Palestinian forces can rally 
for the sake of liberating the land and recovering all 
Palestinian rights." 
  On the agreement signed between Hamas and Fatah in the 
occupied territories yesterday, he said that "this agreement is 
a field agreement prompted by conditions. It is aimed at 
solving problems between the two sides and averting Palestinian 
infighting. That is the essence of the movement's strategy, 
which prohibits infighting."

    [Editorial Report] The following is the 45th in a series of 
editorial reports on political Islam in Egypt. These reports 
include summaries of all articles, reports, interviews, 
commentaries, or other items on political Islam that have been 
published in all the issues of Cairo newspapers 'AQIDATI, 
AL-NUR, and AL-USRAH AL-'ARABIYAH since late December 1993 and 
most issues of the twice-weekly newspaper AL-SHA'B. Unless 
otherwise indicated, no further processing of the items 
summarized below has been done or is planned. 
  This editorial report reviews the 22 April issue of 
AL-SHA'B. 
<H5>  Asyut Group Escalates Operations, Suhaj Group Seeks Dialogue </H5>
  A 350-word report by Qutb al-'Arabi and 'Adil al-Bahnasawi 
on 
pages 1 and 7 says that the Islamic Group has claimed 
responsibility for the assassination of Brigadier General Shirin 
'Ali Fahmi, commander of Asyut security forces, and his 
bodyguard. "In a statement faxed to AL-SHA'B" the group said 
this was "the sixth in a series of operations to confront human 
right violations in prisons." 
  The report cites a statement issued by the Islamic Group in 
Suhaj "denouncing violence and the killing of innocent people," 
originally published in the London-based AL-HAYAH. Issued at a 
seminar in Suhaj, Upper Egypt, the statement affirms that the 
Islamic Group "does not object to engaging in any dialogue to 
solve problems" and that "it calls for laying down arms, 
renouncing violence, and resorting to law, reason, and logic to 
contain the crisis." 
  The report also notes that "the security service in Asyut 
has 
discovered a detective in the Dayrut police station who 
cooperates with the Islamic Group." The detained detective 
revealed that "other officers are working for the Islamic 
Group," the report says. 
<H5>  Government Policies Seen as Cause for Violence </H5>
  In a 2,000-word article on page 3, Dr. Rafiq Habib argues 
that "terrorism has become an excuse for sustaining the ruling 
regime and justifying Mubarak's continued to rule." He says 
that the regime has divided Egyptian society into "terrorists 
and non-terrorists," the latter being the government which, 
protected by the law and the media, tightens its grip on all and 
remains unaccountable. 
  Habib adds that it is wrong to believe the government media 
campaign, which alleges that we are up against a terrorist 
phenomenon financed by foreign states. He contends that this 
campaign seeks to present the situation as a battle between the 
Islamic groups and society, thereby authorizing the government 
to play the role of the policeman who protects society. But the 
truth is that these groups are against the government, not the 
people; they are working to overthrow the regime. 
  The writer says "the armed Islamic protest" provides strong 
evidence that "the regime is no longer capable of realizing 
society's aspirations" and that the present policies divide 
society and make violence the only effective approach. 
  Habib says that the problem lies in the fact that "we are 
subject to imported values and are being ruled by a regime that 
draws its legitimacy from Western systems at a time when our 
original values are buried inside us." He adds that the 
policies of the present [word illegible] are merely fulfilling 
the aims of the West, from which the regime benefits in the form 
of financial and political support. 
  Finally, he calls for rectifying the basic causes of unrest 
and for reevaluating the government policy in order to avoid 
further bloodshed. He advises the regime to ally with the 
people instead of the West.

  [Excerpt] Cairo, April 27 (AFP) -- The Moslem militant 
group al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah on Wednesday vowed to kill 
President Husni Mubarak to avenge the death of its military 
leader. 
  Police said they gunned down 32-year-old Tal'at Yasin 
Hammam, 
head of the group's armed wing, and six other militants in a 
dawn raid Monday on his apartment in northeast Cairo. 
  In a statement sent to AFP, al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah (the 
Islamic Group) warned Mubarak, saying: "your head, as well as 
those of hundreds of torturers in the Interior (Ministry), will 
not be enough for our revenge." 
  It mocked the government's effectiveness in fighting 
militants, saying Hammam used to plan his operations from a 
building located "a few meters (yards) from the general 
intelligence offices" in central Cairo. 
  Hammam "dealt one blow after the other" to the regime, the 
statement said. 
  The Egyptian authorities said Hammam was, among other 
things, 
in charge of sending statements to foreign press agencies.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Amr Nasif from Cairo] </F>
  [Excerpt] In the past few days, Turah prison wardens have 
separated Mahmud Nur-al-Din, leader of the Nasirite group 
Egypt's Revolution, from 'Abbud-al-Zumur, leader of the al-Jihad 
Organization. 
  Both men are serving life sentences: Nur-al-Din for his 
leadership of Egypt's Revolution, a group that between 1986 and 
1988 killed Israeli elements and people working for the Mosad in 
Cairo; and Al-Zumur for his involvement in the assassination of 
President Anwar al-Sadat. 
  Security sources attribute this move to the close ties that 
had recently grown between Nur-al-Din and al-Zumur, culminating 
in their agreement to alternate in leading the inmates in 
prayers. 
  Nur-al-Din has won the confidence of al-Jihad inmates in 
Turah jail. The prisoners treat him as a spiritual father. 
Those on death row have a long meeting with him before their 
execution and sometimes scribble a note of gratitude on a scrap 
of their clothes for him to keep as a souvenir. Nur-al-Din, for 
his part, normally leads the prayer for the absent--a memorial 
service for the executed al-Jihad members. 
  Nur-al-Din has issued a call to the Islamic Group and the 
al-Jihad Organization through AL-SAFIR, asking them to attack 
Israeli targets and interests in Egypt instead of the Egyptian 
police, tourism, and banks. [passage omitted recapping recent 
terrorist incidents]

  [Text] Cairo, 25 Apr (MENA)-- Terrorist Tal'at Yasin 
Hammam, leader of the military wing of the so-called Islamic 
Group [IG], was killed in his hideout in Hada'iq al-Qubbah, 
Cairo, at dawn today during a shootout with the State Security 
detectives, who had to shoot back at him. 
  His death is considered as one of the successful strikes at 
local terrorist leaders and their failing attempts to shake 
Egyptian security and stability.

  [Text] Cairo, 25 Apr (MENA)-- An official source in the 
Ministry of Interior has stated that terrorist Tal'at Muhammad 
Yasin Hammam, who was killed today, is considered the primary 
leader who controlled the "Afghanistan Returnees" organization 
and its military wing. He was sentenced to death in case No. 
24/1993 on military felony. 
  In a statement this evening, the source revealed that Hammam 
was the primary source of instructions to implement terrorist 
operations in the country and the supreme commander at the 
domestic level. He was also the major link between the inside 
and outside, since he was the primary source of financing for 
terrorist schemes. 
  The source pointed out that Hammam received funds directly 
from financing elements abroad and redistributed them among the 
groups in charge of carrying out the operations in accordance 
with a plan prepared in advance. 
  In his statement, the security source revealed that a search 
of the terrorist's home yielded large amounts of local and 
foreign currencies, long distance telephone cards, and official 
documents ready for use in the various terrorist operations. 
  The search also yielded some important documents on how to 
make explosive and incendiary charges, including those used in 
the assassination of Major General Ra'uf Khayrat, deputy chief 
of the State Security Investigation in charge of religious 
activity, in addition to charts of his residence in the Pyramids 
area, the route he took, and the location selected for carrying 
out the assassination. 
  A detailed list of the names and addresses of some banks and 
companies targeted in previous operations and in the future was 
also found in the terrorist's home. 
  The security source said in his statement that papers 
containing detailed information about political, executive, 
security, judicial, and media figures and detailed drawings of 
their places of residence and the routes they traveled were also 
discovered. 
  The State Security forces that stormed the place found a 
German-made pistol with a loaded magazine, a facsimile machine 
with a collection of messages faxed previously, and a detailed 
list of the names and addresses of foreign news agencies and 
newspapers, of their correspondents, and of some local 
newspapers. 
  The security source pointed out that the killed terrorist's 
movements confirmed that he was in charge of issuing statements 
on behalf of terrorist organizations and sending them to several 
news agencies abroad. 
  He added that the State Security forces also found a 
collection of very important organizational papers, in addition 
to ciphering terms and detailed information on some of the 
companies that produce and export movie features and soap 
operas. [passage omitted] 
  The source noted that the State Security Investigation 
forces, assisted by the central security forces, have launched 
synchronized search operations in 12 governorates, during which 
58 active terrorist elements that took part in recent operations 
were caught. They are being interrogated, he said. 
  The source added that the State Security service is 
monitoring all the elements on which information indicating 
involvement in terrorist operations have been obtained.

  [Text] Asyut, Upper Egypt, 25 Apr (MENA)-- Four terrorists 
were killed today in a clash with the security forces in the 
al-Walidiyah cemetery in Asyut Governorate. The four were 
involved in the assassination of Asyut Security Chief Brigadier 
General Shirin 'Ali Fahmi and his guard last Wednesday. 
  The security forces were watching the terrorists' hideout, 
to 
which they were directed by terrorist Hasan Khalifah, who was 
arrested after the assassination. When the security forces 
stormed the hideout, they were fired upon. They had to return 
fire, killing the four terrorists. Four weapons--including an 
automatic rifle, a policeman's pistol, and a large amount of 
ammunition--were found with the dead terrorists. 
  The terrorists are Ahmad Anwar Fahmi, 22 years, a student at 
the faculty of commerce who comes from Mallawi, al-Minya; Amin 
Shafiq Ahmad, 23 years, a student at the pharmaceutical college

  [Text] The Central Bureau of Investigation [CBI] has found 
evidence that arms training was imparted in a neighboring 
country to some of the accused in last year's Bombay blasts. A 
CBI spokesman said that two people have been arrested in this 
connection. The Bureau is said to have gathered more material 
against the prime accused in this case. It is alleged that the 
two arrested were sent abroad for training in handling 
explosives by another accused who is absconding. The CBI is 
reported to have made the breakthrough while checking the 
records of the regional passport office.

<F P=106> [James Adams article: "Revealed: How Iran's Terror Network </F>
Embraced the IRA"; all Arabic names as published] 
  [Text] The IRA leaders flew secretly to Tehran, taking 
steps to ensure they were not being tailed on the journey from 
their homes in Ireland. The meeting they were attending last 
November was one of the group's most important for a long time: 
a gathering of the world's terror organisations at the behest 
of their Iranian paymasters. 
  As the IRA bosses walked into the Feirouzi palace, they 
joined leading figures from some of the most secretive and 
feared groups in the world: the Japanese Red Army, the Basque 
terrorist group ETA, Hizballah, the Abu Nidal organisation and 
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine -- General 
Command. 
  The terrorists were met by Muhsin Reza'i, commander of the 
Iranian Revolutionary Guard. There was only one item on the 
agenda: a plan by Iran to fund and arm a new "terrorist 
international" in exchange for the launching of attacks against 
western targets. 
  The aim was to cause unprecedented devastation in western 
European capitals with coordinated bombings and assassinations. 
According to senior intelligence officials, Iran hoped to fuel 
revolution in Europe and make it pay a heavy price for 
supporting American policies in the Middle East. 
  The meeting, the biggest terrorist gathering since the early 
1970s, was closely monitored by western intelligence. 
Immediately afterwards agencies across Europe and the United 
States began a counter-terrorist drive to track the Iranian 
diplomats known terrorists and their contacts in Europe. The 
biggest undercover operation since the Gulf war, it involved 
satellite surveillance, intercepting telephone calls and 
widespread bugging. 
  British security services were especially concerned that the 
Iranians pledged to supply the IRA with sophisticated weapons as 
well as millions of pounds. The republicans had been searching 
for a supply of modern detonators and ground-to-air missiles to 
complement their stockpile of small arms, ammunition and 
explosives. 
  The IRA presence in Tehran came as no surprise to British 
intelligence, which had watched links developing between Tehran 
and Irish republicans for more than a decade. 
  The contacts began in 1981 when an Iranian diplomat went to 
Belfast to attend the funeral of Bobby Sands, the first 
hungerstriker. He was soon followed by Hojatoleslam Hadi 
Ghaffari, an Iranian cleric nicknamed the "machine-gun mullah" 
after killing up to 60 pro-Shah officials. 
  Although Ghaffari antagonised Sinn Fein by refusing to pay 
for drinks at a lunch he hosted, the republicans found the 
cleric sympathetic. In 1980, he told a rally in Tehran that "we 
are ready to blow up British factories and ships. Now is the 
time for the death of Thatcher." 
  Over the next six years the two sides developed their 
friendship. A Sinn Fein delegation attended the Conference of 
World Movements in Tehran in June 1982, while Iran sent a 
delegation to Sinn Fein's annual Dublin conference for three 
years running. The relationship however, was largely political 
as the IRA was receiving arms and weapons from Libya. 
  Then in December 1987, Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, the 
IRA's political wing flew to Tehran as the guest of the Iranian 
government. Exactly what was discussed is not known, but soon 
afterwards the first clandestine contacts between the terrorists 
and Tehran began. 
  Over the next six years, both M16 and M15 tracked IRA 
terrorists to secret meetings in Paris, Bonn and The Hague. 
Each took place with accredited Iranian diplomats, most of whom 
were attached to the Ministry of Information (MOI) in Tehran, a 
cover for Iranian intelligence. 
  Apart from Ghaffari, three key Iranians have been identified 
by British intelligence. They are Ali Reza Hakkikian chief MOI 
representative in Bonn until 1993; Vahid Attarian, his 
replacement in Bonn believed to coordinate operations of Iranian 
spies across Europe; and Amir Eravani, responsible for liaison 
between the MOI and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
  To begin with, British intelligence was content to monitor 
the relationship. It wanted to track the IRA offficers 
responsible for negotiating arms and cash abroad and to unravel 
the intelligence network run by the Iranians. 
  The tone of the operation changed when Jurgen Merx and 
Tunza-Anet, his wife, were arrested in Athens last year for 
smuggling huge quantities of heroin to Britain. The drugs were 
thought to have been supplied by Iranian intelligence, perhaps 
to generate funds for the IRA. At the same time, there was 
intelligence that cash from Iran might already have reached 
Belfast and that a big arms shipment was being planned. 
  Then came the terrorist summit last November. It was no 
longer simply a British effort to control the IRA, but an 
international attempt to foil a threat to the security of 
several western European countries. 
  The French government launched raids against Muslim 
extremists and members of the Kurdish Workers' party. Germany, 
Spain, Sweden and Italy have also moved against groups suspected 
of having contacts with the Iranians. 
  For Britain, the problem was more difficult. Although many 
IRA terrorists are well known to the security forces and those 
directly involved with the Iranians had been tracked, there was 
not enough evidence to bring anyone to trial. Instead, it was 
decided to confront the Iranians directly in the hope that 
publicity would force the IRA to break off contacts. 
  So, on Thursday, Douglas Hogg, the Foreign Office minister, 
summoned Gholamreza Ansari, the Iranian charge d'affaires, for a 
confrontation about his government's contacts with the IRA. The 
Iranian denied the links, claiming there was "no shred of 
evidence to support these astonishing claims." 
  Security sources said this weekend it was too early to 
determine if the move has worked. The Iranian government has a 
long history of defiance and few doubt that the IRA will try to 
continue to tap the deep pockets and wellstocked armouries of 
Tehran.

<F P=106> [Safa Haeri report: "Iran Tried To Hire IRA Hit-Men"] </F>
  [Text] The IRA has turned down a request by Tehran to 
assassinate three leading Iranian dissidents in exchange for 
explosives, guns, missiles and cash, according to informed 
sources in Iran. 
  The deal was allegedly put to IRA representatives by 
officials from the Iranian Information (intelligence) Ministry 
at a meeting in Tehran last November but was turned down in 
February this year. 
  This latest revelation comes after the Iranian charge 
d'affaires in London, Gholamreza Ansari, was summoned to the 
Foreign Office last Thursday to be told that known contacts with 
the IRA should cease. British intelligence had information that 
Iran was plotting to supply the IRA with guns and money. 
  The Iranian sources, who have contact with the Information 
Ministry, said that at last November's meeting the Iranians 
offered to meet an IRA "shopping list" in exchange for the 
murder of three named people. The list included: 
  Micro-communications and eavesdropping equipment; 
  Semtex explosive; 
  Eight Stinger surface-to-air missiles; 
  400 Colt pistols and 80,000 rounds of ammunition; 
  100 Uzi submachine guns and 50,000 rounds of ammunition; 
  $6m (4m pounds) in counterfeit dollar bills and $500,000 in 
real bills. 
  The IRA was to assassinate three people: the former Iranian 
president, Abolhasan Bani-Sadr, exiled in France since 1981; 
Javad Dabiran, a spokesman for the opposition People's Mujahedin 
Organisation, based in Bonn; and Farzaneh Ta'idi, a prominent 
Iranian actress exiled in London. Ms Ta'idi angered the regime 
for her part in the 1991 film "Not Without My Daughter," which 
depicts the plight of the American-born wife of an Iranian 
stranded in post-revolution Iran. 
  The offer was made on the margins of a meeting in the 
Iranian 
capital which also involved the Greek left-wing group November 
17, Corsican nationalists and ETA, the Basque separatists, the 
sources said. 
  They said the IRA took three months to consider the scheme, 
though informed Western sources said the IRA was known to have 
rejected previous proposals to carry out assassinations, 
including requests from Libya. 
  The Iranian sources also gave new details of contacts 
between 
Iran and the IRA going back to shortly after the 1979 
revolution, when IRA representatives attended a "world meeting 
of liberation organisations" in Tehran. 
  At that time, Tehran wanted the IRA to provide weapons and 
logistics for Iranian teams sent to Europe to kill prominent 
opponents of the new regime, including General Fereyduon Jam, a 
brother-in-law of the late Shah, Ardeshir Zahedi, a former 
ambassador to Washington, and Shapour Bakhtiar, the Shah's last 
prime minister, who was murdered in Paris in 1992. The 
assassinations did not go ahead, although the sources did not 
know if this was because the IRA had refused to cooperate. 
  The initial reaction from Tehran to last week's British 
warning was muted. But over the weekend the tone of press 
comment hardened, after a briefing by Hojatoleslam Hosayn 
Ruhani, chairman of the parliamentary defence committee. 
  "How can anyone criticise Iran for having contacts with the 
IRA when the U.S. does exactly the same when it receives Mr 
Gerry Adams?" said the radical daily SALAM. 
  The semi-official daily ETELAAT in effect confirmed the 
Iran-IRA contacts when it said: "Why, when British MPs and 
government officials rationalise their direct contacts with 
Iranian terrorists (a reference to the People's Mujahedin 
leadership) ... should the same not apply to Iran? Why should 
we be ashamed of our contacts?" 
  The official news agency, IRNA, quoted an unidentified Sinn 
Fein spokesman denouncing the British allegations of cooperation 
between the IRA and Iran as "baseless and troublemaking." "The 
noises the British make are because of their failure to reach 
peaceful agreement over Ireland," the spokesman was quoted as 
saying. He claimed Britain was trying to cover up the arming of 
loyalist terrorists by MI5. 
  It is known in Northern Ireland that the IRA has long wanted 
Stinger missiles to shoot down Army helicopters, and the cash on 
offer from Iran would have been tempting in the face of British 
measures against IRA fund-raising. 
  On the other hand, high-profile assassinations attract 
intelligence attention and the IRA would not relish a "guns for 
hire" image. In particular, killings on behalf of Iran would 
damage the republican movement's American support.

<F P=106> [Report by Alex Fishman] </F>
  [Text] This week the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will 
establish its first ever special Military Police unit that will 
specialize in handling civilian disturbances. The new unit 
belongs to the Central Command, and in addition to basic 
Military Police training, its new recruits will be trained at 
the Israel Police installations in matters such as dispersing 
rallies and arresting rioters. 
  Although the new unit's establishment orders do not 
specifically indicate the civilian population that is to be the 
target of the Military Police unit's operations, knowledgeable 
defense establishment sources noted that recent developments, 
the equipment designated for the unit, and its operational 
methods all indicate that the unit will mainly operate against 
the violent Jewish sector in the West Bank. 
  These troops' operational methods and equipment will be 
similar to those used by the Israel Police rally dispersing 
units. 
  The decision on the establishment of the unit was made by 
the 
late Major General Nehemya Tamari, the former Central Command 
commander. The unit will be officially announced on 8 May.

  [Text] Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] says it will 
not halt its Jihad against Israel in exchange for the release of 
its leader, Shaykh Ahmad Yasin. Hamas is awaiting Israel's 
decision to release Palestinian prisoners, including Hamas 
prisoners. Hamas functionaries talk about accepting the 
Israel-PLO agreement, while its military arm insists on 
continuing the struggle against the occupation. Our 
correspondent Moti Amir reports: 
  On the eve of the signature of the agreement with the PLO, 
and after the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] has already withdrawn 
approximately 90 percent of its forces from the Gaza Strip and 
redeployed in the Qatif Bloc, the question remains, what will 
Hamas do? Over the last few months Israel has tried -- via IDF 
officers -- to open a sort of dialogue with Hamas. Major 
General Matan Vilna'i, commander of the Southern Command, and 
Brigadier General Doron Almog, commander of the IDF forces in 
the Gaza Strip, have held several meetings with some Hamas 
leaders in the area. The two tried to come to an understanding 
of Hamas, attempted to soften it, occasionally resorting to 
threats -- but without much success. 
  Yesterday Hamas disgustedly rejected Foreign Minister Peres' 
proposal to release Hamas leader Ahmad Yasin in exchange for a 
call on his people to halt the acts of terrorism against Israel. 
Sources in the Gaza Strip say that apparently Israel does not 
realize that Yasin can no longer issue such an order to 
'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, Hamas' military arm. They claim that 
there is a growing rift within Hamas between some of the 
spiritual leaders and functionaries, and the fighters in the 
field, after agreement between the PLO and Hamas was signed. 
This agreement, which calls for cooperation in many areas, was 
signed by Rashid Abu-Shabak, leader of the Fatah Hawks, and 
Mahmud al-Zahhar, who is considered to be the leader of 'Izz-al- 
Din al-Qassam. Sources in Gaza say that since this agreement 
was signed, differences of opinion have surfaced between the 
fighters in the field and the organization's spiritual 
leadership, with the former complaining that Fatah is removing 
them from work places, such as the busy works which Israel is 
financing in the territories. 
  Despite all the denials coming from the direction of Fatah, 
and the calming statements issued by Musa Abu-Marzuq, a Hamas 
functionary residing in Jordan, it transpires that the limited 
agreement between the PLO and Hamas will not prevent attacks in 
Israel and in the territories, excluding the areas of Gaza and 
Jericho which will be under the PLO's control.

  [Excerpt] The wave of detentions against opponents of the 
peace process in the Gaza Strip continues. Twenty-five Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement] and Islamic Jihad activists in the 
Strip were arrested over the past 24 hours by the security 
forces, Arab sources reported yesterday. 
  According to the sources, the activists were detained in 
their homes and the security forces also visited the homes of 15 
activists and fugitives who were not at home, and demanded their 
relatives give them up. Among those detained were Shaykh Nafar 
A'zam, 40, of Rafah, an Islamic Jihad leader who was put under 
administrative detention for six months. A'zam was released 
several weeks ago after a long period of imprisonment. 
  A senior activist of the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine, Walid al-Rul, 40, of al-Shati', was put under 
administrative detention for six months for the ninth time. 
Arab sources said he has been under detention for 53 months 
running. 
  Khalil Bal'awi, 24, a Hamas wanted man, was captured by 
security forces in Gaza yesterday. Bal'awi is suspected of 
terrorist activity against the security forces, including firing 
at IDF [Israel Defense Forces] patrols. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Hamas terrorists are threatening to carry out a 
wave of attacks and kidnappings if all Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement] prisoners are not released from jail. The threat came 
in a leaflet claiming responsibility for last week's murder of 
Israeli soldier Shahar Simhoni. The leaflet carries a photocopy 
of Simhoni's ID card. Meanwhile, arrests are continuing in the 
Janin area, of Hamas members connected to the Hadera bombing. 
More on these developments from reporter Alan Ben-'Ami: 
  The Hamas leaflet distributed in the Gaza Strip says that 
members of 'Izz-al-Dan al-Qassam's Squad No. 6 kidnapped and 
killed soldier Shahar Simhoni last week. According to the 
leaflet, which reproduced the soldier's ID card and driver's 
license, the terrorists passed themselves off as Jews, grabbed 
Simhoni, who was on his way to his girlfriend from his Army 
base, and after a short struggle, killed him. [passage omitted] 
  The leaflet is addressed to Prime Minister Rabin and demands 
that he immediately release all Hamas prisoners, especially the 
Hamas leader Shaykh Ahmad Yasin and Hamas members captured in 
recent weeks. If not, the leaflet warns, the killing or 
kidnapping of Israelis will continue. The threats are coming 
against the backdrop of a major crack down on Hamas by security 
forces. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Haifa District Court has lifted the ban on 
reporting the detention of two Israeli Arabs, residents of West 
Barta'ah, suspected of aiding the terrorist who perpetrated the 
attack at Hadera's central bus station. 
  The two -- 'Atif Kabaha, 46, and Majid Kabaha, 48 -- are 
suspected of driving the terrorist from East Barta'ah in the 
territories to Hadera's central bus station under orders from 
Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] in return for money. The 
court extended their remand for another 15 days. They are not 
cooperating with the police. Our correspondent Nati Silberman 
notes that the police take a grave view of cooperation between 
Israeli Arabs and terrorists.

  [Text] Israeli security forces have uncovered a Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement] cell believed to be responsible 
for the bus attack in Hadera, in which a suicide bomber killed 
five Israelis. The Army said 27 suspects were arrested in the 
operation in the Samaria villages of Ya'bad and Barta'ah. It 
said the group leader, Sa'id Muhammad Bardanah, aged 24, is 
suspected of making the two bombs that exploded in the bus in 
Hadera on 13 April. 
  Ahuva Kohen-Unaylah, wounded in the 'Afula bomb attack on 6 
April, has died at the Haifa hospital. She was married to an 
Arab citizen from the village of Yafa in Galilee and converted 
to Islam a month ago. Her death brings to eight the number of 
casualties in the Hamas attack in 'Afula.

  [Text] AKHIR KHABAR has learned that the French interior 
minister has placed Jordan on the list of states sponsoring 
terrorism in the world, imposed restrictions on the movement of 
Jordanian nationals in France, and forced them to obtain exit 
permits before leaving France. In a statement to AKHIR KHABAR, 
Deputy Muhammad Abu-'Alim, who recently returned from an 
official visit to the French capital, said that he, as well as 
the Arab delegations participating in the Arab-European 
parliamentary dialogue, were surprised at the official French 
stand vis-a-vis Jordan. He added that they discussed the matter 
with the French officials, particularly since we in Jordan are 
not aware of this matter. 
  Abu-'Alim said: The Jordanian Embassy in Paris is aware of 
this. I personally met with Mr. Bouchar [name as published] who 
is currently the head of the Middle East Political Desk at the 
French Foreign Ministry. He added that the French official 
admitted that Jordan was mistakenly placed on the terrorism 
list. The French official said: The French Government will 
discuss the matter. 
  AKHIR KHABAR has also learned that the [Jordanian] 
Government 
is currently holding contacts with the French officials in this 
regard and that it expects the situation to be addressed before 
declaring the official French stand which is known to French 
political figures. 
  The French foreign minister visited Israel three weeks ago 
and refused the meet the Jordanian deputies who visited Paris.

  [Text] 
<H5>  We Are Still Holding Contacts With Christian Parties, </H5>
Including the Lebanese Forces. [Signed] U.S. Ambassador Mark 
Hambley 
  U.S. Ambassador Mark Hambley is regarded as the most active 
U.S. ambassador who has served in Lebanon, in terms of official 
and political meetings. 
  Ambassador Mark Hambley, who had previously served in Beirut 
as a second-category staff member of the embassy, came to 
Lebanon having served in two areas of particular importance. 
Before assuming the post of consul in Alexandria, Hambley was 
the U.S. charge d'affaires in Tunis. 
  Both Alexandria and Tunis are vital areas for the Americans. 
Tunis is quite important and vital for the U.S. and Israeli 
intelligence due to the strong ties between the Tunisian regime 
and these intelligence services. This fact enabled both 
services to monitor the Palestinian activities continuously. 
Alexandria, an Egyptian town, is regarded as an extremely 
important area by the Americans and Israelis, because it is 
located near Libya and Palestine and overlooks the 
Mediterranean. Alexandria can play a great mediation role in 
the projected settlement process. 
  According to available information, the designation of 
Hambley as U.S. ambassador in Beirut to succeed Ryan Crocker was 
based on his service in Alexandria and Tunis. He came to Beirut 
with a file containing ample information about the Lebanese 
situation. After his arrival, Hambley formed a working team at 
the embassy to conduct studies and political analyses to be 
dispatched to Washington. 
  Knowledgeable sources view the U.S. move as indicating 
exploration of the stances of all forces and parties and of 
having first-hand information on the Lebanese situation. 
  Furthermore, Hambley's action represents a strong move into 
the Lebanese domestic policy, particularly the Christians, to 
reassure them that the United States supports them. This 
explains Hambley's keenness on continuing contacts with the 
various Christian parties, particularly the Lebanese Forces, 
despite the latter's dissolution. This is interference in the 
Lebanese situation, because the existing contacts between 
Hambley and the Lebanese Forces one way or another represent a 
rejection of the Lebanese authorities' decision to dissolve the 
Lebanese Forces, and represent a U.S. attempt to buoy them up in 
service of the hostile designs. 
  Other information indicates that ambassador Hambley is 
holding continuous meetings with Christian opposition figures 
and he is sending several signals to [Lebanese Forces leader] 
Ja'ja'.

    [Editorial Report] Paris AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI in Arabic on 29 
April publishes an approximately 2,500-word report filed from 
Sanaa by Sa'id al-Qaysi asserting that Yemen has become a haven 
for "Afghan Arabs," and that they are under the protection of 
Hashid, the largest and most powerful Yemeni tribe. 
  Al-Qaysi's report quotes an unidentified Arab observer's 
statement that a hilly area near the Port of al-Hudaydah in 
Yemen leads to a large encampment of Afghan Yemenis and Arabs. 
The observer says this camp "is used as a communication or 
transitional station to host Afghan Arabs who come through 
al-Hudaydah Port, or for travelers assigned with missions 
abroad." 
  Al-Qaysi asks: "What evidence is there of official 
sponsorship of terrorism?" The same observer answers: "On one 
visit to Sanaa's main street you will discover for yourself that 
there are scores of offices for Afghan Arab officials. These 
offices operate under the cover of commercial, media, or public 
relations companies, as well as other professions." 
  The observer adds: "The confessions of terrorists arrested 
in Egypt indicate that some of them received money and 
instructions from Sanaa, and others received forged documents 
from Yemen. Egyptian authorities made official contacts with 
Sanaa about Afghan Arabs, and this was announced at that time." 
  Al-Qaysi also assesses the role of Shaykh 'Abdallah Husayn 
al- Ahmar, leader of the Hashid tribe -- and speaker of the 
House of Representatives and head of the Yemeni Reform Grouping 
[YRG], which he describes as a political facade for the Muslim 
Brotherhood. He argues: "YRG members are the political cover for 
extremists. Since the YRG and the Hashid are the same thing, 
then the Hashid tribe is the sponsor of the Afghan Arabs." 
  The Arab observer says there are no Afghan Arabs in Yemen's 
southern sector. He says that, in the past, two camps there 
belonged to the Jihad Organization. The first camp, located in 
the al-Maraqishah mountains area, was supervised by Yafi' 
tribes, and the second was in Hadhramaut. The two camps were 
closed in November 1993. 
  The observer says: "Aden Governor Salih al-Siyali visited 
Cairo and told Egyptian authorities that the two camps were 
closed, and that the men in these camps moved to a guest house 
in eastern Yemen, which belongs to the Murad clan, one of the 
Hashid clans, and to another guest house in the central area, 
under the supervision of Shaykh 'Abd-al-'Aziz Yasin, one of 
Hashid chieftains." 
  The writer quotes an unidentified analyst, who says: "Some 
ruling wings want to employ Afghan Arabs in the conflict in 
Yemen in a bid to entrench the hegemony of the northerners, and 
subsequently the Hashid, over the resources of the south." 
  According to this analyst, "Afghan fingers are clearly 
visible in the limited military operations that took place in 
the areas where the northern forces, especially the al-'Amaliqah 
Brigade, are deployed. These fingers were also clear in the 
harassment of the southern brigades that are deployed in the 
north." 
  The report concludes with a review of the history of Afghan 
Arabs in Yemen, beginning in 1981 with the arrival of an 
Egyptian teacher identified as Muhammad Ibrahim Sharaf.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Yevtushenko report: "Death on Wheels"] </F>
  [Text] On Sunday evening a bus on the highway near Nazran 
went up in flames like a torch. The bus was packed with 
passengers, suitcases, and, worst of all, cans of gasoline and 
in seconds was turned into a crematorium furnace. Out of the 58 
passengers, 31 died in the fire. The rest suffered various 
burns of various degrees of severity. Eleven are hovering 
between life and death. 
  According to information from the temporary administration 
of 
the state of emergency zone, this incident is an unfortunate 
accident and is not connected in any way with the 
Ossetian-Ingush conflict. However, it is assumed here that the 
affair is linked to Ossetian terrorists who were taking revenge 
for the murder of Marat Khugayev and Boris Kabisov, inhabitants 
of Sunzha, a village in Ossetia's Prigorodnyy Rayon, the day 
before. 
  Incidentally, their death has already had tragic 
consequences. Last Thursday a detachment of troops assigned to 
the temporary administration were traveling in two armored 
personnel carriers while combing the forest where Khugayev and 
Kabisov were killed. The soldiers stumbled across a group of 
armed strangers. When told to stop, the latter replied with 
automatic fire and grenades. A battle ensued. The gunmen 
escaped into the heart of Ingushetia. Aleksandr Grishko, a 
compulsory-service servicemen of the Russian Federation Internal 
Troops, was killed; two staffers of the Ingushetia MVD [Ministry 
of Internal Affairs] -- Sergeant Yevkoyev and Junior Lieutenant 
Dobriyev -- were seriously wounded. 
  On Saturday administration troops, carrying out the 
leadership's order to clear the security zone of the opposing 
sides' armed subunits, demanded the removal of an Ingush 
permanent observation post located on Ossetian territory. The 
reply was sporadic fire. An operational investigations group of 
the Russian MVD has investigated all these incidents.

  [Text] Mariupol -- Mariupol security service staffers have 
caught and exposed a group of foreign citizens who were 
intending to carry out an act of international terrorism in 
Moscow. The "guests" had manufactured an explosive device with 
a large fragmentation radius. 
  In an exclusive interview with a correspondent for the 
newspaper PRIAZOVSKIY RABOCHIY Colonel Dmitriy Chernousenko, 
deputy chief of the Ukrainian security service's administration 
for Donetsk Oblast, said: 
  "The plans of the arrestees included committing an act of 
terrorism in respect of one of the embassies located in Moscow. 
I cannot yet give specific data, but the assumption of a `Near 
Eastern connection' is not devoid of grounds. We have informed 
the special services of interested foreign states about this 
arrest."

  [Text] Paris, May 2 (AFP) -- Three members of the far-left 
terrorist group Action Directe brawled with gendarmes in court 
here on Monday [2 May] after a judge ordered them taken down to 
the cells. 
  Joelle Aubron, Nathalie Menigon and Jean-March Rouillan 
fought with gendarmes after Judge Yves Jacob ordered Aubron, 35, 
to stop reading out a statement in which she denounced his 
"arrogance" and "simpering manner" and called the trial a 
"caricature of justice." 
  Aubron resisted attempts to expel her and was badly beaten 
by 
gendarmes. Three guards jumped on Action Directe leader 
Rouillan, 41, who fell to the ground where he was copiously 
beaten. 
  Menigon, 36, was abruptly removed as sympathisers in court 
shouted "murderers," prompting Jacob to order them expelled. 
The trial was adjourned until Tuesday [3 May]. 
  The three are accused of the 1985 murder of General Rene 
Audran, who was in charge of arms sales at the Defence Ministry 
and two other attempted murders of defence-related personalities. 
  A fourth accused, Georges Cipriani, 44, faces the same 
charges, but refused to appear at Monday's hearing. The four 
are also accused of bomb attacks on the Western European Union 
(WEU) and Interpol headquarters in Paris in 1984 and 1986. 
  A fifth person, Aseime Rouabah, 47, is accused of supplying 
part of the explosives used in the Interpol attack. 
  Action Directe grew out of the student revolt of May 1968 
and 
used the same violent methods as the Red Army Faction (RAF) in 
Germany and the Red Brigades in Italy. 
  Judge Jacob gave Aubron 15 minutes to read a three-page 
joint 
statement after all three said they did not intend to take part 
in the trial. But the judge interrupted Aubron after seven 
minutes and ordered the three expelled. 
  Defence lawyer Bernard Ripert denounced the "brutality and 
savagery" of their treatment "although they only wanted to speak 
for a quarter-of-an-hour." 
  Monday's trial began last November, but was adjourned after 
the accused rejected their defence lawyers. 
  The four were already sentenced to life imprisonment in 
January 1989 for the 1986 murder of Renault president Georges 
Besse. Rouillan and Cipriani are held in solitary confinement 
but are allowed to meet for 30 minutes daily at exercise. 
Aubron and Menigon have a softer regime.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- President Richard von Weizsaecker has 
amnestied terrorist Bernhard Roessner (47), who was sentenced to 
life term of imprisonment. This was announced by the 
President's Office in Bonn on Monday [2 May] upon inquiry. The 
amnesty of Roessner, who was involved in the attack on the 
German Embassy in Stockholm in 1975, will become effective on 16 
May. 
  Roessner has been in prison in Straubing for almost 19 
years. 
In November 1992 Justice Minister Sabine 
Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger ordered a suspension of the sentence 
for 18 months because of Roessner's state of health. Since then 
he has been undergoing urgent therapeutical treatment near 
Kassel.

  [Text] Frankfurt/Main -- Former RAF terrorist Eva Haule 
(37) has been sentenced to life imprisonment in connection with 
an attack on the Frankfurt U.S. military airport on 8 August 
1985. Pronouncing the verdict on Thursday [28 April], the state 
protection senate at the Frankfurt Higher Regional Court spoke 
of a "particularly grave wrong" committed by the terrorist. 
This means that Eva Haule cannot expect her case to be 
reexamined after 15 years for suspension of sentence or 
pardoning. 
  The senate is convinced that Eva Haule was part of the 
commando that carried out the car bomb attack on the airport and 
killed U.S. soldier Edward Pimental in a forest near Wiesbaden 
the previous night to get hold of his U.S. identity card. This 
identity card enabled one of the terrorists to take the bomb to 
the car park in front of the U.S. headquarters at the Frankfurt 
airport. The explosion killed two people and very seriously 
injured another two. Several other people were injured. 
Property damage was approximately 1 million marks. 
  Haule has also been sentenced to 15 years for an attempted 
bomb attack on a NATO military school in Oberammergau, Bavaria, 
by the Stuttgart Higher Regional Court.

arrested in Vizcaya. They have been handed over to the National 
High Court in Madrid. One of them is Juan Carlos Hernando

  [Excerpts] A Civil Guard was shot dead this morning in a 
terrorist attack carried out in the Valle de Trapaga near 
Bilbao. The police are looking for a woman and another two 
people who fled the scene. Felisa Aldai reports from Bilbao: 
  [Aldai] The 39-year-old civil guard, Benigno Villalobos 
Blanco, died in what appears to have been the latest attack 
carried out by the ETA [Basque Fatherland and Liberty] terrorist 
group. Benigno Lobos was leaving his home at around 0800 when, 
acording to eyewitnesses, he was shot at by two men and a woman 
who fled the scene in a Fiat car with Santander numberplates. 
[passage omitted] 
  This attack takes place only 24 days after the ETA terrorist 
group killed another civil guard in Bilbao, Fernando Jimenez 
Pascual. On this occasion the terrorist group planted a 
powerful explosive under his car. This latest attack would seem 
to point to the existence of a new reorganized ETA Vizcaya 
commando.

  [Text] Eight militants, members of a new illegal leftist 
organization which aims to destroy the constitutional order in 
Turkey, have been captured in Istanbul and their arms seized. 
  According to information issued by the Istanbul Security 
Directorate, five terrorists who were planning to rob a bank in 
Zeytinburnu were captured by antiterror squads on 19 April, 15 
minutes before executing their plan. Following an identity 
check, it was determined that two of those captured are lawyers. 
Three other militants were captured as a result of information 
obtained from the captured terrorists. 
  Among the eight terrorists captured is a lawyer who is a 
member of the Istanbul Bar Association and is the terrorist 
organization's official responsible for Turkey [as heard]. In 
searches conducted in the militants' homes, 14 automatic rifles, 
13 revolvers, rounds of ammunition for these weapons, 11 hand 
grenades, 20 dynamite cartridges, 300 meters of fuse wire, 710 
fuses, three time bombs, 16 pipe bombs, two transmitters, police 
and army uniforms, false identification, and organizational 
documents were found. 
  The interrogation of the militants revealed that they robbed 
or planned to rob banks and public organizations in Istanbul, 
Kocaeli, Kayseri, and Balikesir and to conduct intelligence work 
in order to perpetrate various murders. 
  It transpires that the organization, which aims to create an 
order based on Marxist-Leninist principles, was established in 
1991. It was also determined that the militants who belong to 
the organization were conducting armed training programs at a 
farm they rented in Sariyer.

<F P=106> [First of an unspecified number of installments of an </F>
"abridgment" of an interview with Kurdish Workers Party, PKK, 
leader Abdullah Ocalan by reporters Ertugrul Kurkcu, Ragip 
Duran, Behcet Avsar in Barr Ilyas in Lebanon on 21 March] 
  [Text] Question: In your message to the 
International Conference on Northwestern Kurdistan, you proposed 
a cease-fire for the second time. You also agreed to abide by 
all the decisions of the conference. Why? 
  Ocalan: I felt a need to repeat this cease-fire 
offer to clear ourselves of responsibility. It was mostly 
addressed to the Western public, rather than Turks; and was 
announced partly at the request of our friends. I told them our 
views were consistent, that nothing had changed. But they 
asked: "Could you not put it in writing?" I told them I was 
not afraid to do that, and in an act of modesty, I went as far 
as to say I would abide by the decisions made by the conference. 
The Western alternative shows interest in a democratic 
solution, even a limited one. The West does not fully accept 
the renunciation of our national identity, it is impossible for 
them to deny a people's cultural identity. Therefore, do not 
disparage my pledge that "right now I accept any decisions you 
make." The result was clear from the start and I had to respect 
it. I asked if it would have any practical results and could it 
lead to other developments? It seems the decisions of the 
conference will have a significant impact on the Western public. 
Already, parliamentarians are increasing their support for our 
proposals. Influential people from various parliaments 
participated in the conference, and I hope it will influence 
their governments. Diplomatic channels have already been 
opened, including ties with the big powers. 
<H5>  France and Germany Will Backtrack </H5>
  Question: Germany and France joined Turkey last 
winter in declaring your organization illegal and terroristic. 
Do these new developments mean those countries are retracting 
their statements? 
  Ocalan: There will be a clear renunciation of 
these statements, and that will not be all. Why were such 
statements made in the first place? Because they had an 
important place in the plans of the United States and the West. 
At one point, Mitterrand told Ciller: "We will make your star 
shine." The meaning of this is very clear: "You take certain 
steps and in return we will boost your popularity." Do you know 
when France made this statement? A day before the True Path 
Party Congress. Ciller needed some success, a great victory to 
win over the congress. The West expressed their support for 
her, and this is how the "star wars were won." Soon after that, 
France and Germany made certain joint decisions with the 
knowledge of the United States. They expected things of Ciller; 
she had to take certain steps on the Kurdish problem. We were 
aware of the West's inclination, and therefore we wanted to show 
that we were not opposed to their policies as far as values are 
concerned and that we were not opposing this on the battlefield. 
Now, the West is returning to its original policy and is 
abandoning the idea of "giving moral support Ciller's shining 
star." Why? Because "she failed to fulfill the promises she 
made." Ciller had long been under the influence of the special 
warfare forces, and was acting as their mouthpiece. The West 
realized this and asked: "What does that finger wagging by 
Gures mean? Can he raise his finger against a prime minister?" 
[reference to a newspaper photo of Chief of General Staff Dogan 
Gures raising an admonishing finger over a sullen Ciller] The 
West noticed this. Of course, this symbolically reflects a 
reality -- she has come under the control of the Army. The 
promises have come to naught and there is nothing to show for 
it! Now, the West is angry at this. In addition to 
backtracking, it has also withdrawn its support. As the system 
requires, NATO still generally supports Turkey, but that is a 
different matter. Here I am talking about this government. 
Something new has arisen; my proposals had an enormous impact. 
Just the way the cease-fire proposal last year created an 
extraordinary effect in Turkey, the present one has generated a 
far greater impact on the international level. I think that 
this will put a lot of pressure on Turkey. 
  Question: The concluding statement of the 
conference links the intractable Kurdish problem to the West's 
policy of dividing up the Middle East and Kurdistan during and 
after World War I. Is this new attitude linked with the PKK's 
diplomatic initiatives, or with the democratization of the West? 
  Ocalan: Undoubtedly, Turkish realities foiled the 
West's policies; this is evident. They are unable to carry out 
their policies and have nothing left to say on the Kurdish 
problem. In the past the approach was: "The Kurdish problem 
cannot be solved by the PKK." For the last ten years, a Kurdish 
solution without the PKK was the most fashionable. The United 
States spearheaded this policy. The great difference is that 
now they say: "This cannot be accomplished without the PKK." 
This is a dramatic development; it is the achievement of the 
year. The fact that the PKK has been accepted as a factor in 
the solution will have repercussions. Another assessment of the 
conference was: "We have made a great mistake by seeing the PKK 
in this light thus far, we have had a mistaken view of it. We 
should have realized that the problem cannot be solved without 
the PKK. Our governments wanted to isolate the PKK and they 
supported the war, which has led to much bloodshed. The West -- 
France, Germany, and the United States -- are responsible for 
the bloodshed. We will pressure our governments to repent of 
their historic sin on the Kurdish problem and for supporting the 
12 September regime [the Turkish Government since the 1980 coup 
d'etat]. Seeing that this job cannot be done without the PKK, 
we will stress the importance of establishing contact with it." 
The conference adopted decisions in line with this assessment. 
  Question: What path will your party follow after 
the conference? 
  Ocalan: A period of diplomacy has now begun. The 
friendly parliamentarians, influential persons, professors, 
thinkers, and ministers are participating in developments and 
will be able to meet with all the ambassadors. This is a new 
trend, and I think it will intensify in April. This does not 
mean that the PKK has fallen under the control of the West. No! 
We are protecting our identity! We are really attached to our 
independence and freedom. There are no concessions on this 
issue! But on the other hand, we are sure it is senseless to 
make enemies out of the West for no reason at all. The West has 
its own values. Logic and democracy require that these values 
be taken into account and unity be achieved around them. The 
fanatical Turkish leftist and rightist circles consider that 
"the PKK is collaborating with the West." No! The conference 
decisions show the degree of Western support for Turkey. The 
West is equally responsible for the bloodshed. It is a fact 
that the West fought against us bitterly, and the United States 
was the leading force in this war. Again, it was the United 
States which supervised the tortures in Diyarbakir [reference to 
Kurds detained in Diyarbakir prison after the 1980 coup]. For 
many long years the United States supported plans to eliminate 
the PKK. The October 1992 attack against us during the war in 
the south [northern Iraq] was guided by the United States. The 
West also kept silent during the latest bombing of the Zhalah 
camp. As soon as four [Serbian] planes take off in Bosnia the 
West shoots them down; but when 50 planes raided Zhalah they 
approved of it. The region now is under Poised Hammer's 
jurisdiction. This raid shows the extent of the support given 
to Turkey. But now the West sees that it is responsible for the 
bloodshed. We proved their responsibility, and now they now 
want to back away from this policy. This backtracking is not a 
bad thing. Naturally, we will again announce that we are ready 
if they want to promote democratic and cultural rights and a 
political solution to the problem. We will say: "We express 
our agreement and compliance in advance" with any possible 
solutions, as logic and democracy require, not as an act of 
surrender or collusion as some claim.

former coup-plotter Seineldin from prison. 
<H5>  Colombia/U.S. </H5>
  Just before the New York trial of Dandenys Munoz Mosquera, 
a.k.a. La Quica, a Colombian informant "with a great deal of 
credibility" has said that La Quica was a leading figure in the 
1989 Avianca airlines bombing, taking orders from Carlos Mario 
Alzate Urquijo, a.k.a. El Arete. 
<H5>  Iran/International </H5>
  London's THE SUNDAY TIMES publishes a report on a November

  [Text] A special Egyptian unit has returned to Cairo from 
the United States where it received training under the 
supervision of U.S. agencies on operations requiring more 
sophisticated training than could be provided by Egyptian 
security agencies. The units were trained at the expense of an 
oil-rich Arab country. 
  Competent U.S. quarters did not deny that the units' future 
tasks would include the execution of operations outside Egyptian 
boundaries for the United States or the state that has financed 
the units' training. It has been rumored here that among the 
expected or scheduled operations may be one or more in Sudan 
against the ruling Islamic Front and some of its leaders. The 
expected operations in Sudan will particularly target Usamah 
Bin-Ladin, who has been accused by foreign and certain Arab 
quarters of financing and leading extremist fundamentalist 
movements. 
  Usamah Bin-Ladin announced in Sudan that he has joined the 
Saudi opposition movement in London and that he supports its 
objectives. Bin-Ladin's announcement came in reaction to the 
Saudi authorities' withdrawal of his Saudi passport. 
  Western circles believe that part of the al-Shaykh religious 
family in Saudi Arabia supports and finances the opposition.

  [Text] The Berlin public prosecutor has decided to charge 
a former Syrian diplomat, Nabil Sharitah, with carrying out the 
bomb attack on the French cultural center Maison de France. DPA 
learned this from judicial circles today. Sharitah, who is 
being accused of aiding and abetting murder, arrived in Germany 
under mysterious circumstances at the beginning of January and 
was arrested and temporarily held. At the same time, charges 
were brought against a Stasi official from the department 
dealing with the fight against terrorism. One person was killed 
and 23 injured in the attack, which took place 11 years ago on 
25 August 1983. [See 8 April Terrorism Report] 
  A Berlin justice spokeswoman, Uta Filster, confirmed that 
two 
defendants will be charged with aiding and abetting murder, but 
she refused to go into detail. 
  As recently as in mid-April, a former Stasi lieutenant, 
Helmut Voigt (51), was sentenced to four years imprisonment by 
the Berlin court for aiding and abetting the attack. The court 
considered it proven that Voigt at least passed on the order to 
hand over the explosives for the attack to a suspected German 
terrorist, Johannes Weinrich. 
  The Stasi official who is now facing charges is believed to 
have passed on the explosives to Weinrich, as ordered by Voigt. 
According to the public prosecutor, at the Syrian Embassy in 
East Berlin Weinrich deposited the explosives with Sharitah, who 
is now being indicted. Weinrich, who is believed to belong to 
the international terrorist group "Carlos," picked up the 
explosives again on the day when the attack was carried out. 
  It has become known that Sharitah was allegedly lured to 
Budapest by the German authorities. Security officials 
reportedly made it clear to him that he cannot return to his 
home country because of his participation in the attack. In the 
trial against Voigt, Sharitah testified amid tight security 
measures -- he was protected by a screen. He stressed that 
Syria is fighting terrorists. 
  However, according to findings by German security 
authorities, Weinrich and "Carlos" lived in the Syrian capital 
Damascus at least until the middle of last year. The Federal 
Government has asked Syria several times to extradite the two 
suspected terrorists against whom an arrest warrant because of 
murder was issued by the court in Berlin-Tiergarten 10 years ago.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN): The death of an employee at the 
Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and his 
wife during a holiday in Libya has still not been cleared up. 
The case was discussed by the Bundestag Parliamentary Control 
Commission (PKK) today, its chairman Johannes Gerster said 
afterwards. The German Government has briefed the Commission 
about the "brutal" circumstances of the death of the two 
Germans. The control commission strongly criticized the fact 
that the Libyan Government has still not complied with a German 
Government demand that the incident be completely cleared up 
with a comprehensive report. 
  According to press reports, the employee was section leader 
in department six of the Cologne-based Office for the Protection 
of the Constitution, a department which deals with extremist 
acts by foreigners and international terrorism. He is said to 
have died in a military hospital in Tripoli in mid-April. 
According to the reports, the "Middle East and North African 
expert" had a holiday trip to Egypt authorized by his employers. 
There was a ban on travel to Libya at the Office for the 
Protection of the Constitution.

  [Excerpts] Beirut (DPA) -- On Tuesday [26 April] the 
family of Lebanese Muhamad Ali Hamadi, who is in prison in 
Germany, denied press reports that terrorist Ali 'Abbas Hamadi, 
who was deported from Germany last year, has returned to Germany 
to free his brother. On 21 April, Bonn security circles reported 
that corresponding clues are being investigated. [passage 
omitted] 
  On Tuesday the Arab daily AL HAYAH, which is published in 
London, carried a statement of the Hamadi clan, which is very 
influential in Lebanon. The statement says that reports 
"according to which 'Abbas Hamadi is currently in Germany and is 
secretly preparing his brother's escape from prison" are 
"completely wrong." 'Abbas Hamadi is still in Lebanon and 
receives medical treatment because of "the suffering he was 
subjected to in German prisons."

  [Text] Sanaa, April 25 (AFP) -- A man hijacked an Ethiopian 
airliner as it took off from Saudi Arabia for Addis Ababa on 
Monday, but freed all 148 passengers and surrendered when the 
plane landed in Yemen, the interior ministry said here. 
  Blaya Mashasha, an Ethiopian, entered the cockpit 
immediately 
after take-off at dawn in Jeddah and demanded that the pilot fly 
to London, a ministry statement quoted by the official Yemeni 
news agency SABA said. 
  The Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 757 had been scheduled to fly 
to the Ethiopian capital. 
  Authorities in Jeddah and Djibouti refused it permission to 
land, but after two hours the Yemeni authorities said it could 
land at Sanaa airport "for humanitarian reasons, because the 
fuel was in danger of running out," the ministry said. 
  "After great efforts and discussions between the Yemeni 
authorities and the hijacker all the passengers were freed. The 
pilot and co-pilot remained on the plane, but were finally freed 
at 1:00 p.m. (1000 GMT)." 
  The authorities started questioning the hijacker, but no 
details were released about his motives nor the circumstances of 
his surrender.

  [Text] Addis Ababa, 27 Apr (SUNA) -- 'Abd-al-Baqi Muhammad 
Hasan, Sudan's ambassador to Mogadishu town [was] released 
today. Hasan was abducted recently by three Somali gunmen from 
[the] Hawadle clan. 
  [Paris AFP in English at 1115 GMT on 27 April, in a 
Nairobi-datelined item, adds: "Somali gunmen released unharmed 
and without conditions Sudan's ambassador to Mogadishu following 
intervention by Somali faction leaders, diplomats said Tuesday. 
Hasan was freed after Sudanese officials who went to Mogadishu 
last week requested some undisclosed Somali politicians to help 
secure his release, said a diplomat who asked not to be named. 
The ambassador was `in good condition' and joked about having 
gained weight during his eight days in captivity."]

  [Text] Johannesburg April 27 SAPA -- A large explosion 
believed to be a car bomb shook the international arrivals hall 
at Jan Smuts Airport on Wednesday morning. The blast was 
confirmed by Witwatersrand Liaison Officer Col Dave Bruce. He 
could not confirm it was a car bomb. 
  A spokesman for the Joint Operational Centre in Pretoria 
said 
although details of the airport blast were still scanty, reports 
had been received that three people had been injured -- one 
seriously. "There was a car bomb," said a spokeswoman at the 
Operational Centre. 
  But police in a later official statement said "an explosive 
device...as yet unknown type" exploded at the airport. Police 
could not immediately confirm any deaths. 
  SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news 
reported a "car bomb" exploded at the parking area adjoining the 
arrivals facility. Kempton Park fire brigade officers were 
treating several injured people who sustained injuries.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 27 SAPA -- Police were 
questioning a suspect who matched the description of a white man 
seen running away from a car shortly before Jan Smuts airport 
was rocked by a powerful car bomb on Wednesday. SAP [South 
African Police] spokesman Capt Wikus Webber said the suspect had 
been driving a white Toyota. He was fairly tall and had long 
brown hair. 
  Police confirmed there had been no deaths as a result of the 
blast but said two injured people were in a serious condition. 
Police confirmed the blast had been a car bomb. 
  Airport workers were still cleaning up debris -- mostly 
shattered glass -- at 9.30AM after the 7.15AM blast. At least 
18 people were injured in the blast.

  [Text] Announcer Patricia Glyn: Our reporter has 
arrived at Jan Smuts Airport. Hendrick Martin is on the line to 
us from there now to give us an update on the bomb which 
occurred there earlier this morning. Hendrick Hello. How close 
are you to where the bomb actually exploded? 
  Martin: Well, I'm on the spot where the bomb 
exploded, on the inside of the airport building. It's actually 
just outside the windows on the second floor, a sort of parking 
area, it's just opposite the international departures hall. A 
lot of damage has been done. The windows are smashed. The 
ceiling has fallen in in several places. Even from the ground 
floor outside, some of the windows were shattered, and you can 
also [see] parts of the ceiling hanging down. [passage omitted] 
  Glyn So Hendrick let me get this straight, the 
bomb was planted in a car outside the international arrivals 
hall, but the distance between where the car was parked and the 
hall was merely a matter of meters, was it? 
  Martin That's how it looks. According to this 
witness, he told me his whole story. He saw a white Peugeot 
vehicle and he saw smoke coming from the boot of this car. He 
had two traffic officials with him, they also saw it, and they 
tried via radio to contact, to get help, to get someone to come 
and look at this, and he said the next moment there was a 
tremendous blast, and it is literally just on the other side of 
the window. 
  Glyn Now did this person also see the man that 
the police are looking for, some chap with red hair who was 
taken away, or drove away in a Toyota Corolla? 
  Martin No, he didn't see anybody, at least he 
didn't mention seeing anybody, but another witness apparently 
did see someone running away from the area, and apparently the 
police are in the process of compiling an identikit based on the 
description of the person. 
  Glyn Hendrick, thank you very much.

  [Excerpt] Buenos Aires, 29 Apr (NA) -- A 23-year-old man 
had the lower third of his right arm and the forefinger of his 
left hand amputated today, after an explosive device which he 
found tied to a sign of the People's Revolutionary Organization 
(ORP) at the intersection of General Paz Avenue and Francisco 
Beiro Street went off. 
  Edgardo Dario Ruiz was strolling with a group of friends at 
0300 this morning when he saw a strange package hanging from the 
sign. He took the package to a private residence at the 
intersection of Ejercito de los Andes and San Roque Streets in 
Jose Ingenieros district, and tried to open it, at which point 
the device went off. 
  The young man was immediately taken to Santojanni Hospital 
where the lower third of his right arm and the forefinger of his 
left hand had to be amputated. 
  Leonardo Vicente, 18, Ariel Leroiani, 18, and a female minor 
aged 14 were accompanying Ruiz, who also sustained first-degree 
burns to his right eye. 
  Vicente's face was also bruised by the explosion, and was 
taken to Santojanni Hospital as well, but his injuries are not 
serious. 
  According to the Buenos Aires police the homemade bomb 
exploded as it was being manipulated. They also reported that 
four other explosive devices were found attached to the sign, 
three of them 2.54 cm wide by 15 cm long, and the last one 1.27 
cm wide by 20 cm long. The bomb squad buried and detonated them. 
  The sign to which the bombs were attached said "Let's fight 
the labor reform," was signed by the ORP, and bore the red 
communist star. 
  Shortly after the bomb exploded, Interior Minister Carlos 
Ruckauf said that it was a "serious matter" although he added 
that "these kinds of booby traps are nothing new." 
  Speaking to Radio Continental, the interior minister said: 
"During these 10 years of democracy we have had this very same 
organization (meaning the ORP) cropping up every so often and 
setting these booby traps." [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 26 Apr (NA) -- It was officially 
reported today that an "extremely dangerous ultra-right 
extremist," who had been working in the Army until last year as 
a civilian intelligence official, has been detained by Buenos 
Aires police agents on an island in Tigre District. About 30 kg 
of explosives, antitank rockets, 24 grenades, and arms of 
various calibers and ammunition were also seized. 
  Police and court sources have indicated that the detainee, 
officially identified as Alejandro Jorge Socksdorf, 35, is a 
member of a "Painted Faces" group whose members had allegedly 
been training "to rescue" former Colonel Mohamed Ali Seineldin, 
sentenced to life imprisonment for heading a military uprising 
on 3 December 1990. 
  The operation in which Socksdorf was detained was ordered by 
San Isidro Federal Judge Roberto Marquevich. Buenos Aires 
Islands Security Corps police participated in the raids on an 
island near the Antequeda Creek, 400 meters from the Parana de 
Las Palmas river confluence. 
  Inspector Juan Carlos Rebollo, the Buenos Aires Islands 
Security Corps chief, said the detainee "is an extremely 
dangerous person." Rebollo emphasized that the area where the 
raids were carried out is reportedly "a training camp for 
ultra-right extremists" because "a large number of spent 
cartridges" were found in the area. 
  Rebollo explained: "In addition to the arms seized, we also 
found targets and other items that lead us to believe that 
people were trained there. A heliport was found at the far end 
of the island." 
  Based on this, Rebollo emphasized that the 15-hectare island 
might be "a training center," specially for former "Painted 
Faces" military officers. 
  He indicated that extreme-right literature was also seized, 
reinforcing the possibility that the detainee is part of an 
extreme right group. [passage omitted] 
  The police seized 24 MK2 grenades, an unspecified quantity 
of 
9-mm pistols, at least 10 "Energan" antitank rockets which are 
launched by FAL rifles, a large quantity of 7.62 and 12.70 
caliber ammunition, and a "home-made firing stand" [preceding 
word in English] for mobile targets. 
  Inspector Rebollo added that 10 rifle-launched rockets, one 
FMK 2 grenade, three electric detonators, and 100 grams of 
dynamite were also seized. 
  Buenos Aires Security Secretary Alberto Piotti noted that 46 
pounds of TNT -- in 1-pound pieces -- rapid and safety fuses, 
detonators, a 12.70 caliber shotgun [as received], an 
unspecified quantity of dynamite, and a Browning pistol with 
erased license numbers were also seized. [passage omitted] 
  In a brief communique signed by Colonel Eduardo Alfonso, the 
Army Press Office chief, the Army General Staff indicated that 
Socksdorf was a "civilian employee" in the Army until 1993 when 
he was "fired" for undisclosed reasons. 
  Army sources reported that Socksdorf, who was a PCI 
[Civilian 
Intelligence Personnel] grade employee, participated in the 
operations to recover the 3d Infantry Regiment of La Tablada 
that was surrounded on 23 January 1989 by a group of For the 
Fatherland Movement (MTP) militants. 
  Inspector Rebollo noted that when the raid began, Socksdorf 
introduced himself as "an IN-11 grade Army member and many other 
things which the judge (Marquevich) will have to determine if 
they are true." 
  Police sources contacted by NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS stated that 
the detainee "has significant military training" and so the 
possibility that "he is a trainer of other members of the cell" 
has not been ruled out. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the "Seven O'Clock Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] The case of Dandenys Munoz Mosquera, a.k.a. La 
Quica, could take an abrupt turn in the United States. Only a 
few days before the trial against him begins in New York, 
Colombia obtained an important statement directly implicating La 
Quica in the case of the Avianca aircraft, contrary to what El 
Arete [Carlos Alzate Urquijo] had stated in a report that caused 
a scandal a few days ago. The Prosecutor General's office has 
the statement and is expected to turn it over to the United 
States within the next few hours. This is an exclusive report. 
  By a strange boomerang effect, the letter from Prosecutor de 
Greiff to the U.S. judge who is examining the participation of 
La Quica in the attack on the Avianca aircraft prompted a very 
credible informant to confess all he knew about the sinister 
attack. According to the confession, given to an appointed 
prosecutor, the informant, whose identity is being maintained in 
strict secrecy, confessed that the Avianca aircraft explosion 
was carried out directly by Dandenys Munoz a.k.a. La Quica, with 
the participation of other accomplices. In other words, La Quica 
was the one who staged the attack. 
  Even more surprising, the informant confirmed that La Quica 
had staged the attack as ordered by Carlos Mario Alzate Urquijo, 
a.k.a. El Arete, who was the one that stated before Prosecutor 
de Greiff that La Quica had nothing to do with the sinister 
incident. In other words, El Arete blatantly lied to Prosecutor 
de Greiff regarding La Quica. The informant, who contradicted 
the statement by El Arete, and who has puzzled the 
investigators, has a great deal of credibility with the judicial 
and security organizations, because he alerted the authorities 
about an attack on the U.S. Embassy and about other planned 
attacks, even against Prosecutor de Greiff.

  [Excerpt] Quito, 1 May (EFE) -- A low-intensity bomb that 
exploded early this morning in Santo Domingo de los Colorados, 
100 km west of Quito, and which did not cause personal injuries 
has been the main incident of the legislative and gubernatorial 
elections being held today in Ecuador. 
  Quito radio stations that reported the attack added the bomb 
did not cause substantial damage in the building where it was 
placed, and no information was known about the perpetrators. 
  There were two false bomb threats at polling stations in the 
capital, and in Esmeraldas, a city on the Pacific Coast, three 
people were injured in an incident between political 
adversaries, according to a television network. 
  No incidents have been registered throughout the rest of 
this 
Andean country of 11 million people, except for delays in the

  [Excerpt] Lima, 28 Apr (EFE) -- Evangelical pastor Juan 
Mallea has been released after spending nine months in prison 
and after it was demonstrated that he is innocent of terrorist 
charges. He reported today that he was tortured by Peruvian 
Counterterrorism police who wanted him to plead guilty. 
  Mallea announced that his attorney-at-law is studying the 
possibility of filing a claim for damages against the Peruvian 
police and state for moral and economic damage as a result of 
the charges that determined his confinement in the Canto Grande 
prison in Lima. 
  Mallea asked the government to publicly admit its mistake 
"because it is for men to admit their mistakes." 
  Mallea, who was detained on 10 July 1993, held a news 
conference. He recalled that on 21 July 1993 he was tortured by 
Counterterrorism Directorate (DINCOTE) agents. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Lima, 28 Apr (EFE) -- [passage omitted] The 
opposition newspaper LA REPUBLICA today published a police 
report that confirms the [Shining Path] group's split. The 
newspaper reports that the faction opposing [Shining Path 
leader] Guzman held a meeting in March in the Huanta Province 
mountains in southern Peru. During the meeting this faction 
agreed to disregard Guzman's peace proposal. 
  The report also indicates that during this meeting a new 
Shining Path "central committee" was formed, and that this 
"central committee" expelled from the party the leaders who 
remain loyal to Guzman and who support peace, describing them as 
"traitors, infiltrated people, capitulators, and old 
revisionists." 
  According to the report the new "committee" is headed by 
Shining Path leader Oscar Ramirez Durand, alias "Comrade 
Feliciano," one of the Shining Path founders. 
  Former Deputy Carlos Tapia, another expert in Shining Path 
activities, stressed today that "Shining Path no longer 
represents a threat, and in a way we may coexist with this type 
of violence as is the case with the IRA [Irish Republican Army] 
in Ireland and the ETA [Basque Homeland and Liberty] in Spain." 
  Nevertheless, Tapia ruled out the possibility of the 
terrorist organization's immediate disappearance, "as the social 
processes that have been brewing for so long may not end 
overnight, and some time is required for their extinction."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Death Among the Autumn Leaves; The </F>
Disaster of a German Operation Against Arab Terrorists"] 
  [Text] The man, who had spent the past few hours in a 
detention cell in the Duesseldorf police headquarters, was 
raging like a maniac. "Idiot," he snapped at his interrogator, 
"why am I sitting behind bars?" 
  Marwan Khreesat, 49, born in Jordan, revealed an astounding 
story to the State Protection Department of the Federal Office 
of Criminal Investigation (BKA). "I'm one of you," maintained 
the Arab, who had been arrested as a suspected terrorist. He 
lamented that arrangements had been made with the German 
authorities that he would be given a chance to escape. 
  The criminal investigator couldn't understand this at all. 
He 
took the Arab's testimony, three pages' worth. Even the public 
prosecutor in charge began to suspect during the subsequent 
investigation that the prisoner apparently was under special 
protection. In any case, the record of the interrogation ended 
up shredded in the trash, thanks to a warning from West German 
secret service officials. In other respects, too, the arrested 
Jordanian enjoyed striking concessions. An office of the 
Duesseldorf public prosecutor telephoned the German Embassy in 
the Jordanian capital of Amman--Khreesat could speak with a 
fellow national who was sitting there in the office of the 
military attache. The latter made it very clear: "Trust the 
German authorities." 
  Germany, in the fall of 1988, two months before the downing 
of the jumbo jet over Lockerbie: Following a tip from the 
Israeli secret service, Mosad, and on the basis of their own 
investigations, German security officers surrounded a cell of 
the Palestinian terrorist group PFLP-GC (Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine--General Command) in Neuss, near 
Duesseldorf. 
  The Israelis reported that the PFLP-GC fighters wanted to 
attack American targets in Central Europe. The Office for the 
Protection of the Constitution [BfV] for the time being knew 
only--according to an internal report--that the Palestinians 
"were recruiting new members" in Germany. 
  Pulling the strings was Syrian arch terrorist Hafez Kassem 
Hussein, today 48, member of the PFLP-CG Central Committee and 
leader of the European network. His nom de guerre: Dalkamoni. 
Officials knew that wherever he surfaced there was more going on 
than mere recruiting activities: The group was planning several 
bomb attacks. 
  In July 1988, the American cruiser Vincennes had mistakenly 
shot down an Iranian Airbus over the Strait of Hormuz. All 290 
passengers and crew had been killed. Arab groups swore 
revenge--if possible three airplanes were to be dispatched from 
the skies at the same time. 
  German security officials, therefore, planned a big coup 
against Arab terrorists on German soil. Code name for the 
operation: Operation Autumn Leaves. 
  Dalkamoni summoned the top specialist Khreesat, cover name 
"Safi," to Neuss. The partisan of the PFLP-GC had earned a 
reputation in the terrorist branch. Area of expertise: attacks 
against airlines. Khreesat is suspected of having helped prepare 
two attacks against jets belonging to Swissair and Israel's El 
Al, in 1970 and 1972. 
  What Dalkamoni didn't know was that Khreesat had threefold 
duties in the intelligence service and terrorist business. The 
East Berlin Ministry for State Security had learned early in 
October that the Arab was an agent for the West Germans--this 
from a "reliable source" in the German Intelligence Service 
[BND], according to a memorandum. The BND had recruited Khreesat 
"with the concurrence of the Jordanian secret service" to 
infiltrate PFLP commandos, for example. 
  But the big operation against Arab terrorism ended in a 
disaster that the authorities have shrouded in silence to this 
day: 
  --A German policeman died while defusing a PFLP bomb; 
  --an informant in the western services whom the BfV had 
infiltrated into the Neuss group was presumably liquidated; 
  --a Karlsruh investigating judge released the second 
informant, Khreesat, even though he was responsible for 
constructing four bombs. 
  From the middle of October 1988 on, according to Stasi 
[State 
Security Service (GDR)] findings, Khreesat had become a full 
player in Operation Autumn Leaves. Whenever he or Dalkamoni 
telephoned, the BfV's tape recorders were running. Both men were 
under constant surveillance. 
  On 20 October, they talked about procuring "three large 
black 
cans with lids," as well as "gloves" and "paste." On the 
following day, they talked about "pointed buttons made of 
aluminum," four of which were to be "electric." On 24 October, 
according to a record," it was determined that Dalkamoni 
purchased three mechanical alarm clocks and possibly one digital 
alarm clock.... Next Khreesat...together with Dalkamoni bought 
16 1.5-volt batteries (appliance batteries, finger thick), 
diverse small switches, screws, and a large tube of Pattex." 
  Khreesat reported to Damascus that he had made changes in 
the 
"medicine," and that it "was now better and stronger than 
before." What Khreesat meant was clear to the eavesdroppers: 
explosives. 
  He told his contacts in Amman that it would be "two to three 
more days" before he returned. Dalkamoni, too, called his 
homeland and a liaison person in the King's Take Away restaurant 
on Cyprus. The job, he said, was about finished. 
  From this the observers concluded that the Neuss terror duo, 
Dalkamoni-Khreesat, wanted to disappear and would be replaced by 
a new team--a very common practice with such operations. 
  Klaus Gruenewald, department chief in the Cologne BfV, 
sounded the alarm: "To ward off threatening danger, an executive 
intervention was imperative." 
  On 26 October 1988, special operation commandos of the 
police 
took 16 people belonging to the Neuss Palestinian unit into 
temporary custody. Whole arsenals of electronic apparatus and 
weapons were seized. Among those arrested was Ramzi Diab, born 
in Akko, Israel, in 1959. Diab appears only incidentally in the 
German Autumn Leaves papers. An official noted: "n.p.u., which 
means: further personal data unknown. 
  But that is anything but the truth. Diab, a secret service 
collaborator, had been assigned to watch Dalkamoni, which the 
BfV knew--a dangerous case of double dealing. Diab is said later 
to have been exposed and murdered by the PFLP-GC. 
  The carelessness with which German authorities carried out 
Operation Autumn Leaves also cost a German policeman his life. 
He had lived with this danger for over four years. On 20 March 
1989, BKA Chief Commissioner Hans-Juergen Sonntag typed on his 
office typewriter a kind of letter of resignation: 
  "Withdrawal of my willingness to serve. I hereby withdraw my 
declaration to volunteer to deactivate unconventional explosive 
and incendiary devices." 
  It seemed clear to him that his chief would have no 
objections: Star athlete Sonntag, parachutist, body builder, 
swimmer, and soccer player, as well as tennis partner of BKA 
President Heinrich Boge. And the young man had had the prospect 
of a new job for a long time: security officer at the German 
Embassy in Teheran. 
  The last bomb that he was to disassemble took the life of 
Sonntag, 35. On a special table in the basement of the office 
lay a stereo tuner, which looked harmless, but which in reality 
was a devilish explosive trap--a piece of Khreesat's making. 
  "Come on, Thomas," said Sonntag to a younger colleague, 
"let's go to the lunchroom first and then get the job over with 
quickly. If it explodes, we'll be in heaven." The dangerous work 
had almost been completed. "It was just a matter of the last 
screw," Sonntag's father knows. An accidental turn of the 
screwdriver activated the firing mechanism. Sonntag survived the 
tremendous explosion only a few hours. The other official was 
badly injured. 
  Three days later, at the small cemetery in a little spot 
called Erfweiler-Ehlingen, between Saarbruecken and the French 
border: State funeral for Chief Commissioner Sonntag, formulaic 
speeches for the good policeman who had to die in service for 
his country. 
  No one wants to say how absurd Sonntag's death was in the 
jungle of the secret services. The official died from the blast 
of a bomb that the informant of another German security service 
had put together. It is fitting for this tragedy that the German 
judiciary did not issue a new arrest warrant for Khreesat for 
the involuntary manslaughter of policeman Sonntag until the fall 
of 1990, when the perpetrator was no longer in reach. 
  The Fifth Criminal Division of the Superior Land Court in 
Frankfurt mentioned the scandal only in passing when, on 3 June 
1991, after eight months of proceedings, it sentenced the 
terrorists Dalkamoni and an accomplice to 15 and 12 years in 
prison for other attacks: 
  "In October 1988, Dalkamoni asked the fellow accused, Marwan 
Khreesat, an expert in the production of explosives, to come to 
the Federal Republic. Khreesat was to make bombs out of radios. 
These bombs were intended to cause plane crashes." 
  Operation Autumn Leaves ended up in the registry.

  [Excerpt] Violence is back on the agenda in Lome, Togo. 
Five Frenchmen and a Beninese were injured in the Togolese 
capital last night when a grenade thrown into a restaurant in 
the Be district exploded. The six victims are not in danger of 
death and the Togolese police have declined at this stage of 
their inquiry to speculate on the reasons behind the attack. 
The targeted restaurant belongs to a Frenchman and is known to 
be mostly patronized by Europeans. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] On 3 May at about 2130, some unknown persons 
launched a grenade attack on Le Relaxe Restaurant near the Be 
District water tower, which is run by a French national. The 
grenade was thrown across the fence of the candle-lit restaurant 
-- power supply to the area was cut at noon. On-the-spot 
evidence has shown that the grenade was Soviet-made. Six 
persons were wounded in the attack which caused some material

  [Excerpts] We just received a press communique from the 
Albanian Foreign Ministry, which states: Today, 3 May 1994, the 
official meeting between the Albanian Foreign Ministry 
delegation led by Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi, and the Greek 
Foreign Ministry delegation led by Greek Foreign Minister 
Karolios Papoulias was held in Zurich, Switzerland, a meeting 
decided upon long ago to analyze Albanian-Greek relations 
following the terrorist action against a recruit training center 
in Peshkepi on 10 April 1994. [see item AU1304203694 in 22 April 
Terrorism Report] [passage omitted] 
  The Albanian delegation pointed out that unfortunately, we 
determine that we have recently been confronted with a series of 
incidents and provocations, but there is no precedence for the 
10 April act of terrorism. The furious reactivation and 
conspicuous and uninhibited aggressiveness of the Vorio-Epirus 
chauvinist circles, the irresponsible anti-Albanian statements 
issued by several high-level Greek state personalities, the 
exploitation of certain elements of the Greek minority in 
Albania to achieve expansionist ambitions, the provocative 
interference -- contrary to every diplomatic ethic -- of Greek 
diplomats in the internal affairs of the Albanian Autocephalous 
Orthodox Church and the Albanian state, the absence of a serious 
commitment by the Greek Government to throw light on the tragic 
event in Peshkepi and make criminals legally responsible 
underscore these incidents. 
  The Albanian side asked the Greek Government to immediately 
take measures to prevent the frenzied warmongering propaganda of 
radio stations installed in southern Greece, Corfu, and Konjice, 
and publications by the Institute of Vorio-Epirus Studies in 
Ioanniana, which calls for making territorial claims so far as 
to include armed intervention against Albania, as well as the 
measures necessary so that the terroristic acts are not repeated 
in the future. Its public stance should be clearly dissociated 
from the absurd chauvinistic claims directed toward the south of 
Albania. 
  For his part, after assessing Albanian-Greek relations to be 
very important, the Greek foreign minister reiterated his 
willingness to cooperate for a rapid normalization of bilateral 
relations and assented that the Greek Government will fulfill 
the aforementioned demand. 
  Concerning the investigation of the event, the Albanian side 
insisted that the Greek side agree to an investigation from an 
international unbiased commission, assessing that both sides 
should be interested in an objective and impartial assessment of 
evidence. [passage omitted on other issues discussed]

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Colombian guerrilla activities monitored through 4 
May. 
  As the losses from two guerrilla attacks against two Banadex 
company piers were being estimated, six military agents, wounded 
during an ambush in northern Uraba, were recuperating. In 
addition, two guerrillas died, and five others were captured in 
northern Antioquia Department. Meanwhile, the 48th Front of the 
Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces (FARC) detonated a bomb as 
an Army patrol passed by in Santa Catalina, San Pedro de Uraba, 
wounding six military personnel. Also, a counterguerrilla 
patrol and some National Liberation Army (ELN) members clashed 
in Botero, where two unidentified men died. Finally, a police 
patrol captured five ELN members in Argelia, southeastern 
Antioquia. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 25 Apr 94 p 
18A) 
  The Army on 24 April officially reported that one of the 
eight guerrillas captured 75 days earlier in Mesitas, 
Cundinamarca Department, is third in command of the ELN. His 
name is Luis Fernando Orozco Ortega, aka Ramiro, who was 
captured by the 13th Brigade. He is being held at the Modelo 
National Prison and has been charged with complicity in a 
terrorist wave of attacks against multinational oil companies. 
(Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 25 Apr 94 pp 1A, 18A) 
  Some 25 members of the ELN's Carlos Alirio Buitrago Front 
have forced four riders off their motorcycles and shot them dead 
on the Medellin-Santa Fe de Bogota highway, where they also set 
two trailers and 14 new cars on fire. Meanwhile, two minors and 
a peasant died when a guerrilla bomb went off in Caqueta. In a 
separate incident, the Army killed a guerrilla and captured 
another. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 27 Apr 94 pp 
1A, 8A) 
  Narino State military spokesmen report that Colombian 
authorities on 27 April seized 300 kg of dynamite near the 
border with Ecuador and arrested three people, who claimed the 
dynamite came from Ecuador and was going to be used by the ELN. 
(Paris AFP in Spanish 2151 GMT 27 Apr 94) 
  FARC forces attacked Giraldo Municipality, causing 
50-million 
pesos worth of damage. They also stole 15 rifles and wounded 
four soldiers. (Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Cadena 
1 in Spanish 0000 GMT 5 May 94)

  [Excerpt] We are going to repeat the communique sent to 
YSKL by the Salvadoran Revolutionary Front [FRS], which has 
issued death threats against former guerrilla commanders Ana 
Guadalupe Martinez, Joaquin Villalobos, and Eduardo Sancho. We 
will read the text of the communique and then we will have the 
reaction of former guerrilla commander Joaquin Villalobos about 
the FRS death threats. 
  This is the text of the communique: In view of the FMLN 
[Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] actions in the 
Legislative Assembly, the FRS states: 
  1. The attitude of the deputies of the ERP [Peoples 
Revitalizing Expression] and the National Resistance in selling 
out to ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance] in the first vote 
in the Legislative Assembly is a dishonorable action of high 
treason. 
  2. We praise the truly revolutionary attitude of the 
Communist Party, the Revolutionary Party of Central American 
Workers [PRTC], and the Peoples Liberation Forces [FPL] for 
refusing to share the Legislative Assembly's Board of Directors 
with the party of the death squads. It would be dishonorable 
and corrupt for any leader to try to sit on that board. 
  3. We believe the attitude adopted by these gentlemen at 
this 
time and all the repercussions of their treasons, such as the 
case of the El Espino farm, the purge of the Armed Forces, their 
rejection and insults against Marxism-Leninism and revolutionary 
ideas, are very grave offenses against the revolution and the 
unity of the revolutionary forces. 
  4. It is hoped that the FMLN leadership will adopt an 
exemplary revolutionary position and will punish this grave 
transgression in its ranks with the quick and final expulsion of 
the ERP and National Resistance leaders. If this is not done and 
the issue is treated lightly, revolutionary ranks would be 
corrupted and it would be guilty of complicity. 
  In view of the above, the FRS decrees the death penalty is 
applicable to the members of the leadership of the National 
Resistance and the Peoples Revolutionary Army, now called the 
ERP, led by Joaquin Villalobos, Eduardo Sancho, Ana Guadalupe 
Martinez, and the rest of the traitors. We announce that we 
have already ordered our commando units to execute the orders 
against all the ERP and National Resistance leaders. 
  [Signed] FRS, 5 May 1994 
  We have former commander Joaquin Villalobos on the line to 
give us his opinion about the death sentences issued by the FRS 
because of the position adopted by the ERP and the National 
Resistance on Sunday, when the Legislative Assembly Board of 
Directors was elected. The two groups supported the ruling 
ARENA in these elections. Good evening commander, go ahead: 
  Villalobos: I have just learned of this. I can 
tell you that this is the result of the encouragement of 
fanatical positions. We have been insisting to other companeros 
that to use the word traitor, to make moral judgments, to 
polarize the situation as they have been doing, or to employ the 
type of attacks they have been employing would open the doors to 
a situation in which this type of thing would occur. 
  I do not know whether this comes from the left or the right. 
From wherever it comes, it is evidently something that has taken 
shape or is the result of political positions and the way in 
which the debate has been turned by the companeros of the FPL, 
PRTC, and the Communist Party. This is a very irrational and 
rash position of confrontation that runs counter to dialogue. 
All media have reported this as a very aggressive, 
confrontational, enraged, and angry position. Everyone saw the 
upside-down photographs, with the cross on the top, and the 
pamphlets decrying the traitors. For me, this threat is a 
logical consequence. Nevertheless, I tell you that we are not 
worried. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Lima, 5 May (EFE) -- It was reported officially 
today that a Peruvian military court has annulled the life 
prison sentence imposed in March on drug trafficker Demetrio 
Chavez, aka Vaticano, and has sentenced him to 30 years in 
prison. 
  The maximum sentence for Vaticano was commuted by the 
Supreme 
Court of Military Justice (CSJM) because although it believed 
Vaticano cooperated with terrorist groups, he never participated 
directly in murders. 
  The CSJM, which also sentenced Chavez to pay $50 million in 
compensation to the government, reported that it has been proven 
that Vaticano maintained close links with terrorists, and 
exerted influence on armed groups, especially on the Shining 
Path [SL], based on his economic power. 
  "That allowed the SL to intensify actions in that zone (the 
Huallaga Valley) and in several other parts of the country, with 
the resulting selective murders," a document released by the 
CSJM states. 
  The document states that Vaticano's influence reached, among 
other zones, the Cuchara Valley, where since 5 April security 
forces have been carrying out a great antisubversive offensive. 
  The SL protected the illegal airports and the landings and 
takeoffs of the airplanes in which Vaticano had been sending 
drugs to Colombia since 1990, the document states. 
  In exchange, the drug trafficker gave the SL weapons, 
ammunition, communications equipment, and from $10,000 to 
$20,000 in cash for every airplane that took off with 500 kg of 
cocaine. 
  Demetrio Chavez was arrested on 28 February in Cali, 
Colombia, during an operation coordinated between the Colombian 
and Peruvian authorities, and expelled on the same day to Peru 
as an "undesirable."

  [Text] Lima, 1 May (EFE) --The local news media today 
reported that security forces have liberated 1,135 Peruvian 
Ashaninka people who were being held by the Shining Path [SL] 
terrorist gang. 
  The Ashaninkas were freed from several villages on the banks 
of the Ene River, in Satipo Province, Junin Department, a jungle 
area in the Peruvian central mountain region. 
  Journalists state that the captives had been literally 
enslaved by the maoist gang. They are suffering from 
malnutrition and many appear to have tuberculosis. 
  The Ashaninkas were freed by the Army units in the course of 
recent operations. They together with some who managed to flee 
from the terrorists are currently receiving medical care and 
food at regional counter-subversive bases. 
  The SL has been operating in the jungle area of Junin 
Department since 1984.

  [Text] Lima, 5 May (EFE) -- The Peruvian Army and Police 
will today start patrolling Lima and the port of Callao to 
prevent possible terrorist attacks, as the 14th anniversary of 
the day the Shining Path began its activities, on 17 May 1980, 
approaches. 
  There were four attacks with explosives last night against 
the offices of the state company Electrolima [Lima Electric 
Power Enterprise] and three other attacks against the Credit 
Bank in Lima, which caused only material damage. 
  According to a military communique, a similar attack took 
place on 3 May in the Military Village of Chorrillos District in 
Lima, with no casualties resulting. 
  On 17 May 1980, one day before the general elections in 
which 
Fernando Belaunde Terry was elected president for the second 
time, a Shining Path group entered the small town of Chuschi, 
Ayacucho Department, and destroyed electoral material. This was 
the first action of the terrorist organization. 
  According to sources from the Counterterrorism Directorate 
(Dincote) cited today by LA REPUBLICA, there is fear that the 
Shining Path may unleash a campaign of violence in Lima on 
orders from its current chief, Oscar Ramirez Durand, alias 
"Feliciano." 
  There is also the fear that the Shining Path will increase 
its activities in memory of the events of 6, 7, 8, and 9 May 
1992, when the security forces occupied the Canto Grande 
penitentiary in Lima after the terrorists took over the prison. 
  Meanwhile, hundreds of kilometers north of Lima in the 
jungle 
region of Huanuco Department, where a military operation against 
three Shining Path columns is being carried out, a captured 
terrorist, Ely Puertas, alias "Juan," revealed to EXPRESO the 
painful conditions of his colleagues. 
  Puertas says that the "Mar Rojo Batallion" he belonged to 
has 
300 men, many of them civilians who were recruited under the 
threat of death. 
  He added that the Shining Path members are hungry and 
thirsty, as they have only tubers and fruit to eat, and that 
they want to take refuge under the repentance law, but the 
chiefs prevent them from doing so. 
  The Peruvian Government today extended the state of 
emergency 
for 60 days in four provinces of the southern Andean Apurimac 
Department "to facilitate the operations against terrorism." 
  There are no civil liberties in the emergency zones, which 
are under military control.

  [Text] Caracas, 3 May (AFP) -- AFP correspondents have 
reported the Bomb Squad the Political Police [as received] 
(Disip) [Directorate of Intelligence and Prevention Services] 
and agents of the Judicial Technical Police (PTJ) today at 1600 
(2000 GMT) defused a small bomb some 50 meters away from the AFP 
office in Caracas. 
  A police source told AFP the explosive device was planted 
inside a briefcase full of blank sheets of paper left in a 
building located on Urdaneta Ave. The officer added: "We have 
not ruled out that this is an action similar to the one that 
occurred in the Caracas subway on 2 May." 
  On the morning of 2 May, a homemade bomb exploded in a 
Caracas subway car, wounding five people. An unknown group, the 
Popular Liberation Front Urban Command [Comando Urbano del 
Frente de Liberacion Nacional], claimed responsibility for the 
attack. [see previous Terrorism Report] 
  In the early afternoon of 2 May, the Political Police 
reported it had identified two minors as the suspected 
perpetrators of the Caracas subway attack. The Attorney 
General's Office will prosecute their cases. 
  Anonymous calls to the PTJ on 3 May reported the planting of 
explosive devices in at least four places in Caracas.

  [Excerpts] [passage omited] Our correspondent in Beirut has 
interviewed the secretary general of the Palestine Islamic Jihad 
Movement [Fathi al-Shaqaqi] in Beirut on this meeting and the 
possible agreements at the meeting. We draw your attention to 
his report: [passage omitted] 
  On the futue of the intifadah after implementation of the 
Gaza-Jericho accord, Shaqaqi said: Far from being curtailed, 
the military operation will -- in my opinion -- intensify, even 
though continuation of the military operations under these 
circumstances will be difficult. We will, however, exert every 
effort.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "`Islamic Jihad' Hints at Possible </F>
Halt to its Operations in Gaza Strip"] 
  [Text] Damascus, AL-HAYAH -- Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, 
secretary general of the Islamic Jihad Movement, has told 
AL-HAYAH that the signing of the Gaza-Jericho agreement between 
Israel and the PLO today "prompts us to reconsider the nature of 
military action" in the Gaza Strip after the self-rule 
authority's entry. He pointed out that he will work toward 
increasing the movement's "political effectiveness" while 
continuing military action in the same manner in the other 
occupied territories. 
  Al-Shaqaqi said in Damascus yesterday that "in the event of 
the Palestinian authority's entry into Gaza, we will reconsider 
the nature of military action there. But we will continue 
[military action] in the same manner in the West Bank, 
Jerusalem, and the 1948 territory." He added that military 
action will continue, "and we will not suspend it during the 
reconsideration period. The confrontation methods will be 
linked to the nature of the Israeli presence in the Strip." 
  He pointed out that the Jihad Movement does not object to 
"political moves in the Strip away from the self-rule authority 
and its institutions. We will push toward the broadest 
political movement possible, whose motive power is the jihad." 
  On the nature of the future relationship with Fatah and the 
administrative self-rule authority, al-Shaqaqi said that the 
"Jihad's" history is closely linked to Fatah. 
  He added: "There are personal ties between Fatah and Jihad 
sons. This personal relationship could become a channel through 
which to solve some of the problems" that may emerge between the 
two sides. 
  He pointed out that he has no "desire to fight over power. 
Nevertheless, the possibility of a confrontation exists. If 
they judge us because of our jihad against Israel, 
confrontations would occur between us." 
  On his opinion of the agreement to be signed today, the 
Jihad 
secretary general said that he considers "this day a danger in 
our history, and (Palestinian President Yasir) 'Arafat has sold 
his soul for the sake of his body and is trying to sell the 
Palestinian people's soul in return for their remaining alive 
politically."

<F P=106> [Interview with Anwar Haddam, exiled leader of the Islamic </F>
Salvation Front, by Gilles Millet in London; date not given: 
"Islamic Salvation Front Must Be Recognized as Political Party" 
-- first three paragraphs are LIBERATION introduction] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] We met in London with Anwar 
Haddam, one of the leaders of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) 
and an elected member of Parliament since 1991. Currently a 
refugee in the United States, he gave us his views on the 
prerequisites for a successful dialogue. 
  Like most exiled FIS leaders, Anwar Haddam finds it 
difficult 
to voice an opinion on the various actions perpetrated in 
Algeria by the armed islamic groups. While he confirms that 
assaults against police forces are indeed part of the strategy 
of fundamentalist leaders, his answers are much foggier when it 
comes to the murders of intellectuals, journalists, and 
anonymous civilians. He does condemn the killing of "innocent 
people." However, as he himself puts it, "we need to agree on 
the meaning of the word `innocent.'" In his opinion, 
"pseudo-intellectuals or pseudo-democrats for whom democracy 
ends where their failure begins" are not "innocent." In other 
words, they deserve being fundamentalist targets. 
  To a direct question on the murders of Algerian journalists, 
he answers: "I will not get into this. We suggested to our 
mujahidin brothers that they might hit on those who backed the 
coup. These are a group of extremist secularists who reject the 
choice of the Algerian people. It so happens that among them 
are a number of academics, journalists, politicians, 
soldiers..." And when the murders appear "dubious" to him, he 
rather expediently puts the blame on military security forces. 
  Millet: Algeria seems to be in a dead end. Do 
you think talks are still possible between the authorities and 
fundamentalists? 
  Haddam: From the very outset we have asked for a 
political solution to be found through serious negotiation. 
Trouble is, those who forcibly seized power have no clear 
policy on the matter. The FIS is a political party. Therefore, 
it was not ready to go into armed conflict. After the December 
1991 coup, we were faced with a new situation. This is why 
orders were given to people to organize locally and target all 
those who were illegally clinging to power, including security 
forces, which were supposed to preserve the institutions and 
respect the people's choice. We made good headway and the 
mujahidin (freedom fighters) now are an organized entity which 
will abide by FIS decisions in case of serious negotiations. 
  Millet: What do you mean by "serious negotiations"? 
  Haddam: We asked those currently in power to 
clarify their position. To begin with, they must acknowledge 
the fact that political authority may only spring from the 
choice of the people. Unelected, self-styled "decisionmakers" 
cannot play a part in the talks. Then they must agree to 
implement a genuine separation between the three powers: 
Parliament, the executive, and the judiciary. This means that 
we reject any encroachment on political power by the Armed 
Forces or intelligence services. Moreover, Algeria's 
sovereignty and unity must be preserved. Those in power should 
not be allowed to stir up trouble in areas such as Kabylia, for 
instance. These prerequisites tie in with another, basic one: 
All decisions made since the interruption of the democratic 
process must be repealed, including the ban on the FIS. The FIS 
must be recognized as a political party. 
  Millet: Does this mean that no real negotiations 
will take place as long as the authorities have not committed 
themselves to organizing elections? 
  Haddam: Indeed it does. Not only must the FIS' 
legitimacy be recognized, a formal statement must be issued with 
respect to the reactivation of the electoral process, and 
international assurances must be obtained, especially from 
France. And last but not least, all jailed islamists must be 
released. 
  Millet: Who has been or must be involved in the 
talks? 
  Haddam: The FIS, with the mujahidin's assent, 
decided that only Abassi Madani, the party's president, and Ali 
Belhadj, its vice president, are mandated to participate in 
potential negotiations with those in power. This is what 
happened. The talks have now ground to a halt because Zeroual 
(the president of the Republic) has his hands tied and therefore 
cannot recognize the FIS as a political party. [passage omitted] 
  Over 80 percent of combatants are now part of a single 
entity. We share the same objective and same strategy. Now, I 
do not intend to be more specific; nobody was mandated by the 
mujahidin to talk about their structures. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Muslim Extremist Group in Perugia, </F>
Police Says"] 
  [Text] Perugia, May 4 [ANSA] -- Anti-terrorist police units 
in this north-central town on Tuesday found two apartments which 
they said were probably being used as support bases for Algerian 
Muslim extremists of the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS]. 
  Police officials said about 15 people living in the two 
apartments have been placed under investigation for falsifying 
papers and receiving stolen goods after searches in the 
apartments revealed false passports and identity cards and an 
unspecified number of cellular telephones, car stereos, cameras 
and other electronic equipment. 
  Also confiscated were Arab language newspapers and FIS 
propaganda leaflets, as well as "dozens" of videocassettes 
showing people wearing ski-masks and demonstrating how to use a 
variety of weapons, police said. 
  The nationalities of those under investigation, most of them 
between the ages of 20 and 25, were not revealed but 
investigators said they did not believe the group was preparing 
any attacks or engaging in paramilitary training.

  [Excerpt] The AL-AHRAM AL-MASA'I correspondent has learned 
that the Egyptian security organs will contact U.S. authorities 
through Interpol to deport Dr. 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman, the mufti 
of the al- Jihad Organization in Egypt, following the ruling of 
the Higher State Security Court-Emergency yesterday sentencing 
him to seven years at hard labor. [see previous Terrorism Report] 
  A security source said that the necessary measures will be 
taken to deport the defendant on the basis of the court's 
ruling. He added that there is coordination with the concerned 
authorities in the United States because of the absence of an 
extradition treaty between the two countries. The security 
source also stressed to the paper's correspondent 'Adil 
al-Suruji that countries take into consideration bilateral 
relations and the principle of equal treatment in such important 
cases. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, 3 May (MENA)--Security forces in Asyut have 
found the body of a 25-year-old bearded man, wearing peasant's 
clothes on the eastern desert leading to Asyut. The body was 
riddled with bullets. 
  This was according to an Interior Ministry security source, 
who added that the security forces found the body lying near an 
automatic rifle bearing serial number 6245 and 12 bullets, one 
inside the rifle barrel, and 11 empty cartridge cases. They 
also discovered one plastic bag three meters away from the body 
and another ten meters away each containing 50 kg of TNT. 
  An unidentified person telephoned the Abnub police station 
and said that while he was driving on the desert road to Suhaj 
at 0300 today he saw people exchanging gunfire which forced him 
to quickly return to report the incident. He said the site was 
around two km south of the eastern approach to Asyut. 
  The security forces, the criminal laboratory experts, and 
the 
police moved to the area where they found scattered cases used 
for packing fruits, men's clothes dropped on the sand beside the 
road, and a small rug. 
  The public prosecution office has been informed and 
investigations are underway to identify the body. 
  The interior ministry will issue a statement later on the 
incident.

  [Text] The delegation of ambassadors of Islamic and Latin 
American countries, which concluded its four-day visit of Jammu 
and Kashmir, blamed Islamabad for aiding and abetting terrorism 
in Kashmir valley. Reports say that the ambassadors were 
convinced that Pakistan is behind terrorism in the state. The 
group has assessed that ordinary people in the state would like 
to see the end of violence and the situation brought back to 
normal. They were unhappy that the Hurriyyat Conference leaders 
changed the venue of the meeting at the last moment and that 
envoys could not meet them. However, the delegation was 
satisfied it could meet a cross section of the people. The 
delegation regretted that Amnesty International released its 
report on human rights situation in Punjab without going there, 
although it was permitted to send a team to the state.

  [Text] Major General Uri Sagi, the head of the IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] Intelligence Branch, has expressed the 
assessment that there will be a decline in terrorist attacks 
from the autonomous areas following the signing of the Cairo 
agreement. On the other hand, the number of terrorist attacks 
from other areas in the territories will rise. Maj. Gen. Sagi 
briefed the members of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense 
Committee today. Our correspondent Hadar Vismonsky reports: 
[begin recording] 
  Vismonsky: Twenty-four hours prior to the 
beginning of the IDF evacuation of the Gaza Strip and Jericho, 
Maj. Gen. Uri Sagi, the head of the IDF Intelligence Branch, 
presented his evaluations regarding the near future to the 
members of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. 
Sagi believes that the number of terrorist attacks within 
Israel originating from the Gaza Strip and Jericho and the 
attacks against settlers inside those areas will significantly 
decrease. On the other hand, Maj. Gen. Sagi expressed the 
assessment that the level of terrorism will rise in other areas 
of the territories where autonomy is not in effect. Sagi 
explained to the committee members that the PLO has an interest 
in keeping the security situation quiet and will therefore do 
everything to reduce the number of attacks in the areas under 
its control. 
  Maj. Gen. Sagi also commented on relations between the PLO 
and the rejectionist groups, Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement], and the Islamic Jihad. Sagi takes a positive view of 
the inclusion of Hamas representatives in the autonomy 
institutions as part of PLO efforts to prevent a Palestinian 
civil war. Sagi asserted that the PLO will attempt to prevent 
the murder of collaborators, noting that this phenomenon cannot 
be completely stopped. [end recording]

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report: "Fresh Arrests Among Jordanian Afghans"] </F>
  [Excerpt] The Jordanian security authorities are continuing 
their campaign of arrests against the ranks of the Jordanian 
Afghans. The campaign is starting to face strong resistance by 
some of the elements of these groups, who are using firearms. 
This unprecedented phenomenon signals an increase in the 
violence of these groups. 
  We have learned that the latest arrests have been 
concentrated in al-Rusayfah and al-Zarqa' towns and the 'Awjan 
area for the past two weeks. Officers and men, assisted by 
personnel from the special police force, carried out arrests and 
apprehended a great number of people from these groups, which 
are believed to have a connection with attempts to plague Jordan 
with terrorism. 
  According to a knowledgeable source, the campaign did not 
end 
peacefully. One of the suspects fired at a security officer, 
wounding him in the leg. 
  The latest arrests are apparently part of a series of 
measures to fight the establishment of terrorist organizations 
in the Kingdom financed from abroad. Jordan is taking rather 
harsh measures to contain the terrorist groups that have been 
formed recently. 
  AL-BILAD has recently noted a number of attempts on the 
world 
level, instigated by Israel, as well as other attempts sponsored 
by Arab businessmen, to brand Jordan with terrorism and 
implicate Amman in a never ending cycle of terror. 
  We begin in Denmark where big question marks are raised in 
connection with a fire at a residence of a Jordanian citizen who 
was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and currently resides in 
Denmark. According to well-informed sources, the Danish police 
arrested three Egyptians following the fire and investigated the 
possibility that the suspects are connected to the bombing of 
the World Trade Center [WTC]. Two of the arrested men were 
political refugees and the third holds Danish citizenship as 
well as Egyptian citizenship and currently resides in Denmark. 
  The three were accused of buying chemicals used to 
manufacture explosives similar to those used in the WTC bombing. 
The name of the Jordanian citizens, whose house was set on 
fire, has not been released. The Danish authorities' arrest of 
the three Egyptians is construed as having a link with the fire. 
[see 7 January Terrorism Report for initial arrest report] 
However, the incident created the impression, encouraged by the 
United States and Israel, that certain Jordanian nationals are 
involved in terrorism. 
  It goes without saying that for U.S. public opinion, the 
most 
sensitive act of terrorism is the bombing of the WTC in February 
of last year. According to Arab sources, active Israeli 
security bodies in Europe are now trying to invent false 
connections between Jordanians residing in Europe and Egyptians 
suspected of belonging to the al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah led by 
Shaykh 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman, currently detained in the United 
States. 
  Therefore, Jordan must prepare to confront a media war that 
is expected to be launched against it from Washington and 
European capitals on terrorism stories similar to the one we 
just related. 
  This war is not isolated from fears by certain Arab sources 
that the [Israeli intelligence service] Mosad is perhaps 
carrying out assassination attempts against Hamas members in 
Jordan. The aim is to create confusion in Jordan and disturb 
the security of the country and create a new climate of 
terrorist acts. 
  In short, Israel is endeavoring to drown Jordan in the 
maelstrom of terrorism and extremism in two ways: the first is 
by giving international public opinion the impression that the 
Jordanians have some sort of connection with acts of terrorism 
in Europe and the United States; and second, by threatening to 
carry out terrorist acts in Jordan itself and disturb the stable 
security conditions in the country. 
  Meanwhile, secret attempts by Arabs have also been revealed 
aimed at drowning Jordan in acts of terrorism by financing 
groups returning from Afghanistan. 
  As has already been mentioned, the first Arab involved in 
financing terror in Jordan was the Saudi businessman Usamah 
Bin-Ladin. Jordanian security investigations have already 
revealed that one of the leaders of the Jordanian Afghans, 
Zakariya Muhammad Dawud, traveled to Sanaa and met with Yemeni 
figures representing the financier, Bin-Ladin, who helped him 
join training camps. 
  Bin-Ladin finances large training camps of Arab Afghans, 
including quite a large number of Jordanians, in Sanaa with the 
aim of exporting terror to Jordan. 
  Jordan is exerting immense efforts to apprehend a Saudi 
merchant and arms smuggler by the name of Nasir Mashhur 
al-Ruwayli. Al- Ruwayli is considered one of the most dangerous 
drug traffickers and gun smugglers across Arab borders. He uses 
drug smuggling in striking arms deals and smuggling these arms 
to Arab states. 
  It is feared that this smuggler was involved in supplying 
weapons to extremist groups to carry out terrorist acts. 
Members of these groups in Jordan were arrested recently. 
  According to Arab sources, this smuggler is now charged with 
smuggling drugs and arms in many Arab states including Yemen, 
Algeria, and Egypt. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Text of a Dialogue" with Shaykh Na'im Qasim, deputy </F>
secretary general of Hizballah, by Faysal Jallul in Beirut; date 
not given] 
  [Excerpts] Jallul: Hizballah is at odds with the 
Lebanese State, and therefore, it has to either accept or reject 
it. It seems to us that your party has decided to adapt to the 
situation. This is clear because it did not respond to the 
al-Ghubayrah incident and because it takes part in parliamentary 
action and politics. 
  Qasim: Adaptation usually means a relinquishment 
of principles. This is wrong and unacceptable. Adherence to 
principles, however, does not necessarily mean a military clash 
with those with whom we differ. The West may want to promote 
the idea that any ideological and political difference with a 
party like ours will inevitably lead to a military clash. We in 
Lebanon have chosen the way of clashes with the Israeli enemy 
only. On the internal level, we believe that ideological and 
political differences should not lead to military clashes. We 
also still believe in the need to promote the Islamic trend and 
thought as the best alternative for the people. We offer our 
faith to others, share with them issues acceptable to us and 
them, explain our views on issues of dispute, and do not believe 
in the use of force to impose our will on others. 
  Therefore, we did not respond militarily to the 13 September 
massacre. Those who perpetrated the massacre wanted to draw us 
into an internal military conflict to justify the international 
security situation, confuse the party, and try to settle some 
scores under the pretext that our party opted for a military 
clash, especially with the Lebanese Army. 
  We did not respond militarily because we do not believe in 
the use of that method by any side and because we did not want 
to be drawn into others' plans whenever and wherever they 
wanted. We view the 13 September massacre as part of a plan to 
strike at the resistance, and not as a transitory issue designed 
to prevent a peaceful demonstration. [passage omitted] 
  Jallul: You are linked with Iran by spiritual and 
strategic ties, and you are linked with Syria by political 
relations on the ground. Do you not fear the risks of a 
collision between the two parties over the Middle East issue? 
  Qasim: [passage omitted] In our relations with 
Iran and Syria, we do not feel that Iranian-Syrian relations are 
contradictory, and we feel that we are in harmony with both 
parties. [passage omitted] 
  Jallul: Will you continue to fight Israel if it 
withdraws from Lebanon? 
  Qasim: We support the Palestinian people in 
defending their occupied territories because we regard this 
people as rightful. However, details of this support would be 
discussed at an appropriate time. [passage omitted] 
  Jallul: In your slogans you say that "Israel is a 
germ" and should be removed from the map. Let us suppose that 
the Lebanese state and Israel would sign an agreement for 
withdrawal from southern Lebanon. Would you continue to open 
fire on Israel across the Lebanese border? 
  Qasim: We will oppose any agreement that gives 
legitimacy to occupation which usurps lands. 
  Jallul: In Palestine or Lebanon? 
  Qasim: Anywhere in this occupied territory. 
Details on the way of dealing and on confrontation will be left 
for the future. 
  Jallul: Is the Iranian "Revolutionary Guard" 
playing a role in the confrontation you are waging with Israel? 
  Qasim: The Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard 
does not fight in southern Lebanon. However, it is known that 
some of its members are present in the al-Biqa' area; they play 
an educational and training role and do not participate in other 
matters. This is partly due to the Islamic leadership's 
attitude and partly due to the harmony among those concerned in 
the region. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sanaa, 3 May (INA)--A Yemeni Interior Ministry 
source today revealed the parties behind the criminal 
assassination attempt on the life of Hasan Muhammad Makki, the 
Yemeni first deputy prime minister, last Thursday. [see previous 
Terrorism Report] 
  In a statement tonight, the source said that preliminary 
investigations conducted by the competent authorities have 
proven the involvement of Shaykh Naji 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Shayif, 
who is member of the General Committee, which is the highest 
leadership at the General People's Congress [GPC], in the 
assassination attempt in which eight of his loyalists took part. 
  The source pointed out that the Yemeni authorities have 
failed to arrest Shaykh Naji al-Shayif because he and his 
loyalists fled the Yemeni capital, Sanna, on Monday.

  [Text] A third safe house belonging to Basque Fatherland 
and Liberty [ETA] has been found by the police in Barcelona. 
There were neither arms nor explosives in the apartment, 
because it was used as a hiding place for the members of the 
commando acting in Barcelona. 
  Meanwhile, in Zaragoza this evening bomb disposal experts of 
the security forces set off a car bomb. Over to our studios in 
Zaragoza, Manuel Segura, good evening. 
  Segura: Good evening. Toward 1745 bomb disposal 
experts belonging to the police force blew up a suspicious car 
parked near the crossing of the streets Escoriaza y Fabra and 
Santander in Zaragoza, near the Portillo railway station. 
  The car was a white Renault 5 with Barcelona number plate 
6095 MD. Police believe that it might be the car in which two 
women were seen with Felipe San Epifanio, alias Pipe, head of 
ETA's Barcelona commando. [see "Selected Video Reports" section

head, Felipe San Epifanio, alias Pipe, was arrested. 
  The Renault 5 which was blown up by the police this evening 
in Zaragoza was used by members of the Barcelona commando when

<F P=106> [Aitor Guenaga report: "ETA Announces New Attacks And </F>
Affirms: `We Will Win'"] 
  [Text] Bilbao -- The terrorist organization, ETA [Basque 
Fatherland and Liberty], yesterday claimed responsibility for 
the latest attacks, issuing a victorious statement via the daily 
newspaper EGIN far removed from defeatism. "We will win," 
assured the text published by the Guizpucoa newspaper. "The era 
of resistance, the doubts, and the false expectations" are all 
over, according to the armed gang. ETA defended the need to 
continue the attacks in order to achieve its oft-repeated goal: 
Basque independence. "We cannot keep on hoping, nor can we 
place our hopes in miracle solutions. We must obtain new 
results on the road to liberty through our daily struggle." 
  In the two-page press release, written entirely in Basque, 
ETA claimed responsibility for the attack which took the life of 
Civil Guard member Fernando Jimenez Pascual on 4 April in 
Bilbao. Similarly, it said it was responsible for the grenade 
attack carried out on 18 April against the Military Command in 
Barcelona, which cost the life of compatriot Vicente Beti 
Montesinos, who was close to the organization, and whose death, 
the terrorist gang said, was unfortunate. 
  Lastly, the group claimed that it set the devices which 
caused the 20 April explosion on the railroad line linking 
Madrid and Irun, as well as the action against a branch of the 
Caja Vital [bank] in Salvatierra (Alava). Herri Batasuna 
[United People] is waging a battle with that bank because of 
failure to pay a debt. 
  In addition to its triumphalist rhetoric, ETA made a wager 
on 
the unity of the nationalist left: "This is not the time to 
seek out differences, but to develop the issues and sectors in 
which we can work jointly at the same pace and with the same 
initiatives." However, he repeated his speech about the double 
model used for the Basque Country: the model of those who 
condemn the people to disappear, and the model "proposed by the 
nationalist left, which seeks a new society in an independent 
Euskal Herria [Basque Union]." 
<H5>  "Jabotxa" Still Being Detained </H5>
  In the meantime, the editor in chief of EGIN, Patxi Xabier 
Fernandez Monje, or "Jabotxa," who was taken into custody 
Saturday afternoon for his presumed links with ETA, was still in 
custody yesterday at the Indautin police station. Herri 
Batasuna's legal representative, Arantza Zulueta, went to Bilbao 
to defend him. On Saturday night, the police searched the 
dwelling of the EGIN editor without, apparently, taking 
anything, according to one of the newspaper's employees. 
  The detention of EGIN's editor in chief is linked to the 
open 
operation against ETA following the downfall last Thursday of 
the leader of the Barcelona commando and a former member of

  [Text] Bingol--Four Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] terrorists, 
who fled from that organization and surrendered to the security 
forces some time ago, have revealed that the PKK killed 
prominent and respected people in southeastern Turkey and then 
blamed the counter guerrilla organization for its crimes in 
order to provoke the people in the region. 
  The four terrorists surrendered to security forces near 
Bingol last week. Yesterday, they attended a meeting in the 
sports center in Solhan. One of them, whose alias is "Hayri", 
revealed that a former PKK member killed Vedat Aydin, a former 
head of the People's Toil Party organization, in Diyarbakir 
Province on 10 July 1992. He said: "The PKK blamed the counter 
guerrilla organization in order to provoke the people. I 
witnessed Semdin Sakik, head of the PKK organization in the 
region, instruct his men to kill 200 militants. I surrendered to 
the forces of the state after witnessing the merciless massacres 
by the PKK." 
  One of the other terrorists revealed he was an electronics 
expert. He said several militants took him to the mountains to 
work for the PKK in the electronics field. But he said he 
escaped at the first opportunity. He claimed that Semdin Sakik 
abandoned his men, leaving them in a miserable condition on the 
mountains, and went to France. The terrorist also revealed that 
a woman militant who joined the PKK in Istanbul wishes to leave 
the organization but is not allowed to do so. The repentant 
terrorist said: "I fled after witnessing the developments in 
that organization." 
  Kemal Iskender, director of police in Bingol; Staff Major 
Erguder Toptas; leading officials of several establishments; and 
a large group of people were at the sports center to hear the 
terrorists' revelations.

  [Text] Karlsruhe (DPA) -- A former official of the Workers 
Party of Kurdistan [PKK] was seriously injured by several shots 
fired at him in Krefeld on 2 May. According to statements made 
by the Federal Prosecutor's Office on 4 May, there is a 
suspicion that the crime was committed by members of a terrorist 
group within the PKK, because the 33-year-old victim intended to 
leave the Workers Party. 
  In June 1992, the Higher Regional Court in Celle sentenced 
the former high PKK official to a prison term of four years and 
two months for serious deprivation of liberty and dangerous 
injury. Meanwhile, he has served his prison term. The federal 
prosecutor general has asked the Federal Office of Criminal 
Investigation to conduct the investigations on the attack.

<F P=106> [Third of an unspecified number of installments of an </F>
"abridged" interview with Kurdish Workers Party, PKK, leader 
Abdullah Ocalan by correspondents Ertugrul Kurkcu, Ragip Duran, 
and Behcet Avsar in Barr Ilyas in Lebanon on 21 March] [Editor's 
note: OZGUR GUNDEM was closed after publishing the following.] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] 
  Question: Well, where does the solution rest then? 
  Ocalan: In a free democratic atmosphere! There 
should be an opportunity for the free exchange of views and 
political choice by removing the shadow of coercion. What I 
really mean is using the right of engaging in secure politics. 
If you guarantee this security throughout Turkey, I will have 
no other demands concerning the Kurdish problem. I want to 
engage in politics in an atmosphere in which arms are silent. 
This is a reasonable right. If you give the guarantee, then I 
will go in among the Kurds and Turks and engage in politics. If 
there is a real desire to end this war, I am all for it, really. 
And I will propose no preconditions regarding the Kurds' 
demands. Let the use of force be removed. Yes, to engage in 
free politics... 
  Question: I am pleased to hear this. I have an 
actor friend who knows nothing beyond the propaganda in the 
press. When I told him that "Apo [alias for Abdullah Ocalan] 
might be satisfied with entering the parliament as a deputy from 
Diyarbakir or might be satisfied only with forming his own 
party," he replied: "Is that all?" I just wanted to mention 
this. 
  Ocalan: Of course. This will require some 
negotiation. What I am saying is: Let us smooth these problems 
over. The use of political rights depends on particular 
guarantees. If I go there today, they will detain me and hang 
me tomorrow. The DEP [Democracy Party] was ostensibly given the 
right to engage in politics but now its members are facing 
execution on charges of being "traitors to the country." But I 
would want to engage in secure politics. I will seek security 
in the Constitution and the law. Not satisfied with that, I 
will ask for particular institutional measures. Being a 
democrat, I believe in a Kurdish identity. I will address the 
people with this identity of mine. This should have a place in 
the law. Let us make the necessary changes. Why should you 
[the Turks] impose your own arrangements on me by unilaterally 
denying everything that defines me? Will anything remain of 
democracy if you act like that? In the context of democracy 
there should be Kurdish parties and social and political 
institutions. There are lots of local problems to be tackled. 
So there will be local administrations. There will be local 
parliaments. But there are also things to be tackled together 
with the Turks. We will carry out joint government and 
parliamentary work. Some do not want to understand this. Let 
them come to me. I will explain all this in one go. I did not 
attend the law faculty but I can show them how to do what. I am 
looking for a counterpart. Let anyone with confidence in 
himself come here so that we can rearrange all these things 
within the context of Turkey's unity and territorial integrity. 
  Question: Who do you want? Who will we bring to 
you? 
  Ocalan: Anyone. I am even ready for an ordinary 
civil servant. Let him come so that heeding the people's voice, 
we can stop this conflict and usher in freedom of thought and 
particular political choices away from the shadow of arms. No 
one is avoiding this. I am ready to open a debate about 
particular and very modest democratic demands. I am asking you: 
Do you have such a counterpart for me? 
  Question: They do not respect me, otherwise I 
would have come to the talks. I do not know if those higher up 
would. But what clear-cut communal and political projects is the 
PKK offering for the meaningful, democratic, free, peaceful, and 
stable solution of this problem? 
  Ocalan: We want to reorganize the historic 
Turkish-Kurdish relations. History shows these relations. They 
began under Sultan Selcuk and peaked under Sultan Yavuz. They 
also form the foundation of the Republic established by Mustafa 
Kemal. These relations must be admitted first. We want to 
surmount the blind policy of violence, which is against the 
interests of the Kurdish people and goes as far as to deny all 
its national democratic demands and identity and even 
annihilates it. The following are some of the fundamental 
principles needed to surmount the current policy: (1) The 
recognition of Kurdish-Turkish relations. (2) The suspension of 
the policy of violence against and the assimilation of the 
Kurds, that is, the erosion of the Kurdish identity. (3) I am 
saying that alongside the institutions suitable for each 
people's national identity, there is a need to make a transition 
to a system of federal parliament and government based on 
partnership institutions, that is, to put it more concretely, 
based on local, or perhaps federal, parliaments and governments. 
This is the most concrete path to a solution that we could 
advance: the revision of all relations and the recognition of 
the need for reorganization, not under the shadow of arms or 
pressure, but based on complete free will. If this is accepted, 
then there could be an easy movement toward reorganization 
within Turkey's existing borders and based on the genuine free 
will of the two peoples, which would forge a stronger fraternity 
than the current one. This is possible without too much 
fighting. I believe in this but I have no counterpart. 
  Question: You spoke against the use of force, 
assimilation, and the threat of arms but primarily the General 
Staff and an important section of the public accuse you and your 
party of using violence and of committing savagery and 
massacres. So while you declare your opposition to violence, 
your party is being accused of practicing such things. Is there 
not a contradiction here? 
  Ocalan: Before asking me that, you should have 
read this [not further specified; however, Ocalan appears to be 
referring to a paper in his hand]. Do I have to read it for 
you? We announced the names of those killed during the shelling 
of Gabar, Sirnak, and Soke. Their birthplaces were also given. 
Some 16 people were listed. We also obtained the names and 
dates of birth of the villagers killed in the village of Ziver 
in the district of Eruh during the shelling. The number killed 
here was 23. Over 50 villagers were killed in shelling on 
election day alone. Their names are known. I am not 
exaggerating their number. The press did not mention these 
facts. So who is committing the savagery? Don't they claim 
that children are being killed? Go and check their age. You 
should be realistic. When women and children get killed and it 
is beyond our control, when angry young people place bombs here 
and there, you cannot describe this as PKK tactics. We are 
trying to prevent such action. If we do not prevent such action 
the streets might turn into a hell. We are very attached to the 
principles of humanism and war conventions. It is the General 
Staff that is not doing what is needed on this issue. 
  Question: When do you hope to see the realization 
of your ideal of the "recognition of the Kurds' political, 
cultural, and historic rights and of your return to Turkey to 
represent your people on a legal platform?" 
  Ocalan: [passage omitted] It is my ideal to be 
engaged in politics amid my people, even in Turkey. I am not 
devoted to conducting a policy with the use of arms. I have no 
intention of putting my neck out like a sheep if I am given no 
alternative but execution. I will defend myself to the end with 
whatever means I can find in any corner of the world. It is 
obvious that the defense of my own person is linked with the 
defense of my own people and party. Why am I doing all these 
things? I am doing them so as to engage in politics. I have no 
desire for violence for the sake of it. We have political goals 
and national and democratic demands and I want to put them into 
practice. It is the Turkish regime that does not grasp this. 
Let this regime express a bit of goodwill to solve the 
problems. Let it assign a counterpart to talks with us. Here 
my presence is not a condition. Let those counterparts who 
could solve this problem come together. Let us both [PKK and 
Turkish Government] support them. What is needed is for both 
sides to display goodwill. I reiterate: I am ready to display 
my goodwill to the end. But at the same time I will never allow 
the suppression, certainly not the denial, of a people's 
national democratic demands. If need be I can use ruthless 
violence for this purpose or act like the most democratic 
politician to fulfill these same duties.
