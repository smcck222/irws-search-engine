  [Text] Tokyo, May 13 KYODO -- A Turkish Airlines flight 
from Tokyo made an emergency landing in Moscow earlier this 
month after the Turkish Embassy in Tokyo received a message 
threatening to blow up the flight en route to Istanbul, police 
said Friday [13 May]. 
  According to police and airline officials, the message was 
received at the embassy by facsimile on May 5 at 2:45 P.M. from 
a group which identified itself as a Kurdish liberation 
organization. 
  The message, typed in English, said that TK Flight 593 would 
be blown up at 0500 GMT the same day, or 2 P.M. Japan time, and 
the blame would be shouldered by the governments of Turkey and 
Japan, the sources said. 
  The fax did not display the telephone number nor the name of 
the country where the message originated, police said. 
  The jetliner was flying over Siberia and was contacted by 
the 
airline's office, which had been informed by the embassy. 
  The plane made an emergency landing in Moscow and a search 
of 
the interior and luggage was made. Nothing suspicious was 
discovered and the flight continued to Istanbul.

<F P=106> [Interview with Charles Pellegrini, former head of the </F>
Central Criminal Repression Agency, by Christophe Gautier; place 
and date not given: "Charles Pellegrini: `The Islamic 
Salvation Front Has No Formal Structure and Operates Through 
Zones of Influence'" -- first paragraph is LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS 
introduction] 
  [Text] Charles Pellegrini, former head of the OCRB [Central 
Criminal Repression Agency] and a major expert on issues 
relating to the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front], believes that the 
fundamentalist threat is "the worst enemy France has ever had to 
fight." 
  Gautier: Is France the FIS' backline base? 
  Pellegrini: It obviously is. All Western 
countries close to Algeria, especially Spain, France, and Italy, 
may be considered as FIS backline bases. 
  Gautier: How has the FIS established itself in 
France? 
  Pellegrini: The FIS relies on various 
organizations, usually mosques and associations. Today, the FIS 
enjoys strong support networks made up of first-generation 
immigrants, but also second- or third-generation ones. The FIS 
has three funding sources. First of all, black market that is 
going on on both sides of the Mediterranean. Second, we have 
drug dealing. Whole families peddle drugs in suburban housing 
developments. Part of the considerable amounts of money 
involved flows to the FIS. Last, fundamentalists fund their 
activities through a "revolutionary tax," a well organized 
racket scheme. 
  Gautier: Has the FIS a formal structure in France? 
  Pellegrini: No, it has no such structure, it has 
no such thing as a clandestine leader who would control all its 
actions. The way the FIS tends to operate is through zones of 
influence. We are faced with small and independent groups which 
support small groups in Algeria. 
  Gautier: What can happen with the FIS established 
in France? 
  Pellegrini: I am very pessimistic about it. 
Affairs such as that of the arms smuggler arrested on Friday, 
or that of Lille, where 1,000 forged administrative documents 
were found, indicate that there may actually be logistical bases 
on the national territory. This is not a good sign. I think 
two kinds of violent acts may start spreading: to begin with, 
attacks against French interests, and then, of course, a real 
guerilla war between FIS supporters and opponents. 
  Gautier: Is there a danger for France? 
  Pellegrini: The Interior Ministry has correctly 
evaluated the problem. However, I remain convinced that we need 
to step up measures against the FIS in France. The FIS is very 
dangerous for us because these people are fanatics, they are 
very close to us geographically, and they are quite numerous.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- Japanese police will transfer 
their internationally-acclaimed, security-boosting techniques to 
their Mexican counterparts in a 13-day seminar to start in 
Mexico City on May 25, National Police Agency (NPA) officials 
said Monday [9 May]. 
  The NPA decided to comply with a Mexican Government request 
to dispatch nine experts on measures to counter the threats from 
terrorists, drug traffickers and gangsters to society, NPA 
officials said. 
  The Mexican request was conveyed to the Japanese police by 
Mexican Deputy Security Minister Socorro Diaz Palacios, who paid 
an official visit to Tokyo last November, the officials said. 
  Palacios voiced interest in acquiring Japanese police 
techniques credited with maintaining the security standards of 
the Japanese society renowned for its low ratio of the breakout 
of violent crimes, they said. 
  The Mexican Government will shoulder the budgetary outlays 
to 
fund the travel costs of all nine Japanese experts unlike the 
previous similar cases of international cooperation, in which 
Japanese police sent its experts to other developing countries.

  [Excerpts] Police authorities in the Autonomous Region in 
Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) have recommended to higher police 
headquarters the launching of an all out offensive against the 
extremists Abu Sayyaf group, Mindanao's most dreaded terrorist 
band. The recommendation was issued by ARMM Police regional 
director chief Supt. Magingin Magomnang after receiving reports 
Wednesday from Sulu Police provincial director Supt. Aukasa 
Handa. 
  Magomnang called a command conference Wednesday at Camp S.K. 
Pendatun in Parang, Maguindanao. It was his first meeting with 
his subordinates this year. Both Magomnang and Handa said that 
the number of the fundamentalist group is increasing and a 
massive police action should be taken against them before they 
can harm people with their terroristic activities. ``I am 
considering Abu Sayyaf group as a threat,'' Handa told 
reporters. ``I am recommending to higher headquarters that 
police action should be taken against this group.'' The Abu 
Sayyaf, a fundamentalist group that originated in Basilan 
province, is composed of 80 to 100 fully armed members. 
  Denying the group had just received arms shipment from 
nearby 
countries, Handa said the Abu Sayyaf, led by Abdulradjak 
Janjalani, is armed with several 90 recoilless rifles, B-57, 
mortars, M-60 and M-50 machineguns and assorted high powered 
firearms. The group was tagged by military and police 
authorities as responsible in several criminal activities such 
as kidnapping and bombings in Mindanao. It was also believed to 
be responsible in the Davao Cathedral bombing last December 26 
which killed six church-goers and wounded 150 others. 
  Authorities also identified the extremist group as 
responsible in the kidnapping of language researcher Charles 
Walton, shipyard owner Ricardo Tong of Zamboanga City, 
missionary priest Bernardo Blanco, Spanish nuns in Sulu and 
several businessmen in the Zamboanga archipelago. 
  ``The Abu Sayyaf is really a threat in the area, 
particularly 
in Sulu, but we have some precautionary measures that can take 
care of this group,'' Magomnang said in a press conference. He 
said he will tak to PNP chief Dir. General Umberto Rodriguez and 
Chief of Staff Gen Lisandro Abadia for a joint police and 
military action against Abu Sayyaf. Magomnang also reported that 
he already had a talk with several Moro National Liberation 
Front (MNLF) commanders in Sulu to cooperate with the police in 
pursuing the fundamentalist group. 
  Handa stressed that the Abu Sayyaf is not yet capable of 
destabilizing Mindanao. Abadia, during his Mindanao visit last 
month, said Abu Sayyaf cannot destabilize the region but 
admitted that they can create trouble and terrorize people. 
[passage omitted] 
  Admitting terrorism is difficult to address, Abadia vowed to 
neutralize the group in due time. Magomnang said the police has 
already identified the base of Abu Sayyaf in Sulu and will 
strike anytime when the ``go signal'' is issued. Aside from 
Basilan, Handa said the Abu Sayyaf is concentrated in Patikul, 
Sulu.

  [Text] Tirana, May 10 (ATA) -- Yesterday morning an 
explosion occurred in the house of Nebil Cika, editor-in-chief 
of the weekly local newspaper SARANDA, as a result of which only 
some material damages were caused, ATA correspondent in Sarande 
reported. 
  This is the second explosion after the first one on March 3 
which also resulted only in material damage. The SARANDA 
newspaper, directed by Mr. Cika and published in Sarande, 
opposes the policy of Greek chauvinistic circles in regard to 
the southern part of Albania, which they call North Epirus. An 
article published recently in the SARANDA dwelt on question of 
the Albanian population forcibly transferred from Cameria, an 
Albanian province given to Greece by the 1913 Conference of 
Ambassadors. The Greek andarts [as received] have committed 
massacres in Cameria after the First and Second World Wars, 
which are still alive in the memories of the inhabitants of this 
region.

<F P=106> ["ajk"-signed report: "Organized Crime Will Grow This Year"] </F>
  [Text] People will be exposed to even more pressure from 
organized crime this year than they have been hitherto, and 
especially in the fields of narcotics, embezzlement, illegal 
waste management, smuggling, and money laundering. The 
government has informed the deputies about this in its report on 
the security situation for 1993. 
  Klaus's cabinet did not register any direct signal last year 
concerning terrorist activity being prepared against Czech 
citizens, foreigners, or objects in the republic. Some time 
ago, however, Stanislav Devaty, head of the Security Information 
Service, communicated exactly the opposite to the deputies of 
the left-wing parties in the Chamber. According to the findings 
of the secret service, terrorist groups were preparing to attack 
these politicians. 
  Although the government does not expect any direct military 
or any other external threat to the republic, it does expect 
terrorist actions here because of the political development in 
former Yugoslavia. 
  It is particularly because of the constantly deepening 
conflicts between ethnic groups and religious cultures in 
Africa, in the Middle and Far East that there are risks that 
might threaten our security in the future, the report reads. 
  The report also discloses that in 1993 not only did the 
number of crimes committed increase from 350,000 to 400,000, but 
the violence of the perpetrators is also growing, and they are 
more frequently using firearms. The Interior Ministry wants, 
therefore, to enable citizens who are concerned about their 
property or can prove to the police that their health or lives 
are threatened to obtain handguns through a law on arms and 
ammunition.

  [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 13 May (NA) -- A tear gas grenade 
exploded this morning in the Rio de La Plata Building, where the 
Japanese Embassy has its offices, in repudiation of the Japanese 
refusal to grant a visa to soccer star Diego Maradona. Three 
people were injured. 
  The explosion occurred just after 0830 [1130 GMT] when 
embassy employees opened the door to the offices on the 9th 
floor. 
  According to Alberto Crescenti, director general of the SAME 
[expansion unknown], the explosion at Paseo Colon 279 caused eye 
problems and suffocation to the following: Roberto Blanco; 
Carlos Catalano, 23; and Andrea Vousou, 22. 
  The three were quickly taken by ambulance to the Algerich 
Hospital in La Boca District where it was determined that their 
injuries were not serious. 
  Pamphlets with the slogan "Down with Japan, lay off 
Maradona," of the Revolutionary Organization (ORP) were found in 
the building. This shows that the attack was in reprisal to the 
Japanese Government decision to not grant Maradona a visa. 
[passage omitted] 
  One employee told NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS: "It is all very 
strange because the building has a contracted security 
organization in addition to the embassy security guard. Thus it 
is very difficult to understand how the grenade could have been 
planted in the building." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Medellin, Colombia, 8 May (AFP) -- Following the 
confiscation of explosives and ammunition and the arrest of 12 
insurgents this Saturday in Medellin, Colombian Army and secret 
police foiled a guerrilla plot to sabotage the approaching 29 
May presidential elections. 
  The Medellin military command gave the details of this 
Sunday's joint operation -- which they described as effective -- 
against possible sabotage of the electoral process. The command 
also announced the arrest of the leader of the FARC 
[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia] Bolivarian Militia's 
urban group and 11 other rebels. 
  The operation resulted in the seizure of 200 kg of dynamite, 
19 16-caliber cartridges, five rolls of slow-burning fuse, and 
882 9-mm bullets during a raid on a house in northeastern 
Medellin, Colombia's second largest city. 
  Military sources have indicated that operations against FARC 
groups in the Medellin urban area are directed at preventing 
disruptions such as those that occurred during the 13 March 
legislative elections. 
  The same sources also reported that there was significant 
property damage but no casualties during the March terrorist 
attacks against political party headquarters and the Venezuelan 
consulate in Medellin. 
  The authorities stressed this Sunday that they intend to 
continue the operations against subversives and explained that 
the arrest of 12 Bolivarian Militia members and the seizure of 
war material followed 90 days of investigations and intelligence 
work.

  [Text] Joaquin Villalobos and deputies Guadalupe Martinez 
and Eduardo Sancho, members of the People's Revitalizing 
Expression [ERP] and National Resistance [RN] factions of the 
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front [FMLN], yesterday 
downplayed the alleged death threats issued by a ghost group. 
  The threats were made on Thursday night through a communique 
signed by the Salvadoran Revolutionary Front [FRS] and read on 
several radio stations. In the communique the FRS threatened to 
kill Villalobos, Martinez, and Sancho, whom it accuses of being 
"traitors to the revolution and to the spirit of the peace 
agreements." [see previous Terrorism Report for threat text] 
  According to the report, these leaders disregarded 
directives 
issued by the FMLN Directorate, resulting in division within the 
ranks of the former guerrilla organization. Martinez and Sancho 
accepted seats in the Salvadoran National Assembly Directorate, 
and five other deputies supported the candidacy of current 
Assembly President Gloria Salguero Gross. This decision created 
heated friction between 21 colleagues who won seats in the 
Assembly. 
  "I do not worry about anonymous threats; they are the result 
of the opportunity created by discrepancies within the FMLN," 
Villalobos said. The former guerrilla fighter denied that the 
charges are sponsored by members of parties that are annoyed 
with the RN and the ERP -- the Communist Party of El Salvador 
(PCES), the Farabundo Marti People's Liberation Forces (FPL), 
and the Revolutionary Party of Central American Workers (PRTC). 
  Nevertheless, he accused these groups of having discussions 
with the left in a "fanatical" way that may provoke violent 
actions. Villalobos, leader of what is now considered the social 
democratic current in the FMLN, stated that the communique might 
be the work of extremist left- or right-wing groups that 
"disagree with the debate currently under way." Villalobos 
issued an appeal to leading FMLN groups, urging them to stop 
signing newspaper communiques that predict expulsions and 
sanctions characterized by what he termed "fanatical attitudes." 
  Meanwhile, Deputies Ana Guadalupe Martinez and Eduardo 
Sancho 
said they are not afraid of their former comrades in arms and 
they consider the threats to be part of a psychological campaign 
launched by radical left- or right-wing groups. 
  Martinez considers an assassination at this point to be out 
of the democratic context that prevails in the country, saying: 
"I hope only a small group wrote the communique and published it 
in the media. If an assassination occurs, we would be returning 
to the past." 
  Referring to this, Legislative Assembly President Gloria 
Salguero Gross asked the FMLN to unite, work in harmony, and 
legislate in favor of the people. The deputy asked the people 
who sent the communique to "reflect," because "violence is no 
longer an option." 
  A similar statement was issued by Deputy Gerardo Suvillaga, 
who condemned the manifesto from the self-styled FRS, and he 
asked the FMLN to settle its disputes. Meanwhile, Defense 
Minister Humberto Corado said the anonymous communiques are not 
consistent with the new political reality, because "there are 
opportunities for any tendency to publicly state its position."

  [Text] Following orders imparted about a month ago by Oscar 
Alberto Ramirez Durand -- now known by his followers as 
"President Feliciano" -- members of the self-styled "Red Path" 
dissident SL [Shining Path] faction have implemented a plan that 
seeks to recover their strategic balance. 
  As is well known, this strategic balance was lost with 
Abimael Guzman's fall and with the disruption of the leaderships 
of the central, permanent, and political committees that were in 
charge of leading the subversive war. 
  This is the conclusion of a report drafted by intelligence 
analysts and strategists, after talking with SL members at the 
grassroots and leadership levels who have resorted to the 
Repentance Law and who are now important collaborators in the 
struggle against narcoterrorism. 
  Opposed to Gonzalo's [Abimael Guzman's] leadership, "Red 
Path" is made up of groups that have been acting independently 
for several years with the support of narcotraffickers located 
in the coca-growing corridor established in the jungle area 
going from Amazonas to La Convencion (Cusco), and more recently 
part of Madre de Dios (Manu). 
  Based on confessions made by repentant SL members, it has 
been established the "Red Path" is striving to reactivate seven 
areas in the outskirts of Lima that before Guzman's fall were 
controlled by SL and were considered red areas (zonas rojas). 
Area residents were constantly harassed, and did not dare to 
erase the so-called "people's bulletin boards" (subversive 
graffiti). And even less to report them, despite knowing who 
they were. 
  These areas were El Carmen, Collique, and Ano Nuevo (Comas); 
the former Bocanegra ranch (Callao); the San Cosme, El Pino, El 
Agustino (La Victoria), and Canto Grande (San Juan de 
Lurigancho) hills; Sectors 1 and 4 (Villa El Salvador); 
Huachipa, Ate-Vitarte (Central Highway); and Villa Maria del 
Triunfo and San Juan de Miraflores, which form a single bloc. 
This is where the Red Path faction members want to return. 
  Repentant SL leaders who have presented themselves at the 
303d Battalion at the Huallaga Front and at other barracks 
throughout the country have reported that Ramirez Durand, taking 
partial advantage of the campaign against the Army in view of 
alleged human rights violations, is trying to prevent a vast 
sector of Lima shantytown residents and some peasant communities 
from identifying themselves with the democratic system of 
government and the democratic state. 
  To do that, an effort would be made in those sectors -- 
named 
the masses by Ramirez Durand -- to create a generalized 
environment of insecurity and fear of the Armed Forces. 
Therefore, distorted cases of human rights violations have been 
reported, such as the report that the Army was bombing towns 
which were in reality a few shacks used by coca growers and drug 
traffickers as refuge. 
  He also ordered -- we saw that in the last few weeks, said 
the repented subversives -- the intimidation and murder of 
popular leaders in the settlements, in order to gradually take 
over the positions of leadership so as to be able to take 
control over the population. 
  He also wants to get a number of rural settlements in the 
Lima area to passively accept the now-called "Red Path," as 
happened in the past with the SL. 
  The repented subversives said that Ramirez Durand's 
recommendations include the reactivation of popular theaters and 
folk music groups, and the infiltration of work centers, 
especially in the factories located on the central highway where 
a few years ago, on orders from Abimael Guzman, anti-SL union 
leaders and executives were murdered. 
  In this regard, intelligence sources indicated that the SL 
members who had infiltrated some factories -- and who after 
Abimael Guzman was captured, have been keeping a low profile -- 
would again become active in planning to take over the unions 
and create chaos. 
  According to political analysts, what Ramirez Durand does 
not 
seem to understand is that it is only possible to reach a 
strategic equilibrium before the turning point of the war, and 
never after. 
  In other words, when the struggle is on its way to victory, 
and never, as it is happening with the Shining Path, when it is 
obviously on its way to defeat. 
  The experts say that no matter how many attacks are carried 
out by terrorism, they will not frighten the population and will 
under no circumstances win their support, as according to the 
latest surveys made by intelligence circles the people who 
migrated from the subversive areas reject the subversive 
ideology. 
  For example, the recent murder of boxer Carlos Lavalle 
Gonzales and other leaders has only created greater repudiation 
of the Shining Path. 
  In view of a new offensive, intelligence strategists 
recommend the reinforcement of the self-defense committees in 
the outskirts of Lima, with the support of the Armed Forces. 
  The analysts believe that the reinforcement of the urban 
defense patrols and night watches, and a better rapprochement 
with political and military authorities, will help reject any 
maneuver aimed against the democratic system. Now, in contrast 
with the past, the state and society have shown they are capable 
of defeating subversion.

  [Excerpt] Analysts in the Peruvian security forces have 
concluded that the new Shining Path (SL) Central Committee, 
which is headed by dissident Alberto Ramirez Duran, aka 
"Feliciano," has decided to reorganize the party to resume the 
so-called "people's war." 
  The key steps toward this objectives are: a) resume "work 
with the masses" (especially in poor Lima neighborhoods); b) 
step up military actions; c) strengthen compartmentalization 
(cell organization) at all levels; and d) enhance underground 
security. 
  The main objective is to move ahead with the so-called Sixth 
Grand Plan, whose implementation stopped suddenly in September 
1992 when Abimael Guzman was captured. 
  In simple words, "Feliciano's" SL faction intends to 
continue 
terrorist operations, openly disregarding Guzman's instructions 
to his followers -- who have paid no attention so far -- to 
cease violent actions in the quest for a peace agreement with 
the government. 
  Above and beyond the feverish fantasies of SL's current 
leadership, the organization no longer poses an imminent threat 
for the Peruvian state. The analysts believe that SL's decay is 
irreversible, although it is not going to be a short-term 
process. The experts indicated that the final battle against the 
terrorist organization is nowhere in sight yet, and it would be 
imprudent to lower guard. 
  According to information this newspaper and Dincote 
[National 
Counterterrorism Directorate] gathered in Lima suburbs, for some 
time now the SL has been infiltrating many shantytowns, 
settlements, cooperative urban developments, and the 
multitudinous Lima marketplaces. This infiltration is simply 
part of the "work with the masses" aimed at rebuilding cadres. 
  The murder of neighborhood leader and street vendor Benito 
Escalante Apaza on 29 April, near La Parada in the La Victoria 
district, was followed by the murder of national boxing champion 
Carlos Lavalle, a much-liked former leader of the Felix Raucarte 
Housing Cooperative in Ate-Vitarte. Dincote found out that 
Lavalle was killed by an SL annihilation squad, and that 
Escalante Apaza used to be a leader of the Manuel Scorza 
settlement in San Juan de Lurigancho. 
  Dincote also found out that SL militants killed two 
residents 
of the Santa Eulalia district (Huarochiri Province), near 
Chosica, early on 28 April. The victims were accused of 
stealing cattle. The police explained that terrorists seek to 
win the residents' trust and support by punishing criminals.

  [Text] Oscar Alberto Ramirez Durand, who for some time now 
has been known as "President Feliciano" by those who currently 
reject Abimael Guzman Reynoso's leadership, has reportedly 
simultaneously ordered an increase in Shining Path [SL] actions 
in Lima and the transfer of SL bases and refuge areas to border 
regions, so as to expedite SL escape abroad in case of possible 
defeat. 
  This is according to an intelligence report based on 
statements made by Shining Path members who have resorted to the 
repentance law and who have been in contact with Ramirez 
Durand's lieutenants. 
  There are indications that a few months ago "Feliciano" 
tried 
to meet with terrorist cadres operating as "roving" columns in 
Azangaro and Melgar, in Puno. There is also, however, testimony 
that Ramirez Durand is currently in the Gran Pajonal jungle area 
in Pasco. Another theory states that he is in Lima, personally 
heading the so-called "Neighborhood Class Movement" [Movimiento 
Clasista Barrial] in Lima shantytowns. 
  The fact is that a so-called "Emergency Central Committee" 
has started to operate in Lima. This committee seeks to 
coordinate actions in seven areas in the outskirts of Lima, in 
the same places where the establishment of an "iron belt" was 
attempted, before Abimael Guzman's fall, to strangle and take 
over the city. 
  Ramirez Durand reportedly has a contingent of about 200 SL 
members called the "People's Guerrilla Army" [Ejercito 
Guerrillero Popular]. They are armed, and the majority of them 
have been selected for their "loyalty" and for having shown 
cruelty and the capacity to strictly follow "orders." 
  They are like robots, willing to sacrifice themselves for 
"Feliciano," who holds complete control over them. Only a few 
of them personally know him, however. 
  Intelligence souces report that "what they ignore is that 
Ramirez Durand will employ the `sausage' [salchichon] policy 
against them: When he sees he has lost, he will leave them 
behind as cannon fodder [carne de canon] to cover his withdrawal. 
  They will be grouped in platoons to divert attention or to 
halt the Army's advance so that "Feliciano" can escape to the 
"refuge" areas.

  [Excerpt] A Huallaga Front patrol yesterday captured a 
Shining Path leader. He is providing valuable information about 
the whereabouts of the "Red Sea" terrorist battalion. This 
group was located in the Yanajanca valley and surrounding areas. 
The arrested terrorists is also giving information on the 
location of a hideout used by high-ranking Shining path 
political and logistic commanders. 
  The wounded terrorist was identified as Ely Puertas 
Dominguez, alias comrade "John." Yesterday, his right arm was 
operated on for the third time. He is recovering well at the 
intensive care unit of the Tingo Maria hospital. 
  Puertas told EXPRESO that the "Red Sea" battalion has nearly 
300 members, most of whom are civilians recruited by force. 
Each column is made up of 50 individuals. "There were 25 
individuals in my column, but our ranks increased to 45 after we 
recruited inhabitants from a local settlement with death 
threats. Many of them were taken from their homes naked and by 
force." 
  Puertas revealed that there is a group of hired killers in 
the "Red Sea" battalion and that they are responsible for 
murdering the families of members who run away. 
  The arrested terrorist said Shining Path members are hungry 
and thirsty because they do not have food. 
  Puertas said: "The fighters only eat yucca and bananas. Many 
of them are weak, sick with tuberculosis. They want to leave 
but are unable to do so because their lives and the lives of 
their families are at risk." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Military analysts agree that an armed confrontation 
between Shining Path [SL] and the MRTA [Tupac Amaru 
Revolutionary Movement] is "in the making" in the jungle area of 
Junin Department. The analysts added that under the present 
circumstances there is bound to be a struggle for the control of 
drug trafficking areas in Padre Abad, Ucayali; Oxapampa and Gran 
Pajonal in the Pasco jungle; and in Chachamayo and Satipo in the 
jungle area of Junin Department. 
  The analysts explained that it is essential for the two 
extremist organizations to keep their control over coca-growing 
areas, because that is where their dollars come from. This 
income ensures the survival of the two armed groups, and keeps 
them ready for combat. 
  The experts, however, pointed out a significant difference 
between the two groups. 
  The information obtained from a repentant indicated that SL 
leaders keep resources and funds under tight control, and issue 
to their men rations that keep them hungry. SL extremists are 
poorly fed, and get the same food ration for months. 
  "Jairo," one of the first repentants who surrendered at the 
Mazamari military base two years ago, made this decision because 
he was tired of the rampant corruption among the leaders. 
  According to "Jairo" the "lower ranks" ate corn mash while 
the leaders ate canned food and drank whisky which they obtained 
from drug traffickers in the jungle area of San Francisco, 
Ayacucho Department. 
  The internal situation of the MRTA is different. The MRTA 
pays salaries to its militants to stop them from running away, 
which turns them into paid mercenaries. 
  Thus, the two groups clearly rely on support from drug 
traffickers, but there is a difference between them. The MRTA 
structure seems to be more fragile: As soon as the flow of drug 
money is cut the organization will collapse, because the 
combatants would refuse to fight if there is no booty to share. 
  The SL is probably not as dependent on drug money because 
the 
leaders can actually force the soldiers to fight, but the 
involvement is much more deeply rooted. The SL is seriously 
jeopardized by the way in which drugs and drug money have 
corrupted its political and military leaders, who some time ago 
used to take pride in their austerity. 
  According to the sources, when SL militants showed up in 
Padre Abad, fleeing after the defeat of the Mar Rojo battalion 
on the banks of the Huallaga River, and joined other SL forces 
in the province, the MRTA started having problems, and must now 
unleash a sustained offensive. 
  The analysts even predicted that the MRTA will oust the SL 
from Padre Abad Province and will take over SL hideouts in the 
region. The analysts also announced that the MRTA will try to do 
the same thing in Oxapampa and Gran Pajonal, in the jungle area 
of Pasco, where the MRTA has a platoon (one platoon has between 
20 and 30 men), and in Pichis Palcazu. 
  Another MRTA platoon operating in the area attacked a convoy 
with draftees near Villa Rica a few days ago. 
  The analysts explained, however, that the largest MRTA 
contingent is operating in Satiop, Perene, and Parihuanca in the 
jungle area of Junin Department. There the MRTA has three 
well-armed platoons that have been stopping and robbing vehicles 
along the Marginal Highway, and killing people. 
  It would seem that these groups manage to blend with the 
local population after their raids. 
  The analysts confirm that the MRTA apparently managed to set 
up an operation in Huancayo to push out the SL, which was again 
trying to extort money from farmers. 
  In fact, on 26 April the MRTA called a two-day "armed 
strike" 
in three jungle provinces, according to information received. 
The Huancayo police reported that strike "announcements" were 
painted on city walls. 
  The provinces where the MRTA is trying to compel the people 
to "strike" are Chanchamayo and Satipo in Junin Department, and 
in Oxapampa in Pasco Department. In the past only the SL used 
to organize "armed strikes." 
  Even though certain analysts, whom the news agencies quote, 
seem to believe that this could mean a possible merger of the 
two subversive gangs, everything indicates that at least in the 
central jungle area a clash between the two groups seems to be 
inevitable.

  [Text] The Shining Path [SL] Central Committee, comprised 
of leaders who have still not been arrested and alternate 
members elected by the SL congress in 1988, held a meeting in 
February that was presided over by Oscar Ramirez Durand, aka 
"Comrade Feliciano." During the meeting the SL Central Committee 
decided to continue the "people's war" and to consider those 
members who uphold the peace accord with the government to be 
removed from the party "by their own free will." 
  The document entitled "To Grow Strong on the Grounds of 
Partisan Unity and Conquer Power" [Reafirmarse en la Base de 
Unidad Partidaria y Construir la Conquesta del Power], which 
contains the conclusions of the SL event, criticizes the leaders 
under arrest who try to convince the militants still operating 
to "uphold the great decision and definition," that is, Abimael 
Guzman's appeal for the SL to end hostilities against the 
Peruvian state. 
  An SL pamphlet dated February, which is signed by the 
leaders 
under arrest, asserts that "the people's war has ended, and 
(therefore) to continue refusing to uphold (the "great decision 
and definition") means obstructing the Peace Accord and placing 
the life of President Gonzalo and other comrades at stake." 
  But the Central Committee meeting in February disqualified 
the arrested leaders, stating that "it is an international 
communist rule that no leader can lead (the party or a war) from 
prison." 
  According to the Maoist theory, a militant who is in prison 
loses his operational capacity when he is isolated from reality, 
and therefore is assigned another type of job. 
  The National Counterterrorism Directorate [Dincote] learned 
in March about the SL meeting, according to an intelligence 
report datelined 31 March that states it was held in 
Razuhuillca, Huanta Province, Ayacucho. As a result, Peruvian 
Air Force troops carried out operations in the aforementioned 
area during the second week of April. The operations, however, 
were unproductive. 
  Dincote also obtained information according to which 
"Feliciano" presided over the meeting, during which it was 
decided to start a new phase of the "people's war" as well as 
plan an operation to rescue Abimael Guzman, dead or alive, at 
any cost. 
  The five-point document issued at the end of the meeting is 
attached to lengthy citations of speeches by Abimael Guzman and 
documents signed by him that show why the war must not end. 
  The following is one of the citations chosen by the SL 
Central Committee to uphold its decisions: "Always taking into 
account the glorious actions of the people's war, the people's 
war cannot end. The leadership may be wiped out completely or 
partially, but those leaders who are not must and can continue 
carrying out plans, the struggle, the people's war. We were 
taught that the revolution will not stop, will not become 
paralyzed." This was selected from the document entitled "To 
Conquer Power in the Midst of the People's War" that was drafted 
during the Second SL Central Committee Plenum, when Guzman was 
still free. 
  The document even mentions what must be done with those who 
uphold peace and put down arms: "There are two reasons for 
surrendering: to surrender in view of local reaction, and to 
surrender in view of international reaction. This is always the 
case. Its purpose is to ruin the revolution. Those who 
surrender, therefore, are no good, and must be wiped out through 
fire and bloodshed." (Preliminary Session of the Second Plenum). 
  The first of the five points discussed during the meeting 
refers to "reasserting" the agreements reached during the Third 
Central Committee Plenum, which was held in March 1992 and 
headed by Abimael Guzman Reinoso. This plenum was labeled 
"glorious, historic, and momentous" as it planned the terrible 
wave of violence unleashed by the SL in July 1992. 
  During the 1992 partisan meeting it was stated that during 
an 
adverse situation the party should draft "a new plan, taking 
into account the experience of the past years, establish new 
axes, sub- axes, guidelines, and lines of action with a 
nationwide criteria (...), seek new ways to develop and set up 
strategic military plans, and establish, for example, those 
objectives and carry them out on an established date." 
  It seems that the Third Central Committee Plenum's 
assessment 
of what was happening to the SL was negative and, therefore, it 
was decided to unleash a fierce wave of violence in order to 
conceal the weaknesses of the Maoist organization. 
  The second point of the document of the Central Committee 
meeting presided over by "Feliciano" highlights the agreements 
of the Working Meeting of the SL leadership held in August 1993, 
almost one year after Guzman was arrested, and during which the 
implementation of the agreements of the Third Plenum held in 
March 1992 was discussed. 
  During the Working Meeting, and in addition to approving the 
efforts to "step up investigations to determine the sanctions 
for those who are found responsible" for contributing to the 
arrest of Abimael Guzman, it was agreed, among other issues: 
  1. To defend the life of "President Gonzalo" by widely 
preaching our ideology, by showing great courage, placing even 
our lives at stake, by keeping our red and invincible flag 
flying high, and by pursuing our unwavering objective: 
communism." 
  2. To reassert the conclusions of the Third Central 
Committee 
Plenum (March 1992), "personally presided over by President 
Gonzalo, whose victorious appearance revealed its glorious, 
historic, and momentous nature; the second most important 
milestone after the congress (held in 1988)." 
  3. To reassert the three strategies: the political strategy: 
to conquer power; the military strategy: the people's war, to 
develop the war of movements and promote arrangements for the 
uprising of cities; and the construction strategy: to make 
arrangements to conquer power in the midst of the people's war. 
  Based on the conclusions of the Third Plenum and the Working 
Meeting, the Central Committee, during the meeting in February 
presided over by "Feliciano," reasserted "the principle of 
revolutionary violence as a universal law expressed in the 
people's war." 
  The third point discussed during the Central Committee 
meeting headed by "Feliciano" referred to the militants who 
uphold the peace accord. 
  The document addresses this aspect of the internal debate 
as: 
"About the Struggle Against the Counterrevolutionary Hoax and 
the Black Group [Grupillo Negro] that upholds a Right-Wing 
Opportunist Line (LOD)." 
  In order to confront the Black Group or LOD, which are 
nothing but SL militants who sign Abimael Guzman's letters and 
uphold his "great decision and definition" to negotiate with the 
government in order to end the war, the Central Committee 
demands that the militants "grow stronger on the Basis for 
Partisan Unity [Base de Unidad Partidaria, BUP]," which is the 
SL basic principles adopted during the 1988 Congress, and 
"arrange for conquering power in the midst of the people's war." 
  The Central Committee Plenum that "Feliciano" presided over 
in order to break away from the Black Group orders the 
"unleashing of a massive reassertion movement based on the BUP 
throughout the party, the People's Liberation Army, and among 
the masses of the New Power." 
  The Central Committee uses several arguments to "urge the 
smashing of the counterrevolutionary nonsense and the 
misbegotten schemes of Yankee imperialism, the genocidal and 
traitorous dictatorship, and the Black Group:" 
  1. The agreements reached at the Third Plenum (March 1992) 
and the Working Meeting (August 1993) must be ratified because 
"facts have confirmed that the position established on those 
occasions toward the counterrevolutionary scheme was right and 
proper." 
  2. Abimael Guzman's letters to President Alberto Fujimori, 
the telephone conversation between Guzman and Javier Esparza 
Marquez (Guzman's brother-in-law, who is in charge of SL's 
organization abroad), and the communiques released by SL 
prisoners "are a counterrevolutionary scheme concocted by Yankee 
imperialists and the genocidal and traitorous dictatorship with 
the sinister help of the Black Group," the Central Committee 
concluded at its February meeting. It added: "The short-term 
objective of this scheme is to win the elections, prevent the 
commemoration of (Mao's) centennial in December 1994, and cover 
up the La Cantuta affair, but the final goal is to annihilate 
the people's war and move ahead with their plan to murder 
President Gonzalo." 
  The Central Committee does acknowledge Guzman as its leader, 
and gives him credit for the ideology he devised, the so-called 
"Gonzalo's Thoughts," but now he is considered to be a merely 
decorative figure, because neither the party nor the war can be 
led from a cell, especially when the leader is kept 
incommunicado and his contacts with the outside world must go 
through government officials. 
  3. The Black Group is made up of "infiltrators, traitors, 
weaklings, and old revisionists, linked directly to 
reactionaries," meaning Osman Morote, Elena Iparraguire, Maria 
Pantoja, Martha Huatay, Edmundo Cox, and others who are in touch 
with government representatives and prison officials. 
  4. The activities of the Black Group "go against the 
conclusions of the Marxist-Leninist-Maoist-Gonzalo's Thoughts 
First Congress (1988), the BUP, the leadership, the party, and 
the people's war, which means that its members have voluntarily 
strayed from the party." 
  This clearly means that the negotiators of the peace 
agreement no longer belong to the SL, because their actions 
openly violate the agreements, resolutions, and decisions 
reached at party meetings such as the Third Plenum and the 
Working Meeting. Thus, they do not represent the ideology of 
the PCP-SL. Furthermore: 
  5. "Actions that go against principles cannot be accepted" 
because "it is an international communist rule that the 
leadership (of the party and the war) cannot be exercised from 
prison," and because "monstrosities like the `peace accord'(...) 
clash with our principles." 
  The Central Committee meeting that "Feliciano" presided over 
clearly defined its position toward Abimael Guzman Reinoso, 
whose ideological contribution to the people's war, called 
"Gonzalo's Thoughts," was acknowledged. 
  Gonzalo's "leadership" was also accepted but, as he is 
operationally restricted, he cannot lead the party anymore. 
  Guzman and the leaders who support his decision to hold 
talks 
with the administration signed a communique that was released in 
March. This communique "warned against" and "denounced" the 
reports of "Feliciano's" Central Committee, which decided to go 
on with the war. 
  This communique stated: "They are trying to separate 
`Gonzalo's Thoughts' from `President Gonzalo' the person. Under 
the guise of defending the party they are undermining it and its 
leadership so as to bring about its defeat, by using empty 
rhetoric to disguise their partisan, opportunistic, and personal 
interests and ambitions, and by taking a blind, biased, 
subjective, and superficial approach to concrete reality. (...) 
We urge the eradication of these leftist ideas of military 
extraction." 
  The communique emphasized the decision to put an end to the 
people's war: "The people's war is over. To continue it means 
sabotaging the peace agreement. We warn our members against 
militaristic and revisionist approaches, and urge them to keep 
their eyes open to unmask this or any other scheme." 
  Guzman's call upon the militants in action to "abide" by the 
decision to hold talks with the administration in order to stop 
the war, and to fight those who disagree with this decision, is 
persistent: "Once again we warn the militants to be on guard 
against any desperate action, adventure, or provocation from 
third parties, because the goal of all this is to scuttle the 
proposed peace agreement. Such actions must be prevented to the 
extent possible, and immediately and categorically criticized." 
  Meanwhile, the Central Committee has acknowledged "Gonzalo's 
Thoughts" as the ideological basis for the "people's war," 
Guzman Reinoso's "leadership" and his inability to lead the 
party and the war from prison, and has decided to reorganize the 
SL machine to launch a new stage of the war without Guzman. 
  The Dincote report lists the steps that "Feliciano's" 
followers are taking to carry out actions that would put SL back 
in the political picture. 
  The report states that the SL is expected "to carry out 
isolated actions at key targets in order to demonstrate its 
operational capacity." 
  Intelligence agents believe that the most likely targets are 
"financial companies, banks, stores, and industries, in order to 
sow confusion among local and foreign investors." 
  Other likely targets are "soon-to-be-privatized public 
energy 
and mining companies, the embassies of countries whose citizens 
are purchasing Peruvian companies, and the interests that these 
countries already have in Peru." 
  "Government politicians and high-ranking members of the 
forces of order are also among the main targets. In this case 
the objective is to obtain the freedom of Abimael Guzman 
Reinoso." 
  The counterterrorism police believe that the SL "urgently 
needs to demonstrate its power in order to get out of its 
current defensive position." 
  Dincote's intelligence reports adds that the internal strife 
in the SL has reached the level of killings among militants, so 
it is likely that there will be a "settling of accounts." SL 
members believe that surrender deserves capital punishment. 
  The Dincote report, which confirmed that "Feliciano" 
presided 
over a SL Central Committee meeting somewhere in Razuillca, 
added that it has been decided to "rescue Abimael Guzman 
Reinoso, dead or alive." 
  The report explains that "Israeli experts in hostage rescue 
and underwater operations (demolition) have been hired for this 
purpose." 
  The SL also considered the possibility of winning over 
Peruvian security forces personnel "so as to attract new 
members, including Armed Forces Special Operations personnel." 
  The 21-page police report labeled Dincote-EM-2-Lima provides 
a detailed analysis of the behavior of the SL and the MRTA 
throughout the country. 
  According to "Feliciano" and his followers, Guzman Reinoso 
has fallen prey to a plot designed to murder him. 
  "Feliciano" claims that the "forged letters" sent to 
President Alberto Fujimori, the communiques supporting the peace 
agreement signed by SL prisoners in Canto Grande, Chorrillos, 
and Yanamayo, and the statements and gestures of Osman Morote 
Bariionuevo and Edmundo Cox Beuzeville are all part of this plot. 
  As far as "Feliciano" is concerned, rescuing Guzman Reinoso 
dead or alive is in any case just a symbolic gesture.

  [Text] One of the most important leaders of the Tupac Amaru 
Revolutionary Movement [MRTA] has been captured. He is Emilio 
Villalobos, a member of the MRTA national executive committee, 
who is considered the brain behind the kidnapping of several 
businessmen. 
  Dincote [Counterterrorism Directorate] today exhibited 
Villalobos and six other subversives who were captured in the 
operation labeled Alacran-3. Weapons were also seized during 
the operation. [begin recording] 
  Unidentified reporter: The terrorists who were 
captured during the Alacran-3 operation were responsible for 
several attacks, kidnappings, and the murders of several 
businessmen, including (David Bayon Vera), (Pedro Antonio 
Miyasato), and (Fernando Manrique Azevedo). Their capture 
helped to prevent the kidnapping of businessmen (Mitchel 
Stafford) and (Andreas Bekermayer). The subversives who were 
arrested in Lima, Barranca, and Arequipa are the following 
[passage indistinct]. 
  Villalobos, who is considered one of the most important 
leaders of the MRTA, coordinated actions with Ernesto Serpa 
Cartolini and Miguel Rincon Rincon, who are still at large. The 
police found ammunition and weapons of different calibers, 
communications equipment, subversive propaganda, police 
uniforms, and money. [end recording]

  [Text] Tingo Maria, 25 Apr -- General Alfredo Rodriguez 
Riveros, chief of the Huallaga Front, said that the bodies found 
buried in a grave in the Shapingo sector (Moyuna) yesterday by 
members of the Human Rights Commission of the Democratic 
Constituent Congress belong to two Shining Path "commanders" of 
a group that operates in this zone. 
  He said this was determined by the testimony of three 
repented Shining Path members who were under the command of one 
of them, and also from intelligence information. 
  Other military chiefs said the dead were known as "Comrade 
Mardonio" and "Comrade Abel" of the logistical and military 
commands respectively of the so-called 3d Batallion of the 
Moena-Moyuno People's Committee. 
  The body of "Comrade Abel" supposedly belongs to the peasant 
Felix Loyola who, according to his wife and relatives, was a 
coca grower who had his farm in this sector and was shot by 
soldiers when he was leaving the area. 
  General Rodriguez presumes that the bodies belong to some of 
the six terrorists killed by a militay patrol on 8 April in a 
clash in another sector of Moyuna, about three to four hours by 
foot into the jungle. 
  He said that all the information will be given to provincial 
Prosecutor Carlos Gonzalez Ortiz, who is investigating this case 
to gain more evidence to clarify the killings. 
  Regarding the bones found in the Carmen Alto zone (near the 
port of Moyuna de Anda), he said that according to preliminary 
information the bones have been there for several years.

  [Text] Huancayo -- The dangerous Chilean terrorist 
"Rodrigo," who heads the so-called MRTA [Tupac Amaru 
Revolutionary Movement] Central Guerrilla Front (Junin, Pasco, 
and Huancavelica), may be in hiding in the central jungle area, 
according to Villa Perene authorities. 
  The dangerous terrorist is allegedly planning some terrorist 
actions to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the clash with 
security forces in Los Molinos, on 28 April 1989. 
  The spokesman added that a few days ago the Chilean 
participated in several attacks perpetrated in Pampa, Tigre, and 
Alto Celendin, in the central jungle in Chanchamayo. 
  The source added that in the meantime, a group of MRTA 
members is steadily moving toward the higher areas of southern 
Chanchamayo Province. 
  According to a source in the National Crime Investigative 
Directorate (Dinincri), the Chilean "Rodrigo" arrived in Peru in 
1990 to learn and later on participate in MRTA criminal 
activities. 
  Once in Peru, the MRTA made him witness some attacks, such 
as 
the one perpetrated against the La Rosa Nautica restaurant in 
1991. 
  Later on, following the orders of the third most powerful 
MRTA leader, Chilean terrorist Jaime Castillo Petrucci, aka 
Alfredo, Rodrigo started to take part in actions, because the 
MRTA knew that he had already participated in several acts of 
sabotage in Chile. 
  After participating in several actions, Rodrigo was made a 
member of the MRTA Abduction and Extortion Special Force headed 
by Petrucci and other Chilean terrorists. Rodrigo thus 
participated in the murder of businessman David Ballon Vera and 
Spanish citizen Carlos Manrique Acevedo, as well as the 
abduction of businessmen Hiraoka and Furokawa.

  [Text] Beirut, May 9, IRNA -- Four Iranian diplomats who 
were abducted in 1982 are alive and have been handed over to 
Zionist regime's officials in occupied Palestine, a source close 
to Lebanese Government disclosed here Monday. 
  The source, who is close to Lebanese Minister of Hydraulic 
and Electrical Resources Ilyas Hubayqah, told IRNA here Monday 
that the Iranians were delivered to Zionist regime by elements 
affiliated with head of Lebanese Maronite Party Samir Geagea 
[Ja'Ja']. 
  He said the hostages who were three Iranian diplomats along 
with Islamic republic news agency's photographer were taken as 
hostage when they came across a Lebanese paramilitary troops' 
checkpoint in 1982. They were taken to occupied Palestine via 
sea last year once Geagea was forced to quit his command 
headquarters. 
  Since then, Iranian officials repeatedly have called for 
their release, but Lebanese paramilitary troops have refused to 
acknowledge that they are holding the four Iranian hostages. 
  Families of the hostages have also offered documents to the 
international bodies, appealing for their release. 
  Foreign Minister Velayati also in a letter last month called 
on his Lebanese counterpart Faris Bouez to probe into the issue.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Palestinian Leading Figures Deny </F>
Knowledge of the Incident, But Jordanian Sources Say an Attempt 
To Blow Up 'Arafat's Plane Was Foiled"] 
  [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Leading Palestinian 
figures in Amman yesterday denied knowledge of an attempt to 
assassinate Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat during his 
recent visit to the Jardanian capital after signing the Cairo 
agreement with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. 
  Jordanian sources had stated that the attempt was discovered 
hours before the arrival of 'Arafat's plane. Primitive missiles 
were placed near the runways of the military airfield (special 
section) in the "Marka" area in the Jordanian capital. That 
prompted the security authorities to change the landing area for 
'Arafat's plane and the plane was diverted to the deserted 
civilian airport in the same area. 
  The sources added that stringent security measures were 
taken 
upon 'Arafat's arrival and during his reception. Reporters were 
not allowed in the reception hall even though they had been 
invited to participate in the reception for the Palestinian 
president. Those who were there to receive him, including PLO 
leaders, were physically thoroughly searched and their cars were 
carefully searched. They included [Fatah] Central Committee 
Member 'Abbas Zaki. For the first time, their cars were not 
allowed in the reception area of the airport. 
  Meanwhile, Palestinian Embassy sources in Amman have denied 
media reports of an attempt to assassinate 'Arafat in 
Johannesburg while he was attending President Nelson Mandela's 
inauguration last week.

arms against either the self-rule authority or Fatah members. 
  In the last press statement he made in Amman before Hamas

We only call on the self-rule authority not to stand against

occupation.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mustafa al-Liddawi, representative of the </F>
Islamic Resistance Movement-Hamas in Beirut, by Ja'far Salim and 
'Abbas Surur; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] 
  Al-Liddawi: Statements by the Hamas official 
spokesman and representative in Jordan concerning the 'Afula and 
Hadera operations were made after the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam 
groups inside the occupied territories announced their 
responsibility for the two martyrdom operations. The operations 
were used as a pretext to implement this conspiracy against 
fraternal Jordan, to blackmail it, especially after Jordan's 
recent position toward the blockade of the Jordanian port of 
al-'Aqabah and Jordan's link between its continuing 
participation in the bilateral talks and the lifting of the 
blockade. On top of this comes the painful impact of the 
martyrdom operations on the occupation government. 
  AL-'AHD: It was said that Ibrahim Ghawshah and 
Muhammad Nazzal's passports were withdrawn. What information do 
you have on this? 
  Al-Liddawi: We do not say that the Jordanian 
Government withdrew their passports. But after the news 
conference that King Husayn held in Amman following the Israeli 
threats to Jordan, the Jordanian foreign minister summoned 
Ghawshah and Nazzal to explain developments and the government's 
position on them. After listening to the two, the minister 
asked their permission to keep their passports with him. 
  AL-'AHD: Many observers expect relations between 
Hamas and the Jordanian regime to become tense. 
  Al-Liddawi: We do not expect such a thing. Our 
relations with the Jordanian Government remain good, despite 
what happened. Jordan appreciates that the Palestinian cause is 
important for it. There are many reasons leading it to create 
good relations with Hamas, which in turn appreciates Jordan's 
importance for the Palestinian cause and the Palestinian people 
in general. We also deeply respect all the Arab and Islamic 
countries, especially those where we have an information, 
political, or charitable presence. We want their security to be 
stable, especially Jordan's. Hamas has no organizational 
infrastructure or armed presence outside Palestine. It is not 
our policy to embarrass Jordan or any other country. We believe 
that relations with Jordan will not be harmed by what happened. 
The government's recent measures against Hamas will not last. 
[passage omitted] 
  AL-'AHD: Muhammad Nazzal told AL-'AHD two weeks 
ago that Hamas would hit the Israeli settlements with rockets. 
What is your comment on this? 
  Al-Liddawi: That's what I and brother Muhammad 
Nazzal read in the statement issued by the Martyr 'Izz-al-Din 
al-Qassam Battalions in the occupied territories. It threatened 
the Zionists with more military operations against the enemy's 
soldiers and settlers in retaliation for the massacre 
perpetrated by the settlers in the al- Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. 
  We are expecting more painful operations against the enemy 
by 
the Martyr 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions. 
  AL-'AHD: Does this mean that the target of these 
operations will be the settlements built in the territories 
occupied in 1967 or the ones throughout Palestine? 
  Al-Liddawi: This question should be put to the 
Martyr 'Izz-al- Din al-Qassam Battalions operating in occupied 
Palestine because all the planning, preparation, and 
implementation of all the military operations is carried out in 
the occupied territories. 
  AL-'AHD: How do you envisage the relations between 
Hamas and Fatah in the event of the implementation of the 
self-rule in Gaza and Jericho and the entry of 'Arafat and the 
Palestinian police force into these two areas? 
  Al-Liddawi: We yearn to maintain good relations 
with all the sides in the occupied territories. Fatah enjoys 
support in the occupied territories and any fighting between 
Hamas and Fatah would trigger the fire of civil war in 
Palestine. We must avoid this as far as we can. Any struggle 
between the two inside the occupied territories would be bloody 
and destructive to our people. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Regarding reports on terrorism, the Algerian 
national Abdelkrim Boutrif appeared before a French magistrate 
today and was remanded in custody. Boutrif was arrested on the 
French-German border in possession of a quantity of weapons and 
ammunition. In the trunk of his car police discovered over 129 
sticks of dynamite, about 100 detonators, some 3,000 bullets, 
three automatic pistols, night vision binoculars, and 14 two-way 
radios. 
  Abdelkrim Boutrif is 34 and an activist in the banned FIS 
[Islamic Salvation Front]. His mission was to drive the car and 
its contents all the way to Spain, from where this arsenal would 
have been taken to Algeria.

<F P=106> [Gilles Millet report: "Two French Clergy Persons </F>
Assassinated in Algiers Yesterday"] 
  [Excerpts] It is clear that those who assassinated Henri 
Verges, aged 64, and his sister Paule-Helene Saint-Raymond, 67, 
in the Algiers Casbah yesterday do not believe in the "dialogue" 
between the authorities and the Islamists, which was being 
defended by some 20,000 demonstrators on the other side of the 
city. They wanted to indicate in a violent way that the Islamic 
Armed Resistance cannot be brought down by repression, which is 
particularly harsh at this moment, nor by the "national 
reconciliation" advocated by head of state Liamine Zeroual. 
[passage omitted] 
  The [French] Foreign Ministry has condemned "this odious 
crime" and has reissued a warning to the remaining 3,000 or so 
French citizens in Algeria to return to France (some 5,000 have 
already left the country). Government Spokesman Nicolas Sarkozy 
stated that "Today, Algeria is one of the prime minister's 
primary concerns."

  [Text] Cairo, May 10 (AFP)--A senior Egyptian opposition MP 
on Tuesday accused unnamed government officials of ordering the 
killing of a Muslim fundamentalist lawyer because he tried to 
negotiate an end to clashes between Islamic militants and the 
security forces. 
  Kamal Khalid, a lawyer and independent member of parliament, 
said Abd-al-Harith Madani died after having tried to give him 
proposals for ending the conflict between the outlawed 
al-Jama'ah al- Islamiyah and security forces which has cost 
nearly 400 lives in the past two years. 
  "Certain circles in the security forces are trying to stir 
up" the violence, Khalid told a lawyers' union meeting in the 
centre of Cairo, called to protest over the alleged killing of 
Madani by security forces. 
  The Order of Cairo Lawyers said Monday that Madani, who 
defended the al-Jama'ah's spiritual leader, was tortured to 
death a week after he was arrested. 
  Madani was a leading member of the defence committee set up 
for al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah (Islamic Group) spiritual guide 
Shaykh 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman, who was sentenced to seven years in 
jail by the state security court last week. 
  The al-Jama'ah has been waging a bloody two-year campaign to 
topple the secular government of President Husni Mubarak. 
  In a message to Mubarak, Order of Cairo Lawyers President 
'Abd- al-'Aziz Muhammad said there were "circles in the heart of 
your government who do not want stability in Egypt." 
  The Cairo lawyers' statement said Madani was arrested on 
April 26 and taken to a secret destination. 
  "Not even his family knew where he was. They only heard 
about his death on Friday." 
  The lawyers said they were "horrified" by Madani's death, 
describing it as "an act of aggression against all lawyers." 
  Security forces arrested Madani during a four-hour search of 
his office, in the presence of four colleagues. 
  The 40-year-old lawyer from Qina in northern [Qina is 
actually in the south] Egypt was married with two daughters.

  [Text] Cairo, 9 May (MENA)--Two citizens were injured today 
while passing by a gas station in Sadafa town in Asyut 
Governorate when shots were fired indiscriminately. 
  An Interior Ministry security source stated that citizen 
Muhammad Hasan Darwish informed the Sadafa police station that 
while he was inside the gas station that he owns he noticed some 
strangers wearing municipal clothing. He became suspicious of 
their movements and when he attempted to identify them, one of 
them fired shots in the air from a gun he took out from under 
his clothing. They exchanged gunfire and a regular sentry 
present at the scene of the incident also participated in the 
shooting. 
  The perpetrators of the crime escaped. They drove away in 
one of the cars parked in the taxi parking lot near the gas 
station. 
  The security source said that the two injured citizens are 
Fu'ad Zaki Abu-Yusuf, headmaster of Majris Preparatory School in 
Sadafa. He received superficial injuries in the nose. The 
second citizen is Ernest Anwar Askerios, an employee of the 
Social Security Department in the same town. He was shot in the 
neck and was taken to Sadafa General Hospital for treatment. 
  Commanders of the Asyut Security Department, men from the 
various investigation departments, and forensics experts moved 
to the scene of the crime to search for evidence. The police 
are concentrating their efforts on finding the criminals. The 
prosecution has been informed to proceed with the investigations. 
  Earlier the town of Sadafa was the scene of another 
terrorist 
incident where unknown gunmen fired at the checkpoint of the 
Sadafa police station.

  [Excerpt] Amman, 6 May (MENA)--Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif 
Sidqi stated that Egypt's leadership and security organs are 
confronting terrorism and terrorists with the firmness and 
strength they deserve and that all their activities are 
confronted decisively. He said: We should not worry about Egypt. 
  Speaking at a meeting with members of the Egyptian community 
in Jordan before leaving Amman this afternoon, the prime 
minister said that compared with other countries, terrorism in 
Egypt is decreasing in a big way. 
  Answering a question, he said that attempts were made over a 
long period to hold a dialogue with these terrorists at times 
between 1980 and 1987 or 1988. He added: The dialogue 
continued in one way or another but they were not ready to 
listen to the voice of reason and their ideas rendered the 
dialogue useless. When they started to use bullets and kill, the 
security organs confronted them decisively and firmly. [passage

<F P=106> [Report by Ahmad Kurayshan] </F>
  [Excerpts] The public prosecutor of the State Security 
Court has issued a decision dismissing the case of seven 
Jordanian Afghan defendants. The public prosecutor announced 
that the case does not fall within the court's jurisdiction and 
that he would refer the case to the attorney of the State 
Security Court, who should refer it to the competent judicial 
quarters. 
  The decision stated that the State Security Court charged 
the defendants with participation in a conspiracy to carry out 
terrorist acts and planning to commit crimes against people and 
public funds. 
  The decision said that, after investigating this case and 
studying it in detail, the public prosecutor of the State 
Security Court became convinced that the first defendant, Bura', 
and the second, Yahya, are members of the Jordanian Afghan 
movement who had left Jordan for Afghanistan in 1989 where they 
received military training. They stayed there for over a year, 
during which time they took part in the war there. In 1991, 
they returned to Jordan. 
  In 1993, the two defendants got together again and discussed 
the idea of establishing a religious jihad organization that 
seeks to remove vice by force and to achieve the highest 
objective of this organization, the establishment of an Islamic 
state. The two set out the objectives of the organizations as 
follows: 
  1. Declaring as infidel the ruling regime in Jordan and all 
its civil and military institutions. 
  2. Attacking the state's civilian and military personnel, 
since they are followers of the ruling regime. 
  3. Assassinating certain Jordanian personalities, including 
intellectuals, economists, and men of letters. 
  4. Blowing up the Parliament building, since it is the 
legislative authority that passes legislation conflicting with 
the Holy Koran. 
  5. Smashing movie theaters and liquor stores inside the 
Kingdom. 
  6. Declaring as infidel women who do not wear an Islamic 
veil 
and considering them prisoners of war. 
  The two defendants, Bura' and Yahya, then began looking for 
sources to finance this organization, especially to acquire 
weapons and pay for the expenses and financial obligations of 
the members of the organization. Consequently, the second 
defendant, Yahya, issued a ruling sanctioning the theft of funds 
from non-Muslims and considering the money they get from those 
people war spoils, as long as those people do not pay Islamic 
tax for their stay in a Muslim country. The second defendant 
also sanctioned the theft of bank funds which, they argue, are 
usurious. He also said it was permissible to take the money of 
a Muslim who does not pay alms tax either by force or by fraud. 
  In accordance with this edict, the two defendants agreed to 
rob several stores and banks, such as the Arab Bank, Umm 
al-Summaq branch, and a goldsmith in al-Fuhays. They also 
planned to attack foot patrols to kill them, since they follow 
an infidel ruling regime, and to seize their weapons. 
  The two defendants also agreed to recruit other elements to 
this organization. Thus, the first defendant, Bura', recruited 
another defendant, Wa'il, after explaining to him the aims of 
the organization and the methods it would adopt to achieve these 
aims. 
  On 17 November 1993, defendant Yahya left Jordan for Saudi 
Arabia where he was arrested, while the first defendant, Bura', 
and the third defendant, Wa'il, began to prepare for the thefts 
that were agreed upon among the three defendants. Wa'il bought 
a 7-mm pistol [as published] for 400 dinars and two tear gas 
grenades to be used in the theft operations. [passage omitted] 
  After verification, it has become clear that the established 
facts here are not in conformity with the provisions and 
elements of the first charge against the defendants; namely, 
participating in a conspiracy to carry out acts of terrorism, 
and that the actions carried out by all the defendants, even if 
proved to be true, do not constitute more than an offense, or an 
agreement to perpetrate crimes against people and their funds in 
violation of the provisions of Articles 157/1 and 158/3 of the 
Penal Code No. 16 of 1960. 
  Since this offense, even if proven true, does not fall 
within 
the jurisdiction of the State Security Court in accordance with 
the provisions of Article 3 of the State Security Court Law No. 
17 of 1959, amended by Law No. 6 of 1993, I have decided to 
dismiss the case as not falling within my jurisdiction, and to 
refer the file of the case to the attorney of the State Security 
Court to refer it to the competent judicial quarters. 
  The defendants are: 
  1. Bura' Ghanim 'Abduh, alias Abu-Malik, 33 years old. 
  2. Yahya Ibrahim al-Zughli, alias Abu-Humam, 35 years old. 
  3. Wa'il Rashid al-Waza'ifi, 24 years old. 
  4. Ahmad Nasuh al-Waza'ifi, 26 years old. 
  5. Ahmad Musa Naji 'Amirah, 25 years old. 
  6. Isma'il 'Abd-al-Wadud al-'Isawi, 22 years old. 
  7. 'Ali Muhammad Mahmud al-Faqih, 24 years old.

<F P=106> [Statement by Hizballah on the Palestinian-Israeli Agreement </F>
signed in Cairo; date not given] 
  [Text] A new festival of fraudulence is being held in an 
Arab capital to obliterate the most luminous cause, the 
Palestinian cause. 
  The so-called self-rule agreement signed by 'Arafat, Rabin, 
the U.S. secretary of state, and the Russian foreign minister is 
aimed at giving complete legitimacy to the Zionist occupation of 
the occupied territories in return for giving the Palestinians 
some powers to administer their affairs. 
  This agreement seeks to make the treacherous and rejected 
occupation a legitimate authority acceptable to the Palestinian 
people. Therefore, this festival is one of fraudulence attended 
by several foreign and Arab false witnesses. 
  It is a crime committed against the land, man, and history. 
They want us to believe this is the long-awaited peace. We 
ask: Where is the sovereignty? Where are the rest of the 
rights? What is the fate of the detainees? What is the fate of 
the rest of the occupied territories? What is the fate of the 
millions in the diaspora? What is the fate of Jerusalem? What 
is the fate of all Palestine? Where is all this in the agreement? 
  Nothing, nothing. There is nothing now or even in the 
future, because 'Arafat has accepted the bare minimum to enable 
the Palestinian people to establish a state on even a part of 
their land in the future. It is a new treason with widespread 
Arab blessing. The fraudulence in Cairo was preceded by two 
ceremonies in Muscat and Doha celebrating peace and cooperation 
with the enemy. 
  We urge the sons of the Palestinian people and the sons of 
our nation to realize the dangers of this new plot and to use 
all means to undermine the prospects of the plotters and foil 
their schemes by rejecting all projects presented under the 
banner of a promised peace and future for the Palestinian people 
and the region's nations. These represent the worst link in the 
chain of moves to destroy and seize the region. 
  This new plot will not pass, regardless of its potentials 
and 
supporters and regardless of the extolling headlines. Our 
nation will be lying in wait and will not allow some ostracized 
people to exploit our nation in order to serve their interests 
and threaten our nation's interests. 
  Certainly, it is a day of mourning and grief for the 
Palestinian people and the sons of the Arab and Islamic nation 
to see that the Palestinian people have become an isolated 
community in a state where the authority of the Jewish usurpers 
is being legitimized.

  [Text] Tripoli, 12 May (JANA) -- A source at the General 
People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and International 
Cooperation commented on the U.S. Administration's claims, 
reported by the [foreign] media, accusing several countries of 
supporting terrorism. He said: Inclusion of the Great 
Jamahiriyah in such claims and allegations and the concoction of 
accusations against it is not a new thing. It has become one of 
the hallmarks of the conspiracy against the Libyan Arab people 
in order to exert pressure on its choices and to force it to 
serve certain interests which are known to everyone. 
  Concerning the issue of terrorism and other related matters 
which have been used by the Western powers to serve their 
interests in the world, we wish to explain the following points: 
  1. The Great Jamahiriyah, which is eager to see 
international peace and security established on solid bases 
which will help relations between peoples of the world to be 
based on equality, mutual respect, and noninterference in 
internal affairs as well as the nonuse of violence in resolving 
disputes, has been calling on the international community to 
overcome negative aspects [in international relations], such as 
the phenomenon of terrorism, by defining it, analyzing the 
reasons for it, and combatting it. 
  2. The Great Jamahiriyah is another victim of terrorism, 
particularly the state terrorism which has been used against it 
for years, a matter which has claimed tens of innocent victims 
as well as causing material damage. It reached its zenith 
during the U.S.- Atlantist aggression against the innocent 
inhabitants of Tripoli and Benghazi in April 1986, as well as 
against the brother leader of the revolution and his family. 
This was a serious international precedent, condemned by the UN 
Gneral Assembly in successive resolutions. 
  3. The Great Jamahiriyah reacted to the U.S. 
Administration's 
claims on terrorism with clear and public statements, documented 
by international and regional organizations, in which they 
condemned terrorism in all its forms. All international 
organizations and bodies highly praised this stand. 
  4. The Great Jamahiriyah, in a bid to refute American 
claims, 
asked the UN secretary-general to take appropriate measures to 
expose the falsehood of such claims.

  [Text] Two Indian terrorists have been apprehended by 
Pakistani troops after they crossed the Line of Control in 
Nikyal subsector of Azad Kashmir on the night of 4th and 5th of 
this month. Over 18 kg of explosives along with accessories and 
two tubes of rocket launchers have also been recovered from the 
saboteurs. According to preliminary investigations, the 
terrorists -- Mohammad Yusuf, son of Sain Mohammad; and 
Mohammad, son of Raj Mohammad -- belong to village (Neka 
Panchgaran) of Indian-held Kashmir. During interrogation, it 
has transpired that the two saboteurs received training in 
handling of explosives at a Gurkha Rifle unit of the Indian 
Army. They were roped in by one RAW [Research and Analysis 
Wing] agent, Havaldar [petty military officer] Sharma, through 
coercion. They were also promised that handsome amount will be 
paid to them on return with a warning that if they refused to 
carry out the orders, they would be shot dead and declared 
intruders. 
  Prior to the agents' entry into Nikyal subsector of Kotli, 
the Indian troops deployed near the Line of Control started 
heavy firing on the flanks first to divert the attention of the 
Pakistani troops, and also intimidate local population so that 
the terrorists could enter undetected. But this commonly used 
tactic of Indians aroused suspicion and Pakistani troops became 
extra vigilant. As the two terrorists penetrated into Azad 
Kashmir area, they were nabbed by a local patrol. Both the 
agents have confessed that they have been visiting various 
places in Azad Kashmir and Pakistan in the past for the purpose 
of sabotage. The terrorists have also confessed that a large 
number of educated Kashmiri youth are being imparted terrorism 
training by Indian soldiers under threat of maltreatment.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Has the Ice Begun To Break?"] </F>
  [Text] Several people have been detained on suspicion of 
being involved in the murder of Gia Gulua, deputy minister of 
internal affairs. We were informed about this in the press 
center of the republic's Ministry of Internal Affairs [MVD]. 
  "Although," specified V. Gogolashvili, head of the press 
center, "it is still too early to say that the murderers have 
been caught and, generally, to make any loud statements." 
  Less than a week has passed since the murder of Gulua and 
two 
MVD employees accompanying him. The investigative bodies are 
refraining from presenting any specific versions. In the 
immediate days and even hours following the barbaric terrorist 
act on the Nutsubidze plateau [as published], it became known 
only that the police had managed to identify the registration 
number of one of the cars that had blocked the deputy minister's 
path and from which the first rounds of automatic gun fire came 
and also to ascertain the type of weapon used in the killing. 
An easy logical calculation suggests that, once the weapon has 
been identified from the cartridge case, this means it has been 
officially registered; however, some petty criminal scum is not 
so decent as to register his weapon. A brief journalistic 
survey carried out at the scene of the incident enabled a 
curious detail to be added to the picture: Literally 15 minutes 
before the murders took place, unknown persons carrying 
automatic weapons chased some children into buildings located 
near a school and kindergarten. What amazing humaneness, 
particularly given what occurred later. 
  As directly regards the versions of what happened, according 
to unofficial information gleaned "in the corridors," the 
investigation is leaning toward the view that Gulua was the 
victim of mafia structures. He was in charge of the transport 
police. Highways and railroads in Georgia have already become 
virtually the principal feeding trough for underground business. 
It is also nothing new that Georgia is increasingly becoming a 
transit country for drugs and this activity comes into direct 
conflict with the work of this transport police (along with 
specialized structures). 
  However, one cannot of course exclude other versions as 
well. 
Gulua, who stood out as a man of principle, was a fairly 
well-known figure in the Georgian law enforcement bodies. He 
did not play an insignificant role in the events that took place 
at the end of 1991 and beginning of 1992 [overthrow of 
ex-President Zviad Gamsakhurdia]; he was later taken prisoner by 
the Zviadists in western Georgia and a serious operation was 
undertaken by special subunits to secure his release. In 
Abkhazia, Gulua was also in the command structures.... He could 
"hinder" many people. 
  A serious investigation is underway. The Procurator's 
Office, the security services, and the MVD are involved in it. 
These bodies do not forgive when one of their own is killed and 
they should not forgive. How often have we written about 
various terrorist acts and almost on every occasion we have 
concluded with the words: "One would like to hope that, at 
least, this time...." Now as well, we would sincerely like to 
hope that the guilty persons will be found and punished -- as in 
all previous terrorist acts, a list of which we have compiled 
from memory below, which are the most notorious cases. We have 
added brief comments on the progress made in solving these 
cases. To be honest, these comments do not raise one's spirits 
particularly. 
  Attempt on the life of D. Ioseliani [former first deputy 
chairman of State Council, leader of "Mkhedrioni" paramilitary 
group that has now been incorporated into the Rescue Corps] (13 
June 1992); explosion on Chikovani Street [Tbilisi] -- 
investigation concluded; trial in progress; 
  Explosion in car of D. Ioseliani on the airport road 
[Tbilisi] -- under investigation; 
  Murder of Tbilisi Procurator General M. Kurdadze -- under 
investigation; 
  Explosion in car of Defense Minister G. Karkarashvili in 
western Georgia -- no proceedings instigated; 
  Armed attack on the headquarters of the Georgian National- 
Democratic Party -- under investigation; 
  Explosion in the headquarters of the Union of Georgian 
Traditionalists -- under investigation; 
  Murder of F. Woodruff, high-ranking employee in the U.S. 
Embassy and American special services -- murderer convicted and 
sentenced to 15 years imprisonment; 
  Explosion in the state philharmonic building during the 
conference of parties and organizations belonging to the 
national- democratic movement -- under investigation; 
  Armed attack on the 7 DGHE editorial office -- under 
investigation; 
  Murder of G. Zhordaniya, director of the First Tbilisi 
Tobacco Factory -- under investigation; 
  Murder of "Mkhedrioni" leaders Z. Vepkhvadze and G. Svanadze 
-- under investigation; 
  Murder of Deputy Defense Minister N. Kekelidze -- under 
investigation; 
  Explosion in the Rescue Corps building -- under 
investigation; 
  Explosion in the headquarters of the Georgian Popular Front 
-- under investigation; 
  Explosion in the "Ibervizia" independent television company 
building -- under investigation; 
  Explosion in the SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA editorial office -- 
under 
investigation; 
  Bribery and arson committed at the apartment of opera singer 
P. Burchuladze -- under investigation; 
  Murder of G. Gulua, deputy minister of internal affairs, 
chief of the transport police -- under investigation.... 
  We have decided to end with ellipses. Our readers certainly 
understand why.

belonging to the YSEE [Greek General Confederation of Labor] in 
Aryiroupolis. The car, which was parked at the junction of 
Trapezounda and Olimbia Streets was destroyed. The 
Revolutionary Violence Cells [Pirines Epanastatkis Vias] claimed 
responsibility for the car's arson in a telephone call to a 
private radio station. 
  A YSEE statement described the arson as a provocative action 
aimed at disorientating the working people. The statement 
condemned the unseen elements, who, with their suspicious and 
evil presence, have again tried to open a front against the 
trade unions--and this on the day of the May Day observances.

[IGERF] has claimed responsibility for the bomb attack against 
the building that houses the Ankara branch of the Grand Hall of 
the Freemason Organization. Last night two unidentified persons 
hurled a bomb at 17 Tuna Avenue, Kizilay. The attack caused the 
security forces and the people who live in the area to be 
alarmed. The bomb exploded in the window of the keeper's 
bedroom in the basement of the building. Luckily no one was 
hurt. 
  An anonymous person called the newspaper SABAH immediately 
after the attack. He said: We assume responsibility for the 
attack on behalf of IGERF. We shall eradicate the roots of the 
freemasons. Our activities will be maintained.

  [Text] Ankara, May 11 (A.A.) -- Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Ferhat Ataman on Wednesday said that claims of security forces 
burning down villages and forcing the population in the 
southeast to emigrate to northern Iraq are all part of a 
previously written ploy aimed at fooling the world. 
  Speaking at his weekly briefing, Ataman strongly denied 
foreign press reports on so-called forced emigration of 3,500 to 
6,000 Turks of Kurdish origin following operations by security 
forces in the region and of villages being burned down. 
  "We knew the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] terrorist 
organization would try to send some of our citizens voluntarily 
or by force to northern Iraq, group them together and present 
them to the foreign press as `Kurds escaping Turkish 
oppression'," Ataman said adding that this action aimed at 
increasing the foreign pressure on Turkey. 
  "The organization has started to transport its sympathizers 
as well as others from the region to northern Iraq in small 
groups and are also aiming to obtain money from the United 
Nations for their own," he said. 
  "The terrorist organization is trying, as ever, to deceive 
the foreign public and stage a new play completely based on its 
own scenario," he said. "It is trying to obtain United Nations 
money through its own supporters in the process." 
  "There is no question of any village being purposefully 
bombarded or destroyed by security forces," he said. "Some of 
the villagers have been already moved to safe regions in order 
to escape PKK terror and there has been some damage in some 
hamlets or villages where the security forces have clashed with 
terrorists." 
  "In these cases, our innocent citizens, as always, are 
compensated by the state," he said.

  [Excerpt] Ankara (AA) -- [passage omitted] Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman replied to a question by an 
ANATOLIA correspondent at the end of a news conference in Ankara 
today. Ataman declared that Turkey welcomes the U.S. State 
Department's report on terrorism in 1993 from two aspects. 
  Ataman said that the fact that the separatist PKK [Workers 
Party of Kurdistan] organization was described as a terrorist 
organization in the report shows that the message Turkey wishes 
to convey to the world is being received, particularly in the 
United States. 
  The spokesman noted that it is extremely important that 
world 
public opinion recognize the true nature of the separatist 
organization. 
  Secondly, Ataman remarked, the report identifies the 
separatist organization as the main reason for the increase in 
world terrorism last year. He added: "This is also a very 
important point." 
  Ataman stated that if certain other countries start sharing 
the same view regarding the separatist terrorist organization, 
this will constitute a very important development in the 
struggle against terrorism. 
  The section of the report concerning Turkey also listed 
Dev-Sol [Revolutionary Left] as a terrorist organization.

  [Excerpts] Al-Tikriti, Iraq's ambassador to Turkey and a 
relative of Saddam Husayn, said that Turkey should cooperate 
with Iraq to establish [kurulmasi--no negative as published] a 
Kurdish state in the region. 
  Ambassador al-Tikriti said: "The project of creating a 
Kurdish state incorporating Iraq and Turkey is Britain's. The 
United States supports this project." 
  He gave assurances to Turkey, saying: "If the Hammer Force 
leaves, we will not allow even a single PKK [Kurdish Workers 
Party] militant to take shelter in northern Iraq." [passage 
omitted] 
  Noting that prior to the Gulf crisis no such tension and 
disorder existed in the region, al-Tikriti said that at the time 
Iraq gave importance to Turkey's security. Asking "where was 
the PKK before the Gulf crisis?" al-Tikriti said: "The PKK will 
vanish if the Hammer Force leaves and the oil pipeline is 
opened. At present, the PKK is being protected and sheltered by 
the Kurds in northern Iraq. Ask the Hammer Force to leave. Once 
the Hammer Force leaves, our government will restore authority 
in the region. Not even one single PKK militant will remain in 
northern Iraq. PKK is a terror organization. Besides, Turkey's 
security is important to us." 
  Asked what Iraq's position towards the Kurds will be once 
the 
Hammer Force leaves, al-Tikriti replied: "We gave official 
guarantees to Ozal in the past, and later to Demirel. We told 
them that we would not oppress the Kurds."

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Colombian guerrilla activities monitored through 16 
May. 
  A Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia [FARC] member died 
on 9 May in a clash with troops of the Pijaos Counterguerrilla 
Battalion in Villarrica, Tolima Department. The Army discovered 
a camp where the subversives had stored war materiel. 
  A woman was killed during clashes between the Francisco 
Caraballo Group and the San Mateo Battalion of Pereira and the 
Ayacucho Battalion of Manizales near Batero Hill in the rural 
area of Quinchia Municipality, Risaralda Department. 
  Police dealt another blow to the urban guerrilla networks in 
Medellin when they discovered 100 kg of dynamite hidden 
underground in the Blanquizal neighborhood. The Army also 
reported the discovery of other caches containing arms and 
explosives in rural areas of Sabana de Torres and San Vicente de 
Chucuri. FARC member Jorge Leonel Pineda Moreno, alias Leo, was 
captured. The authorities reported that the dynamite belonged 
to the Bolivarian Militias and was going to be used to sabotage 
the upcoming elections. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 
10 May 94 p 8a) 
  Military sources in Santa Fe de Bogota reported on 14 May 
that about 249 guerrillas died and another 726 were captured in 
operations conducted between January and April this year. 
According to a detailed report presented by 10 generals to the 
Army Command, only 90 soldiers died in the 221 counterinsurgency 
operations carried out in that period. Since January, the 
military institution has seized 6,285 kg of explosives, 121,673 
cartridges of various calibers, and 1,235 firearms from the 
rebels. The source added that 73 guerrilla camps and six 
communications centers were discovered during the same period. 
(Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1803 GMT 14 May 94) 
  The Guerrilla Coordinating Board burned six rural 
transportation vehicles at various checkpoints along the San 
Pedro de Uraba-Turbo Highway over the weekend. The vehicles 
were owned by former guerrillas who now belong to the Hope, 
Peace, and Liberty Movement. The Francisco Caraballo Group has 
been blamed for the attacks. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in 
Spanish 15 May 94 p 8a)

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 14 May (NOTIMEX) -- The Army has 
revealed that it found at least five remote-controlled bombs, 
which guerrillas planned to set off today against the helicopter 
of Santander Department Governor Juan Carlos Duarte. According 
to the military report, the bombs had been planted by the rebels 
on the runway at the terminal area of Malaga, located some 370 
km from Santa Fe de Bogota. Governor Duarte and his entourage 
were scheduled to land in Malaga. 
  According to Army sources, after the bombs were detected in 
Malaga, authorities decided to divert Duarte's plane. The 
source added that five suspects were captured in connection with 
this failed action. 
  The Simon Bolivar National Guerrilla Coordinating Board 
[CNGSB], made up of 12,000 combatants, is engaged in an 
offensive to hinder the 29 May presidential elections. As a 
result, the incident in Malaga has not been ruled out to be 
associated with the sabotage campaign by the CNGSB. The report 
indicates that the Army of National Liberation -- a CNGSB group 
-- operates in the Garcia Rovira area, where the attempt against 
Duarte was planned. 
  Duarte, who was preparing to inaugurate various social 
welfare projects in the area, said that despite the failed 
attempt, he will continue touring the department. Santander is 
among the most unstable departments nationwide. 
  According to the source, the Army arrested four guerrillas 
and seized weapons and political propaganda in Antioquia 
Department during operations to guarantee normal elections on 29 
May. 
  The CNGSB two years ago chose not to participate in peace 
negotiations held by the government of President Cesar Gaviria 
in Tlaxcala, Mexico because of disagreements on the agenda to be 
discussed.

<F P=106> [Report by Gerardo Roman] </F>
  [Text] In the middle of the guerrilla crisis caused by the 
Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] in Chiapas, the 
National Security and Investigation Center requested that 
various military and police corps create an Antiterrorist Group 
[Grupo Antiterrorista -- GAT] with agents' selection to be based 
on a criteria of high levels of training and skills. 
  Among the institutions that were asked to cooperate are the 
Federal Judicial Police, the "Foxes" [Zorros] squadron of the 
Secretariat of Roads and Safety, the Army, the presidential 
staff, and the Federal District's Judicial Police. 
  According to statements by several GAT members and sources 
close to institutions involved, approximately 300 specialized 
agents were trained by instructors from the United States, 
Spain, and Argentina. 
  Police sources reported the objective of GAT was to create 
an 
organization to end terrorism, kidnappings, and prolonged 
guerrilla violence such as bomb explosions in various cities of 
the country. 
  GAT members took courses on explosives, explosives 
investigations, assaults on installations, intelligence, and 
photography. They received training to infiltrate organizations 
such as the Independent Proletariat Movement, the Revolutionary 
Workers Party, the Peasant-People Union Movement, and the EZLN. 
  Approximately 15 days ago, the agents were summoned to the 
National Security Center to launch an antiterrorist operation 
and, according to sources, they would be deployed in groups in 
the States of Guerrero, Michoacan, Oaxaca, Jalisco, Chiapas, and 
the Federal District and its contiguous urban areas.

  [Text] Tapachula (Mexico), 15 May (EFE) -- Journalist 
sources today reported that a bomb damaged a section of railroad 
tracks a few kilometers from Tapachula, Chiapas State, 1,300 km 
south of Mexico City. The explosion destroyed 10 meters of 
track and left a hole 2 meters in diameter, interrupting 
railroad traffic. 
  Soldiers and federal and state judicial police arrived on 
the 
scene and established area controls while National Railroad of 
Mexico personnel inspected the route for other bombs. 
  The Army arrested a group of people from Central America who 
were near the site of the explosion -- four Salvadorans, seven 
Guatemalans, and one Honduran -- who remained under judicial 
police arrest. 
  Nearby residents said that the bomb was homemade and that it 
was intended to destroy a nearby bridge, although authorities 
are still examining what was left of the device.

  [Text] The only place where the MRTA [Tupac Amaru 
Revolutionary Movement] still has some strength is the central 
jungle. There it has a column that is allegedly headed by 
Nestor Serpa Cartolini himself, and which allegedly has a 
considerable number of weapons, according to two MRTA chiefs 
arrested by the Dincote [National Counterterrorism Directorate] 
and presented to the media on 6 May. 
  The area of influence of this armed group is located between 
La Merced, Satipo, and Pichis, and in the jungle in Junin and 
Pasco Departments. There they continue to carry out attacks, 
although these are not as harmful as those carried out in the 
past. 
  In the January and February issues of the MRTA mouthpiece LA 
VOZ REBELDE, the MRTA claims responsibility for several attacks, 
most of them in the central jungle, a few in the north, and a 
few in Lima. 
  However, the group that acted in the north was deactivated 
with the arrest of Juan Antonio Leon Montero, aka "Perseo," 
member of the MRTA national directorate. 
  The MRTA also suffered harsh blows in Lima, especially last 
month with the Alacran 3 Operation carried out by the second 
Dincote division, which arrested Emilio Villalobos Alva, aka 
"Celso" or "Polo," and nearly all the members of its "Special 
Forces" -- a detachment that specialized in kidnappings and in 
collecting protection money from businessmen. 
  Dincote said that 20 MRTA bases in Peru have so far been 
dismantled. In face of this the MRTA members who no longer have 
a regional command have retreated to Lima and to the Central 
Jungle area, as well as to Jaen and the surroundings of Huancayo. 
  This means that there currently remain only four MRTA 
bastions. The main one is in the central jungle. Those in Jaen 
and Huancayo are unstable, and the command in Lima is trying to 
recover the time lost, this time under the command of the number 
two man of the MRTA: Miguel Rincon Rincon. 
  Dincote has said that in general terms, the MRTA forces are 
disbanding. 
  For example, the members of the "Martin La Torre Escalante" 
platoon that carried out actions south of Peru, especially in 
Puno, are fleeing to Bolivia, where MRTA leader Sonia Cuentas 
supports them. 
  This platoon, which bears the name of one of the terrorists 
who died in the Los Molinos operation in 1989, is headed by 
Justino Soto Vargas, aka "Lucho Chico," among others 
  The MRTA members who remained in Trujillo and Chiclayo have 
retreated to Jaen. Many MRTA members of Lima have also 
emigrated to Tarma and Junin. 
  According to the documents that were found, the MRTA plans 
to 
take what remains of its military forces to La Convencion 
(Cuzco), and Aguaytia (Ucayali). 
  According to Dincote detectives, this is a strategic retreat 
with the purpose of recovering the control of the coca producing 
zones as well as the financing for their actions. 
  Given the action of the forces of order, the MRTA has lost a 
lot of its area of influence at a national level, especially in 
the Huallaga region and in other coca producing zones that 
constituted its emporium and had become its base of actions. 
  Now it will be very difficult for the MRTA members to return 
to these zones, not only because of the Armed Force's actions, 
but also because the voids it left were quickly occupied by the 
Shining Path.

<F P=106> [Article by Carlos Aponte, a correspondent in Tingo Maria] </F>
  [Excerpt] Interior Ministry intelligence analysts estimated 
the fortune amassed by Oscar Alberto Ramirez, aka "President 
Feliciano," at $200 million through kickbacks paid by gangs of 
drug traffickers operating in the area known as the coca belt 
region, which is located along the jungle. 
  According to these analysts, who are conducting an 
investigation in the region, Ramirez started to collect this 
money -- which accounts for one-third of the total flow moved 
through the marketing of cocaine paste in the region under 
Shining Path [SL] control; that is, $600 million -- a few months 
before the arrest of Abimael Guzman. 
  Ramirez managed to do this despite the fact that the SL has 
lost control of major drug centers such as Crespo, Castillo, 
Pueblo Nuevo, Pacayacu, Loro, and recently -- as a result of 
Operation "Aries" -- Mohena, Moyuna, Venenillo, Mongon, and 
Ancayacu, among others. 
  By contrast, cassava, rice, corn, and other legal crops have 
yielded only $30 million. 
  Through disclosures made by repentant drug traffickers at 
the 
303d Battalion on the Huallaga Front, it has been learned that 
"Feliciano," "El Manco," and other SL leaders who deal with the 
drug traffickers have permanent ground-air contact through 
powerful receivers, portable transmitters, and using coded 
messages. 
  Huallaga Front strategists believe Operation "Aries" 
prompted 
the suspension of flights by Colombian planes in the Leoncio 
Prado (Huanuco) and Padre Abad (Ucayali) areas. 
  Despite the information obtained by counterintelligence 
agents from repented former SL leaders and peasants forced to 
work for the SL for some time, there is no firm clue as to the 
place where the fortune Ramirez amassed by exacting kickbacks 
from drug traffickers is hidden. 
  There is evidence, however, that drug traffickers and SL 
members circulate large amounts of dollars through local 
branches of banks and financial companies. The fact is that not 
all the proceeds from drug sales are "laundered" in Lima by 
individual money exchangers or through investments in legally 
constituted companies. 
  There are several financial companies competing for 
narcodollars along the coca belt region. According to 
intelligence sources, no one should be surprised if "Feliciano" 
made large deposits through a front, if he is keeping a major 
portion of the money, or he distributed it through his closest 
aides and henchmen. 
  The truth is that the money is concentrated in few hands 
because those terrorists who are clashing with security forces 
-- the ones called the "rank-and-file" -- are poorly fed, 
dressed in rags, and suffering from contagious diseases such as 
scabies, tuberculosis, and cholera. 
  Some repented SL leaders who were recently captured admitted 
that most of those now following "El Manco" have absolutely no 
morale, that they are following him out of fear for their 
families who have been kidnapped by the SL, which has threatened 
to murder them. 
  It has been reported that drug shipments have been suspended 
after the dismantling of the so-called "Red Sea" battalion and 
as a result of the capture and/or surrender of many subversives 
and the action of antisubversive forces at the Ucayali Navy 
base. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Lima, 16 May (EFE) -- A car bomb exploded today, 
Monday, in front of the door of the Bank of Credit in San Borja 
district in Lima. There were no reports of injuries. 
  The explosion affected nearby shops and residences, and the 
police have cordoned off the area to establish the amount of 
explosives used. 
  The car used to perpetrate the attack was a 1970 "Hillman" 
that was stolen yesterday from a noncommissioned police officer. 
  Another car bomb exploded on 15 May in the Miraflores 
residential district, causing damage to a pension fund building 
and to nearby shops and residences, but there were no reports of 
injuries, either. 
  The series of attacks are attributed to the armed Maoist 
group Shining Path, on the eve of 17 May, the 14th anniversary 
of its first attack. Since then more than 30,000 have died and 
$20 million have been reported in losses caused by attacks or 
acts of sabotage.

  [Excerpts] Lima, 13 May (EFE) -- The bomb attacks 
perpetrated in Lima last night have made people fear a new 
outbreak of terrorist actions in the next few days, to mark the 
14th anniversary of the beginning of Shining Path's [SL] 
subversive activities. 
  The Maoist group perpetrated its first attack on 17 May 
1980, 
and since then more than 30,000 people have died as a result of 
political violence. 
  Several explosions last night shook the offices of local 
banks in the districts of Surquillo, San Martin de Porres, San 
Juan de Lurigancho, and Brena and in the industrial zone in 
Lima, wounding at least four people and causing material damage. 
  These attacks follow similar ones that occurred between 4 
and 
5 May in Villa Militar, in the coastal Lima district of 
Chorillos, at bank branches and at an office of the public 
enterprise Electro Lima. 
  Since then security forces have stepped up patrolling in 
Lima 
and in the port of Callao, as a preventive measure in case a 
wave of terrorism takes place on the SL anniversary. 
  The National Counterterrorism Directorate (Dincote) has 
expressed fear that the Maoist group could unleash a wave of 
attacks and crimes in Lima, ordered by its current leader Oscar 
Ramirez Durand, aka "Feliciano." [passage omitted] 
  The SL celebrates its 14th anniversary in the midst of 
internal divisions, and weakened by the harassment of the Armed 
Forces, which since 5 April have been conducting a new offensive 
against the subversive columns in the jungle area of Huanuco 
Department. 
  The SL's attacks are no longer as fierce as they were before 
the arrest of its main leader [Abimael Guzman] on 12 September 
1992. 
  Political violence has caused 30,215 deaths in Peru since 
1980, of which 14,239 are alleged terrorists, 12,932 civilians, 
and 2,737 member of the security forces, as well as 307 drug 
traffickers. This information was published by the magazine 
PERUPAZ of the Constitution and Society Institute.

  [Text] Six months after it was signed Shining Path [SL] 
has made public the often reported third letter from prison of 
Abimael Guzman, which President Fujimori wanted to regard as an 
offer for SL to surrender and lay down their arms. [President

<H5>  Text of Letter </H5>
<H8>  APPEAL </H8>
  COMRADES OF THE PERUVIAN COMMUNIST PARTY FIGHTERS OF THE 
PEOPLE'S GUERRILLA ARMY COMRADES AMONG THE MASSES 
  As communists, applying our specific ideology of Marxism, 
Leninism, Maoism, and the thoughts of Gonzalo and reflecting 
almost exclusively and intensely on these problems for the past 
year, we have reached the following conclusions in the 
preparation of a "concrete analysis of the concrete situation." 
  For more than 13 years, we have carried on a people's war as 
the greatest social movement in Peruvian history. As a result, 
Maoism has been defined as the third, new, and higher phase of 
Marxism. The prestige and impact of the party has been raised to 
the highest point. We have gained immense and mainly positive 
experience in the service of the World Proletarian Revolution. 
We have achieved this, like everything in life, through great 
and heroic efforts and have had our successes and failures. 
Nevertheless, we must look clearly and profoundly at the 
situation which we face at present and its foreseeable 
prospects. The facts show that the present government has made 
objective progress in carrying out its tasks, especially since 
the events of 5 April 1992, which clearly was necessary for the 
Peruvian state to do. Thus, it has established foundations for 
the economic process and has carried out adjustments in the 
state. And, what applies to us more directly, it has prepared a 
systematic, coherent, and well-developed strategy at different 
levels, particularly in the field of intelligence, achieving 
real successes, principally through the capture of cadres and 
leaders, among them myself. Clearly, this is the most important 
success achieved by the Peruvian state during the past 13 years 
of war. In this way it has favorably prepared the course which 
the present government is following. 
  Meanwhile, on our side real problems have been growing. New, 
complex, and very serious problems have arisen in world 
politics, in the situation in which the country finds itself, 
and in the war which is unfolding. All of these questions have 
raised fundamental leadership problems for the Peruvian 
Communist Party. Nevertheless, the party has been dealt its 
hardest blow in terms of its leadership. As proletarian 
revolutionaries we know very well and must keep in mind the fact 
that a people's war, starting from the realities facing it, 
requires certain, essential conditions to succeed. It needs 
proletarian leadership, a mass base, strategic centralization, a 
prolonged war, a new type of army, and a favorable international 
situation. It is clear that this last condition does not exist. 
However, the first condition is the principal one and from it 
flow the others. Therefore, a people's war is essentially a 
question of political leadership. The question of leadership is 
decisive. In our case this question cannot be resolved in a 
timely way. 
  Consequently, the facts show that the prospects facing the 
people's war are not its expansion but simply keeping it going. 
  On the basis of what has been said above and under the 
present circumstances, the party and principally its leadership 
are being faced with the need to make a new and great decision. 
In the past we carried on our struggle by beginning a people's 
war. Today, with equal firmness and determination we must fight 
for a peace agreement as an unavoidable, historic necessity. 
This also makes it necessary to suspend activities related to 
the people's war, except those involving self defense. There is 
a corresponding requirement that the Peruvian state suspend its 
military activities and not make reprisals of any class or kind. 
Once this previous question is resolved, we can proceed to 
drafting a Peace Agreement, whose implementation will lead to 
the end of the 13-year war which the country has been waging. 
These are historic decisions which the party must make now, 
particularly considering that peace has become a necessity for 
the people, the nation, and Peruvian society as a whole. Peace 
will serve to unite the people, for the people, notwithstanding 
the differences among them, are united by a profound, common 
interest. 
  We are taking this extremely important step in carrying out 
our responsibilities. We are absolutely certain of the need for 
doing this, as communists, as maoists, and as soldiers of the 
proletariat, even committing ourselves to serve as one of the 
parties guaranteeing the implementation of the peace agreement. 
  We call on all party comrades, and particularly on its 
cadres 
and leaders, on the fighters, on the masses, and principally on 
the left wing of the party who seek, in close union with us, to 
hold high and to apply this new, just, and correct decision. It 
relates to the position of the proletariat and to the interests 
of the working class and the people. 
  22 September 1993 
  PRESIDENT GONZALO 
  On Friday afternoon, 8 April, a videocassette and the 
typewritten text of a document reached the editorial offices of 
SI. According to those who sent it, this was the third letter of 
Abimael Guzman Reynoso. This was the letter whose public 
distribution was announced by President Alberto Fujimori on 
several occasions shortly before the referendum of 31 October 
1993. However, this letter was never published and nothing 
further was said about it. 
  Some six months later in April 1994, sources identified as 
relatives of Shining Path [SL] personnel held in prison sent to 
certain publications, including SI, a document which, they 
state, is a true copy of the third letter of Abimael Guzman 
Reynoso. 
  The document, together with a video recording in which two 
hooded SL members appear reading it, presents some problems in 
terms of timing. The document is dated 22 September 1993, or 
prior to the date of the second letter (6 October 1993). As this 
is a typewritten document, there may have been a typographic 
error. The first letter was dated 15 September 1993. As far as 
the rest of the third letter is concerned, the contents appear 
to be genuine. 
  If the letter is genuine, it would confirm that, in effect, 
when the president let slip a remark concerning the possibility 
that there was a third letter from the leader of SL, this letter 
had already been written. 
  President Fujimori's clear objective at that time was to 
make 
the point that Abimael Guzman sent this third letter, not to 
him, but rather to the SL forces. He wanted the leader of the 
subversives specifically to admit in the letter that he had 
surrendered and to call on his followers to lay down their arms. 
  As indicated from a reading of the letter, this third 
communication from Abimael Guzman, which has now been made 
public, did not include those conditions and did not satisfy the 
demands of the president. 
  One of the SL family members said: "Therefore, President 
Fujimori did not agree with it." 
  And, therefore, the president and the National Intelligence 
Service (SIN) simply filed the letter. 
<H5>  Summary of the Contents </H5>
  In the third letter from Abimael Guzman the following, basic 
ideas are contained: 

  -  It reaffirms and provides a basis for his proposal for a 
peace agreement. 
  -  It reaffirms his Marxist, Leninist, Maoist ideology. 
  -  It seeks to vindicate the role played by 13 years of a 
people's 
war. 
  -  It recognizes that the government has made progress since 5 
April 1992, particularly in the fight against subversion. 
  -  It points out serious problems on the world scene. 
  -  It describes the problem of proletarian leadership as 
decisive. 
  -  It calls the proposed peace agreement a great decision and a 
national need. 
  -  It confirms the fact that the SL movement is wholly committed 
to the search for a peace agreement. 


    However, it says nothing about SL surrendering and laying 
down its arms. 
  A Shining Path spokesman states that conversations with the 
government have been broken off. It is known that they were cut 
off after the referendum of 31 October 1993. The spokesman added 
that the "representatives" of the SL leadership who were sent to 
the leaders in prison have returned to the original places where 
they were being held. 
  The SL spokesman said: "The government is going to continue 
to do everything possible to prevent a peace agreement from 
being drafted. A peace agreement does not suit its interests. 
The idea was used for election purposes. However, we see it as a 
necessity, not only for us, but for the country." 
  Everything seems to indicate that, after contacting its 
leaders in prison, the supporters of Abimael Guzman in SL have 
gone out into the streets. Outside the walls of the prisons the 
most stubborn and recalcitrant elements of SL, who reject the 
idea of a peace agreement, control most of the organization. The 
Metropolitan Committee of SL [in Lima] holds a contrary view, as 
do the higher leadership bodies, which are effectively 
controlled by Comrade "Feliciano." 
  Family members of those in prison, trade union officials, or 
isolated leaders outside the leadership bodies are distributing 
the peace proposal. According to our SL informant, they are 
finding a positive reception, particularly among the rank and 
file members who have participated directly in the war. The 
"intellectuals" are most opposed to a peace agreement. We asked 
if this term refers to SL members in the universities. We were 
told, "Yes." 
  The SL cadre seems to have a clear understanding of their 
position. 
  He admitted: "The boss has been captured. The rest are easy 
meat. The organization right now is like a boat without a 
rudder. And to resume an active life again, there has to be 
another person, equal to or more capable than the leader who is 
in prison, to take over this responsibility." (He was referring 
to "President Gonzalo.") 
  A family member who spoke in the metaphoric language of a SL 
cadre stated: "The waters have to be constantly in motion. If 
they quiet down, everything falls apart. We have to expand, but 
now we are just keeping up the present level of activity." He 
concluded: "The war has to be ended, because now it leads 
nowhere." 
  Despite the fact that President Fujimori does not show the 
same interest in a peace agreement as he did before the 
referendum of 31 October 1993, fighting for this proposal (which 
is too general) is a new contradiction which SL is discussing.

<F P=106> [Article by Jalal Duwaydar: "Solidarity To Abort Foreign </F>
Funding of Terrorism"] 
  [Excerpts] There may be a gray cloud over Egyptian-Kuwaiti 
relations as a result of some irresponsible behavior by certain 
groups or societies, either through good intentions or bad, on 
the pretext that they are working for the Islamic call, even if 
this conflicts with the values, principles, and tolerance of the 
religion. No one can actually claim that the official Kuwaiti 
organs are responsible for this behavior or that they know of it. 
  Our brilliant Kuwaiti colleague, Ahmad al-Jarallah, writer 
for AL-SIYASAH newspaper, wrote an article about this issue, 
which has been republished by AKHBAR AL-YAWM. He linked the 
fact that President Mubarak did not visit Kuwait on his journey 
home from China to the material and propaganda support the 
terrorist movements are getting from certain religious societies. 
  Perhaps al-Jarallah's analysis is correct, or perhaps it 
exaggerates. But there is no doubt that he supports his view 
well by referring to the incident in which a Kuwaiti citizen who 
has close links with a famous Kuwaiti Islamic society arrived in 
Cairo with thousands of dollars that he was going to spend in a 
suspicious way. He claimed that the money was to be used to 
publish some books. [see item NC3004193394 in 5 May Terrorism 
Report] [passage omitted] 
  The fact that the security organs found large amounts of 
foreign currency in some terrorist dens has raised questions 
about its sources. 
  It was also natural that there is a growing conviction that 
there is foreign funding to buy weapons, pay agents, and spend 
set up and carry out terrorist crimes. 
  It is no secret to anyone that in some Arab countries that 
hide behind the cloak of Islam, the religion of justice, some 
groups and societies are soliciting funds from their citizens on 
the pretext of helping Bosnia or Afghanistan, since Islam is a 
just religion. But these funds are actually being used to 
support and bolster terrorists directly or indirectly. [passage 
omitted] 
  As for the heir apparent of Kuwait, Sa'd al-'Abdallah, he 
spoke with great zeal about the strong fraternal relations 
between Egypt and Kuwait. When discussion turned to the Kuwaiti 
citizens' enthusiasm for visiting Egypt, he said in very clear 
terms that the Kuwaiti Government cannot and will not allow any 
Kuwaiti citizen to misbehave in Egypt or to commit any act that 
harms its security and stability. He affirmed that the Kuwaiti 
Government, which he heads, is ready to take the strictest 
measures possible against any Kuwaiti citizen who entertains 
ideas of this kind or violates the law. [passage omitted]

Yusuf, commander of the Palestinian police force in Gaza, said 
today that the police has no intention of clashing with the

  [Excerpts] Dr. Musa Abu-Marzuq, the chief of Hamas' 
Political Bureau, has reaffirmed that resisting the occupation 
is a strategic option for Hamas until the occupation is defeated 
and all Palestinian lands are liberated, primarily Jerusalem, 
the capital of Palestine and the land of the prophet's ascension 
to heavens and of all holy sites. [passage omitted] 
  Answering a question about the relationship between Hamas 
and 
the alliance of the 10 factions, Abu-Marzuq said: We have a 
good relationship despite recent reports casting doubt on this 
relationship, which will remain pivotal for us. 
  Abu-Marzuq further stressed that Hamas seeks to develop this 
relationship so the alliance can undertake its important jihad 
role to defeat the Oslo and Cairo accords, as an indispensable 
step before resuming the plan of liberation. 
  Abu-Marzuq, who had just heard about the unjust Zionist 
bombing of the [Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine] 
General Command positions in al-Na'imah, expressed his sympathy 
and solidarity with the heroes of the General Command, saying: 
We complement each other in the same trench and course. 
[passage omitted] 
  On the fate of the 10 factions that oppose the settlement if 
a Syrian-Israeli agreement is reached, Abu-Marzuq said he rules 
out the possibility of such agreement in the short run, 
considering the solid Syrian position. He stressed, however, 
that the major organizational body of Hamas is inside the 
occupied territories. Therefore, it remains free from influence 
by any Palestinian or Arab agreements. 
  Commenting on the entry of the Palestinian police force into 
Gaza and Jericho, Abu-Marzuq said: These forces are from the 
sons of the Palestinian people and some of them fought heroic 
battles for liberation. Therefore, we will welcome their 
presence among the people there as long as they are protecting 
the people's security. This position will change if these forces 
change their attitude and turn into political forces to suppress 
strugglers and opponents from various national and Islamic 
political currents and persuasions.

  [Excerpt] The Central Command of the anti-'Arafat 
coalition of the 10 factions has decided to transfer its 
operations to the occupied Palestinian territories to defeat the 
Oslo accord and its offshoots. The 10 factions plan to achieve 
this through mobilizing the masses in the territories to defeat, 
expose, and isolate the accord. 
  This was decided at a meeting held by the Central Command 
last Wednesday [11 May]. The five-hour meeting addressed the 
latest developments, particularly the Cairo agreement, ways to 
respond to the recent developments, activating confrontation 
with the enemy, and the situation of the Palestinians in 
Lebanon. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Moscow, 19 May (ITAR-TASS) -- A terrorist attack 
against Russian citizens took place in Algeria yesterday. As a 
result three people died and five were injured, said Grigoriy 
Karasin, director of the Russian Foreign Ministry's information 
and press department, at a briefing today. He named the dead as 
Baturin, Petkevich, and Chenchikov. 
  According to him, a bus carrying 25 Russian citizens was 
traveling from the town of Jijel to the airport in the country's 
capital. Near the village of Ziam the bus was attacked. Eleven 
servicemen of the Algerian army who were guarding the convoy of 
Russian specialists died in the fight. G. Karasin said that the 
terrorists sustained heavy losses. 
  Viktor Posuvalyuk, director of the Near East and North 
Africa 
department of the Russian Foreign Ministry, had a meeting today 
with the ambassador of the Democratic and Popular Republic of 
Algeria in Moscow. He raised in no uncertain terms the question 
of stepping up security measures to the utmost for Russian 
citizens in Algeria and requested an immediate inquiry into the 
circumstances of this tragic incident. 
  G. Karasin emphasized that a whole series of additional 
arrangements have been made at the initiative of the Russian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs to increase the security of our 
specialists living and working in Algeria. Specifically, the 
total number of Russian Federation citizens in the Democratic 
and Popular Republic of Algeria has been halved to around 1,100 
people. The majority of wives and children of our specialists 
have left Algeria. 
  The Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs told 
Russian ministries and departments which have their own people 
in Algeria and specialists working at economic cooperation sites 
outside the capital of Algeria, as well as Russian Federation 
citizens in the country on private contracts that security 
measures need to be observed to the utmost and that personal 
discipline and organization need to be stepped up.

al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah said Saturday it had shot dead three 
policemen and wounded a fourth in the Asyut region, a 
fundamentalist stronghold in southern Egypt. 
  A statement sent to AFP from the group's armed wing said 
that 
Friday's two attacks were "part of a series planned to revenge 
the murder" on April 25 of Tal'at Yasin, the organisation's 
military leader. 
  It added they were also a warning to those who "killed the 
martyr 'Abd-al-Harith Madani" who died in detention at the end 
of April. 
  On Thursday the public prosecutor's office said initial 
autopsies showed Madani had been tortured to death. [passage

  [Excerpts] Cairo, 14 May (MENA)--An official security 
source at the Interior Ministry today announced that the 
security forces raided 11 hideouts at the same time in the 
Governorates of Cairo, al-Jizah, Ismailia, al-Daqahliyah, and 
al-Qalyubiyah arresting the associates of terrorist Tal'at Yasin 
Hammam, the leader of the terrorist groups. They represent the 
command group, which includes the base of the organization's 
military wing in the central region, and the officials in charge 
of surveillance, finance, liaison, and implementation. 
  In the security campaigns, seven modern vehicles of various 
types were seized. One of those cars was used in the 
assassination of martyr Major General Ra'uf Khayrat in al-Haram 
on 9 April and another in the attack against the officers of Abu 
Za'bal prison on 26 March, when explosive charges were thrown at 
them on the Cairo- Ismailia agricultural road. 
  When residences of members of the command and implementation 
groups were searched, large amounts of explosive, chemical, and 
incendiary materials were found along with some sketches and 
information about officials on the assassination list and some 
cash. [passage omitted] 
  The source said that in light of information gathered from 
close surveillance of some terrorists abroad and their contacts 
inside the country, the State Security Intelligence managed to 
define the general picture of the terrorists' activity and of 
certain internal organizations trying to support those 
terrorists and push them to implement their various operations. 
[passage omitted] 
  The security forces extended the arrest operations to 
include 
those responsible for liaison and conveying assignments from the 
leaders of the organization inside prisons to leaders outside. 
It became certain that this liaison mission was carried out by 
two lawyers who used their profession to serve their secret 
organizational activities. One of these is lawyer 
'Abd-al-Harith Muhammad Ibrahim Madani, who was arrested and 
accused in connection with several extremist cases in Isna in 
the Governorate of Qina. Investigations and seized 
organizational documents proved that he was also in charge of 
financing the organization from funds he received from the 
leader of these groups, Tal'at Muhammad Yasin Hammam. 
  The source said the suspect distributed sums amounting to 
45,000 Egyptian pounds and $3,000. 
  The security source pointed out that this suspect is one of 
the dangerous terrorist elements that played a prominent role in 
the recent terrorist acts. He was arrested on 3 July 1990 for 
his dangerous activity in the terrorist groups, and in the same 
year he, along with others, were charged with attacking citizens 
in Isna and preventing them from visiting cemeteries. He was 
also accused in Case No. 4116 in 1991 in Isna, when he was 
arrested for distributing leaflets promoting extremist thought 
and inciting violence. 
  The source said the High State Security Prosecution issued a 
warrant for his arrest for his involvement in Case No. 235 of 
1994-high state security, concerning the military wing of the 
terrorist groups organization, which is currently being examined. 
  The security source said that the defendants told State 
Security Prosecution investigators that Madani was their link to 
the group's leader, Hammam. Madani was also in charge of 
communication between the group's imprisoned and free leaders, a 
task he performed under cover of his work as a lawyer and on the 
orders of Hammam. 
  The source said that the defendants' confessions also show 
that Madani was in charge of the finances of the group. 
Investigators have learned of seven instances in which Madani 
received funds from abroad totalling 45,000 Egyptian pounds and 
$3,000. The entire sum was used to finance the group's 
terrorist activities. 
  Security forces arrested Madani on the night of 26 April at 
his office in al-Haram, the source said. They took him along as 
they searched his home in al-Talibiyah in al-Haram. There 
security sources seized documents and other material. While the 
security forces were leading Madani to his second residence in 
Warraq al-'Arab, which they intended to search, he experienced 
difficulty in breathing and lost consciousness. He was 
instantly taken to the al-Manyal al-Jami'i hospital for 
treatment, where doctors diagnosed his case as severe asthma and 
kept him in the hospital for treatment. The next day, 27 April, 
the hospital notified us that the defendant had died of lung 
failure, a complication of severe asthma, the source said. 
  The security source added that the State Security 
Intelligence forces continued to act on the information they had 
already gathered. Acting in cooperation with other security 
organs, they prepared plans to raid 25 hideouts of the military 
wing of the extremist terrorist groups in farm and mountain 
areas in the Asyut and Suhaj Governorates. 
  In these hideouts, the security forces seized four automatic 
weapons, a pistol, 1,600 7.62-mm rounds, 300 9-mm rounds, 18 kg 
of TNT, 29 detonators, six timers, and electric wiring devices. 
The raids also led to the arrest of the deputy leader of the 
military wing of the terrorist groups in south Egypt. The 
officials in charge of communications and accommodations were 
also arrested. So was a group of terrorists wanted by police in 
connection with 40 terrorist attacks against police officials, 
trains, and Nile cruise boats in south Egypt. The defendants 
have been referred to the competent prosecution offices. 
  The individuals who were arrested in these raids confessed 
to 
involvement in the assassination of Asyut Security Commander 
Brigadier General Shirin 'Ali Fahmi; and Lieutenant Colonel 
Mustafa Khalil Tuni and First Lieutenant Zaki Bahjat, both of 
the Asyut Security Department. They also admitted involvement 
in the attack on Bank Abu-Tij in Asyut and the bombing in 
al-Bunuk Square in Asyut, according to the Interior Ministry 
source. 
  The security source noted that as a result of these security 
operations against the leaders, cadres, and members of the 
terrorist elements, 98 leading figures have been arrested and 
approximately 500,000 Egyptian pounds have been seized. In 
addition, a Goryunov machine gun, five automatic weapons, three 
pistols, three Enfield automatic rifles, a Russian-made pistol, 
25 FON [initials as received] bombs, a large quantity of live 
ammunition, 190 kg of highly explosive TNT, a large quantity of 
chemicals, ready-made explosive devices and tools and material 
for making them, fax machines, and wireless telephones have been 
seized. [passage omitted] 
  The source noted that investigations and surveillance 
operations are still underway to arrest the remaining terrorists 
still at large, who include the following important figures: 
Hasan Salih Hasan Mahmud, Hasan al-Sayyid Hamid Khayri, Mahmud 
Muhammad Sa'id Salim, Jamal 'Abd-al- Hamid 'Abd-al-Nasir, 
Hamadah Muhammad Lutfi 'Abd-al-Baqi, Rif'at Zaydan 'Abdallah, 
Islam Ahmad Muhammad Ibrahim al-Ghamri. In addition, there are 
other terrorist elements whose activities are being monitored 
abroad. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Ibrahim Humaydi report: "Hamas Demands Its Founder's </F>
Release"] 
  [Excerpts] Damascus -- The Islamic Resistance Movement 
(Hamas) has demanded the "immediate" release of Shaykh Ahmad 
Yasin, the movement's leader, who has been in the occupation's 
jails for five years. It renewed its rejection of the 
"undertaking statement" which the occupation forces want the 
detainees to sign before they can be released from detention 
centers. 
  A statement issued by Hamas, a copy of which AL-HAYAH's 
Damascus bureau has received, says: [passage omitted] "We 
condemn the obstruction of his receiving medical treatment and 
undergoing surgical operations and the enemy government's 
persistence in refusing to allow a national team to supervise 
Ahmad Yasin's treatment. We hold the Rabin government 
responsible for anything that may happen to him." 
  The movement renewed its absolute rejection of "the 
humiliating document (the undertaking statement) which the enemy 
authorities" say must be signed. The movement said that "while 
Hamas salutes the steadfastness of Palestine's Shaykh and his 
brothers detained in the occupation jails, it stresses that 
their detention will lead only to further escalation and 
resistance against the occupation." [passage omitted]

near Bet Hagay, Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq said he foresees a 
continuation of terror attacks in Judaea, Samaria, and the Qatif

intelligence personnel protect thousands of vehicles driving 
through Judaea and Samaria. He added that roadblocks can only 
prevent terror attacks in their immediate vicinity and that the 
task of providing additional protection for the population falls 
to the Israeli Army and the citizens themselves.

  [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza Strip, May 16 (AFP)-- 
Palestinian police stepped in to save a leading PLO militant 
from being captured by the Israeli army, a senior PLO official 
said Monday. 
  The police intervened late Sunday as Fatah Hawks leader 
Ziyad 
Gharman and nine other activists armed with M16, Uzi, and 
Kalashnikov machine guns, fled an Israeli patrol lying in wait 
on a road between Gaza City and Nusayrat, the official told AFP. 
  The PLO men took refuge in a farmhouse which was surrounded 
by troops. 
  Palestinian police were informed and after intensive talks 
the army agreed to let the men go. 
  The militants were taken to the police headquarters in Gaza 
where a senior Palestinian officer advised them "to stay in 
hiding and not to move" as long as the Israeli army was present 
on the Gaza Strip. 
  The Palestinian police last Wednesday started to take over 
the strip, in line with the May 4 PLO-Israel agreement on 
limited self-rule. 
  "We don't want to lose you in the final moments of the 
occupation," the officer told the Hawks. 
  The Israeli army spokesman said he was unaware of the 
incident.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hizballah Deputy Secretary General Shaykh </F>
Na'im Qasim by unidentified CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY correspondent; 
place, date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Correspondent: Some 
people say that lifting the international cover of the Lebanese 
Forces will also lead to lifting Hizballah's cover, particularly 
the Syrian and Iranian protection, because of the party's links 
to the foreign hostages issue. What is your reaction to that? 
  Qasim: The circumstances that made eyes focus on 
the Lebanese Forces are unique to the Lebanese Forces, the only 
local Lebanese organization that rendered services to the 
Israeli enemy by engaging in domestic sedition. This does not 
apply to Hizballah, which seeks to liberate the land, drive the 
Israeli enemy out of the south and the western al-Biqa', spread 
peace among the people, and serve the community. Hizballah did 
not gain power in the Lebanese arena through dreadful acts; it 
got its status through its sincerity, major sacrifices, and the 
blood of innocent martyrs who served not only the Islamic cause, 
but also the Lebanese cause in the region and helped the free 
people in the Arab and Muslim worlds. [passage omitted] 
  As for the foreign hostages, we repeated several times in 
the 
past that we have absolutely no connection with that file. 
There is no sense in reopening that file, because we settled 
the ramifications of that issue at the time. [passage omitted] 
  As for Hizballah, we do not rely on any international cover 
for our local existence. You say that some people ask whether 
the cover will be lifted from Hizballah now that it has been 
lifted from the Lebanese Forces. The way the West deals with 
Samir Ja'ja' and what he stands for is generally different from 
the way they deal with Hizballah. We are fighters at the 
international level, because we do not tolerate the continued 
occupation of our lands. [passage omitted] 
  Correspondent: Some believe that things will get 
worse if the domestic situation keeps on its current course. 
How does Hizballah view the need to close all domestic files? 
  Qasim: We understand the meaning of balances of 
rights and duties and the need for mutual coexistance. But we 
do not understand this balance to mean taking the innocent with 
the guilty to achieve sectarian equality. Had the Sayyidat 
al-Najat Church crime been committed by Muslims, the same 
measures that were taken against the Lebanese Forces should have 
been taken against Muslims, if they were directly accused. That 
horrible act was committed by a team of Christians, so they have 
to pay the price for harming people, violating a place of 
worship, and terrorizing a sector of the Lebanese people. But 
opening files in every direction is not an objective measure; it 
ruins Lebanon. Whoever makes mistakes and undermines public 
peace must be punished. [passage omitted] 
  The Christians' frustration has objective causes that have 
to 
do with the performance of Christian political leaders. The 
bloody conflicts that raged in the eastern area [of Beirut] as 
part of a power struggle and the way some Christian parties 
dealt with the grassroots level and with Christian citizens led 
to that development and created an atmosphere of frustration 
among Christians in general and the Maronites in particular. 
Those bloody confrontations could have been averted. We in 
Hizballah believe that rectifying that internal situation 
requires that all Lebanese citizens be dealt with on the basis 
of actual developments. These developments require an 
Islamic-Christian openness, free of tribal fanaticism.

<F P=106> [Sandrine Briclot report: "Strange Visit by Libyan </F>
Minister; Victims of Bomb Attack Against UTA DC-10 Protest"] 
  [Excerpt] A (private) visit by Libya's foreign minister to 
Paris this weekend raises pressing questions and indignation on 
the part of families of victims of the bomb attack against UTA's 
DC-10 in September 1989, who criticized Charles Pasqua. 
  What in the world was Libya's foreign minister doing in 
Paris? The mystery remains 48 hours after he left France. 
Although the Libyan Embassy in France and the French Foreign 
Ministry vigorously state that 'Umar al-Muntasir's visit was 
definitely a "private" one, his short stay in Paris is still 
raising controversy. Yesterday, Interior Minister Charles 
Pasqua's comment that he had not been "informed" about this 
visit only added to a general feeling of skepticism. It is 
indeed nothing short of incredible that the interior minister 
would not be aware of the presence in Paris of a member of 
Colonel al-Qadhdhafi's government. Especially in view of the 
fact that Mr. al-Muntasir's visit had been scheduled at least 10 
days earlier, according to both the Libyan Embassy and the 
Foreign Ministry. A transit visa was issued to him by the 
French Embassy in Tripoli before he left for South Africa, where 
he attended Nelson Mandela's swearing in ceremonies. 
  Versions differ as to 'Umar al-Muntasir's time of arrival in 
Paris: either very early on Sunday morning, via a South African 
Airlines flight from Johannesburg, or the day before. And he 
left in the afternoon of the next day [16 May] for Tripoli via 
Tunis. His stay of some 30 hours, or more likely the whole 
weekend, in the French capital raises some major questions: 
What did he do, who did he see, what did he talk about? 
  It is known that 'Umar al-Muntasir stayed in the Crillon 
Hotel, which often accommodates foreign ministers on an official 
visit to France. First question: Who took care of the 
logistics of the Libyan minister's visit? According to 
"reliable sources" of AFP, that would be...Adnan al-Khaskji 
[presumably al-Khashoggi], the prominent Saudi Arabian 
businessman, who reportedly acted as a middleman to ensure the 
informal visit took place smoothly. However, the Libyan Embassy 
firmly denied al-Khaskji's involvement yesterday, stating that 
it alone had made arrangements for the minister's stay. At any 
rate, the embassy could hardly acknowledge any participation 
from the Saudi Arabian, as it would imply that, through its 
foreign minister, Libya may have been trying to negotiate some 
arrangement with the Americans or with the Mossad (Israeli 
intelligence service). 
  More prosaically, the lawyers representing the victims of 
the 
bomb attack against the UTA DC-10, Messrs Levy and Szpiner, are 
convinced that there is a connection between Mr. al-Muntasir's 
visit in Paris and the case they have been working on. The 
airliner exploded in 1989 while flying over Niger, killing 170 
people. The bomb was presumably planted by Libyan terrorists. 
  "Judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere has almost completed his 
investigation," insisted Jean-Paul Levy; "This is why they (the 
Libyans) are getting restless!" The lawyers, who were informed 
about the Libyan minister's visit on Monday night, cannot see 
another explanation for the successive visits to 'Umar 
al-Muntasir's room in the Crillon Hotel by "Adnan al-Khaskji, by 
one of the French lawyers defending the Libyans in the DC-10 
affair, and by British and American businessmen." "The 
pro-Libyan lobby has a lot of clout," says Mr. Levy. "We are 
faced with states and international companies that are eager to 
do business with Libya." 
  It is true indeed that 'Umar al-Muntasir had "no formal 
contact" with French political figures. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Salahuddin Haider and Surender Valasai] </F>
  [Text] Karachi, May 14, A series of bomb blasts in two 
Karachi mosques and hnambargahs [shrines] shook the city on 
Saturday morning. 
  In another incident of violence three persons, including a 
police constable, were killed in firing. 
  The bomb blasts in masjikis and Imahagahs, just when Moharam 
is in the corner, are indicators of dreadful things to come. 
All this appeared to be a part of the design to ignite 
sectarian clashes in the city. 
  Who are the elements behind the sinister plan? The 
authorities must find the answer, and find it quickly. 
  Security agencies have been active in the city, each 
claiming 
that they have been more efficient than the other, in effects to 
restore law and order. But none of these agencies have a clue 
that who are the elements behind these blasts and what are their 
motives. 
  In fact, the police were surprisingly ignorant of the 
incidents, "We are not aware of such incidents. Reports 
appearing in the press are wrong" chaimed a senior police 
officer. 
  Residents, however, said they heard the blasts in the small 
hours of Saturday. The explosions took place in Gulhan-e-Iqbal 
where the Janiat-Uloon-e-Taleemat-e-Islami was the target. A 
hand grenade was hurled at it. 
  In Gulshan-e-Iqhal, Block 4-A where most of the city 
journalists have their houses, the Masjid-e-Taqwa was the 
target. A bomb exploded in its courtyard. No injury was caused 
to anyone. The obvious exercise was to create a scare among 
residents. Syed Fariduddin, 35, District East President of the 
Sipah-e-Sababa, a religious organisation, deadly opposed to Shia 
community, was fired at. He received four bullets and was 
hospitailsed. Simultaneously, agencies fed the newspaper with 
reports that secretarian clashes in Karachi and the rest of 
Sindh were imminent, and that a red alert had been sounded to 
all police and relevant establishments to deal with the 
situation. 
  In the second incident of violence in which three people 
were 
killed some unknown armed young men fired indiscriminately at 
two police constables Sultan Meumood and Badruzzaman at Alfalah 
society near Wireless gate. Sultan Ahmed was killed on the spot 
while his other colleague escaped unhurt. Both constables were 
returning after performing their guard duty at National Bank 
Branch in Alfalah. 
  In another incident, three unidentified dacoits killed a 
chowkider for Bonglow No.S-29, phase II) in Defence area. The 
dacoits gunned down chowkidar after he foiled their dacoity 
attempt by resisting their entry into the house. 
  In yet another incident, unknown snipers killed Mukammad Ali 
in Landhi area this afternoon. Muhammad Javed received bullet 
injuries in Shah Faisal Colony.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Larisa Kislinskaya] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 17 TASS -- One of two blasts ripped the 
air in downtown Moscow where a joint stock society of the closed 
type was located. 
  ITAR-TASS learnt at the Moscow Chief Militia Department that 
an explosive device without a shell went off due to careless 
handling. The society's driver brought it to the office due to 
some reasons. 
  He received several lacerated wounds, and both his hands 
were 
torn away. He soon died from the loss of blood. Militia found 
two cartridges, two electric detonators and two radio 
transmitters at the place of accident. The blast was so 
powerful that the society's door was blown out, and all glass 
was shattered at the house entrance foyer. 
  The second explosion sounded in Moscow's suburb 
(2,Varshavskoye highway). An explosive device was planted into 
a Lada car which belonged to the managing director of the 
Grigori-91 firm. Luckily, there were no casualties. Only the 
Lada car and nearby Zaporozhets car were damaged. Windows were 
shattered at a house. 
  Investigation was started in both cases.

  [Text] Yerevan ("LRAGIR," "AZG" dailies), 
05/17/94--Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze phoned the RA 
[Republic of Armenia] President Levon Ter-Petrosyan and said, 
Georgian authorities will do their best for catching the 
terrorists, who has blown a bomb in the Tbilisi Armenian Drama 
Theater. 
  Georgian Minister of the Interior Aleksander Chikavidze 
accepted the Armenian Charge d'Affaires Levon Kachatryan and 
reported on measures taken for revealing the crime. He hoped 
that this action won't affect the relations between Georgia and 
Armenia. 
  Georgian Procurator General P. Babilashvili and Chairman of 
the Security Service Sh. Kviria are ordered to carry operative 
investigation, periodically reporting its results to the 
President. 
  "AZG" reports, quoting the editor of the "VRASTAN" 
Armenian-language newspaper, published in Tbilisi, Vahan 
Bayburtyan, the information by Western agencies was wrong, and 
nobody was killed as a result of the explosion. According to 
the editor, only 5 persons are now in hospital, 3 of them 
children wounded by glass splinters. Only one of the 5 injured 
is in a heavy [serious] condition. This is Mikhail Hovsepyan, 
61, dance teacher of the theater, who inhaled the hot air of the 
explosion, and burnt his lungs. Doctors are now struggling to 
save his life. Among the injured is the deputy director of the 
theater Rafik Grigoryan. 
  According to Mr. Bayburtyan, the investigation has shown 
that 
the explosive and detonator used were of the same type as those, 
used during the Sadakhlo bridge explosions. This lead is 
probably pointing to Baku. 
  V. Bayburtyan also reported that Georgian President 
Shevardnadze allocated 45-50 million rubles for eliminating the 
consequences of the explosion.

  [Text] Paris, May 18 (AFP) -- French police and Danish 
officials stepped up security around Danish interests in Paris 
on Wednesday in the wake of a blast against a travel agency 
specialised in trips to Denmark, Danish embassy sources said. 
  An anarchist group calling itself the "Revolutionary Cell" 
claimed responsibility Tuesday for an explosives attack on 
Selectours, in southern Paris, saying the blast was to express 
solidarity with a prisoner in Denmark. 
  The typewritten claim sent to AFP said the attack was 
carried 
out "on a travel agency specialising in Denmark and recommended 
by the embassy" out of solidarity with Marc Rudin, held in 
Denmark "in very tough conditions." 
  The agency was slightly damaged by Monday's blast. 
  Besides the embassy, there are several Danish companies in 
Paris as well as a complex on the Champs Elysees including 
restaurants and a cultural centre. 
  "We shall attack Danish interests as long as the claims of 
our comrades in Denmark are not satisfied," the text said 
without elaborating. 
  Rudin, a 48-year-old Swiss national, was sentenced to eight 
years in jail in 1993 by a Danish court for belonging to an 
extremist leftwing group that staged several armed hold-ups in a 
crusade to finance international liberation movements. A 
policeman was killed in one of the attacks blamed on the group. 
  He has also been accused of taking part in attacks in 
Switzerland against the International Monetary Fund and the 
Spanish embassy. He was believed to have fled to Syria and was 
arrested on the border between Turkey and Syria in 1991.

  [Text] Athens, May 18 (AFP)--A blast wrecked the third 
floor offices of U.S. computer giant IBM in a building in 
central Athens Tuesday evening, but no injuries were reported, 
police said. 
  A caller who said he was from the November 17 extremist 
group 
phoned a commercial radio station to give a warning a few 
minutes before the blast in the Sindagma building. 
  He said November 17 were going to fire a rocket at the 
building, although police could not immediately establish that a 
rocket had caused the blast. 
  Police cordoned off the entire area, which includes the 
Greek 
parliament and the new European parliament headquarters. 
  November 17 has assassinated more than 20 people and carried 
out around 50 bomb or rocket attacks since it surfaced in 1975 
with the murder of U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Athens 
station chief Richard Welsch.

  [Text] The 17 November organization hit the IBM offices 
eight minutes after midnight with two 2.6-inch-caliber antitank 
rockets. The offices are on the corner of Filellinon and 
Dhedhalos Streets near Sintagma Square in the capital's center. 
The explosions caused only material damage. A homemade 
launcher, consisting of a tripod and a metallic pipe, was found 
in a building across from the offices. A few minutes before the 
attack, an unidentified person telephoned SKY radio warning 
about the strike and claiming responsibility in the name of 17 
November.

<F P=106> [Emin Demirel report: "PKK's Bomb Expert Arrested"] </F>
  [Text] Istanbul--The teams of the Directorate of Police's 
antiterror department have arrested Veysel Bozcali, a Kurdish 
Workers Party [PKK] terrorist, who trained as an explosives 
expert in one of the PKK camps in Greece and who arrived in 
Istanbul to bomb several tourist sites in the city. Meanwhile, 
the teams also arrested nine other PKK members, three of whom 
are women. 
  The antiterror department has disclosed that six of the 
terrorists trained in a camp close to the border between Germany 
and the Netherlands some time ago. They then crossed into 
Greece and were trained by the Greek secret service organization 
as bomb experts. The terrorists later crossed the Maritsa River 
into Turkey. 
  Veysel Bozcali was arrested while preparing to carry out his 
terrorist activities.

  [Text] Greece has rejected Turkey's demarche claiming that 
members of the Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] are being trained on 
Greek territory. Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said 
that the competent Turkish deputy foreign minister summoned the 
Greek ambassador in Ankara and lodged a demarche claiming that 
members of the PKK are being trained on Greek territory. 
  The spokesman stressed: Statements and demarches by Turkey 
that cause artificial tension have no meaning; Greece will not 
become an accomplice in creating an artificial climate of 
tension. Venizelos said: Greece condemns every act of violence 
and terrorism. There is no official representation of the PKK 
in our country. Greece is a pluralist state of law, with a 
legal order; whoever violates that legal order is punished. And 
he also noted that there is no meaning for Turkey in attempting 
to export its domestic problems.

  [Text] Istanbul, May 16 (AFP)--A bomb exploded in the 
administrative offices of the Turkish postal service Monday, 
killing one person and injuring another, both believed to be 
involved in planting the device, police said. 
  The afternoon blast took place in the toilets of the 
building. 
  Another bomb which exploded in a train at Istanbul station 
overnight Sunday hurt two people, also believed to be 
responsible for the attack. 
  On Sunday a bomb attack in a cinema wounded 12 people, 
including six soldiers, in Elazig, southeastern Turkey. 
  A Russian-made explosive device was thrown inside the cinema 
premises where 140 people were watching a film. There was no 
immediate claim of responsibility. 
  Police generally attribute blame for such attacks on the 
outlawed Kurdish separatist guerrilla movement, the Kurdistan 
Workers' Party.

  [Excerpts] Interior Minister Nahit Mentese has said that 
the fight against the separatist terrorist organization PKK 
[Workers Party of Kurdistan] is continuing successfully and 
added that there is a 300 percent increase in the number 
terrorists who surrendered in the first four months of 1994 in 
comparison to the same period last year. [passage omitted] 
  Mentese stated that 500 terrorists -- 186 terrorists killed, 
four wounded -- were captured in operations conducted against 
the dissipating terrorist organization during 1-15 May. Mentese 
added that 197 long-barreled rifles, 37 revolvers, 386 bombs, 
and large quantities of ammunition were seized during these 
operations. 
  Explaining that collective surrenders, including members in 
high- level positions, were taking place for the first time, 
Mentese stressed that during this period 48 terrorists -- 22 in 
Sirnak and 7 in Agri and Van [as heard] -- surrendered to the 
security forces, handing in their weapons. Mentese said that 
collective surrenders from the terrorist organization's militant 
cadres in the mountainous region are expected to increase.

<F P=106> [Edward Gorman report: "MI6 Fears IRA May Obtain Missing </F>
Afghan Missiles"] 
  [Excerpts] Kabul -- American attempts to control the black 
market in Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, first supplied eight 
years ago to rebels fighting the Soviet Union's army in 
Afghanistan, are proving virtually futile. 
  Inquiries by THE TIMES in Afghanistan and Pakistan suggest 
hundreds of these highly sophisticated and deadly shoulder-held 
weapons have now gone astray in south Asia and the Middle East. 
A serious fear in British intelligence circles is that the IRA 
will succeed in buying or being given the weapon and the 
training to enable its terrorists to use it. 
  The heat-seeking infra-red Stinger, which is difficult to 
deflect with flares or chaff once it has locked onto a target, 
would transform the military balance in Northern Ireland, 
allowing the Provisionals to shoot down military transport 
helicopters virtually at will. At a stroke this would cripple 
army logistics in the province and force a substantial rethink 
on military strategy. A constant watch for signs that IRA 
members or their representatives are on the hunt for the Stinger 
in the arms bazaars of the Middle East and Asia is being mounted 
by British intelligence, but so far none has been detected. 
However, at least one alert has been issued in the past year in 
Pakistan. 
  An accompanying danger is that Iran may supply Stingers to 
the Provisionals or has already done so. At the end of last 
month, the full extent of Iranian contacts with the IRA was 
disclosed by British intelligence sources after a leak to a 
Greek newspaper, prompting a diplomatic dispute between the two 
countries. The Iranians are known to be among the main 
beneficiaries of Stingers sold by Afghan Mujahidin commanders 
first obtaining them in 1987 when they "confiscated four 
launchers and 16 missiles from a commander, and are now thought 
to have many more of the weapons." 
  The IRA is not the only danger. The Americans fear Islamic 
radicals may attempt to use the missiles against civilian 
passenger aircraft and the Turks are concerned about Kurdish 
rebels getting them. Other countries known to have Stingers 
include Libya, Iraq, North Korea, and militant Palestinian 
groups. [passage omitted] 
  Inquiries suggest that, of the original estimated 1,000 
intended for Afghanistan, around 300 were used inside the 
country, 200 are now stored in the arsenals of Pakistan, a 
further 200 have already gone missing, and about 300 are still 
in the hands of former Mujahidin commanders. The numbers are 
unverifiable but are regarded as a reasonably accurate guide by 
diplomatic sources. These sources say of the 300 still in 
Afghanistan at the beginning of this year. about 100 have 
recently been sold, including around 60 to the Americans who 
have paid between $85.000 and more than $100,000 for each 
launcher. The North Koreans, who closed their embassy in Kabul 
last month, are thought to have bought at least 30, with another 
ten going to the Iranians and two to the Iraqis. The Americans 
are not willing to discuss the programme beyond confirming that 
it is still going on. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Toby Moore, transport correspondent: "Luggage </F>
Bar-Code To Beat Bombers"] 
  [Text] Airlines are being ordered by the Government to stop 
unaccompanied luggage being put on board aircraft, as part of 
attempts to prevent a Lockerbie-style disaster. 
  The decision follows successful trials at Manchester Airport 
with a refinement of the bar-code system used to price goods in 
shops. 
  An explosive device hidden in luggage without an 
accompanying 
passenger brought down Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie in 
December 1988, with the loss of 270 lives. 
  Since then, fast, thorough checks make sure that passengers 
and luggage are booked on the same flight. But the risk remains 
on a terrorist checking a bag onto a flight and then walking out 
of the airport. 
  It is then up to random screening in baggage-handling areas 
and the watchful eye of an X-ray operator to spot anything 
suspicious. 
  The Manchester trial of equipment designed by Ferranti has 
convinced ministers it is now possible to make sure that luggage 
does not enter an aircraft without an accompanying passenger. 
  Lord Mackay, the aviation minister, will use a visit to 
Manchester Airport on Monday to announce that from July 1 every 
airline operating international flights out of Britain must 
introduce some system to ensure that luggage and passengers 
match. 
  Using the bar-code technology favoured by the Government, 
travellers would have a code stamped on their boarding pass when 
checking-in and the same code stamped on luggage they send for 
storage in the hold of their flight. Airline staff will use a 
device to read the bar-code on the boarding passes. This will 
tell the airline's computer system that a particular passenger 
has boarded. 
  The baggage handler will use a code-reader to check luggage 
sent for stowage. It will give him a pass or fail signal that 
the luggage is authorised for the flight and matches someone who 
has at least checked in. If the passenger fails to board, the 
airline's computer will automatically register that there is 
unaccompanied luggage on board. The system will show instantly 
where the unaccompanied luggage is stored. This will end the 
long process of taking out every single item of baggage. 
  Bar-coding will also make it less likely that baggage will 
end up at the wrong destination. "Airlines spend millions of 
pounds each year reuniting luggage with passengers," said a 
Department of Transport spokesman. 
  Meanwhile, the first system for automatically detecting 
explosives in luggage is now installed at Heathrow and Gatwick.

<F P=106> ["Luggage for Explosives"] </F>
  [Text] Luggage loaded into aircraft holds at Britain's main 
airports will be automatically screened for explosives from 1996. 
  BAA, the private company which operates the airports, is to 
spend &pound;150 million installing the screening system, which 
has 
been developed as the latest technology has become available. 
  It will be installed initially at Heathrow and Gatwick 
airports to check bags being transferred between international 
flights, but will eventually be in operation at BAA's seven 
airports. 
  The screening process is aimed at averting a repeat of the 
Lockerbie disaster of 1988, when explosives were smuggled aboard 
a Pan-Am jet. 
  Forty-five million bags a year go into the holds of 
international flights at BAA airports. The system being 
installed is capable of screening up to 20 bags a minute, so 
will not slow down normal check-in procedures. The bags go 
through an X-ray machine which analyses the atomic weight and 
density of materials, pinpoints anything which is a potential 
explosive and uses a computer to analyse the results. 
  Any suspect bag is pulled from the conveyor belt and 
subjected to further automatic examination, which is checked by 
an operator. If the bag still appears suspect it is sent for a 
"sniffer" test for the distinctive vapours given off by 
explosives. 
  The technology has been developed over the last 2 1/2 years, 
during which time repeated tests gradually ironed out the 
problems with false alarms. 
  Richard Everitt, director of safety and security for BAA, 
said the new system was "a significant breakthrough in our fight 
to beat the terrorist." 
  "No other airport in the world is currently using this 
technology, which can be integrated into existing baggage 
systems, but we hope that others will follow our lead." 
  "One of the great benefits of this technology is that it 
increases the protection for passengers without disrupting their 
journeys and allows the airport to continue operating 
effectively."

  [Text] The Foreign Office has opposed the reopening of one 
of Britain's most historic airfields because of fears that it 
could be used for a terrorist attack on the Foreign Secretary's 
official country home. 
  The airstrip at Combe Bank Farm in Sundridge, Kent, which 
has 
the country's earliest surviving hangars, is two miles from 
Douglas Hurd's country home at Chevening. 
  Sevenoaks Council was due to decide last Wednesday on the 
application from Timothy Barr-Smith, a farmer, but at the last 
minute the Foreign Office letter was received. It opposed the 
plan "on the grounds that Chevening House is the residence of a 
cabinet minister who, as a potential terrorist target, is 
subject to a high-security requirement. The close proximity of 
low-flying aircraft ... and the lack of air-traffic control, 
constitute an unacceptable risk in our view." 
  Planners were expected to recommend that the proposal be 
approved, but it has now been deferred. 
  Mr. Barr-Smith submitted his plan for the airfield last 
October, emphasising its historic past as the site of some of 
the earliest adventures in aviation. Biplanes and triplanes were 
tested there in the 1910s. 
  English Heritage supported the scheme because it would 
ensure 
the survival of the hangars, which had been used as hay stores. 
They were listed as buildings of grade two architectural and 
historical importance in 1988. 
  Mr. Barr-Smith was reluctant yesterday to discuss the 
intervention by the Foreign Office. "Publicity at this stage 
would not help my cause," he said. 
  Lee Prebble, chief development control officer of Sevenoaks 
Council, said the recommendation for planning permission had 
been withdrawn because of the Foreign Office letter and concern 
about crime, and a noise objection.

  [Text] Johannesburg May 16 SAPA -- An Inkatha Freedom Party 
[IFP] branch chairman on the East Rand and a member of the 
Katlehong Peace Committee were killed on Sunday when the taxi 
they were traveling in came under fire from unknown gunmen. The 
latest in a resurgence of violence on the East Rand, the 
killings prompted the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] 
regional government to propose community policing be introduced 
in the region. 
  Police spokesman Capt. Janine Smith reported the IFP's 
chairman at Simmer and Jack Mines near Katlehong, Wilson 
Buthelezi, 43, and Katlehong Peace Committee member Muzi 
Sithole, 31, were shot dead when men with AK-47 rifles opened 
fire on their taxi at 5.30PM on the road between Zonkesizwe and 
Palmridge. 
  The attackers fled in a white Toyota Corolla. 
  Reacting to the killings, IFP East Rand regional organiser 
Thabani Dlamini said in a statement: "We call on the African 
National Congress East Rand region to meet with us so that we 
can work hand-in-hand to defuse the anger of the people of our 
region who have suffered so much in the recent violence through 
these senseless killings." 
  Mr. Dlamini said neither organisation gained anything from 
the violence. "We are distressed by the wave of violence 
sweeping through the East Rand townships, particularly Tokoza 
and Katlehong, and we call upon everyone in these communities to 
do everything possible to rebuild peace." 
  PWV Public Safety and Security Minister Jessie Duarte called 
for urgent attention to be given to the implementation of 
policing that included the involvement of self-defence units, 
SABC radio reported. Ms Duarte was speaking after a visit to 
Tokoza, where 12 people were massacred at the weekend. 
  The IFP has attributed the flare-up in violence to new 
soldiers not knowing the location of trouble spots.

  [Text] The Alex Boncayao Brigade [ABB] has issued a 
directive to kill the leaders of the group loyal to Jose Maria 
Sison, Communist Party of the Philippines chief. This was 
revealed earlier today by Chief Superintendent Leandro Mendoza, 
Philippine National Police [PNP] director for intelligence. 
  According to Mendoza, the fight between the ABB and Sison 
loyalists might commence any day and may trigger violence in 
Metro Manila. 
  Mendoza refused to identify who among the leaders of Sison 
loyalists are included in the hit list of the ABB. Mendoza 
added that if the killings start, the peace process maybe 
affected. 
  As of now, the PNP is monitoring the activities of the two 
groups to prevent the outbreak of violence. 
  [Begin Mendoza recording in progress] ...because this might 
escalate to a point where they will be killing each other. And 
in the process, of course, neither of the group will admit to 
the slaying. The government might be blamed for the killings.

Thursday [19 May] cut the jail terms for two mainland Chinese 
hijackers from 10 years to seven years. 
  Liu Baocai, 24, and Huang Shugang, 30, hijacked a China 
Southern Airlines' Boeing 757 to Taiwan en route from Shenzhen 
to Beijing on April 5, 1993, marking the first of ten mainland 
hijackings in 1993. 
  Liu and Huang were sentenced to 10 years in prison by a 
Taoyuan District Court, but they appealed to the Taiwan High 
Court, and the High Court upheld the sentence. 
  Liu and Huang then appealed to the Supreme Court. The 
Supreme Court returned the case to the Taiwan High Court for 
retrial. On Thursday, the High Court cut their sentences from 
10 to seven years, saying the hijackers deserved leniency 
because they surrendered without resistance. 
  Judge Wang Hsi-pao of the Taiwan High Court told them that 
they could be paroled after serving slightly more than two years 
in jail. 
  Liu and Huang said they would appeal the decision.

  [Text] Nineteen Muslim organizations have claimed that 
violence in the South was a consequence of the May 1992 turmoil, 
and not the work of separatists, according to a news bulletin. 
  The SAN EKKAPHAP (Solidarity News Bulletin), published by 
southern Muslim MPs, said the organizations believed the 
violence was not created by separatist guerrillas. The violence 
occurred as a result of the May upheavals which culminated in 
the violent suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations. 
  The organizations claimed the government had information 
relevant to the violence. It should reveal the facts in a 
straightforward manner, and improve its working system to 
prevent the situation from deteriorating. 
  "The government has to shoulder responsibility for the 
violent incidents. The government must take decisive action to 
prevent the situation from turning into bloodshed," they said. 
  The organizations said social and political problems had 
affected the South's economy. They claimed the South had lost 
BtlO billion in economic gains in the past year. 
  The bulletin is published by the Solidarity Muslim group of 
Muslim MPs from the five southernmost provinces, led by Deputy 
Interior Minister Den Tomina. 
  Den, a Pattani MP, said in the first issue of the bulletin 
that the publication was aimed at protecting Muslim interests 
and creating better understanding between Muslims and Buddhists. 
  Education Minister Samphan Thongsamak told reporters that 
the 
four Muslims accused of involvement in bomb attacks in the South 
are not preachers but teachers of religion. 
  The four suspects, who were granted bail on Tuesday, have 
been charged with sedition. Muslims have claimed the men were 
scapegoats, and it was speculated that they would rally to 
protest the arrests. 
  However, many senior police officers, including national 
police chief Prathin Santipraphop, have repeated several times 
they have substantive evidence to prove the men guilty. 
  Samphan said individuals suspected of committing crimes 
would 
be prosecuted in accordance with the law, regardless of their 
religion. 
  "It is not that if you are a Muslim, you will not be 
punished 
when you do wrong," he said. 
  Politicians should not intervene in the case because they 
could not change the truth. Police should not be disheartened 
and should proceed according to the law, Samphan said. 
  Some Muslim MPs of the New Aspiration Party, also claiming 
the men were scapegoats, have said they would represent them in 
court. 
  In Songkhla, Police Director General Prathin yesterday said 
police had sufficient evidence to take legal action. The 
suspects had the right to ask that new investigators be 
appointed, but he would have the final say. 
  Assistant police chief Michai Nukunkit said investigators 
would file suits against the suspects next week. Army Commander 
in Chief Wimon Wongwanit said crime suspects must be prosecuted 
with an even hand, regardless of their religion.

  [Excerpt] Buenos Aires, 15 May (NA) -- The People's 
Revolutionary Army (ORP) today denied any involvement in the 
attack on the Japanese Embassy on 13 May and blamed 
incriminating reports on "counterintelligence maneuvers." [see 
item PY1305161194 in previous Terrorism Report] 
  The ORP states that pamphlets linking the ORP to the attack 
"are a pathetic attempt to involve the organization in an 
incident that is without political motive." 
  The ORP press communique stresses that it has "always" 
admitted responsibility for its actions, adding that this 
"attempt" to link it to the attack "a pathetic 
counterintelligence maneuver." [passage omitted]

  [Text] The United States presently is carrying out a set of 
measures for preparing to eliminate its stockpiles of chemical 
weapons. This is connected with fulfillment of obligations 
stemming from the Soviet-American Agreement on Disposal of 
Chemical Weapons (1990) and from the Chemical Weapons Convention 
(1993). 
  According to official data, in terms of chemical agents 
there 
are presently around 32,000 t of U.S. chemical weapon 
stockpiles. In addition, the United States has an unannounced 
number and capacity of casings and devices not filled with 
chemical agents. Half of the stockpiles consists of nerve agents 
(sarin and VX) and the other half is mustard gas. Around 40 
percent of chemical agents are loaded in munitions and 60 
percent are stored in containers and can be loaded into 
munitions in less than two years. 
  Over 90 percent of existing stockpiles are in the 
continental 
United States and 6.6 percent of the munitions, delivered from 
Okinawa during 1962-1971 and from the FRG in November 1990, are 
on Johnston Atoll in the Pacific. Stockpiles of chemical agents 
and munitions filled with them have been stored for over 20 
years (with guaranteed safe periods of 10-15 years). Up to 90 
percent of stockpiles of filled munitions consists of models of 
systems that are obsolete or no longer operational; as a result 
of above-norm storage periods, some projectiles are beginning to 
leak, which creates a danger of contamination of depots and 
surrounding terrain as well as injury to the local populace. 
  A commission recommended eliminating 80-90 percent of 
obsolete chemical weapon stockpiles. As a result, the U.S. 
Congress adopted a program for destroying these stockpiles up to 
1998, and $111.3 million were allocated to the Defense 
Department in FY 1988, $196.9 million in FY 1989, $213.8 million 
in FY 1990 and 264.4 million in FY 1991 for its implementation. 
The overall cost of the program for destroying obsolete 
stockpiles initially was $1.7-2.2 billion, but specialists 
estimate the costs may grow 2-3 times because of increased 
expenditures for environmental protection.[.sup]1[/] 
  It is planned to build all chemical weapons disposal 
enterprises near storage sites, which should preclude the 
appearance of dangerous incidents in transporting munitions to 
the site of their disposal. One experimental installation 
presently is operating at Tooele (Utah), where 42.3 percent of 
all stockpiles are located. A second enterprise (on Johnston 
Atoll, which was the range for conducting atmospheric nuclear 
tests during 1958-1962) is in the stage of coming up to design 
capacity (Fig. 1 [figure not reproduced]). Construction of 
another seven enterprises will be completed during 1993-1994, 
after which the process of destroying obsolete chemical weapons 
may be concluded in 6-8 years. 
  The principle of incinerating chemical agents in specially 
equipped furnaces has been made the basis of chemical weapons 
disposal technology. The technological process provides for 
delivering munitions and containers with chemical agents to the 
disposal enterprises; unloading them and separating liquid 
contents, metal parts of munitions and containers, metal parts 
and casings with explosive materials not removed, nonmetal 
parts, packaging, and auxiliary equipment into individual flows; 
incinerating materials of each flow in a separate furnace; 
collecting gases discharged from the furnaces and reburning 
vapors of toxic substances present in them; cooling gaseous 
products discharged into the atmosphere and cleaning them of 
solid ash particles, traces of toxic substances, and oxides of 
nitrogen and carbon; and burying solid remains in sealed 
underground vaults. 
  In the opinion of American specialists, this technology 
permits disposing of all existing chemical agents. It is also 
used widely in working with toxic industrial and household 
wastes. For complete disposal of chemical agents, it is 
necessary to maintain a temperature of over 1,100C in the 
furnaces and ensure an oxygen surplus and the presence of 
gaseous materials in the incineration chamber for around two 
seconds. Temperature and time regimes have been worked out for 
eliminating parts of chemical munitions and packaging--an 
incineration temperature from 760 to 1,200C and presence in 
the combustion zone for from a few seconds to 15 minutes. Safety 
of gaseous discharges is ensured by secondary reburning of toxic 
substances and trapping of ash, hydrogen fluoride and chloride, 
phosphoric anhydride, sulfur dioxide, and oxides of nitrogen and 
carbon in cleaning devices. Gaseous discharges should not 
contain harmful solid and gaseous substances in amounts 
exceeding norms established for ordinary industrial enterprises, 
or concentrations of chemical agent vapors above a specific 
level. The table shows maximum permissible concentrations of 
chemical agents in the air in built-up areas and workspaces and 
also in gaseous discharges of chemical weapons disposal 
enterprises as set by the U.S. Department of Health.

  Modern means and methodologies provide for determining those 
concentrations of chemical agents in the air, on the soil and in 
an aqueous medium and also provide reliable protection against 
them. The experience of operating the enterprise at the chemical 
depot in the city of Tooele confirms the possibility of safe 
disposal of various chemical munitions and chemical agents (Fig. 
2 [figure not reproduced]). Over 146,000 projectiles with 2,800 
t of chemical agents already have been disposed of by 
incineration in the United States. Over 38,000 munitions with 
sarin (34 t) and VX (3.6 t) as well as 16.6 t of chemical agents 
of the mustard gas, chloropicrin, Lewisite, phosgene and 
cyanogen chloride type have been eliminated right in Tooele. 
During 1990-1991 5,700 M55 rocket-propelled projectiles 
containing 24 t of the chemical agents sarin and VX were 
disposed of on Johnston Atoll. 
  In accordance with the standard design, a chemical weapons 
disposal enterprise is accommodated in an area of 4.5-5 
hectares. It includes a three-story building (platform) for 
eliminating munitions, a depot for temporary storage of arriving 
munitions, administration building, multipurpose building, 
equipment for monitoring access to the enterprise and the state 
of affairs in its separate parts, a power facility and sewer 
facility. Capital construction costs are evaluated at $55-75 
million depending on location. The design duration for using the 
enterprise is ten years, after which it is either to be closed 
or retooled as a production unit for disposing of especially 
dangerous industrial wastes. 
  Building the enterprise takes from two to three years, after 
which tests are conducted and attendant personnel master the 
technology for 3-9 months. The model staff is 140 persons. The 
production process is supported by a shift of 22 persons. The 
equipment servicing and routine maintenance team includes 13-14 
persons. The enterprise must work three eight-hour shifts five 
days a week. The first shift destroys munitions, the second 
maintains serviceability of equipment and performs repairs, and 
the third is the duty shift. The design capacity is 40 
projectiles per hour and the maximum is up to 50. In the course 
of a year the enterprise may destroy up to 80,000 projectiles, 
each containing 5 kg of chemical agents (350-500 t of chemical 
agents per year). Ten-year operating costs were evaluated at 
$120 million in 1988. 
  In tying in the project to specific construction sites, a 
study was made of the degree of risk to people and of damage to 
the environment under various working conditions, and 
alternative options were studied for transporting chemical 
weapons to their disposal site. In addition, defects of chemical 
agent incineration technology, technical troubles, personnel 
error, and the possibility of aircraft falling on enterprises, 
of transportation accidents, earthquakes, and terrorist 
attacks--a total of around 3,000 situations--were taken into 
account. It was determined that the danger of injury to people 
and of damage to the environment is practically nil with normal 
operation. The enterprise should be located in a seismically 
safe zone away from airways, railroads and highways and have 
autonomous routes for access and for bringing in electrical 
power and water. Dangerous consequences are possible from 
incidents involving chemical agent vapors getting into the air 
and chemical agent spills into the soil or water. 
  A vapor cloud which has appeared from a motor vehicle 
accident with the destruction of a container holding one ton of 
sarin or VX can spread under certain meteorological conditions 
and injure people, animals and birds more than 10 km from the 
accident site. Entry of these chemical agents into small and 
medium rivers is very dangerous, especially if the spilled mass 
breaks down into drops or forms a floating spot (characteristic 
of mustard gas). The entry of 5 kg of sarin into a medium-size 
river can cause the death of over half the fish at a distance of 
more than 40 km from the spot of the spill. A spilled chemical 
agent penetrating water-bearing layers of soil can lead to 
poisoning of potable water sources, in connection with which 
their toxicological monitoring is necessary. An analysis of the 
risk forced American experts to reject the use of water 
transportation (with the exception of the FRG-Johnston Atoll 
route) and air transportation for carrying chemical munitions 
and to choose the safest land routes. 
  Human death risk zones in case of an accident involving a 
chemical agent spill have been determined for each disposal 
enterprise and for all "wind rose" directions in a given 
locality, and with the most likely and worst weather conditions. 
According to U.S. press data, an average of 500-1,400 persons 
within a radius of 20 km from a chemical enterprise may die from 
an accident. It has been established that the safety zone 
boundary must be approximately 35 km from chemical weapons 
disposal enterprises. 
  The high danger connected with chemical weapons disposal led 
the U.S. Congress to the need to adopt a national program in 
1985, and the U.S. Defense Department was made responsible for 
its fulfillment. The U.S. Congress allocates funds for it each 
year and monitors it through the General Accounting Office. 
Within the Defense Department the Army Deputy Chief of Staff for 
Logistics and the chief of the Chemical Weapons Disposal Agency 
subordinate to him are responsible for this program. The 
director of the chemical weapons disposal program and his staff 
organize the development of measures and immediate fulfillment 
of plans. The Environmental Protection Agency, Department of 
Health [and Human Services], and administration of territories 
where chemical weapons disposal depots and enterprises are 
located and where transportation routes for moving them pass are 
responsible for monitoring the provision of measures for 
environmental protection and for safety of the populace. 
  Technical studies are conducted by the U.S. Army Center for 
Chemical Research, Development and Technologies (Aberdeen 
Proving Ground, Maryland), by specialists of the Chemical 
Weapons Disposal Agency, and by personnel of arsenals and depots 
where stockpiles of chemical weapons are stored. The FBI, CIA 
and special-purpose subunits of these departments and of the 
Army may be involved to prevent terrorist acts. 
  Military-scientific accompaniment of the program is being 
provided by military chemists of Aberdeen Proving Ground. 
Representatives of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and of 
the Association of the Chemical Industry are brought in for 
consultations. The main scientific problems at the present time 
have been resolved. The development and evaluation of techniques 
and details of the process of destroying casings of chemical 
munitions under conditions of their cryogenic cooling (Fig. 3 
[figure not reproduced]) are being concluded, for which the U.S. 
Congress allocated around $10 million in 1990. Nontraditional 
disposal processes such as a nuclear explosion or biodegradation 
also were examined, but were rejected (as was the method of 
incineration in deep mine shafts or dumping in the ocean). 
  The main unresolved scientific problem is an evaluation of 
the degree of danger to people, animals and plants of the 
lengthy effect of chemical agent vapor concentrations below 
maximum permissible norms and of their mixtures with flue gases. 
This problem also has not been completely resolved for other 
dangerous incineration products of industrial and household 
wastes such as tetrachlorodioxins. 
  Along with construction of chemical weapons disposal 
installations, the Department of the Army presently is arranging 
the conduct of measures to ensure safety of the local populace 
in case of accidents involving a release of chemical agents. 
Situations being examined as typical are the spill of up to 1 kg 
of sarin or VX type chemical agents or up to 4 t of mustard gas 
and the explosion of a container holding 100 kg of VX. It is 
presumed that in such cases enterprise heads should notify the 
local administration and populace in order to evacuate people 
from the danger zone. With the most adverse weather conditions 
no more than 30 minutes remain to notify and evacuate the 
populace located up to 10 km downwind from the accident site 
(zone of active measures), no more than 1-3 hours at a distance 
from 10 to 35 km (zone of protective measures), and from 3 to 10 
hours at a distance over 35 km (zone of preparatory measures). 
  Roads and bridges 10-35 km from an enterprise or depot with 
chemical weapons (as the most likely site of an accident) should 
be prepared for evacuation of the populace. The presence of 
gasproof shelters and conduct of measures for gastight sealing 
of schools, hospitals, kindergartens, public establishments and 
dining halls is required within a zone of active measures. The 
populace and medical personnel should be supplied with means of 
individual chemical protection and medical aid, as well as with 
necessary duty means of evacuation. In case it is impossible to 
evacuate people from other zones (10-35 km distant), gasproof 
shelters also are prepared for them. The entire population is 
supplied with means of chemical protection (protective masks for 
adults and children, special carriages for infants). Advance 
evacuation or even resettlement of people to a safe zone are 
planned as an extreme measure. 
  Those measures require significant expenditures. According 
to 
calculations, their average cost is $53.30 per person. 
Considering that 1.9 million people live near the eight depots 
where it is planned to organize chemical weapons disposal, the 
Department of the Army requested an additional $100 million in 
1989 alone to assist local authorities and protect the populace. 
  In accordance with U.S. legislation, local authorities of 
territories on which harmful substances are stored and destroyed 
are responsible for protecting the population. They are 
obligated to draw up plans of action in case an emergency 
situation appears. A check showed that not everywhere is the 
local administration informed of the danger of measures being 
taken by the Department of the Army. In connection with this, 
the Department is assisting local authorities in drawing up 
evacuation plans and carrying out other measures to protect the 
populace and provide technical means. The administration also is 
obligated to take similar actions in anticipation of the 
possibility of accidents at nuclear and chemical enterprises. 
  In connection with the organization of chemical weapons 
disposal, the problem is being raised in the U.S. press of 
insurance under special policies and for differentiated payment 
rates against ecological risk at the enterprises being created. 
It is noted that after the soil and underground waters were 
polluted with dangerous wastes on the grounds of the military's 
Rocky Mountain Arsenal (Colorado), the military's losses were 
recovered from Shell, which designed and built the storage 
facilities for especially dangerous wastes without the necessary 
lining. The insurance company refused to cover this firm's 
losses inasmuch as the leak was not accidental, but resulted 
from personnel negligence. 
  The country gives exceptional attention to psychological 
preparation of the populace for the siting and operation of 
depots and chemical weapons disposal enterprises near built-up 
areas. As a rule, people willingly agree to the need for such 
enterprises as long as they are far from places where they live. 
This is connected with the fact that they fear acute or chronic 
poisoning from possible accidents, contamination of lands and 
buildings, the death of animals, other economic losses, and loss 
of freedom of movement and comfortable conditions. There have 
been cases of psychological trauma. The absence of information 
about danger usually only increases public tension. 
  To overcome resistance appearing in the population, the U.S. 
Army command has been widely informing the public about all 
measures and strengthening the people's confidence in their 
safety. Thus, the press describes in sufficient detail the 
chemical weapons disposal program; time periods for 
accomplishing it in different states, for taking preventive 
measures, and for testing protective devices; as well as 
incidents which have occurred (especially those mopped up 
quickly and successfully). 
  As reported in the foreign press, a citizens' committee was 
formed in the city of Richmond, Kentucky to oppose military 
chemists from nearby Lexington-Blue Grass Depot. In response to 
this, the command arranged a visit by committee members to the 
Tooele Army Chemical Weapons Depot and a demonstration of the 
operation of a munitions incinerator. A technical library was 
set up under the citizens' committee and certain additional 
measures to lower population risk were considered and included 
in the chemical weapons disposal plan with the participation of 
committee members. It is also proposed to involve this committee 
in the discussion and selection of a site for building a 
chemical munitions disposal enterprise. 
  The press has widely publicized both the achievement of a 
cessation of dumping of obsolete munitions at sea and the 
transition to their incineration, has been actively discussing 
results of successful transportation of chemical projectiles 
over FRG territory as a model of skilled, precise organization 
of safety measures, and has emphasized the many years of 
experience in safe work with various kinds of these weapons at 
ranges and depots. The activity of the U.S. Department of the 
Army Chemical Weapons Disposal Agency also is propagandized. 
Critical writings regarding shortcomings of the military 
department's work in this area receive an immediate response 
from highly placed Defense Department officials. 
  In parallel with this, plans for fulfilling a chemical 
weapons disposal program and its individual stages, and open 
competitions of chemical weapons disposal enterprise projects 
(each project is discussed publicly, with all responses set 
forth in special digest-annexes) are being submitted for 
consideration of official bodies of states, the federal 
administration, and the scientific and technical public. 
Official project reviews and documents are accessible to the 
public. A public discussion of submitted projects was organized 
in 1988 with the involvement of military and civilian 
specialists at Aberdeen Proving Ground (at the Newport Chemical 
Munitions Production Plant) and in the city of Richmond. 
  Department of the Army training of all local residents in 
measures of protection against chemical agents, in the procedure 
and rules of actions in response to chemical alarm signals, in 
practical use of means of protection and gasproof shelters, and 
in supplying the population with means of medical aid and 
necessary medicines is of great importance in overcoming the 
population's psychological resistance. 
  Thus, the chemical weapons disposal program developed in the 
United States represents an orderly system of financial, 
organizational, logistical, medical, information and other 
measures presently being accomplished in an integrated manner. 
In the opinion of American specialists, it is being done rather 
successfully. Scheduled operation of the enterprise on Johnston 
Atoll began in 1990. After building one other plant in the city 
of Anniston, Alabama, the United States will be able to support 
the disposal of over 1,000 t of chemical agents per year in 
1993-1994, which is in keeping with the concluded agreement. 
Disposal technology has been worked out to a sufficient extent 
and may be presented to Russia if the U.S. Congress approves 
such a decision and does not include it in the category of 
advanced technologies, transfer of which is prohibited by 
existing law. U.S. experience in realizing the chemical weapons 
disposal program may be used to accomplish similar measures in 
our country. 
Footnotes 
  1. Chemical weapons disposal programs were carried out in 
the 
United States even earlier. For example, 6,600 t of chemical 
agents were destroyed from 1973 through 1985 mainly on the 
territory of Rocky Mountain Arsenal (Colorado) and Dugway 
Proving Grounds (Utah).

  [Text] The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, an absolute theocratic 
monarchy, occupies a large part of the Arabian Peninsula. It 
formed within existing boundaries in 1932 by the unification of 
several principalities. Possessing significant oil resources and 
finances, Saudi Arabia attempts to play the predominant role 
among the Muslim and especially Arab countries. Its leadership 
was the main initiator of the formation of the Cooperation 
Council for the Arab States of the Gulf[.sup]1[/] in 1981, 
bending great efforts to transform it into a military-political 
alliance. 
  The development of the military-political situation in the 
Near East and Persian Gulf in the last three years has shown 
that the United States and its western allies attach special 
importance to Saudi Arabia, giving it considerable aid in Armed 
Forces organizational development and technical outfitting. This 
is explained above all by the country's important 
military-strategic position, enormous oil reserves and leading 
role in the regional organization of monarchic Arab states. 
  While maintaining close cooperation with the United States 
in 
all areas for a long time, the country's leadership declined 
American demands to present its territory for building foreign 
military bases. But the appearance of Iraqi troops on the Saudi 
border as a result of Kuwait's occupation in August 1990 forced 
King Fahd, the head of state, to decide to present the country's 
territory for the first time for deployment of a grouping of 
armed forces of other states, above all the United States. As a 
result, the territory of Saudi Arabia was a springboard for 
delivering the multinational forces' attack on Iraq. 
  Considering the instability of the Near Eastern situation 
and 
danger of the outbreak of new armed conflicts, the leaders of 
Saudi Arabia activated measures for developing and upgrading the 
national Armed Forces in the post-crisis period. Special 
attention was given to reoutfitting the army with new kinds of 
weapons and military equipment by purchases abroad, above all in 
the United States, Great Britain and France; upgrading the 
troops' organizational structure and combat training; and 
increasing their numbers sharply. Thus, while the numerical 
strength of personnel of all branches was 67,500 and that of the 
National Guard 35,000 in 1990, it reached 102,000 and 55,000 
respectively in 1993. 
  Supreme military command and control entities 
(Fig. 1). The King is supreme commander of the Armed Forces. He 
exercises overall leadership of them through the Minister of 
Defense and Civil Aviation as well as through the Chief of the 
General Staff. The consultative body is the Defense Council, 
which includes the King, Minister of Defense and Civil Aviation, 
ministers of Foreign Affairs, Interior, Finance and National 
Economy, and Communications, Chief of the General Staff and 
Commander of the National Guard. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UFM-004L-05A>      Fig. 1. Saudi Arabian Armed </FIG>


  The Minister of Defense and Civil Aviation directs the Armed 
Forces via the General Staff. He is responsible for their 
status, combat readiness and organizational development. 
  The General Staff is an operational leadership entity which 
includes four directorates (operations and combat training, 
intelligence, personnel, logistics), a Finance Service and a 
Medical Service. 
  Leadership of the Armed Forces is wholly in the hands of the 
royal family. The posts of Minister of Defense and Civil 
Aviation, commander of the National Guard, their deputies and 
even commanders of individual subunits are held by the King's 
relatives. 
  The Armed Forces organizationally consist of the Army, Air 
Force, Air Defense Force, Navy and National Guard. 
  The Army (69,000) is the principal and largest 
branch of the Armed Forces. Its order of battle includes two 
armored brigades, five mechanized brigades, one airborne 
brigade, a Royal Guard regiment, two motorized infantry brigades 
and four infantry brigades of the National Guard, and five 
separate artillery battalions. The brigade is the highest 
tactical unit. 
  The armored brigade has three tank battalions, an artillery 
battalion, AAA battalion, and logistic support subunits. It has 
over 100 tanks and other weapons and military equipment in the 
inventory. 
  The mechanized brigade includes three motorized infantry 
battalions, a tank battalion, artillery battalion, AAA 
battalion, antitank battalion, and support and service subunits. 
It has up to 40 tanks, over 40 field artillery pieces and 
mortars, ATGM launchers, air defense weapons, APC's and motor 
vehicles in the inventory. 
  An infantry brigade consists of three infantry battalions, 
an 
artillery battalion, antitank battery, AAA battery, and logistic 
support subunits. There are field artillery pieces, mortars, air 
defense weapons (including shoulder-fired SAM systems), APC's 
and motor vehicles in the inventory. 
  The airborne brigade includes airborne battalions, artillery 
and mortar subunits, and antitank weapons. 
  The Army has a total of around 700 tanks (up to 400 M60A3 
and 
300 AMX-30), 235 combat reconnaissance vehicles, around 700 
IFV's, 1,700 APC's (including vehicles of their own production, 
Fig. 2 [figure not reproduced]), up to 400 field artillery 
pieces (105-mm, 155-mm and 203.2-mm), 70 MLRS, around 400 
mortars (81-mm and 106.7-mm), around 800 antitank weapons (TOW, 
Dragon, HOT and Vigilant ATGM's and also 90-mm and 106-mm 
recoilless guns), over 500 air defense weapons (Redeye and 
Stinger shoulder-fired SAM systems and Vulcan self-propelled AA 
guns), and around 30 army aviation helicopters. 
  The Air Force (18,000) has combat (fighter and 
fighter-bomber) and auxiliary aviation in its makeup. The 
squadron is the main organizational unit. The Air Force has a 
total of 19 squadrons: six fighter-bomber (52 F-5E and 45 
Tornado aircraft, Fig. 3 [figure not reproduced]), five 
fighter-interceptor (78 F-15 and 24 Tornado aircraft), three 
transport (40 C-130E and H, 35 C-212), three training (BAC-167, 
Hawk, Cessna) and two helicopter squadrons (AB-205, -206 and 
-212). 
  For basing aircraft Saudi Arabia has bases and airfields 
whose overall capacity, in the assessment of foreign 
specialists, fully satisfies the needs of the national Air 
Force. The main bases and airfields are Riyadh, Dhahran, Jiddah, 
Taif, Tabuk and Khamis Mushayat. 
  The Air Defense Force (4,000) was removed from the 
Air Force as an independent branch of the Armed Forces in late 
1986. It has 16 Improved Hawk SAM batteries (128 launchers) and 
17 Crotale (Shahine) SAM batteries (68 launchers). 
  The Navy (11,000) organizationally consists of two 
commands, Western (Red Sea) and Eastern (Persian Gulf). The Navy 
has around 60 ships and craft of various types, of which there 
are 4 corvettes equipped with Harpoon antiship missiles, 4 
frigates with Otomat antiship missiles, 9 missile craft (Fig. 4 
[figure not reproduced]), 3 torpedo boats, 20 patrol craft, 6 
minesweeper/hunters, and 8 landing craft. The Navy also includes 
a Marine regiment (1,500 persons) and 24 Dauphin 2 helicopters. 
  The main naval bases and basing facilities are Jiddah, Al 
Jubayl, Ras Tanura, Dammam, Yanbu, Qatif and Ras al Mishab. 
  The National Guard (55,000), established in 1958, 
is an independent force element and holds a special place in the 
Armed Forces system. Its basic purpose is to protect members of 
the royal family, government establishments, oil fields and so 
on. It has two motorized infantry brigades (four battalions 
each), four infantry brigades, a ceremonial squadron and support 
subunits in its makeup. Its inventory includes around 1,100 
Commando APC's, 30 105-mm howitzers, mortars, TOW ATGM's, 
recoilless guns and Vulcan self-propelled AA guns. 
  Armed Forces manpower acquisition is accomplished 
by the volunteer enlistment principle. Basic military training 
of the rank and file is conducted at training centers and that 
of NCO's and specialists in military schools of branches of the 
Armed Forces. Training of officer cadres is conducted in Saudi 
Arabian military colleges and that of higher officer personnel 
and of equipment and armament operation and maintenance 
specialists is done abroad, chiefly in the United States, Great 
Britain, France and other countries.

<F P=106> [Article by Colonel V. Stefashin, candidate of military </F>
sciences, and Colonel M. Markov] 
  [Text] This is the first in a series of articles on 
Chinese military science. It provides a general impression of 
the subject in question. In the next journal issues we will tell 
about military-scientific establishments and training of cadres 
for them, the status of military-economic and military-technical 
sciences, and organization of military research. 
  Chinese scientists look at four periods in the development 
of 
the country's modern military science. It is believed that the 
first period begins with the appearance of works by Mao Zedong 
in the late 1930's and ends in the 1940's. It is characterized 
by an interpretation of theoretical questions of military 
problems revealed by Mao in a number of theoretical studies such 
as "Questions of the Strategy of Guerilla Warfare Against 
Japanese Invaders," "On a Protracted War," "War and Questions of 
Strategy" and others. The second period falls in the 1950's and 
is marked by the extensive adoption of Soviet military 
experience both in military-theoretical as well as 
military-technical studies. A network of military educational 
institutions, scientific research establishments and 
post-graduate work was established at this time. The third 
period comprised the years of cultural revolution (1966-1976), 
when the country's leadership rejected military cooperation with 
the USSR. General stagnation of military research is a 
distinctive feature: There was a sharp drop in volume and 
quality of military RDT&amp;E, but work to create nuclear weapons 
and missile-space equipment was carried on actively. Profound 
transformations of the state's entire military system were 
required with transition to a reform policy in the late 1970's. 
This became the beginning of the fourth period, which continues 
at the present time. It is characterized by a large-scale 
unfolding of military-scientific research, which was not seen in 
the preceding three periods. 
  With consideration of changes in the political, 
military-strategic and economic situation in the country and 
world, especially in the Asiatic-Pacific region, Chinese 
military specialists prepared fundamentally new provisions for 
the military-political leadership in a short time on problems of 
national security and Armed Forces organizational development. 
Up to the end of the current century they recommended being 
guided by the concept of "priority development of the national 
economy" with respect to defense organizational development and 
to rely on the "state's comprehensive might" and political 
authority for establishing their leadership. 
  The present highly dynamic development of military science 
was facilitated not only by increased attention to it on the 
part of the country's leadership, but also by its "conversion," 
i.e., emergence from a closed, isolated system of a purely 
defensive nature into the broad market of "know-how" and 
introduction of military technologies to civilian production. 
The number of such projects and developments which are becoming 
the property of the civilian sector of the economy is growing 
continuously. There were around 40 of them in 1983, already 800 
in 1984, and over 20,000 in 1985, which contributed to a 
constant growth in volume of funds for economic agreement work, 
consultations and S&amp;T servicing of projects between 
military-scientific establishments and enterprises of the 
country's economic complex. (In 1984, for example, it was around 
430 million yuan and in 1985 it exceeded one billion yuan). This 
trend also is preserved at the present time. 
  In analyzing the history of development of military science, 
it should be noted that in the first three periods China 
approached a solution to problems of military theory from purely 
dogmatic Maoist positions. This placed an imprint on development 
of general problems of military thought, and in particular on 
the conceptual apparatus, which is an instrumental part of 
military research. To this day the role and place of military 
science and its divisions have been the subject of scientific 
disputes. Chinese scientists note that with the development of 
military affairs, new directions appear in military science, 
including "military-social science," "military-economic 
science," the "science of military mobilization," and "military 
forecasting," but their place and collateral subordination have 
yet to be determined. 
  Official PRC Ministry of Defense publications define 
military 
science in the broad sense by the term "military theory," which 
is understood to mean systemized knowledge in the area of 
military affairs and of war as a whole which realistically 
reflects the evolution of military organizational development, 
the nature and regularities of warfare, and the very process of 
obtaining this knowledge. 
  At the present stage military theory is called upon to study 
problems holding a priority position such as war and peace, war 
and politics, the interrelationship of defense organizational 
development and economic organizational development, and 
dialectics of military affairs. Chinese specialists believe that 
the level of development and practical value of military theory 
are determined by the degree of conformity of the "new strategic 
situation in the world to the level of China's economic 
development, to the status and development prospects of weapons 
and military equipment of the People's Liberation Army of China 
[PLA], and to requirements of modern military doctrine and 
missions of organizational development of the regular Armed 
Forces." 
  The following are components of military theory: leading 
ideas, military science, science on armed forces organization, 
history of military affairs, military history, and military 
geography. 
  Chinese theorists interpret leading ideas as a 
system of scientific views which combine general provisions of 
Marxism-Leninism on war, peace and the army as well as the 
specific experience of revolutionary wars in China. Military 
ideas of Mao and Deng Xiaoping are their basis. 
  Military science is defined as a system of 
knowledge about the nature of war, the country's preparation for 
it, and methods of its conduct. Military science accomplishes 
the following tasks: research of the strategic nature of modern 
wars; development of doctrinal views on defense organizational 
development and on the country's military-technical and 
military-economic policy; cognition of regularities and methods 
of preparing and conducting warfare; development of pressing 
problems of technical outfitting and economic support of the 
Armed Forces. Theory of military art as well as 
military-technical and military-economic sciences are components 
of military science. 
  The theory of military art is understood to mean various 
fields of knowledge encompassing theoretical and practical 
aspects of preparing and conducting military operations of a 
varying scale. The theory of military art includes theories of 
military strategy, operational art and tactics. 
Military-technical science, which engages in developing military 
equipment and the technology of its production, is considered a 
very important factor determining the country's 
military-technical and military-economic potentials and defense 
capability. Military-economic science represents a system of 
knowledge on military-economic problems relating to production 
of means of warfare and to war as a whole. As an independent 
field of military knowledge, however, it still has no specific 
place in the set of components of military science, which is a 
constant subject of theoretical arguments. A number of Chinese 
military scientists place military-economic research among 
problems of military-technical science, others examine it in the 
theory of military strategy, and still others suggest making it 
an independent division of military science or an independent 
field of military theory. 
  The science on armed forces organization is a 
system of knowledge on regularities and principles of Armed 
Forces organizational development. It studies questions of 
determining directions of development of the Armed Forces 
structure and ratios of branches of forces and combat arms; 
performs tasks of substantiating the PLA's quantitative and 
qualitative makeup for peace and wartime; determines principles 
of manpower acquisition for military formations and units and 
the procedure for performance of duty and for functioning of the 
cadre training system; studies problems of discipline, combat 
training and the provision of military equipment and supplies; 
and develops recommendations on billeting troops, the basing 
system for naval and air forces, training of reserves, and 
establishment of mobilization stockpiles. 
  The history of military affairs studies the 
history of the origin and development of military affairs. Its 
components are the history of wars, history of armed forces, 
history of military equipment, history of military thought and 
history of military art. The regularities and trends in 
development of armed forces and military art are revealed and 
theoretical and practical recommendations on improving military 
affairs are offered within the scope of these sciences. 
  Being a component part of general historical science, 
military history studies the causes, role and place 
of warfare of popular masses, classes and parties in the overall 
process of development of mankind and the state. It views the 
history of wars as a sociopolitical phenomenon, and the military 
system (the army) as an instrument of violence and a very 
important element of state organizational development. 
  Military geography studies military-political, 
military-economic and natural conditions, elements of terrain 
relief and their influence on conduct of combat operations, as 
well as the historical-geographic features and operational 
preparation of probable theaters of military operations. 
  The structure of Chinese military theory (see figure) 
graphically demonstrates that the predominant place in it is 
held by military science, whose main task at the present stage 
is to give theoretical and technical support to modernization of 
defense and to ongoing military reforms. In performing this 
task, Chinese researchers arrived at the conclusion that "reform 
is a means of self-improvement of the army" and it "must follow 
its own national path." The principal contradictions in Chinese 
Armed Forces organizational development are considered to be 
their nonconformity to demands of modern war and the still low 
level of PLA modernization on the one hand, and on the other 
hand, the fact that under present conditions the Army has ceased 
to be an effective means of achieving political goals which can 
be used in all cases and at any time. Difficulties connected 
with determining directions of Armed Forces development stem 
from this. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UFM-004L-09A>      Structure of military theory </FIG>


  To perform its principal task, Chinese military science now 
is resolving the following specific problems: 

  -  forecasting the military-political situation and possible 
variants of initiation of military operations in the course of 
which the country's interests may be affected; 
  -  technical 
substantiation of the military-political course and principles 
of defense organizational development and military 
reform; 
  -  revelation of features of modern wars and development of 
new forms and methods of warfare; 
  -  scientific argumentation of 
directions of development of weapons and combat equipment and a 
determination of their most important kinds for future 
wars; 
  -  substantiation of territorial stationing of military force 
elements; 
  -  precise determination of goals, missions and content 
of military education. 

    Chinese scientists assert that all research on military 
questions in the PRC has specific features, which are--relying 
on Marxist-Leninist theory and the military ideas of Mao and 
Deng Xiaoping, military-scientific research should be linked 
closely with the practice and traditions of the state itself and 
the Army. In conducting such research it is considered necessary 
to rationally combine the international and national theory and 
practice of military organizational development and the applied 
and basic research on military subjects. 
  Thus, a characteristic feature of the present, fourth, stage 
of development of Chinese military science is the sharp increase 
in its role of developing practical recommendations for the 
country's military-political leadership. New trends have begun 
to predominate in China's contemporary military science: 

  -  the growing influence of military science on state 
decisionmaking not only in the military policy area, but also 
for many domestic and foreign policy problems; 
  -  use of results of 
military-scientific research for further developing China's 
"strategic course" and for resolving complex national security 
problems; 
  -  the determining influence of military-scientific 
research on a search for the main, future, and optimal 
directions of Armed Forces organizational development and their 
combat employment in different kinds of wars and military 
conflicts; 
  -  conduct of military-scientific research in support of 
military policy requirements not only of today, but also for the 
long term (right up to the middle of the next century); 
  -  rapid 
development rates of military science, an expansion of its 
content, and the appearance of new independent divisions; 
  -  activation of conversion of military research with wide use 
of 
general scientific and special research methods typical of world 
and national scientific schools. 

    In conclusion, one can state that at the present stage of 
military organizational development the problem of development 
of military theory has begun to occupy a very important place in 
the work of the PRC military-political leadership, which 
believes that "correct theoretical conclusions permit reaching 
the goal by the shortest path," and that theory itself, 
including military theory, must outstrip practice. In addition, 
Chinese analysts believe that victory cannot be won either over 
a weak or a technically superior enemy without the presence of 
advanced theory. Therefore, rapid development not only of 
applied, but also of basic directions of theory is a 
characteristic feature of China's modern military science.

  [Text] A mobile system developed in the United States for 
receiving fuel and issuing it to subunits under field conditions 
which approximate combat conditions to the maximum presently is 
in the inventory of NATO armies. 
  As a rule, system equipment includes the following: six 
Uniroyal soft rubber-fabric reservoirs with an overall capacity 
of 227,100 liters (37,850 liters each);[.sup]1[/] two pump 
units (each with a 1,330 liters/min feed rate); and two 
separator filters (each with 1,330 liters/min capacity). 
  In addition, it includes a rubber-fabric pipeline 500 m long 
overall for connecting equipment with each other and with the 
reservoirs; adapters; valves; and distributing cocks. 
  The system (see figure) permits receiving (discharging) fuel 
into soft reservoirs from three tanker trucks simultaneously and 
issuing it from the reservoirs into tanker trucks (fueling 
trucks), canisters, barrels, and vehicle fuel tanks over six 
lines, and into Sealdrum soft containers over two lines. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UFM-004L-10A>      Flow diagram of fuel receiving </FIG>


  The set of equipment can be divided depending on the 
situation, setting up two systems on the terrain with a capacity 
of 113,500 liters each and using them for receiving and issuing 
different kinds of fuel. 
  The set of equipment weighs 3.2 t and its volume in a form 
packed for transportation is 11.3 m[.sup]3[/] (the set is 
air-transportable). According to standards, it takes a team of 
eight persons around 4 hours to set up or take down one system. 
  Rear subunits which deploy and operate the fuel receiving 
and 
issuing points included in fuel supply points are equipped with 
such systems. Thus, a company which organizationally is part of 
the supply and service battalion is the main subunit in the U.S. 
Army corps logistic support area whose personnel and equipment 
deploy fuel supply points. The company's structure and technical 
outfitting permit it to deploy up to four supply points in the 
corps logistic support area. The standard time for a team of 33 
persons to deploy one is 8 hours, and to take one down it is 6-7 
hours. 
  In addition to the receiving and issuing point, each supply 
point includes a fuel storage sector (five 190,000 liter soft 
reservoirs), a helicopter and ground vehicle fueling point (two 
1,900 liter containers), a sector for fuel storage in barrels 
and cans, and a sector for cleaning and washing containers. 
  The main tasks of the supply points are to transfer oil 
products necessary for rear subunits of divisions and for 
separate supply and service companies which supply fuel to units 
and subunits not part of divisions, and to keep army corps fuel 
reserves at a given level. 
  A division fuel supply point is established in the division 
logistic support area. Its basic elements are a fuel receiving 
and issuing point, a field pool of fuel tanker trucks, two 
fueling points and a laboratory. It is deployed and operated by 
the supply and service company, which organizationally is part 
of the logistic support battalion. 
  Fuel receiving and issuing points included in corps and 
division supply points are outfitted with mobile systems which 
are deployed on the terrain, usually according to the scheme 
shown in the figure.

  [Text] Changes in the world military-political situation 
which began in the mid-1980's forced the U.S. leadership to 
revise its views on problems of the country's national security 
on the threshold of the 21st century. Since 1946, the day of the 
well-known speech by W. Churchill in Fulton (USA), the principal 
threat to U.S. national security was considered to be the Soviet 
Union, the only state in the world which could threaten the 
existence of western civilization. But disintegration of the 
USSR and of the Warsaw Pact Organization on the one hand and the 
rapid buildup of military potential of individual third world 
countries on the other led to a change in the correlation of 
forces in the international arena. 
  In the assessment of U.S. political scientists, development 
of the world community up to the end of the 1990's will be 
characterized by growing political instability, serious economic 
shocks and an increasing number of states possessing a 
significant military potential. With consideration of the 
continuing process of proliferation of modern types of arms, 
including mass destruction weapons, all this creates a potential 
threat to U.S. security. The likelihood that the U.S. Armed 
Forces will be forced to defend the country's interests by arms 
remains high, in the assertion of Pentagon specialists, but the 
time and methods of their use will undergo significant changes 
in the future. 
  In the situation at hand U.S. foreign policy pursues the 
following goals: assist in spreading freedom and democracy (as 
the Americans themselves understand it), ensure stability of the 
country's economic development (for which a need arises to 
protect very important sources of strategic resources and lines 
of communication), fulfill allied obligations, exert direct 
influence on development of the situation in unstable regions in 
U.S. interests, prevent a strengthening of unfriendly regimes, 
oppose proliferation of mass destruction weapons, and fight 
international terrorism and the drug trade. These provisions 
became the basis of new concepts of organizational development 
and employment of branches of the U.S. Armed Forces; development 
of the concepts were begun by appropriate ministries and staffs 
in the late 1980's. 
  The Air Force was first to advance a new concept for its 
development, called "global reach-global power." It was 
submitted to Congress in February 1991 as an annex to a 
Secretary of the Air Force report on the draft budget for fiscal 
years 1992-1993. 
  Basic provisions of U.S. national security strategy are 
formulated in the first part of the document. In determining the 
role and place of armed forces in ensuring national security, 
the U.S. administration proceeded from the following theses: 

  -  on a global scale the United States will continue to play 
a key role in the world to retain control over areas of its 
"vital interests" at any point on the planet; 
  -  Europe will 
continue to be a vitally important region and, despite a 
reduction in numerical strength of the U.S. Armed Forces 
grouping, ensuring European security (strengthening NATO, 
supporting ideas of the Conference on Security and Cooperation) 
will remain as before the principal task of the United States in 
this zone; 
  -  as the importance of the Asiatic-Pacific region 
grows, the sphere of U.S. "vital interests" is expanding and the 
threat on the part of traditional enemies is diminishing: 
  -  in the 
Persian Gulf U.S. interests remain the same--support friendly 
states and prevent any foreign power from establishing control 
over oil resources and lines of communication. 

    Independently of the correlation of forces taking shape in 
the international arena, it is planned to carry on U.S. Armed 
Forces organizational development in the future as well guided 
by principles of a reasonable combination of offensive and 
defensive capabilities. The following remain fundamental 
military policy provisions: strategic deterrence and defense, 
forward presence, immediate reaction to crisis situations, and 
capability of quickly building up military might to the 
necessary level. 
  These provisions served as the basis for the second and main 
part of the concept, which examines main directions of Air Force 
organizational development and methods of its employment at the 
end of the current century and beginning of the next century. 
  The Pentagon leadership believes the Air Force has the 
necessary personnel and assets for performing missions in 
military conflicts of any scale and intensity. It is 
characterized by a long operating range, flexibility, 
operational efficiency, accuracy in delivering strikes and high 
offensive potential of weapon systems. In planning 
organizational development of this branch of the Armed Forces, 
the U.S. Air Force command attempts to achieve the following 
goals: provide capabilities for conducting combat operations in 
any TVD [theater of military operations], organize airlifts of 
troops and cargoes in a short time on a global scale, and 
achieve aerospace superiority. For this it is deemed necessary 
to develop nuclear forces; strategic, tactical, military 
transport and tanker aviation; and space-based forces and assets. 
  Provide capabilities for conducting combat operations 
in a TVD. Questions of organizational development of Air 
Force general purpose forces hold an important place and are 
examined in greater detail with consideration of possible 
options of their employment both in peace as well as wartime. 
  The concept assumes that in peacetime regions will remain 
such as the European Theater of War, where a potential need is 
preserved for conducting large-scale combat operations for a 
lengthy time, but the likelihood of initiation of war here has a 
tendency to drop. Meanwhile, there was a sharp increase in the 
likelihood of the appearance of a threat to U.S. interests from 
individual states located a considerable distance from the main 
TVD's. 
  Pentagon representatives believe that military force will be 
used in local conflicts primarily in the form of brief, 
purposeful, effective operations. In the course of battles the 
U.S. Armed Forces must react quickly and adequately to actions 
of a well equipped and well trained enemy, deliver powerful 
strikes and win victory in compressed time periods. 
  The Air Force has those capabilities to the full extent. The 
capability of promptly concentrating necessary forces and assets 
in remote areas of the globe and the flexibility and operational 
efficiency inherent to Air Force elements permit the command to 
deliver strikes against the most important elements of the enemy 
military and military-economic potential in very short time 
periods. 
  The flight range of combat aircraft is such that it enables 
them to operate at a considerable distance from base airfields. 
Flexibility of employing Air Force elements permits reacting 
promptly to a change in the situation and influencing a 
situation created in a given region. The time aircraft are 
present in the enemy air defense weapon impact zone and the time 
of performing the combat mission as a whole are reduced because 
of high flight speed. 
  In the opinion of western military specialists, the nature 
of 
combat operations by air groupings deployed in a TVD will 
undergo no substantial changes. They will perform all primary 
missions in the course of independent air operations and 
operations together with ground troops and naval forces: winning 
air superiority, giving close air support to troops, isolating 
the battlefield and combat operations area, and conducting 
aerial reconnaissance. Forces and assets assigned for this will 
be determined by specific conditions. 
  At the same time, as the concept notes for the first time, 
in 
a number of cases aviation will independently perform such 
missions as neutralizing the enemy or depriving him of the 
capability to resist, and disrupting the cohesiveness of his 
troop operations, which may have a deciding influence on the 
course of a conflict. The 1991 Persian Gulf war is an example of 
this. 
  The document emphasizes that although joint efforts of all 
branches of armed forces unquestionably are needed, judging from 
practice of recent years it is most often the Air Force that 
places the most combat ready force elements with a large radius 
of action at the disposal of the country's leadership. Aviation 
is capable of delivering weapons and destroying primary targets 
in any region. The Air Force role in protecting U.S. interests 
outside the country may grow even more in the future. 
  Having considerable capabilities for destroying targets, 
strategic aviation can deliver a strike at any point on the 
globe in compressed time periods. Thus, during Exercise Bright 
Star-83, B-52 strategic bombers which took off from airfields in 
the continental United States delivered a strike with 
conventional munitions against targets on a range in Egypt, 
after which they returned to departure bases without an 
intermediate landing. U.S. military specialists assume that 
measures similar to Operation Eldorado Canyon (delivery of the 
strike against Libya in 1986) can be carried out by lesser 
forces and assets, but forward air bases or permission to fly 
through the air space of other states are necessary for this. 
  In the opinion of the Air Force command, strategic bombers 
with conventional weapons can be brought in in the first hours 
(days) of a conflict to deliver a strike against vital targets. 
In this case the material costs turn out to be less than in 
realizing other options of armed intervention. In subsequent 
combat operations they can be used for mass bombings of troops 
in concentration areas, on forward movement routes, and against 
air and naval bases and infrastructure facilities. Their 
capability for performing combat missions at night and in 
adverse weather conditions permits the command element to 
organize continuous fire pressure on the enemy. 
  In connection with the aging of B-52 aircraft, in recent 
years the Air Force command decided to modify the B-1B heavy 
bomber to expand its capabilities for employing conventional 
munitions. The B-1B has a number of advantages over the B-52 
(less radar cross-section, greater flight speed, improved 
electronics) and is capable of performing combat missions more 
effectively, especially in initial stage of a conflict. 
  The question of using new B-2 bombers (Fig. 1 [figure not 
reproduced]) developed using stealth technology is being 
discussed actively at the present time. This aircraft has 
greater survivability and an increased combat operating radius 
with the same ordnance payload compared with the B-52 and B-1B. 
Calculations showed that a B-2 bomber using two air bases (Diego 
Garcia in the Indian Ocean and Andersen on Guam in the Pacific) 
is capable of delivering a strike with conventional weapons 
against targets in any part of the globe with one aerial 
refueling. The U.S. Air Force command considers this aircraft to 
be a highly effective means of delivering surprise strikes. 
  Autonomous operations in the deep enemy rear are the 
principal feature of B-2 employment (it is proposed to destroy 
the maximum number of important strategic targets). Their use 
will permit significantly increasing surprise in delivering 
strikes, ensure destruction of any target on enemy territory and 
ensure continuity of the effect on his principal installations. 
  But the primary role in accomplishing swift, adequate 
retaliatory operations in conflicts of varying intensity without 
use of nuclear weapons belongs to tactical aviation. In the 
opinion of the U.S. command, forward-based tactical air units 
and subunits providing a constant military presence (Europe, 
countries of the Asiatic-Pacific region, and the Persian Gulf) 
have a stabilizing effect on the situation in corresponding 
regions. Therefore, the planned reduction of air groupings on 
overseas territories is being carried out by moving subunits 
equipped with obsolete aircraft models (F-4 and F-111 tactical 
fighters, A-10 attack aircraft) to the United States. At the 
same time, it is planned to deploy units and subunits armed with 
modernized F-15E tactical fighters, and in the future also the 
newest F-22's (Fig. 2 [figure not reproduced]), in forward zones. 
  Considering the increased likelihood of local armed 
conflicts 
being initiated in various regions, the Air Force command began 
creating composite air wings in accordance with the new concept. 
Because they include various types of combat and auxiliary 
aircraft, the composite air wings are capable of rebasing 
independently and quickly and performing all missions facing a 
deployed air grouping. Along with combat aircraft, such a 
subunit may include tanker, military transport, and radar early 
warning and control aircraft. 
  The multi-option nature of employing tactical aviation 
outside the country depends to a considerable extent on the 
presence and preparation of an airfield network in forward 
zones. In this connection the country's military-political 
leadership believes that when allied interests are threatened, 
the requisite number of air bases and forward airfields 
supporting a redeployment of units and subunits within several 
hours should be placed at the disposal of the United States. In 
developing the Air Force organizational development concept, the 
command element proceeds from the need to preserve (up to the 
mid-1990's), and in the future also to increase, the firepower 
of strike aviation with a substantial reduction in its combat 
force level. Financial restrictions force certain reductions, 
and the latest changes in the correlation of forces in the 
international arena and achievements in the development of 
aircraft weapon systems provide an opportunity for such 
reductions, above all of tactical aviation (up to 30 percent by 
1995-1997). 
  The following basic directions are planned for development 
of 
aircraft and weapons in the next few years: An increase in 
performance characteristics and specifications of aircraft, 
above all through achievement of "supermaneuverability," use of 
supersonic cruising speed, and use of economical engines; 
introduction of automated flight and weapon control systems and 
equipment; realization of stealth technology to reduce the 
signature and vulnerability of aircraft and aircraft munitions; 
achievement of high effectiveness in engagement of airborne and 
ground targets by aircraft long-range precision guided weapons; 
development of remotely controlled aircraft for various 
purposes; expansion in the area of combat application of 
aircraft (use of upper layers of the atmosphere and hypersonic 
flight speeds); and development of aerospace aircraft capable of 
flying in low, near-earth orbits. 
  Realization of research in the area of foremost technology 
under the Forecast-2 program, which unites basic priority 
technologies for creation of aircraft weapons and military 
equipment (39 advanced technologies and 31 new system 
developments), will be the material basis of the concept in 
question. 
  Adoption of the latest aircraft (B-2, F-117, F-22, F-15E) 
outfitted with precision weapons and adoption of low-signature 
cruise missiles and drones will significantly increase Air Force 
capabilities, since they will be capable of engaging mobile 
ballistic missile systems, the main elements of reserve troop 
groupings in the interior of the country, state and military 
command and control entities, and very important transportation 
hubs and power and industrial installations. In other words, the 
destruction not only of forward groupings of armed forces, but 
also of deep reserves, disabling of enterprises of leading 
sectors of industry, and a reduction in the enemy military 
potential are probable. In addition, this may provide continuity 
of action of combat aircraft regardless of weather conditions 
and time of day, which reduces the effectiveness of the air 
defense system in repelling an air attack and strengthens the 
psychological effect on the enemy. 
  Joint operations of the Air Force and Navy during which they 
will reinforce and supplement each other are singled out in 
particular in the "global reach-global power" concept. According 
to the command element's calculations, Air Force aviation is 
capable of substantially assisting the Navy in performing 
missions of covering ship groupings and protecting sea lines of 
communication in various areas. Should it be necessary, aircraft 
carriers in turn should arrive in a conflict area right after 
tactical aviation force elements in order to build up efforts. 
Combat capabilities of U.S. Navy ships' air defense forces and 
assets can be used in organizing defense of territory adjoining 
the coast, because of which Air Force aircraft can be retargeted 
to perform other more important missions. Thus, a squadron of 
B-52 bombers is capable of doubling the strike potential of a 
carrier force. 
  In the course of combat training, strategic bomber subunits 
actively perform missions of laying minefields in sea waters and 
combating enemy ships by use of antiship missiles. 
  In accordance with the new concept, missions are assigned to 
the U.S. Air Force in the course of special operations both for 
comprehensive support of those operations as well as for 
immediate involvement in them. (It is proposed to bring in 
special-purpose air units and subunits as well as tactical 
aviation force elements). One goal which is assuming ever 
greater importance is the fight against illegal drug shipments. 
The Air Force must assign necessary forces and assets for 
conducting aerial reconnaissance and surveillance, intercepting 
airborne targets and isolating areas of drug production. 
  Support of strategic movements of troops and 
cargoes. The new concept also reflected a change in views 
on the Air Force role, place and missions in supporting Armed 
Forces mobility. If one takes into account the scale of the 
planned reduction in numerical strength of U.S. troops and 
unpredictable development of the situation in certain areas, 
support of strategic mobility will be one of the primary Air 
Force missions. 
  The increased likelihood of local conflicts breaking out in 
third world countries, which as a rule have a poorly developed 
infrastructure, places the Air Force command face to face with 
additional missions in organizing airlifts. Among them is the 
need to deploy additional command and control systems and 
communication lines; the provision of navigation and 
meteorological support as well as logistic support, above all 
the supply of POL and spare parts. 
  Guided by these provisions, the Air Force command advances 
the requirement to continue production and procurement of the 
new C-17 transport intended for replacing the C-141 and capable 
of operating from poorly equipped airfields, including from 
those with dirt runways. 
  The second part of the concept ("global power") emphasizes 
Air Force strike assets (ICBM's, strategic bombers and tactical 
fighters) and its first part ("global reach") reflects command 
views on use of tanker aviation. The likelihood of a reduction 
in the number of U.S. air bases on overseas territories 
substantially increases the role of tanker aircraft, which are a 
mandatory, necessary means of supporting operations both of U.S. 
Air Force combat aviation as well as auxiliary aviation. Aerial 
refueling of aircraft increases the radius of action of combat 
aircraft, the flight range of military transport aircraft, and 
time in the air of air defense fighters, airborne command post 
aircraft and radar early warning and control aircraft, which 
contributes to increased effectiveness of U.S. Air Force 
operations. In addition, some tanker aircraft can be used for 
refueling Naval Aviation aircraft as well as allied aircraft, 
thanks to which their capabilities for conducting combat 
operations increase. 
  It also should be noted that in the organization of troop 
and 
cargo airlifts, tanker aircraft will be used to deliver 
necessary aviation fuel reserves to the conflict area. 
  Use of aerospace for supporting Air Force 
activity. The document emphasizes that in the future 
aviation will be used on a global scale day and night in any 
weather and climatic conditions in delivering strikes 
continuously against ground, naval and airborne targets. All 
this will require a qualitatively new approach to supporting 
aircraft and missile flights. Space reconnaissance, navigation, 
meteorological support and communications systems can play a 
special role in supporting aircraft operations. They will 
support the issue of target designations, battle management, 
information exchange, and a precise approach to the target area. 
  Technical progress permits realizing such important 
advantages of space-based systems as global surveillance, 
relatively low vulnerability, and independence of operations, 
which can contribute to a significant increase in effectiveness 
of using aviation forces and assets. 
  Aviation combat support systems supplement capabilities of 
space systems in following the quickly changing world situation. 
The AWACS radar early warning and control system as well as the 
advanced JSTARS, adapted for swift deployment in the most remote 
parts of the globe, are the principal and sometimes also the 
only source of information on the enemy in the initial stage of 
combat operations. 
  Strengthening the security of allies and developing 
relations with them. The new concept attaches special 
significance to this area of Air Force activity as a means of 
achieving national policy goals in a corresponding region. In 
particular, aircraft deliveries considerably increase combat 
capabilities of partners' armed forces and give assistance in 
the area of preparing personnel and logistic support, which 
helps strengthen and spread U.S. influence and provides for 
advance deployment of the logistic support system in potential 
conflict areas. 
  One Brookings Institution study entitled "Strength Without 
War" draws the conclusion that following the end of World War II 
the Air Force achieved positive results in various conflicts 
considerably more often than any other branch of the Armed 
Forces. Aviation's role will grow constantly in the future with 
a shift of emphasis to preparation for military operations using 
conventional weapons and an absence of immediate opposition 
(contact) of armed forces groupings deployed in peacetime. 
  U.S. Air Force organizational development up to the end of 
the current century and at the beginning of the next century is 
to be accomplished in accordance with changes occurring in the 
world. The Air Force must perform assigned missions to the full 
extent in any part of the globe in compressed time periods. An 
analysis of plans and programs for development of the Armed 
Forces as a whole permits asserting that it is specifically 
aviation that will conform most fully to basic provisions of the 
strategy of U.S. involvement in regional conflicts and will 
become one of the means of fire effect against enemy targets 
regardless of their location, size, structure, mobility and 
other characteristics. Specifically these capabilities will be 
built up so that the Army, Air Force and Navy mutually 
supplement and reinforce each other. Thus, optimum Armed Forces 
will be formed to realize U.S. national security strategy.

<F P=106> [Part One of article based on foreign press materials by </F>
Captain 1st Rank V. Aksenov and Captain 1st Rank K. Lumpurov] 
  [Text] This article, prepared from foreign press materials, 
provides a brief analysis of the status and immediate 
development prospects of navies of NATO member states (above all 
their numerical strength and ship order of battle) under new 
conditions. 
  The U.S. military-political leadership regards a powerful 
fleet as a necessary attribute of a superpower and one of the 
main tools for ensuring U.S. interests on a global scale. In a 
report on national military strategy (January 1992), the 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff noted that "geography 
endowed the United States with a defensive shield, but national 
security is linked firmly with events across the oceans and with 
possibilities of access to various regions." The experience of 
combat employment of naval forces in recent years, above all in 
the Persian Gulf, demonstrated the Navy's increased importance 
in accomplishing missions of military presence in areas of the 
globe remote from the United States, in prompt reaction to 
crises and in vigorous operations in them. The Navy is given a 
special role in connection with the closing of a number of U.S. 
military bases on foreign territories. 
  Assurance of U.S. Navy readiness to take part in regional 
conflicts, above all in Europe, the Persian Gulf and the Far 
East, is becoming the important element in U.S. Navy 
organizational development and employment. In case a global 
threat is revived, measures are envisaged for an emergency 
buildup of the effective combat strength of regular forces to 
the necessary level. On the whole, it is planned to keep the 
Navy in a high condition of combat and mobilization readiness. 
(As announced in the 1994 budget report, 40-45 percent of ships 
presently are at sea each day, including 20-25 percent on combat 
duty in forward areas), continue programs for developing the 
fleet and its reserve components, and ensure effective work of 
the shipbuilding industry. 
  U.S. Navy activity in maintaining stability in various 
regions of the world requires corrections to be made to combat 
training plans aimed at additional rehearsal of missions in 
combating navies of developing countries equipped with modern 
weapons and military equipment. Above all, this concerns 
anti-submarine and anti-mine defense in "shallow-water areas" 
and organization of a more effective defense against small 
surface craft and missiles. 
  To strengthen its influence and develop remote TVD's 
[theaters of military operations], it is planned to expand the 
scale of two-sided combat training of fleets of the United 
States and other countries (the aforementioned report notes that 
in 1992 alone the Americans took part in 216 joint exercises 
with fleets of 58 countries) and to make fuller use of U.S. Navy 
capabilities for giving humanitarian aid and for fighting the 
drug trade and terrorism. 
  At the same time, the priorities of matters being decided by 
the Navy are changing under conditions of the new 
military-strategic situation. According to U.S. Navy command 
statements, because of sharply decreased activeness of Russian 
Navy combat training and increased effectiveness of national 
global surveillance and reconnaissance systems in sea and ocean 
TVD's, it is becoming possible to reduce maneuverable ASW forces 
providing protection for ocean and sea lines of communication. 
Based on experience of Operation Desert Shield, the mission of 
such ASW forces now reduces merely to creating "protected zones 
of lines of communication" in areas adjoining a combat 
operations zone. 
  In accordance with basic provisions of the concept for Navy 
organizational and combat employment adopted in 1992 known as 
"operation from the sea" (and not on the sea as in previous 
"maritime strategy"), the Navy's primary mission becomes 
assurance both of sea supremacy as well as superiority in air 
space and outer space over the waters and territory of a combat 
operations zone. 
  According to data of the reference "Jane's Fighting Ships, 
1993-1994," the numerical strength of the U.S. Navy (not 
counting Marines, Naval Aviation and other components) as of the 
beginning of 1994 was 708,000 persons and the ship order of 
battle numbered 400-307 combatant ships and 60 auxiliary vessels 
in the regular forces and 33 ships in the Naval Reserve. In 
addition, 70 ships and vessels were in mothballs and 47 patrol 
ships and around 200 vessels and small craft were part of the 
Coast Guard, which in peacetime is subordinate to the Department 
of Transportation. 
  The country's Navy is divided into strategic sea-based 
nuclear forces and general purpose forces according to missions 
to be performed. 
  Nuclear powered missile submarines (SSBN's) hold a 
special place both in the makeup of the country's strategic 
nuclear forces as well as in the Navy's organizational 
structure. The ballistic missiles (SLBM's) with great striking 
power, range and accuracy that are aboard them make these 
submarines, which possess high readiness for combat employment 
and survivability, the most effective means of nuclear attack 
compared with land-based ICBM's and strategic bombers. 
  By the beginning of 1992[.sup]1[/] the number of U.S. 
SSBN's was 34 and there were 640 ballistic missiles (5,440 
nuclear warheads) accommodated aboard them. In January 1994 22 
SSBN's (464 SLBM's, 5,056 warheads)--14 Ohio-Class and 8 
Lafayette-Class--remained in the U.S. Navy. 
  Plans are that in four years there should be a total of 18 
Ohio-Class SSBN's in the U.S. Navy order of battle. It is 
planned to remove Lafayette-Class submarines, which are 
exhausting their service life, from operational status gradually. 
  With the aim of fulfilling requirements of the Treaty on the 
Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (the total 
number of nuclear warheads of SLBM's and ICBM's must not exceed 
4,900), it is envisaged recycling or eliminating all obsolete 
SSBN's and SLBM's. At the same time it is proposed to up-arm the 
first eight submarines in the Ohio-class series with Trident II 
missiles in place of Trident I missiles. (The possibility of 
such modernization was included in their design). Specifications 
and performance characteristics of ballistic missile 
modifications are given below.

  Ohio-Class SSBN's have been constructed since 1974. The lead 
submarine was launched in 1979 and transferred to the Navy in 
November 1981. Her specifications and performance 
characteristics are as follows: surface displacement 16,600 t, 
submerged displacement 18,700 t; principal dimensions--length 
170.7 m, beam 12.8 m, draft 10.8 m; output of nuclear power 
plant (S8G water-moderated reactor, recharging of core every 
nine years) of 60,000 hp permits providing a submerged speed of 
25 knots; normal operating depth 300 m; armament--24 Trident I 
or Trident II SLBM's, four 533-mm torpedo tubes. There are two 
crews (Blue and Gold) for each submarine consisting of 155 
persons each, including 15 officers. 
  From the moment of transfer to the Navy until removal from 
operational status an SSBN must be at sea at least 66 percent of 
the time, including major overhaul periods (combined with 
recharging of the nuclear reactor). One SSBN combat employment 
cycle consists of a 70-day patrol and a 25-day period, which 
includes the submarine's transfer to the other crew, maintenance 
between patrols, transfer of ammunition and so on. 
  The first eight SSBN's (SSBN 726-733, stationed at Bangor 
Naval Base in Washington) perform duty in Pacific waters and the 
other six (SSBN 734-739, Kings Bay, Georgia) in the Atlantic. 
Those naval bases are specially equipped for reception, docking, 
loading and unloading of ammunition, degaussing of SSBN's, and 
for personnel and families to rest and live. 
  Communications and command and control of submarines are 
accomplished in particular using very low frequency radio gear, 
ground systems of which are located on territory of the states 
of Michigan (opened in 1986) and Wisconsin (1991). 
  As they are outfitted with increasingly powerful offensive 
weapon systems, general purpose forces become an 
effective reserve of strategic forces and are an irreplaceable 
means, tested many times, of achieving military-political goals 
in local conflicts. They include nuclear powered multipurpose 
submarines, surface ships (aircraft carriers, cruisers, 
destroyers, frigates, mine warfare ships and landing ships) and 
auxiliary vessels. 
  As of the beginning of the current year, the U.S. Navy 
numbered 87 nuclear powered multipurpose submarines (SSN's), of 
which 54 are of the Los Angeles Class (Fig. 1 [figure not 
reproduced], during 1992-1993 six with side numbers SSN 759-765 
and 767 were included in the order of battle and SSN 689 Baton 
Rouge was turned over for scrap); 30 Sturgeon Class (two SSN's, 
SSN 663 Hammerhead and SSN 687 Richard B. Russell, were removed 
from the regular forces in 1993 and taken off Navy rolls, and it 
is planned to remove SSN 637, 648, 650, 662 and 679 from the 
Navy order of battle in 1994); and one Narwhal-Class (SSN 671). 
In addition, SSBN 642 Kamehameha and 645 James K. Polk, refitted 
for supporting U.S. Navy Special Operations Forces raiding and 
reconnaissance parties, were reclassified as multipurpose SSN's. 
  It is planned to commission the last Los Angeles-Class SSN 
in 
the series, SSN 773 Cheyenne, in August 1996. Their construction 
began in 1972 (the lead submarine was transferred to the Navy in 
November 1976). Submerged displacement of the SSN's is 6,927 t; 
the nuclear power plant (S6G reactor), with an output of 35,000 
hp, permits developing a submerged speed of 32 knots; 
submergence depth is 450 m; standard ammunition 26-8 Tomahawk 
cruise missiles, 4 Harpoon antiship missiles and 14 Mk 48 
torpedoes (there are four 533-mm torpedo tubes). All SSN's are 
equipped for under-ice navigation, and beginning with the 32nd 
submarine (SSN 719 Providence), they are additionally equipped 
with a vertical launcher for 12 Tomahawk missiles (outside the 
pressure hull in the forebody). According to foreign press 
information, nine ships of this class successfully participated 
in the war against Iraq in 1991 and two submarines delivered 
Tomahawk cruise missile strikes against Iraqi territory from the 
Eastern Mediterranean. 
  The Americans presently are building two SSN's of a new 
class, SSN 21 Seawolf and SSN 22 Connecticut, and their 
commissioning is planned for 1996 and 1998 respectively. 
Initially, it was envisaged building up to 30 such ships, but 
this program was revised in favor of less costly SSN-X 
Centurion-Class SSN's. The latter's capabilities are assessed to 
be 25 percent lower. Basic specifications and performance 
characteristics of Seawolf are as follows: surface displacement 
7,460 t, submerged displacement 9,137 t; hull length 107.6 m, 
beam 12.9 m, draft 10.9 m; the nuclear power plant (S6W reactor) 
with an output of 52,000 hp permits developing a submerged speed 
of 35 knots; submergence depth 610 m; and standard ammunition 
may include up to 54 (Tomahawk cruise missiles, Harpoon antiship 
missiles, torpedoes, mines) employed from eight torpedo tubes of 
increased diameter. 
  Aircraft carriers are the Navy's main striking force. As 
part 
of battle groups and in coordination with mixed naval forces, 
they perform missions of winning sea supremacy and air 
superiority, delivering strikes by deck-based aircraft against 
targets in the interior of enemy territory, providing air 
support to amphibious landings and operations of ground troops 
on coastal axes, accomplishing blockade operations and a number 
of other missions. 
  The Navy's regular forces presently number 13 carriers, of 
which six are of the Chester W. Nimitz Class (CVN 68-73), four 
of the Kitty Hawk Class (CV 63, 64, 66, 67), two of the 
Forrestal Class (CV 60, 62) and one of the Enterprise Class (CVN 
65). Ten ships are part of combat-ready forces. The carriers 
Enterprise and John F. Kennedy (CV 67) are in major overhaul 
until May 1994 and September 1995 respectively, and following 
sea trials work is being done on the latest nuclear powered 
carrier, George Washington (CVN 73), transferred to the Navy on 
4 July 1992 (Fig. 2 [figure not reproduced]). 
  The carrier Ranger (CV 61) was decommissioned 10 July 1993 
and is in mothballs at Bremerton, Washington. The carrier 
Forrestal was reclassified as a training carrier (ATV 59) in 
February 1992. Up to the end of the 1990's it is planned to 
decommission three ships of this type: Saratoga (CV 60), 
Independence (CV 62) and America (CV 66), built in 1956, 1959 
and 1965 respectively. 
  Under the program for development of carrier forces, two 
Chester W. Nimitz-Class nuclear powered carriers, John Stennis 
(CVN 74) and United States (CVN 75), are in various stages of 
construction, with planned dates of transfer to the Navy in 1996 
and 1998. One billion dollars were allocated in fiscal year [FY] 
1994 for procurement of equipment and materials for building a 
ninth ship of this class; it is envisaged having ten such 
carriers in the early 2000's. 
  On the whole, despite budget and other limitations, 
construction of nuclear powered carriers continues in the United 
States, thanks to which the U.S. Navy will continue to have a 
monopoly on this kind of weapon in the next few years. 
  Cruisers, destroyers and frigates hold an important place in 
the makeup of the Navy's general purpose forces (all 
battleships--Iowa, New Jersey, Missouri and Wisconsin--were 
mothballed). They are intended for delivery of strikes both 
against naval and shore targets as well as against targets in 
the interior of enemy territory, for operations above all as 
part of carrier, missile and ship battle groups, and for defense 
of amphibious landing groups and convoys. 
  There were 45 cruisers in U.S. Navy regular forces at the 
beginning of this year: 9 nuclear powered--CGN 9 Long Beach, CGN 
25 Bainbridge, CGN 35 Truxton, CGN 36 California, CGN 37 South 
Carolina, CGN 38 Virginia, CGN 39 Texas, CGN 40 Mississippi and 
CGN 41 Arkansas; 6 Belknap Class (CG 26, 29-33); 4 Leahy Class 
(CG 19, 20, 22, 23), and 26 Ticonderoga Class (CG 47-72). Three 
Belknap-Class cruisers (CG 27, 28 and 34) and 5 Leahy-Class 
cruisers (CG 16-18, 21 and 24) were taken off operational status 
and removed from the rolls in 1993. 
  In the next three years it is planned to eliminate from the 
order of battle the nuclear powered cruisers Long Beach, 
Bainbridge and Truxton, built in the 1960's, three 
Virginia-Class nuclear powered cruisers, and all remaining 
Leahy-Class and Belknap-Class ships, and to transfer to the 
fleet in 1994 the 27th and last in the series of 
Ticonderoga-Class cruisers (Fig. 3 [figure not reproduced]). 
  In just the last two years the Navy received six of the 
newest cruisers of this class, which became the embodiment of 
modern U.S. shipbuilding achievements. They were created based 
on the hull and main power plant of the destroyer Spruance, 
which permitted making their construction less expensive, 
simplifying operation and maintenance, and facilitating 
personnel training. The multifunctional Aegis combat system, 
with which Arleigh Burke-Class destroyers also are outfitted, 
combines essentially all means of acquisition, command and 
control and communications as well as weapon subsystems 
(Tomahawk cruise missiles, Harpoon antiship missiles, ASROC ASW 
missiles, Standard SAM's, torpedoes, guns), jammer subsystems 
and so on. Functions of combat employment of weapons are 
performed with the help of a unified computer system, thanks to 
which the resources of all subsystems become common and are used 
more effectively to perform a specific combat mission. The Aegis 
system also permits integrating weapons of an entire formation, 
including aircraft.[.sup]2[/] 
  The destroyer type in the U.S. Navy is represented by 39 
ships of four classes: Kidd (4, DDG 993-996), Spruance (31, DD 
963-992 and 997) and four newest ones of the Arleigh Burke Class 
(DDG 51-54), transferred to the Navy during 1991-1993. 
  By the end of the 1990's another 28 of the Arleigh Burke 
Class will be added to the above destroyers (18 ships of this 
class presently are in various stages of construction). It is 
envisaged having a total of at least 49 such ships of three 
modifications distinguished by displacement, weapon mix, size of 
crew and certain technical features. 
  The lead ship, transferred to the Navy in July 1991, has a 
full displacement of 8,315 t, hull length of 153.8 m, beam of 
20.4 m and draft of 9.9 m; four gas turbines with an output of 
105,000 hp provide a flank speed of 32 knots and a range of 
4,400 nm at 20 knots. The ship's hull is made of steel, and a 
kevlar covering with an overall weight of 70 t protects her most 
vulnerable parts. Special attention is given to protecting the 
crew (303 persons, including 23 officers) against mass 
destruction weapons. Ships of a second modification will be 
built after 1995 beginning with the 22nd hull (full displacement 
9,033 t), and ships of the third modification beginning with the 
28th hull (9,217 t). There will be a crew of 380, including 32 
officers. 
  Twenty-five Spruance-Class destroyers are armed with 
Tomahawk 
cruise missiles and are capable of delivering strikes against 
targets in the interior of enemy territory. It is envisaged 
outfitting all ships of this class with Mk 41 vertical launchers 
during scheduled modernization (up to the end of the 1990's). 
Presently 19 Spruance-Class destroyers already have such 
launchers (61 missiles: Tomahawk cruise missiles and ASROC ASW 
missiles). Harpoon antiship missiles and Sea Sparrow SAM's are 
in two quad launchers and one eight-cell launcher respectively. 
  Thus, despite a certain reduction in appropriations for 
construction and upkeep of the fleet, in the last two years 
there has been a buildup in the number of ships that are 
platforms for Tomahawk sea-launched cruise missiles (SLCM's), 
one of the most important strike weapons of U.S. Navy general 
purpose forces.[.sup]3[/] By the beginning of 1994 the U.S. 
Navy had a total of 135 such ships (2,200 launchers), including 
80 SSN's (600 launchers) and 55 surface ships (1,600 launchers). 
In addition, four Iowa-Class battleships with a total of 128 
Tomahawk cruise missile launchers are mothballed in 270-day 
readiness to put to sea. 
  The direction of the U.S. shipbuilding program up to 1998 
confirms the trend toward a certain increase in SLCM platforms, 
with a substantial growth in the cumulative number of launchers 
on them (over 3,000) through commissioning of new ships that are 
SLCM platforms. The U.S. Navy command plans to have over 4,000 
Tomahawk cruise missiles in the inventory in 1995. In accordance 
with a decision by U.S. President G. Bush of 27 February 1991, 
SLCM's with nuclear warheads were removed from ships during 1992 
and placed in arsenals of naval bases in the continental United 
States in readiness to be loaded back on platform ships in 24-36 
hours. 
  Specifications and performance characteristics of Tomahawk 
cruise missiles of various modifications are given below.

  Frigates are one of the most numerous types of surface 
ships. 
There are 35 in U.S. Navy regular forces and there are 16 Oliver 
H. Perry-Class ships in the Naval Reserve. Eight Knox-Class 
ships are used as training ships to train crews of reservists 
for 22 mothballed frigates, which are ready to be transferred to 
the regular forces in 180 days. 
  The entire series of Oliver H. Perry-Class frigates was 
transferred to the fleet during 1977-1989 and has the following 
side numbers: FFG 7-16, 19-34, 36-43, 45-61. The ship's full 
displacement is 4,100 t, length 135.6 m, beam 13.7 m, draft 7.5 
m; the power plant with an output of 41,000 hp provides a flank 
speed of 29 knots and a range of 4,500 nm at 20 knots; there is 
a crew of 206, including 13 officers and 19 technical flight 
personnel who service two SH-60B helicopters; armament: Harpoon 
antiship missiles, Standard SAM's (ready inventory 40 missiles), 
76-mm single-tube gun, 20-mm Vulcan-Phalanx CIWS, and two 324-mm 
triple torpedo tubes. 
  All nuclear powered multipurpose submarines, 118 surface 
combatants of the Regular Navy and 24 of the Naval Reserve, and 
a number of U.S. Naval Aviation squadrons are armed with Harpoon 
antiship missiles.[.sup]4[/]

  U.S. Navy mine warfare forces are represented by 15 ships, 
including 13 Avenger-Class (MCM 1-13) and two Osprey-Class (MHC 
51 and 52). Five Aggressive-Class ships (MSO 441, 455, 488, 489 
and 492) and one Acme-Class (MSO 511) are in the Naval Reserve. 
The 14th Avenger-Class mine countermeasures ship Chief, which 
completes the series, is planned to be transferred to the Navy 
in 1994. During the next 3-4 years it is planned to complete 
construction of ten Osprey-Class ships with simultaneous removal 
of obsolete minesweepers from the order of battle. 
  The mine warfare ships Avenger and Osprey are intended for 
mine countermeasures support to the Navy on approaches to naval 
bases, basing facilities and ports, and support to naval 
groupings in combat operations areas in remote TVD's. The 
experience of employing minesweepers during the Persian Gulf 
War, which was negative on the whole, showed the need to upgrade 
this naval arm. Its reorganization was carried out during 
1992-1993.[.sup]5[/] 
  Amphibious forces support the sealift and landing of Marine 
formations and units on an austere beach. As of the beginning of 
the current year the U.S. Navy numbered 51 large landing ships: 
two Blue Ridge-Class command ships (LCC 19 and 20), eight 
amphibious assault ships--three Wasp-Class (LHD 1-3) and five 
Tarawa-Class (LHA 1-5), eight Whidbey Island-Class (LSD 41-48) 
and five Anchorage Class (LSD 36-40) dock landing ships, ten 
Newport-Class tank landing ships (LST 1184, 1186, 1187, 1189, 
1192-1194, 1196-1198), five Iwo Jima-Class helicopter carriers 
(LPH 7, 9-12) and 13 Austin-Class amphibious transport docks 
(LPD 4-10, 12-15; AGF 3, 11). 
  It is planned to include two Wasp-Class ships (the 
possibility of building one more is being considered) and four 
Whidbey Island-Class ships (cargo version) in the Navy order of 
battle in the next 3-4 years. In connection with the planned 
removal of Austin-, Anchorage-, Newport- and Iwo Jima-Class 
landing ships from operational status at the end of the decade, 
the Navy leadership decided to develop the design project of a 
new LX-Class landing ship. With a full displacement of 23,000 t, 
she will be able to take aboard up to 900 landing personnel, air 
cushion vehicles and assault transport helicopters. A contract 
for building the lead ship will be signed in 1996 and 
commissioning is planned for 2002. The period for building each 
of the 11 subsequent ships should not exceed 55-60 months. 
  The military-political leadership is showing concern over a 
possible reduction in effectiveness of the national shipbuilding 
base in connection with a likely reduction in previously planned 
programs for upgrading the fleet. The Defense Department drew up 
an appropriate plan called "National Shipbuilding Initiative," 
the goal of which is to develop its industrial base up to the 
year 2000. There are $2.18 billion being allocated, including 
$485 million in FY 1993-1995, $400 million each in FY 1996-1999 
and $100 million in FY 2000 for specific goals connected with 
developing new technologies, designing and building ships and 
vessels, upgrading the process of managing the sector, and 
training specialists of various profiles. A special naval 
technologies center will be established in 1994. 
  In the assessment of specialists, the indicated numerical 
reduction in the U.S. Navy ship order of battle during 1994-1998 
is not leading to a decrease in its combat potential inasmuch as 
qualitatively more improved ships are coming to replace obsolete 
ships and the spectrum of missions they are to perform is 
enormously broader. 
  The program for commissioning combatant ships during 
1994-1999 is given below.

                      Note: Hydrosonic sensitivity is 
                      defined as 20 times the base-10 
                      logarithm of the ratio of the 
                      root-mean-square output voltage to a 
                      reference voltage of 1 V, when the 
                      hydrophonic pickup, less the 
                      preamplifier, is located within the 
                      acoustic field of a plane wave with

                      a reference voltage of 1 V/Pa) 
                      produces an output voltage of 
                      10[.sup]-[superscript  illegible][/] 
                      V in such a field, while a 
                      sensitivity of -180 dB gives an 
                      output voltage of 10[.sup]-9[/] V. 
                      Thus -160 dB is better than -180 dB

                                 1. Application of a (hard) coating from 
                                 vaporous chemical compounds is the process 
                                 of applying a purely external coating or a 
                                 coating with modification of the surface 
                                 being coated, when a metal, alloy, 
                                 composite, dielectric or ceramic is applied 
                                 to a heated article. Gaseous products 
                                 (vapors, reactants) decompose or combine on 
                                 the article surface, as a result of which 
                                 the desired elements, alloys or compounds 
                                 form on it. The energy for such 
                                 decomposition or chemical reaction can be 
                                 provided by heating the article, by the glow 
                                 of a plasma discharge or by a laser beam. 

                                 2. Applying a (hard) coating by deposition 
                                 of chemical compounds from a vapor phase 
                                 includes the following process: powderless 
                                 application of a coating by a direct gas 
                                 flow; pulsating chemical deposition of 
                                 vapors; controlled thermal application of 
                                 coatings with nuclear crushing and also with 
                                 the use of a powerful plasma flow; or 
                                 realization of chemical deposition of vapors 
                                 with the involvement of plasma. 

                                 3. Powder application signifies immersing 
                                 the article in a powder made of several 
                                 components. 

                                 4. Gaseous products (vapors, reactants) used 
                                 in the powderless process are used with 
                                 several basic reactions and parameters such 
                                 as powder carburizing, except for the case 
                                 where a coating is applied to an article 
                                 without contact with the powder mixture.

                                 evaporation 

                                 Notes 

                                 1. Physical deposition of vapors by 
                                 evaporation (thermal evaporation) is the 
                                 process of purely external coating in a 
                                 vacuum with pressure less than 0.1 Pa., when 
                                 the thermal energy source is used for 
                                 converting the material to be applied into 
                                 vapor. As a result of the process, 
                                 condensate or coating is deposited on 
                                 appropriate parts of the article surface. 
                                 Gases appearing in the vacuum chamber in the 
                                 deposition process are absorbed in the 
                                 majority of process modifications by 
                                 elements of the complex composition 
                                 (compounds) of the coating. Use of ion or 
                                 electron emission or plasma for activation 
                                 or involvement in coating application also 
                                 is inherent to the majority of modifications 
                                 of the process of physical deposition of 
                                 vapors by thermal evaporation. Use of 
                                 monitors for supporting a measurement of 
                                 optical characteristics or coating thickness 
                                 in the course of the process may be realized 
                                 in the future for processes of this type. 

                                 2. Ion cladding is a special modification of 
                                 the general process of physical deposition 
                                 of vapors by thermal evaporation in which 
                                 the plasma or ion source is used for 
                                 ionizing the material of coatings to be 
                                 applied, and a negative charge of the 
                                 article facilitates deposition of coating 
                                 components from plasma. The introduction of 
                                 active reagents, evaporation of solid 
                                 materials in the chamber, and use of 
                                 monitors supporting measurements of optical 
                                 characteristics and coating thickness (in 
                                 the process of coating application) are 
                                 inherent to the usual modifications of the 
                                 process of physical deposition of vapors by 
                                 thermal evaporation.

                                 The process of coating using a cathode arc 
                                 uses a consumable cathode as the material 
                                 which forms the coating, and it has a steady 
                                 arc discharge on the cathode surface after 
                                 momentary contact with a grounded starting 
                                 device (trigger). Controllable arc erosion 
                                 of the cathode surface leads to formation of 
                                 a highly ionized plasma. The anode either 
                                 may be conical around the periphery of the 
                                 cathode separated by an insulator, or the 
                                 chamber itself can play the role of anode.

                                 Notes 

                                 1. Plasma jet spraying is the process of

                                 the plasma gun (spray torch) in which the 
                                 plasma forms and is controlled, receiving 
                                 the powder and rod (wire) of coating 
                                 material, melts them and directs them to the 
                                 article, where an integrally bound coating 
                                 forms. Plasma jet spraying can be built on 
                                 spraying by low-pressure plasma or 
                                 high-speed plasma realized underwater.

                                 a purely external coating based on the 
                                 phenomenon of transfer of a quantity of 
                                 motion, where positive ions are accelerated 
                                 in an electrical field in a direction toward 
                                 the surface of a target (coating material). 
                                 The kinetic energy of ion impact is 
                                 sufficient for forming atoms of the coating 
                                 material on the target surface, with their 
                                 appropriate accommodation on the article
