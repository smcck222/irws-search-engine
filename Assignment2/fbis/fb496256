<F P=106> [Article by Captain First Rank Vladimir Chupakhin: "Society </F>
Suffers From Lack of Spirituality--Best Remedy Is Patriotism: 
Notes From Session of Russian Defense Ministry Collegium"] 
  [Text] What a complex, unusually sensitive and unique 
organism the army is. Any sore point in our society or negative 
phenomenon there immediately appears in the military, and with 
double or even triple the intensity. The economic crisis is hard 
for everyone, but for military personnel, who are maintained 
exclusively at government expense, its consequences are 
especially grave. Discipline has slackened in the country, crime 
has become rampant, and these things cannot help but affect the 
strength of our military ranks. 
  But perhaps the most important issue today is what is 
happening in the spiritual or psychological area--the crisis of 
the state and national ideal, the loss of moral reference points 
in life, and much, much more. While for some people these things 
are no tragedy, if they can find refuge in the world of 
individualistic, consumer values, for military people, whose 
very vocation is founded on the idea of serving the Fatherland 
and on the idea of patriotism, to lose one's spiritual grounding 
is like having no weapons or ammunition in battle. 
  In this connection it is hardly surprising that military 
personnel are among the first who are sounding the alarm about 
an aggression being waged by the lack of spirituality, 
amorality, and all-permissiveness that we encounter left and 
right. It is not surprising that the Armed Forces and Ministry 
of Defense are increasingly often a source of impulses 
encouraging a rebirth, on a new basis, of the patriotic and 
unifying ideal and of effective and productive efforts to rear 
true civilians and defenders of the Motherland. 
  This theme was the focus of a session of the Russian 
Ministry 
of Defense Collegium held several days ago, as KRASNAYA ZVEZDA 
already reported. The agenda item was worded as follows: "On 
measures to strengthen military-patriotic education for 
servicemen and young people in support of the Russian Federation 
Armed Forces." But in the hall, besides military officials and 
chiefs of Main and Central Defense Ministry Directorates, one 
could also see Russian Minister of Culture Ye. Sidorov; 
Colonel-General G. Yashkin, retired, chairman of the Russian 
veterans organization; Metropolitan Kirill of Smolensk and 
Kaliningrad; R. Bykov, the noted film-maker, and many other 
state and public figures and representatives of concerned 
organizations. This made it clear that the discussion would 
inevitably transcend purely departmental bounds and by no means 
touch on the "interests of the Armed Forces" alone. 
  And that is what happened. The introductory remarks by 
Russian Defense Minister General of the Army P. Grachev, 
followed by the report by Deputy Defense Minister 
Colonel-General V. Mironov, bluntly declared: "This situation 
cannot continue. Nihilism, lack of spirituality, and morale 
degeneration have reached an extreme point that poses a danger 
to both army and navy combat readiness and the security of 
society and the state. The following facts disclosed at the 
session caused a bitter sensation: In sociological surveys 
conducted among conscripts in a number of oblasts on whose 
territories the units of the Volga, Urals, and North Caucasus 
Military Districts are stationed, as well as in Moscow and 
Moscow Oblast, nearly 70 percent said military service was 
unnecessary, and more than 35 percent spoke of a readiness to 
emigrate from the Motherland. Every second conscript thinks that 
such concepts as military duty, honor, and patriotism are things 
of the past and no longer have any meaning. 
  The character of conscripts is extremely alarming. 
Drunkenness, drug abuse, and crime are on the rise. Almost every 
fifth young recruit has committed a legal offense or been taken 
to the police station, and nearly 10 percent have been convicted 
of crimes. 
  In view of all these things, the Army and Navy are 
definitely 
taking necessary measures. Everything possible is being done. 
Col-Gen Mironov cited a number of facts relating to every 
service arm and branch and showing how commanders and Army and 
Navy educators aren't giving up but are instead trying to work 
with the contingent now arriving in units and on ships and to 
get positive results nonetheless. But the main attention of both 
the keynote speaker and other colleagues who spoke was focused, 
not surprisingly, on shortcomings and untapped potential. 
  The need to improve cooperation with state and public 
organizations, patriotic associations, and the mass media was 
posed with particular urgency. It was pointed out that much in 
this regard has been lost, unfortunately. Ties with unit 
veterans, associations of Afghan war veterans, and other 
patriotic organizations are unraveling. 
  The educational role of the Russian Sports and Technical 
Defense Association has declined markedly. Many of its primary 
organizations are more involved in commerce than in the 
education of future soldiers. 
  The Russian Armed Forces have at their disposal a rather 
impressive array of assets for military-patriotic education. 
They include more than 500 officer houses and clubs, 400 
military museums, 35 singing and dancing ensembles, six drama 
theaters, 800 orchestras, and library holdings of several 
million volumes. But this things need serious support. Every 
third officers house is in need of renovation. There is a 
shortage of funds to make video films and movies about the 
history of service branches and units. Book holdings must be 
updated. There is almost no literature on the history of Russia 
and the Russian Army. 
  A study of the state of affairs in military commissariats in 
Moscow, Nizhniy Novgorod, Samara, Tataria, Bashkiria, and a 
number of other parts of the country show that existing 
educational potential is being used poorly and that cooperation 
with government bodies and public organizations is weak. For 
example, of 246 military-patriotic clubs in Moscow only 14 
remain, and of 1,400 museums and military valor rooms in 
secondary general-education schools only 514 are left. The 
situation is no better in other republics and oblasts. 
  Honor guards at memorable sites linked with the heroic 
history of the Fatherland have been eliminated almost 
everywhere. The Orlenok [Eaglet] and Zarnitsa [Summer Lightning] 
Games have become a thing of the past. Military sports camps 
have almost disappeared. Fitness programs for young people, like 
the Ready for Labor and Defense program, many of whose methods 
were adopted in other countries, including the United States, 
France, and Germany, have ceased to function. 
  The report and a number of speeches suggested that it is a 
serious mistake to abolish the system of elementary military 
training, which was hardly intended to militarize pupils' way of 
thinking and has greatly helped youths adjust to army life and 
master basic army skills. 
  And it is inappropriate that military-patriotic themes have 
largely disappeared from school textbooks, literature, movies, 
theater, and art. Unfortunately, the vacuum is being filled by a 
low-grade promotion of sex and violence. Age-old Russian values 
are being destroyed. 
  Yes, there are many, many problems, and they are extremely 
acute. But what can be done? How can the syndrome of destruction 
be overcome? How can the situation be rectified? 
  "We can talk a lot about forms and methods of patriotic 
education," said Colonel-General M. Kolesnikov, chief of the 
General Staff, in his speech. "But nothing is going to change 
unless we start with ourselves, with the patriotic education of 
officials." 
  He was seconded by R. Bykov. Today our government itself, 
the 
national leadership itself is in need of patriotic education, if 
you will. To be more precise, in need of a change of attitude 
toward this matter." The film director cited an incident that 
evoked a stir in the hall. He recounted how a request that an 
appropriate government agency help finance a movie about the 
50th anniversary of the Great Victory brought the following 
answer: We can't help because "the military budget cannot be 
increased." This is the level of understanding of the problem, 
the level of thinking that, unfortunately, is very widespread 
even among senior officials. 
  "We have reached a point where people have even begun to be 
embarrassed by the term `military-patriotic' education," said 
Deputy Defense Minister Colonel-General B. Gromov bitterly in 
his remarks. He called the attention of those present to the 
need to seriously improve efforts to instill in young people 
respect for national history and the achievements of Russian 
culture. 
  "We must pool our efforts!" was the main point of the speech 
by Russian Minister of Culture Ye. Sidorov. He said that the 
Ministry of Culture was prepared to cooperate closely with the 
Ministry of Defense in all initiatives aimed at the spiritual 
rebirth of society. In the minister's opinion, a good start 
would be worthy preparations for the 50th anniversary of the 
Great Victory and a fitting observance of that event. 
  Metropolitan Kirill also spoke about pooling efforts. In 
this 
connection, he characterized the cooperation agreement signed 
recently by Defense Minister General of the Army P. Grachev and 
Patriarch Aleksii II of Moscow and All Rus as extremely 
promising. This "agreement of intentions" of sorts is already 
operating and making headway in promoting the revival of Russian 
military traditions. But it is important, the clergyman 
stressed, to prevent the effort from becoming a short-lived 
campaign and to avoid excesses, as in a reported incident in one 
unit in which the following order was issued: "In honor of the 
observance of the Annunciation, I hereby order..." 
  Real deeds, not fanfare and declarations, are what is needed 
today. This was emphasized by many colleagues at the session. 
Any real efforts, no matter how small, to promote the revival of 
patriotic education must be supported. In particular, attention 
was called to steps taken by the commanders of the North 
Caucasus and Transbaykal Military Districts to support effective 
cooperation with the Cossack movement. In this region, almost 80 
Cossack organizations are serving as sponsors for various units 
and taking part in educational work and efforts to solve social 
and consumer-service problems. 
  Or consider this example: Despite all difficulties, young 
sailors clubs in the Northern Fleet, young paratrooper clubs in 
the Moscow Military District, and young artillery crewmen clubs 
in St. Petersburg and Yekaterinburg have survived and are 
popular among young people. The same is true of patriotic and 
military-history associations attached to various units and 
higher educational institutions. This form of work encompasses 
more than 50,000 youths, and more than 3,000 servicemen have 
been enlisted in it. 
  Every effort must be made to publicize such examples and 
multiply them. Patriotic education enthusiasts must receive 
comprehensive assistance and support. 
  At the same time, it is clearly impossible to rely solely on 
someone's enthusiasm. The session leitmotif was the need for a 
carefully formulated and substantiated state policy on patriotic 
and military-patriotic education and on the development of 
appropriate federal programs involving all branches of 
government, as well as representatives of science, culture, and 
public organizations. 
  This was also stressed by General of the Army P. Grachev in 
his closing remarks. He announced that the Ministry of Defense 
will propose an initiative to the government on launching a 
federal program to enhance the prestige of military service and 
to strengthen not only the prestige of the Armed Forces, but 
also the Russian state and the country's security. 
  As was pointed out, the collegium discussion is only a 
start, 
a kind of prologue to a tremendous amount of painstaking work to 
create in the new conditions a reliable and effective system to 
rear citizens, patriots, and defenders of the Motherland--a 
system that both society and the Armed Forces need very much.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal </F>
Democratic Party of Russia, by Srdjan Djuric in Moscow; date not 
given: "Support for our Christian Orthodox Brothers"] 
  [Text] The problem of former Yugoslavia and the agreement 
on civil reconciliation were topics that dominated the Russian 
political scene last week, judging at least from debates in the 
state Duma and media. On Friday, 22 April, in the Kremlin, 
President Boris Yeltsin summoned the leaders of the 
parliamentary factions, the representatives of the church, and 
government officials. At the meeting, where the draft of an 
agreement that, as has been envisaged by economists, would 
soothe political disagreements, and prompt a harmonized Russia 
peacefully to develop further, Yeltsin's most vociferous 
opponent, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, took part. 
  Three months have passed since our last conversation on the 
premises of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], a 
dilapidated old house on Stepenkiy Square. He arrived at the 
party's new headquarters in the Mir Hotel, next to the building 
of the former CEMA [Council for Mutual Economic Assistance], the 
current Duma, visibly exhausted by lengthy assembly debates and 
talks in the Kremlin. Beside the new LDPR headquarters, many 
things have changed since January. Among his closest aides, who 
are making a much more civilized impression now, there are 
almost no old faces. Although his attitudes remain the same, 
Zhirinovskiy appears to be more composed than before. He is 
lacking the severity that used to emanate from each movement, 
word, or look of his. It seems that he is even trying to wash 
his hands of some of his earlier uncontrolled statements. 
  "Our attitude has always been against any military 
intervention on any Serbian territory in the former Yugoslavia, 
particularly against any involvement by NATO," Zhirinovskiy says 
about the NATO air strikes against the Bosnian Serb positions. 
"We are explicitly against it, and we have been saying this for 
four months now. I have said even today to our president that 
we ought to take a clear stance regarding the protection of our 
Christian Orthodox brothers in the Balkans and Yugoslavia," he 
says. 
  [Djuric] You said that if it came to air strikes against the 
Serb positions, cities of NATO member countries would have to 
pay the price. Recently it did come to air strikes against the 
Serbs.... 
  [Zhirinovskiy] That is my personal position. We shall be 
urging our government to take the appropriate measures. When 
our delegations come back from Serbia, we shall propose that the 
Duma lifts the economic sanctions against Serbia. We are ready 
to exert further pressure on our government to take a firmer 
stance, to forbid any bombing of Serbian towns. We are sticking 
to that stance. However, we are an opposition party, rather 
than the executive body, so we shall be pursuing our policy in 
the future as well, and we shall not give up. 
  [Djuric] You were a vehement critic of the official Russian 
policy on the problem of former Yugoslavia. How do you assess 
the roles of the president and the foreign minister today? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Their policy has started to change in the 
last two months. They have taken a stance closer to the Serbs, 
as much toward the United Nations as toward the Muslims and 
other participants in the Yugoslav conflict. However, we still 
consider their stance to be weak, and they should take a firmer 
one. We have demanded many times that the foreign minister be 
replaced. I also demanded this in the Duma last week, and 
yesterday as well, while today I said in the Kremlin that we 
ought to have a different foreign policy, particularly with 
regard to the former Yugoslavia. I think that the wrong attitude 
of our diplomats is best illustrated by Kozyrev's completely 
unprofessional attitude. The role given to Churkin does not 
correspond to reality at all. And now the minister's deputy 
[Churkin] is behaving like an offended little girl. 
  The best and the only way is to lift the economic blockade 
against Serbia and Montenegro. One should start commercial 
exchanges, conclude military-political agreements, our army 
should be sent to Serbia, and only then will the final score be 
positive for Serbs. There is little use in the negotiations and 
conferences that Yeltsin is interceding for. So far all the 
conferences and all the negotiations have eventually collapsed, 
and the war has continued. Today I proposed to Yeltsin that we 
could accomplish peace in the Balkans by sending our troops in 
the region. We have considerable troops in Germany -- 300,000 
soldiers and officers. We could send them to the Balkans, 
rather than back to Russia. In that way the issue would be 
solved, provided, of course, that the Serbian republics 
consented to this. 
  [Djuric] Aleksandr Rutskoy and Ruslan Khasbulatov have been 
released from prison thanks to your party's votes. Have there 
been any changes on the Russian political stage caused by their 
release? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] No, their release has not influenced the 
political situation in Russia at all. However, I think that, 
from the psychological point of view, the situation is much 
better if you do not have political prisoners. Khasbulatov has 
completely abandoned politics, and will not be engaged in it, or 
involved in any political activities. As for Rutskoy, he is 
resting. He is at home, and is not influencing political life 
in any way. 
  [Djuric] Your visits to Serbia and Montenegro have caused 
many controversies. It has been noticed that no officials 
received you.... 
  [Zhirinovskiy] We went there on invitations by certain 
parties, associations, and movements. That was not a part of 
the program and was not necessary.... We simply visited our 
Serbian friends, and followed the program that they prepared. 
The basic intention was to visit different regions, and to make 
contacts with the local population. That was our first visit, 
and was highlighted by our participation at several big rallies 
-- in Vukovar, Montenegro, and Herzegovina. We did what the 
program anticipated by our friends expected us to do. I see 
nothing peculiar in this. 
  If parliament invites us (our second delegation went to 
Serbia following an invitation from parliament, whereas even now 
our delegation is visiting parliament), we shall also go there. 
On 8 May we shall be there again, and everything depends on 
what sort of program is anticipated by those who invite us. 
  [Djuric] In Serbia much attention has been paid to your 
cooperation with the party led by Zeljko Raznjatovic Arkan, as 
well as to the so-called secret Elipton weapon that you gave 
him. Why did you decide to cooperate with that particular man, 
and why did you give that mysterious weapon to him, rather than 
to somebody else? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] It is our military experts, our supporters, 
who were also there with us, who gave him the weapon. We just 
connected them with Arkan, and we have nothing against their 
exchange of experience or assistance aimed at improving the 
defense ability of Serbian territories. We have several naval 
officers, submarine commanders, who are ready even to deploy 
their submarines in the Adriatic Sea, and carry out attacks 
against the NATO air bases from which planes assigned to bomb 
Serb positions take off. That was the officers' personal 
initiative. We are a political party, and we do not take part 
in such activities. However, those officers are so eager to 
help, that, as far as I know, they already have a plan to carry 
out counterattacks against NATO bases. 
  [Djuric] Your visit to Zagreb had been announced for a long 
time. Why did you cancel it, and when will it eventually come 
about? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] In Zagreb, there is a dispute in the 
leadership. Some people want me to visit them, others are 
hesitant. Besides, I am waiting for public opinion to mature. 
As far as I know, for the time being there is no acceptable 
solution between the Serbs and Croats, and I would not like the 
Serbs to think that I want to make some agreements with the 
Croats. I have plenty of time. If it is their good will and 
desire, I shall visit them, but my policy remains unchanged -- 
giving support to our Serbian Orthodox brothers. 
  [Djuric] The state Duma has been discussing the problem of 
former Yugoslavia for several days. What can be expected after 
the return of the delegation of the Duma that is now touring the 
former Yugoslav republics? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] The basic goal of our party is that our 
activities in parliament result in a decision to lift the 
sanctions, and in the government's undertaking concrete steps 
aimed at the improvement of the situation in the Balkans. We 
shall do anything that we are required to. We were told: If 
there had not been these latest events in Gorazde, in two weeks 
the sanctions would be lifted. That is what they are saying 
now. The fact is that even if there had not been those clashes, 
the sanctions would probably not have been lifted anyway. It is 
hard to judge how realistic the option was. But the tendency to 
speed up the possible lifting of the sanctions does exist. 
  [Djuric] You are saying that you were told that the 
sanctions might have been lifted. Do you think that the Serbs 
made a mistake by attacking Gorazde? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I do not think so, and I cannot accuse 
anybody here. That is a matter for the Serbs. Still, our 
experts at the Foreign Ministry believe that if the events in 
Gorazde had not happened, the question of sanctions would have 
been settled in the shortest possible time. That is what they 
are saying now, but, perhaps, they are simply deceiving us. 
  [Djuric] In addition to Arkan's party, which other Serbian 
political parties do you cooperate with? What sorts of 
cooperation do you exercise, if there is any cooperation? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Our relations are the same with all the other 
parties. We do not interfere in the internal affairs of Serbia. 
When some parties invite us, we go there, and make contacts.... 
And whether we have any particular preferences -- no, we do 
not! Those are internal affairs of Serbia. We have the same 
attitude toward each of Serbia's political parties.

<F P=106> [KOMMERSANT correspondent Mikhail Kirtser report: "Russian </F>
Cosmodrome: Plesetsk Will Take on Baykonur's Programs, if Money 
Is Forthcoming"] 
  [Text] Yesterday KOMMERSANT correspondent Mikhail 
Kirtser returned from Arkhangelsk province, where the Russia's 
Plesetsk cosmodrome, which has for 30 years fulfilled 
exclusively military functions and which is officially known as 
a state test site, is located amidst the forests. For the first 
time, the command of the Strategic Missile Troops permitted 
Russian journalists to come here, showing them the latest Topol 
(SS-25) strategic missiles as well as an excercise by a missile 
regiment. 
  During the excercise the photojournalists simply implored 
the 
missile officers to erect an ICBM into the vertical position. 
But the soldiers explained that such a procedure is 
irreversible: A missile can assume combat position only with a 
"launch" command. The press decided not to insist. They were 
able to observe the movement of a column of missiles and support 
vehicles and the concealment of a launcher at its combat site in 
the forest. Then the KOMMERSANT correspondent visited the 
training center, where noncoms and officers are trained as 
service personnel. 
  The Plestesk cosmodrome is an entire complex of the most 
various buildings and installations. The strategic mobile 
missile regiment, whose excercise the representatives of the 
press observed, is only a part of the whole. There are also 
launch sites, which are inevitably associated with Baykonur, 
which is now in a foreign country. True, they were not able to 
look into missile silos--their hatches can be opened only by 
means of a special mechanism (whose work would be "noticed" both 
by the press and by orbital spy satellites), but they were 
nonetheless able to touch a rail-based missile complex. 
(KOMMERSANT wrote about this adventure in February). 
  The true purpose of the invitation to the journalists became 
clear at the concluding press conference, which was conducted at 
the secret town of Mirnyy, next to the cosmodrome. The test 
site commander, Lieutenant-General Yuriy Zhuralev, declared that 
he thought it was incorrect to divide the country's missile 
forces into Strategic Missile Troops, Military-space Forces, and 
ABM Defense Forces. In his opinion, such a division only 
complicates command and control and increases upkeep expenses. 
The Lieutenant-General also declared that the test site's 
capabilities enable it, without no need for new equipment, not 
only to support the Strategic Missile Forces' combat readiness, 
but also to take on the civilian space programs from the 
Baykonur cosmodrome (the more so, in that Mirnyy has scientific 
establishments and intellectual potential which would permit 
Russian space technology to attain a high level of efficiency 
and reliablity). There is only one problem--too little money.

"Future of Russian Nuclear Potential"] 
  [Text] The Soviet leadership's political thinking, 
particularly as regards military-political strategy, used to be 
compared in the old days to studied chess gambits. The 
circumstances of the USSR's collapse and the rapid degradation 
of society call into question the correctness of this 
complimentary comparison -- at any rate as regards the skills of 
many of the "chess players" of the perestroyka period. The 
historians of the future, however, will as usual voice varying 
opinions about 20th century Russian history and about whether 
the last Soviet leadership had an inferiority complex or whether 
they were pioneering a new era, and so forth. What will be seen 
as history by the researchers of the future, for us increasingly 
boils down to the problem of survival. Consequently, as we 
encounter very urgent matters every day it does not seem out of 
place to attempt to sort out at least certain rules and the 
sense of the game in which Russia is a player in the nuclear 
arms sphere. 
  The current era of total change is, apart from anything 
else, 
also a time of radical change in geostrategic realities and ways 
of thinking. The speed and spontaneity of these changes are 
probably the reason why our so-called post-Soviet society is 
parting willingly (and even with unmitigated enthusiasm) from 
the state appurtenances that largely determined the USSR's 
status as a military "superpower." There is something 
irrational -- though easily explained in terms of the systemic 
crisis in society and its revolutionary nihilism -- in the fact 
that we are putting paid with equal measures of indifference 
("we don't need that any more!") to the, in many respects 
controversial but nonetheless technically sophisticated, "Buran" 
(and thus, in practice, to our entire "state-funded space 
effort"); to aircraft-carrying cruisers -- and next it will be 
the turn of the entire oceangoing fleet; and to ABM defense and 
air-defense installations and strategic ground force groupings 
west of Smolensk and south of Sochi. 
  There is, however, a sphere of social and professional 
interests where the consequences of the possible changes should 
be analyzed with particular care and where discussions should be 
conducted by specialists in a constructive spirit without any 
interference from emotions and not necessarily in conjunction 
with other information such as, say, the examination of the 
START II Treaty by the new parliament or the adoption of a 
long-term program for military organizational development. It 
will be a question of the prospects for developing our strategic 
nuclear forces, which can quite justifiably be called the 
scepter in the double-headed eagle's claw. 
  It is time to recognize that behind the numerous discussions 
about the expediency of retaining, removing, or adopting certain 
weapons systems and their quantitative and qualitative 
parameters lies a principled and so fundamental question that 
people prefer not to consider it -- will Russia be able under 
these conditions that are new to it to preserve its nuclear 
potential and in what form? It is no secret that a number of 
important components in the nuclear system that used to exist 
have been lost, and traditional problems such as, for instance, 
the no-first-use of nuclear weapons and the relationship between 
a retaliatory strike and a counterstrike are being reconsidered 
and reinterpreted. Thus, the question of the future of Russia's 
nuclear potential is becoming not so much theoretical as 
practical -- particularly now that the lack of funds and the 
absence of constant and focused attention from top organs of 
power to the problems of the strategic nuclear forces could lead 
to their irreversible degradation. In tandem with this, the 
protracted uncertainty about ratification of the Strategic 
Offensive Arms Reduction Treaty (START II) threatens to 
seriously delay the entire future disarmament process and 
introduces additional problems to the choice of the ideal 
solutions for modernizing the Russian Armed Forces' strategic 
nuclear component. 
  Statesmen who should already be taking responsible steps to 
choose long-term avenues for the organizational development of 
nuclear strategic forces are feeling an urgent need for a more 
accurate system of references in the emerging geopolitical 
situation, a need to understand what global military-political 
situation they will have to face in the future. And it is very 
important for them that some fragments of the picture of the 
future -- despite the turbulent processes of change in the world 
order -- are in a number of aspects acquiring new outlines. 
  A typical feature of the emergent era will be a change in 
the 
overall structure of influence in the world. Many specialists 
are noting that the bipolar structure with two opposed 
superpowers -- the United States and the USSR -- is being 
replaced by a more traditional multipolar structure which, by 
reducing the opportunities for the superpowers to determine the 
course of world development, will enhance the role of other 
countries (such as the countries of Europe and the Pacific 
region), diversifying the arsenal of their ways and means of 
influencing world politics. According to a number of forecasts, 
the weakening of U.S. economic positions in favor of West Europe 
and Japan will make the United States' bonds of alliance with 
its partners in Europe and Asia more short-term and unstable, 
and international relations more complex, unstable, and less 
predictable as a result. Hence, the overall political situation 
in the world may be less predictable, hard to control even at 
regional, not to mention global, level, and likely to result in 
the emergence of acute crises and the appearance of additional 
spurs to confrontation. The distant rumbles of thunder can 
already be heard. 
  In the context of a multipolar world with criteria of 
influence and stability that are somewhat different and by no 
means always advantageous for Russia, when additional room is 
created for multilateral political maneuver, allies can very 
quickly become enemies, and the principle of "every man for 
himself" (remembering G. Washington's behest) prevails 
increasingly clearly in politics -- under these circumstances it 
is hardly sensible to rush into all-out disarmament, giving up 
our national nuclear forces or even discussing handing them over 
to some kind of collective control. It would be an unforgivable 
mistake, giving in to complacent ideas about the end of the era 
of confrontation, to "tear the tails off" all Russia's strategic 
missiles, although this does not at all mean that we should not 
use the entire panoply of peaceful means of safeguarding 
Russia's national security or that we should end the disarmament 
negotiations. 
  The range of opinions on this issue, particularly now that 
politics has become part and parcel of our public awareness, is 
quite broad. Thus, there is a view (voiced in particular by 
ISKRAN [expansion unknown] staffers S.K. Oznobishchev and A.V. 
Surikov) that at a time of the transition to the building of 
strategic partnership relations between Russia and the United 
States, the use of the strategic stability criteria which were 
successfully used in the postwar decades is becoming senseless. 
Since this is the case, despite all the reservations befitting 
the current situation, nuclear weapons are allegedly becoming a 
kind of burden for Russia and should be gradually turned into 
the "last guarantee" of the security system "not only for Russia 
and the United States in isolation, but perhaps for a whole 
group of states united behind the principles of a collective 
security system within the UN framework." 
  Admittedly, it seems as though the United States is not yet 
ready to share with Russia its experience of these innovations, 
even though their general human and humanitarian thrust is 
evident. The nuclear powers' lack of enthusiasm on this subject 
is possibly explained by the fact that achieving an ideal 
combination of individual and collective means of defense is a 
complicated task with no single solution. But that is a 
separate discussion. The actual agenda is different, and one 
specific problem is that Russia should maintain effective 
national strategic nuclear forces. At the same time, it somehow 
seems as though our enemy now is not any specific country or 
group of countries, but uncertainty (incidentally, the 
transition to planning for uncertainty has already been 
reflected in some official U.S. documents on military-strategic 
issues). 
  If we set out the development of military thinking in the 
nuclear planning sphere extremely simply and without any serious 
distortions, it can be said that the development of nuclear 
weapons arsenals has made certain changes to the targeted role 
of military strategy, which has become more broadly interpreted 
and is seen as a military-political strategy. In reality this 
has meant a change of emphasis in nuclear planning from the 
possibility of directly winning a nuclear war to the sphere of 
implementing political goals by means of the threat of war. The 
concept of political deterrence has supplemented the concept of 
nuclear deterrence -- literally "containment by means of nuclear 
deterrence" [sderzhivaniye posredstvom yadernogo ustrasheniya]. 
It was based on the principle of the "balance of terror" -- the 
certainty that each party to a potential nuclear conflict would 
inevitably suffer unacceptable damage in any nuclear war 
scenario. The logic of deterrence presupposed the permanent 
building up of the two superpowers' nuclear potentials and an 
increase in the number of nuclear munitions and delivery systems 
to an irrational level (a kind of "foolish multitude") that 
guaranteed the impossibility of one side winning in any 
meaningful way. Implementation of this concept turned into an 
outright arms race. 
  At the end of the sixties the stupidity of this approach to 
the organizational development of strategic nuclear forces was 
so obvious that the parties to the confrontation came to the 
conclusion that it was expedient to seek (very cautiously and 
gradually) new approaches to maintaining strategic stability and 
to implementing the concept of combining nuclear deterrence with 
arms control (so far only control). 
  If the strategic nuclear forces of the two states (or 
coalitions of states) are capable of inflicting unacceptable 
damage on each other in retaliation (retaliatory strikes and 
counterstrikes), then both sides restrain each other from 
aggression, military equilibrium exists between the states, and, 
consequently, military-strategic stability in their relations is 
maintained. Thus, deterrence is achieved by the possibility that 
strategic nuclear forces will deliver a retaliatory strike of 
such force in response to an enemy first strike that the idea of 
carrying out a first strike ceases to be attractive. 
  The method of maintaining strategic balance on the basis of 
the use of nuclear deterrence proved its effectiveness from many 
standpoints over the decades. But, like any "precision" 
instrument, it is very fragile and subject to many factors in 
real life. Thus, of itself the conclusion that stability exists 
at any specific moment of time requires a very complex analysis 
of the military-political and military-technical reality, and 
consideration of a huge number of varied and, moreover, variable 
quantities in the most unexpected areas. We can also cite the 
sensitivity of this kind of stability to different symmetries 
and asymmetries in arms systems, and imbalances between rivals 
even within the framework of the "simple bipolar world." Any 
changes in military potentials, on the one hand, promote the 
emergence of excessive suspicion in interstate relations, while, 
paradoxically, on the other hand objectively requiring the 
maintenance of a certain level of mutual confidence. 
  In this context many necessary but unilateral steps to 
sensibly improve national armed forces could upset the strategic 
equilibrium and should therefore be most carefully weighed up 
from the standpoint of whether or not they will be seen by the 
opposite side as an attempt to change the balance in its favor. 
Caution or active enmity can be caused by the improvement of 
the technical potential of conventional (nonnuclear) weapons, 
particularly in terms of warhead accuracy and yield, the 
development [sozdaniye] of any ABM systems with ambiguous roles, 
and so forth. The problem of somebody acquiring a decisive 
military advantage through a technological breakthrough also 
remains very topical. This likelihood does exist, which could 
tempt people to play their "untrumpable" card for the purposes 
of strong-arm blackmail. 
  That is why Russia and the United States, like other states, 
need to improve their strategic nuclear forces in areas that 
strengthen strategic equilibrium. And corresponding joint 
information about weapons systems in service should be envisaged. 
  In order to define the main avenues for the organizational 
development of national nuclear deterrence forces it is very 
useful to comprehensively analyze and take account of new 
concepts which have recently been actively developed and 
actually implemented by Western specialists in the sphere of 
strategic planning. These concepts are based on the initial 
premise that the most realistic threat to the security of the 
United States and its NATO allies now comes not from Russia and 
the other CIS countries but from "authoritarian" regimes (read 
"unfriendly," as distinct, for instance, from "friendly 
dictators"), or regional interstate and interethnic conflicts 
using conventional weapons. It is within the framework of this 
doctrine that Western specialists have embarked on the 
elaboration of new approaches which will define the principles 
governing the use of nuclear arsenals for the next 10-20 years. 
In the United States in particular, in early 1993 L. Aspin, the 
then U.S. defense secretary, had already ordered an urgent 
review of the concept of the use of U.S. strategic nuclear 
forces. Although officially the adoption of the new concept is 
planned only for this year, the main problems that have arisen 
in the course of its elaboration have been covered in sufficient 
detail. In particular, the U.S. strategists will not only have 
to revise the list of targets, but also review once again 
whether the United States needs such a big nuclear potential, 
since maintaining it at its current level costs the United 
States $10 billion a year at a time when the threat of an 
all-out nuclear war has significantly diminished. The military 
are also having to "rethink the methods for deterring new and 
old enemies." 
  It is worth noting that, in L. Aspin's opinion (and there is 
hardly any doubt about his competence on geostrategic matters), 
the main threat to U.S. security is now posed not by an 
increasingly predictable ("transparent") global strategic foe -- 
as was the Soviet Union -- but by a whole team of "political 
monsters" in the shape of "nuclear smugglers and double-dealing 
governments that reject international norms." 
  For all the lack of ambiguity in the interpretations of the 
role played by nuclear weapons in the present-day world, the 
renewed U.S. concept of "containment by means of nuclear 
deterrence" nonetheless remains the most important nuclear 
planning idea for the United States, and the novel aspect of the 
utilization of strategic nuclear forces will most probably lie 
in the search for "some kind of devilishly inventive new 
principles." Nothing is as yet known about these, incidentally 
-- although L. Aspin admitted, discovering compelling reasons 
for it, that the approach of "monitoring the nuclear arsenal 
together with a threat of retribution" which had effectively 
influenced the Soviet Union, "may not frighten the new owners of 
nuclear weapons at all." In this event it cannot be ruled out, 
at least theoretically, that there will be an expanded range of 
missions for strategic nuclear weapons to carry out -- from 
peaceful containment through deterrence on the basis of the 
inflicting of unacceptable damage, to the limited combat use of 
nuclear weapons alongside conventional (nonnuclear) systems. 
The main aim of the limited combat use of nuclear weapons would 
be to prevent a military conflict from developing into all-out 
hostilities -- that is, in an unfavorable direction for the 
state under attack -- and to defuse the conflict. We cannot 
rule out new and original ways of parrying the threat from 
"nuclear smugglers and double-dealing governments." For 
instance, the potential threat of nuclear terrorism could be 
eliminated by implementing the idea of global information 
transparency in the nuclear sphere, whereby secret activity in 
manufacturing and moving not only nuclear devices, but in 
accumulating a "critical mass" of fissile materials would become 
impossible. Governments that prove intractable in this area 
could be (as has already happened) removed from the political 
scene for the required period of time by establishing control 
over the ruling elites in these countries or with the help (and 
there are plenty of examples of this too) of limited military 
and other sanctions -- which would easily be feasible within the 
framework of a policy of regionalism or simply under UN mandate. 
But the latter measures might not always be successful -- 
therefore the reality of using strong-arm methods, regrettable 
though it may be, should be retained. 
  We should be more interested in the question of whether 
Russia is ready to propose its own vision of the use of 
strategic nuclear forces. The undoubtedly honest position of 
the new Russian military doctrine -- now being extensively 
commented upon -- on the possible use of a nuclear first strike 
can be seen mainly as a reaction to traditional strategic 
challenges and as being largely brought about by the country's 
situation and, accordingly, by the state of its Armed Forces. 
To all appearances, even the modernization of Russia's 
strategic nuclear forces, which is suggested under the framework 
of the treaties on offensive arms reduction, does not make it 
possible to do anything but implement deterrence within the 
framework also of the "traditional" military-strategic situation 
with the criterion of inflicting unacceptable damage on any 
aggressor in retaliatory action. 
  When talking of the category of "unacceptable damage," we 
should take account of present-day views of this problem. We 
realize now that this category has, as it were, two dimensions, 
and can be framed within two systems of coordinates. It is 
usual to consider (and, incidentally, this understanding emerged 
relatively recently), that the criterion of unacceptable damage 
exists simultaneously as a certain quantitative level of losses 
and as a kind of psychological barrier. 
  The question of the norm of unacceptable damage is 
incredibly 
complex. Military specialists honestly admit the failure of the 
numerous attempts to define a more or less objective level for 
it. Staffs in both Russia and the United States are now using in 
their practical activity the mathematical value of a set amount 
of damage (required for deterrence) which nonetheless plays an 
important role in assessing the strategic balance when defining 
the limits of restrictions in the course of drawing up 
disarmament treaties and, most important of all, serves as a 
kind of guideline in shaping major state programs for the 
quantitative and qualitative development of strategic offensive 
arms. 
  We should not downplay the positive significance that the 
idea of a quantitative assessment of the force required to 
inflict "unacceptable damage" on an enemy has possessed for the 
development of the strategic situation, looked at 
retrospectively. It was this idea that made it possible to 
conclude more or less objectively that there was nuclear parity 
between the USSR and the United States -- which made it possible 
for one of the parties to dump its psychological baggage and 
provided an incentive for a disarmament process based on mutual 
recognition of the impossibility of either side's winning any 
substantial advantage in the context of balanced cuts in 
strategic offensive arms. At the same time, let us emphasize 
yet again that the criterion of "unacceptable damage" was to all 
intents and purposes never used as the basis for the adoption of 
the "final" decision to launch a nuclear strike within the 
context of the nuclear deterrence doctrine. Its mechanistic 
meaning (incidentally, if it could have been used as a 
guideline, then the choice of the time to launch a first strike 
could easily have been delegated to computers) cannot be related 
to the huge moral responsibility which a political leader would 
have to assume when deciding to start a nuclear war. We need 
only recall the Caribbean crisis, when the correlation of 
nuclear munitions was 17-1 in favor of the United States. (The 
Soviet Union had around 290 nuclear munitions, while the 
Americans had something in the order of 5,000). You can also 
imagine under what scenario the war in the Persian Gulf would 
have been played out if Iraq had had a few primitive nuclear 
munitions at the time. Most probably there would have been no 
war, and the task of liberating Kuwait would have been resolved 
by different means. 
  Few people give much thought to the fact that the category 
of 
terror and the category of "unacceptable damage" in its 
psychological dimension are historical categories -- times 
change, old moral principles and stereotypes are being tightened 
up and new ones are taking shape; attitudes toward the 
permissibility and probability of nuclear war are also being 
reconsidered by the political leaders of the major nuclear 
powers. Throughout postwar history common sense has never yet 
deseted them, which has made it possible at least to avert 
several global nuclear conflicts. There are no grounds for 
supposing that the current U.S. leaders have "frozen" their idea 
of what constitutes acceptable damage for their country as a 
result of an exchange of nuclear strikes with Russia at the 
level imagined by President Eisenhower. When in 1989 the U.S. 
plan for a nuclear attack on the USSR, drawn up in 1957, was 
declassified, environmental specialists were quick to produce a 
model of the consequences for the United States of launching 
such a nuclear strike against the USSR. It turned out that if 
all the planned 180 high-yield atomic and hydrogen bombs were 
exploded on Soviet territory, the USSR would be guaranteed to 
cease to exist as a state, but in two or three weeks the level 
of radioactive fallout on U.S. territory as a result of the 
natural spread of radioactive dust through atmospheric air 
currents would be comparable to 60 Chernobyls. Of course, the 
accuracy of these assessments (from the "greenhouse effect" to 
"nuclear winter") can be disputed, but one would like to hope 
that nobody would try to do a real experiment to check them out. 
  More and more experts today are inclined to think that 
nuclear weapons cannot be used in principle. 
  It is, nevertheless, not possible to wholly agree with this, 
since the unambiguous exclusion of the possibility of the use of 
nuclear weapons removes their deterrent effect. You could even 
use sophistry to prove the opposite. But in practice the basis 
of deterrence is the probability of the use of nuclear weapons. 
References to the irrationality of their use and their terrible 
consequences, which make it impossible to achieve the political 
aims of a war, are convincing but leave room for doubt. For 
instance, in August 1914, when World War I was already building 
up a head of steam in Europe, certain U.S. newspapers thought it 
appropriate to state something to the effect that the systems 
(primarily artillery systems) in the sides' arsenals were so 
destructive that it was difficult even to imagine the 
consequences of a war -- and therefore there could simply not be 
a war. Another example is that Indian tradition has it that the 
events described in the heroic epic "The Mahabharata" (compiled 
in its present form around the middle of the first millennium) 
relate to some wars and great social upheavals of the fourth 
millennium BC. The epic describes various types of what we 
would now call mass destruction weapons, whose use required a 
difficult psychological barrier to be overcome. R. Oppenheimer, 
one of the developers of the atomic bomb, directly associated 
the Mahabharata's "light brighter than a thousand suns" with a 
nuclear explosion. For us it is not so important which modern 
arms systems might correlate to the types of weapons described 
there. What is important was something else -- there was an 
entire science behind their use (star-gazing and their own 
system of combat using "divine weapons"). "No man should ever 
think of warring with them. Should they fall into the hands of 
the weak, they could consume this entire transient world. They 
should always be used as a defense against other weapons. They 
are wonderful, they cannot be parried, but they can repulse an 
attack in which any other weapon is used [divnoye, ono 
neotvratimo, no udar vsyakim drugim oruzhiyem ono otbivayet]." 
The psychological barrier was nonetheless overcome, and the 
weapons were used, despite the warning that some types of them 
would lead to an effect, seen in a modern reading, on the human 
genetic code. We can only hope that the current system of 
deterrence will prove more effective. 
  It should not, however, be thought that the existence of 
nuclear forces under present-day conditions is able to prevent 
the unleashing of any conventional wars and armed conflicts -- 
particularly on the periphery of the superpowers' spheres of 
influence. Since there are a now a multitude of precisely such 
conflicts, nuclear weapons are not omnipotent. Hence the need 
to develop conventional systems -- precision weapons. The 
development of precision weapons is also expedient for another 
reason -- states (albeit in the very distant future, or at least 
not in the foreseeable future) may give up nuclear weapons, and 
the full burden of the task of ensuring deterrence will be borne 
by conventional weapons systems. This will not happen in one 
sudden surge, there should be a long period when the task of 
deterrence is resolved through the combined use of nuclear and 
conventional systems. But the task of developing precision 
weapons is very complex, requires the diversion of considerable 
material and financial expenditure, and will last just as long 
-- since it depends on the development [razrabotka] not just of 
precision systems but on computerized reconnaissance, targeting, 
and guidance networks. Consequently, the basis for its 
elaboration should be developed right now. But, at the same 
time, it is necessary to recall that if a state does not have 
the requisite conventional weapons for deterrence, then it 
should not destroy its nuclear weapons even if all other states 
scrapped their nuclear weapons. Otherwise this would lead to a 
destabilization of the situation and to the possible unleashing 
of a war or military conflict. 
  Thus, we can conclude that the main role of the Russian 
strategic nuclear forces should be to continue to safeguard 
Russia's national security. And the makeup of these forces, the 
technical features of their systems, the organization of their 
combat and auxiliary subunits, and so forth should meet two 
criteria -- first, the ability to effectively deter any 
aggressor against launching a war; and, second, the ability to 
put a stop to aggression by ruling out the possibility of a 
military conflict escalating into large-scale hostilities, to 
suppress military conflict, and to ensure a quest for compromise 
in the course of peace talks. 
  From the preceding reflections it becomes clear that we 
currently have a fundamental opportunity for a fairly broad 
choice of ways to develop the Russian strategic nuclear forces. 
It is even permissible to speak of their possible radical 
restructuring with the complete renouncement of the use of old 
stereotypes and strategic concepts, as if going back to the very 
beginning, and, incidentally, the situation reagrding the 
reappraisal of values in the country as a whole accords with 
this. However, in the face of the systemic crisis which Russia 
and other CIS states have found themselves in, tough 
restrictions, mainly financial ones, have been imposed on the 
choice of real ways of developing strategic offensive arms. The 
majority of Russian military specialists agree that only two of 
them are realistically practicable: Either to "go it alone" and 
take unilateral steps to reduce the numerical strength of the 
strategic nuclear forces and change their structure, or else to 
conduct the modernization of the strategic nuclear forces within 
the framework of the process of the mutual reduction of 
strategic nuclear arms with our former main opponent, and then 
in coordination with other member states of the nuclear club. 
Circumstances have taken shape in such a way that Russia has 
taken the second path, which is justified in the present 
conditions. Although well-founded misgivings exist concerning 
the possibility of the American side, even within the framework 
of the restrictions of the START I and START II Treaties, to 
quickly increase its nuclear potential if the United States were 
to withdraw from these treaties, the rules of the game which 
have been adopted are nevertheless better than a situation 
whereby the Americans could do this without any of the current 
restrictions. 
  START II, as an important international document, has been 
the subject of a most careful study by a wide circle of Russian 
experts. A multitude of articles exists on practically every 
aspect of the problems of strategic stability, which this treaty 
raises and broaches. The fact that good work has been done on 
this question from the viewpoint of information and analysis 
obviates the need for us to further examine the quantitative and 
qualitative restrictions which the treaty places on the 
strategic nuclear potentials of Russia and the United States. 
It is appropriate to ask oneself just the main question here: 
Will the treaty preserve strategic stability and will the new 
level of the nuclear potential estyablished for Russia be 
sufficient as a deterrent? When analyzing these problems, two 
focal points in the discussions of various aspects of this 
treaty must be singled out. This concerns first of all a 
triadic (Strategic Missile Forces plus Navy and Air Force 
strategic nuclear forces) or a dyadic (Strategic Missile Forces 
plus either Navy or Air Force strategic nuclear forces, and so 
on) structure of the strategic nuclear forces, and the number of 
nuclear munitions which Russia is authorized to have. Second, 
the quantitative distribution of the number of munitions among 
the various components (naval, air, and land-based) of strategic 
offensive arms. The expediency of a triadic or dyadic structure 
of strategic nuclear forces for a particular state is determined 
by its geostrategic position, the capacity of its technical 
personnel and resources for servicing strategic nuclear weapons, 
the tactical-technical characteristics of the strategic nuclear 
forces it has, and the parameters of its means of active 
counteraction against a potential adversary. Thus, by assessing 
the aforesaid parameters of the United States' systems, we will 
obtain practically equal combat capabilities for the land-based 
and naval components of the U.S. strategic nuclear forces in 
terms of hitting targets. This testifies to the possibility of 
the United States transferring to a dyadic (naval and air 
components) structure of strategic nuclear forces and the 
elimination of land-based ICBM's. 
  Unlike the United States, an effective strategic nuclear 
forces structure for Russia which would guarantee the nuclear 
deterrence of any aggressor in any strategic situations, is a 
triad: Strategic Missile Forces plus Naval strategic nuclear 
forces plus Air Force strategic nuclear forces. Excluding the 
Strategic Missile Forces, the Naval strategic nuclear forces or 
the Air Force strategic nuclear forces from the triadic 
structure of Russia's strategic nuclear forces would lead, 
according to certain calculations, to an increase in the number 
of nuclear munitions required for deterrence within the 
strategic nuclear forces by a factor of 1.2-1.6, and in 
individual strategic situations, to the nonfulfill of the combat 
mission. This discrepancy in the rational structures whereby 
the Russian and the U.S. strategic nuclear forces are composed 
is attributable to the inferior survivability of the naval 
component of Russia's strategic nuclear forces (see V. 
Belousov's article) as compared with the analogous parameters of 
the U.S. strategic nuclear forces. This deficiency in the 
Russian naval strategic nuclear forces may be compensated for 
and is compensated for by a Strategic Missile Forces land-based 
stationary and also road-mobile force. The triadic structure of 
the Russian strategic nuclear forces provides a guaranteed 
counter to technological breakthroughs in the military sphere, 
for example in air defense, ABM defense, or antisubmarine 
defense. Such a strategic nuclear force structure creates a 
great deal of uncertainty for a possible aggressor as to the 
effectiveness of his preemptive strike, and is a factor which 
stabilizes the strategic equilibrium. Therefore it is 
impermissible to remove one of the components from the Russian 
strategic nuclear forces.

<H5>  Information Memorandum "On State of Affairs in the Northern </H5>
Fleet" 
  1. General Evaluation of the State of the Northern Fleet and 
of the Problem of Ensuring the Combat Activity of the Fleet's 
Forces and the Social Protection of Servicemen and Their 
Families and Civilian Personnel 
  The Northern Fleet is one of the most powerful and modern of 
the Russian Federation Armed Forces' operational-strategic 
formations.... At the present time the Northern Fleet is the 
only force capable of opposing the NATO countries' naval 
groupings in the North Atlantic region. 
  The fleet's role in, and responsibility for, the defense of 
the Russian Federation's economic interests in the transpolar 
region is increasing because of the exploitation of oil and gas 
reserves on the continental shelf, the protection of fishing, 
the escort of transarctic crossings and ships traveling from 
Europe to the Far East and Southeast Asia, and also the 
provision of reliable cover for access to the world's oceans. 
  The viability and combat effectiveness of the fleet depend 
on 
full and timely financing. However, in recent times the Russian 
Federation Ministries of Finance and Defense have been 
implementing only partial financing of the Northern Fleet. The 
shortage of money has led to a 45 percent reduction in the 
Northern Fleet's ships and vessels since 1988. Industry 
delivers only two combatant ships every year. At the same time 
more than 50 ships were decommissioned in 1991-1993. Special 
alarm is caused by the state of the recycling of nuclear 
submarines, the storage and reprocessing of radioactive waste, 
and by questions of radiation and ecological safety. The 
irregularity of finance and the inability to pay suppliers is 
causing serious breakdowns in the provision of fuels and 
lubricants to the fleet. The absence of a mechanism for the 
practical implementation of individual articles of the Russian 
Federation Law "On the Status of Servicemen" for the provision 
of social and legal guarantees and privileges to servicemen and 
their families, and also delays in payment and indexation of 
wages and allowances, are having a detrimental effect on the 
vital activity and morale of the fleet's naval and civilian 
personnel.... 
  The cadre problem has become acute -- as a result of the 
exodus of the population from the Kola Peninsula to the 
countries of the CIS and the Russian Federation's central 
oblasts a great shortage of skilled specialists has arisen in 
the maintenance services and subdepartments which ensure the 
vital activity of Northern Fleet garrisons. The situation is 
exacerbated by the fact that the most qualified specialists are 
moving into local administration structures because of the low 
level of pay in comparison with similar services in the Russian 
Federation's housing and utilities sector. 
  The difficulties of maintaining the fleet's personnel levels 
at full strength are growing. Analysis of the young replacement 
recruits arriving on the ships showed a sharp reduction in the 
qualities exhibited by draftees. The number of servicemen with 
health defects and inadequate physical development has grown 
significantly (from 1.2 percent to 6.7 percent), and the number 
of new-arrivals with disproportionate heights and weights has 
increased. One in five young seamen are guilty of deviant 
behavior; one in six were brought up in single-parent families, 
mainly by the mother.... 
<H5>  On Ship Repairs and the Recycling of Ships and Radioactive </H5>
Waste 
  In 1993 the Northern Fleet had 332 ships in need of repair. 
These included 35 nuclear submarines, seven diesel submarines, 
39 surface ships, and 251 service craft. On the basis of the 
quantity of money allocated only 21 combatant ships were sent 
for repairs. Thus the fleet's total repair requirements were met 
by 27 percent. The repair of auxiliary fleet ships is a cause 
for special alarm. With a total requirement of 5.0 billion 
rubles [R] and $40 million for these purposes only R283 million 
were allocated in 1993, which constitutes 3.8 percent. This 
state of affairs could lead to failures in ensuring the fleet's 
combat effectiveness by as early as 1995. At the same time it 
is essential to bear in mind that as of today 42 percent of 
ships have completed their regulation service lives and are 
liable to be withdrawn from the fleet, while the period between 
repairs has been allowed to overrun for 53 percent of ships. 
  There are 112 foreign-built ships in the fleet. The routine 
repairs of more than 70 of these are overdue. Since 1993 these 
ships have ceased to be sent abroad for repairs because of the 
lack of hard currency appropriations.... 
  In order to fulfill the recycling program and the START 
treaties, appropriations at the level of R899.0 million (in 
current prices) are needed. In 1993 the fleet received 
R1,566,700,000 (17.4 percent of the sum requested). 
  A critical situation has arisen in the fleet over the 
removal 
of spent nuclear fuel. In 1992 the fleet ended the practice of 
dumping liquid and solid radioactive waste in the sea. The 
temporary storage areas for solid radioactive waste are 
completely full.... 
  Because of the absence of finance for the capital 
construction of storage facilitiesfor spent nuclear fuels and a 
permanent special-purpose wharf [statsionarnyy tekhnologicheskiy 
prichal] in the Andreyev and Nerpichye inlets and for the repair 
and modernization of the railroad from Kola Station to Nerpichye 
Station, the fleet cannot begin the removal of spent nuclear 
fuel in the new ecologically safe TK-18 containers.... 
<H5>  On Missile and Artillery Weapons </H5>
  Efficiency in the solution of questions regarding the repair 
of missile and artillery weapon components and the replenishment 
of spare parts, tools, and accessories kits has sharply 
deteriorated. Since January 1991 the Navy Armored Tank Supply 
Service has failed to achieve the task of supplying the Northern 
fleet with new MAZ-537 tow trucks to replace those whose engine 
life has expired.... The fleet has four floating cranes left 
which are permitted to be used on operations involving 
special-category freights; new ones are not being delivered.... 
The cranes are being stretched to the maximum. Their failure 
would entail the end of work with special-category freights.... 
The problem of recycling arms and munitions currently in 
operation at Northern Fleet bases and storehouses is acute. A 
large number of missiles for which there are no carriers has 
accumulated.... 
<H5>  On Mines and Torpedos </H5>
  It is essential to accelerate the production of mines and 
antimine weapons at the Russian Federation's defense industry 
plants in the cities of St. Petersburg, Perm, Votkinsk, and 
Yekaterinburg, where the necessary production facilities exist. 
This is connected with the fact that the chief plants for the 
production of these weapons are in Kazakhstan, and arms 
production at them has already ceased. There is no possibility 
of replenishing arms reserves in the fleet.... 
<H5>  On Supplying Fuels and Lubricants </H5>
  In connection with the fleet's monetary debts to industrial 
enterprises, supplies of petroleum products and solid fuel to 
the fleet have virtually ceased. The fleet received 68 percent 
of its diesel fuel requirement in 1993. There are not 
sufficient tanks to store fuel.... 
<H5>  On the Maritime Engineering Service </H5>
  At the present time worker and employee manning levels in 
the 
Northern Fleet's communal services stand on average at 20-30 
percent. In order to maintain the stock of housing and barracks 
and communal facilities in proper running order the command 
authorities have been forced to divert personnel to the 
aforementioned work. This is seriously detrimental to the 
combat training and combat readiness of the fleet's units. 
Given the existing personnel shortage (around 40 percent), 
people are being seriously physically overstretched.... 
  In view of the manning levels and the technical condition of 
the ships, the fleet is delivering only 36 percent of the 
planned level of stocks, including 50 percent (52,000 tonnes) of 
liquid fuel requirements and 17 percent (15,000) of dry freight 
requirements by means of its own resources; hence the fleet is 
forced every year to hire ships from civilian ship owners, which 
requires additional monetary expenditure, including of hard 
currency. The fleet does not have ships of its own capable of 
transporting the necessary amount of freight. Of the 50 
transport ships the fleet needs, it actually has just 35 (70 
percent), among which 19 (54 percent) have completed their 
regulation service lives and are due to be written off. 
<H5>  On Clothing Supplies </H5>
  At the present time, because of shortfalls in supplies from 
industry of a large number of items of military dress, the 
situation as regards the provision of clothing to the fleet's 
forces remains tense. Thus, for example, supplies of fur 
jackets for submariners meet 1 percent of requirements, supplies 
of footwear, 76 percent of requirements. 
<H5>  On Food Supplies </H5>
  The nonfulfillment of the Russian Federation President's 
directive "On the Abolition of Advance Payment for Products 
(Commodities) Delivered to Regions of the Far North and 
Equivalent Localities" is leading to increasing difficulties in 
providing food for personnel. 
  The safekeeping of food is a pressing problem, owing to the 
shortage of storage capacities. In individual garrisons there 
are shortages of up to 30 percent of the storehouses, depots, 
and refrigerators that are required. The material-technical 
base of military trade remains a tricky problem. In garrisons 
in Pechenga, Vysokiy, Kilp-Yavr, Afrikanda, Korzunovo, and 
Kildin Island, and others, 70 percent of enterprises are housed 
in delapidated, unadapted premises built before the war. 
<H5>  On the Provision of Housing </H5>
  The Northern Fleet has a sufficient material and technical 
base and sufficient personnel to construct and commission the 
necessary facilities.... However, questions of funding housing 
construction today encroach extremely painfully on the interests 
not only of people, but also of production units. Social 
tension is growing in the labor collectives of 
"Sevvoyenmorstroy".... 
<H5>  On Ensuring the Social Protection of Servicemen and Their </H5>
Families 
  The adoption of a package of laws on the social protection 
of 
servicemen and their families has been positively received in 
the Northern Fleet. However, the adopted laws of the "military" 
package are not yet operating fully.... 
<H5>  On Closed Administrative-Territorial Enities </H5>
  The majority of the Northern Fleet's remote garrisons have 
the status of closed administrative-territorial entities. The 
peculiarities of life in these entities require an increased 
level of budget finance and additional social protection 
measures, privileges, and guarantees provided at state level. 
Analysis shows that the Russian Federation Law "On the Closed 
Administrative-Territorial Entity" is not being fully 
implemented. 
  Appeals received from inhabitants of the cities of 
Murmansk-140, Murmansk-150, and the settlement of Vidyayevo 
reflect the most typical socioeconomic problems of the Northern 
Fleet's remote garrisons. These appeals (they are forwarded to 
the apparatus of the Russian Federation Council of 
Ministers-Government) demand the adoption of additional measures 
to ensure the implementation of the law. 
<H5>  Our Commentary </H5>
  The Northern Fleet was in 1993 recognized as the best fleet 
of the Russian Federation. The authors of the memorandum -- 
high-ranking Russian military men -- try in the language of 
facts and figures to explain to the State Duma and the minister 
of defense that the country could soon be deprived of its most 
combat-effective fleet, and thus by the end of the century be 
without a proper maritime strategic defense system. 
Unfortunately, this is happening at a time when, in accordance 
with the START-II treaty, the proportion of the sea-launched 
grouping of ICBM's in Russia is doubling. Perhaps the situation 
in the world has thawed to such a degree that other countries 
have kissed their navies goodbye? It would appear not: In the 
United States, for example, more than 100 ships are being 
commissioned in 1993-1995, including three aircraft carriers, 
seven missile-carrying submarines, 18 nuclear multi-purpose 
submarines, eight cruisers, 16 destroyers, three amphibious 
warships, three acoustic research ships, and seven tankers. 
This is no accident: Any state that pretends to the role of a 
great power must ensure its naval power. 
  So, is it possible to resolve the Northern Fleet's problems 
under real economic conditions? One method was proposed at a 
session of the Interdepartmental Commission for Defense Security 
held 28 April under the chairmanship of A. Kokoshin. The 
proposal was to derive funds to set up a new infrastructure for 
the Northern Fleet on the basis of "centers of growth" of 
industrial production and the diversification of 
military-industrial complex enterprises and through the 
subsequent increase of the tax base and the influx of private 
money. The minimum number of ultramodern combatant ships in the 
fleet will be determined on the basis of national security 
interests, and the full support of these ships with auxiliary 
vessels and shore services should eliminate the disproportion 
between the combatant ships' requirements and the possibilities 
of servicing them. All the same the impression arises that 
moods leading, to put it mildly, to the underestimation of the 
role of a strong Navy -- which is designed to support Russia's 
strategic interests -- have gained the upper hand in the 
country's military-political leadership. All the attention of 
several Ministry of Defense leaders is today focused on mobile 
forces, and the backbone of these forces -- Airborne Troops, 
which are intended to be the basis of Russia's military might. 
However, it is no secret that mobile forces are designed 
primarily for fighting an internal enemy. Does this mean that 
danger to Russia from without no longer exists?

<F P=106> [Interview with Lt-Gen B. Dyukov, first deputy commander, </F>
Group of Russian Troops in Transcaucasus, by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA 
correspondent Vitaliy Denisov: "A Practical Military Diplomacy 
in Transcaucasus"; date and place not given; first paragraph is 
KRASNAYA ZVEZDA introduction] 
  [Text] The Group of Russian Troops in the Transcaucasus has 
been created relatively recently. What tasks does it face? What 
is the reason for a Russian troop presence abroad? These were 
the first questions put by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA's correspondent to 
Lieutenant-General B. Dyukov, first deputy commander, Group of 
Russian Troops in the Transcaucasus. 
  [Dyukov] The GRVZ [Group of Russian Troops in Transcaucasus] 
is not simply a strategic grouping on the soil of friendly 
Georgia and Armenia. The local populace, and--let us admit 
it--many people in nearby countries look upon the Russian Armed 
Forces as offering the sole opportunity for normalizing the 
situation in this explosive area, with the only, and, possibly, 
the last, real chance for ending internecine and fratricidal 
warfare. 
  Another aspect is the moral, the humanitarian. I have in 
mind 
the fact that Russian military personnel on duty in Tbilisi, 
Batumi, Gyumri, and Akhalkalaki are fully-qualified 
representatives of the great Russia. In this connection, any 
move they make, their behavior is watched very closely and 
subjected to unforgiving analysis and evaluation by our true 
friends on the one hand, and by our enemies and opponents (of 
which there are many) on the other. For this reason, for 
military personnel, such concepts as professionalism, 
conscience, and soldier's honor hold special significance. A 
significance which the famous Russian military leader General 
Yermolov described as early as the 19th century as "practical 
military diplomacy" for the Russian Army in the Transcaucasus. 
This in spite of the fact that today's military service Russians 
are performing in the Transcaucasus has nothing in common with 
the missions and functions assigned to the Caucasian Army at the 
beginning of the last century. 
  [Denisov] One may say that the Transcaucasus area is the 
"hottest" of all places in the territory of the former USSR. 
Reports emanating from here are more often than not alarming. 
How does that affect the Group of Russian Troops? 
  [Dyukov] The peculiarities of the situation in the area 
naturally do exert an effect on service in the Transcaucasus. 
The instability of the situation accords priority status to 
guarding and defending sites, bases, and the territory on which 
military units are stationed. Pursuing this mission under 
conditions of an extreme personnel shortage is anything but 
simple. And it must be realized that Russian military personnel 
must take on peacekeeping functions as well, such as in the fall 
of last year, when GRVZ men and officers assumed the burden of 
providing security for a segment of the railroad lying between 
Poti and Kutaisi. 
  In spite of the above, we cannot ignore combat readiness and 
military training of units and subunits. Combat training 
essentially boils down to commander training, but the arrival of 
contract servicemen affords us the opportunity of effecting a 
more effective, quality training process. There is much labor 
attached to this, it is true. For example, in the large unit 
stationed in Gyumri, the military authorities can organize 
weapons firing, driving exercises, special training, and even 
demonstration company tactical exercises including live firing. 
By agreement reached between the governments of Russia and 
Armenia and between the leadership of the ministries of defense 
of the two countries, it was at this time that permission was 
obtained to enlist republic citizens from among the 
Russian-speaking population, something which made it possible to 
effect a considerable improvement in filling the manpower needs 
of units and subunits. Commanders of other large units can only 
dream about that kind of scale of combat training. 
  I repeat: Interethnic conflicts in one way or another -- 
some 
waxing, others waning -- exert a direct influence on the life 
and activity of Russian troops in the area. Take Georgia as an 
example. The internal political situation in that Republic in 
1992-1993 was anything but stable. The absence of a well-founded 
program of resolving the total socio-economic crisis, 
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict, state of war existing between the 
country's east and west - all of that contributed to an increase 
in extremism, to a defamatory and unacceptable observance of all 
laws. It is not surprising that Georgia turned into a chaotic 
mess. On top of that, a large part of the population took up 
looting. 
  But from whom to steal? The primary target of violence was 
the Russian military. And we were forced to protect ourselves, 
without expectation of help from the authorities, who 
incidentally until recently were not particularly of a loyal 
frame of mind with respect to us. Unfortunately, there were 
victims. In two years in the Transcaucasus, more than 50 
enlisted men and officers lost their lives. Add to that the 
hundreds of pieces of motor vehicles and armored vehicles 
seized, incidents of forced eviction from apartments, constant 
threats hurled at servicemen's families, etc. 
  Yes, progress has been made in interrelationships with 
Georgia's leadership and the republic's minister of defense. The 
local populace's attitude toward the Russian military has shown 
some improvement. This definitely gives rise to hope: The 
realization has finally arrived whereby seizing our vehicles and 
plundering Russian troop facilities can cause only harm, not 
good, primarily to Georgia. 
  [Denisov] The situation is apparently somewhat more 
favorable 
in this respect in the large unit stationed in the city of 
Gyumri. 
  [Dyukov] There was a time when Russian troops in Armenia 
suffered difficulties. Desperate persons of the opposition would 
shout about the need for immediate withdrawal of the 7th Guards 
Army from Republic soil. The army departed. But now, some time 
later, many representatives of the power structures and even 
yesterday's "irreconciliables" openly admit their hastiness and 
generally the wrongfulness of their past statements and actions. 
The people simply realized that Russians are not enemies, that 
we--both Armenians and Russians--who have lived together for 
centuries, cannot exist separately. 
  Also of no small importance is something else. Even during 
the years when the situation attending our units stationed in 
Armenia caused unrest and apprehension, when some "gentlemen of 
opportunity" took it upon themselves to test the vigilance of 
Russian military personnel, we were always extended 
understanding on the part of the state's leadership and the 
power ministries. Criminals were delivered due punishment, while 
that which was seized or stolen was in most cases returned to 
the rightful owners. That firmness apparently also played a role 
in ending the lawlessness with respect to the Russian military. 
  [Denisov] In our conversation, we have not brought up the 
subject of another Transcaucasus republic: Azerbaijan. 
  [Dyukov] The fact of the matter is that there are no GRVZ 
units or large units stationed on the soil of the Azerbaijani 
Republic. Nonetheless, we are maintaining the necessary working 
contacts with this country's leadership and with representatives 
of the Ministry of Defense. The reason for this is that passing 
through Azerbaijan are military trains carrying freight shipped 
in support of the Group of Troops. These trains do at times 
raise passions. At times there are complaints of documents 
incorrectly filled out, while at other times allegations are 
made accusing the armed guards riding the trains of engaging in 
espionage. It is true that a complaint we lodged directly with 
the Azerbaijani minister of defense resulted in speeding up the 
trains. 
  [Denisov] During the recent visit to Georgia made by Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin and Minister of Defense Pavel Grachev, a 
statement was issued relative to a long-term presence of Russian 
troops in the area and the creation of several military bases on 
Transcaucasus territory. In your opinion, how will this be made 
a reality, and how will this affect the lives and service of our 
military personnel? 
  [Dyukov] Yes, Russia did make a statement dealing with the 
existence of strategic interests beyond the mountains of the 
Transcaucasus. However, in this regard, this is a long-term 
program not of a military presence, but of political, economic, 
and military cooperation which is directly dependant upon the 
internal political situation, say in this same Georgia. A 
particular leader may support the idea of a union with Russia, 
while his replacement may oppose it. Today's parliament may be 
in favor of ratifying treaties and agreements, while tomorrow's 
may reject them. Thus, the expression "long-term" as it applies 
to the Transcaucasus is highly relative. And discussion along 
this line unfortunately does not include a strategic 
perspective, only a specific time-- the end of 1995. Concerning 
military bases, in light of the agreement arrived at between the 
Russian Federation and the Republic of Georgia on Friendship, 
Neighborliness, and Cooperation, our Group is facing a change in 
the near future to a new, so-called "base-line" troop 
organization and equipment structure. This will require adopting 
a highly serious approach and exertion of greater efforts to 
acquire new skills, knowledge, and the necessary experience. 
  [Denisov] Many young men about to be inducted into the Army 
are apprehensive about leaving for service in the Transcaucasus. 
Officers are also less than enthusiastic to come here. However, 
service under these conditions, often extreme, is undoubtedly an 
excellent school for acquiring professional and life skills. 
  [Dyukov] All I can say is that service in the Transcaucasus 
very quickly brings out what a person is like. There is no room 
for weaklings and whiners here. Cowardice and faintheartedness 
are evaluated here not in terms of moral categories, but rather 
in lives. Service in the GRVZ is for those who understand that 
the purpose of the military person is either to protect and 
guard or to take up the offensive and liberate. It is for those 
who are willing to sacrifice warmth and comfort for something 
greater. But then, this is a matter of each person's conscience. 
  Does the service really promote professionalism? Most 
likely, 
if we think of this as doing one's duty, as irreproachable 
accomplishment of assigned responsibilities, personal 
discipline, and strength of the spirit. All these qualities are 
manifested more clearly and remarkably under the conditions of 
the Transcaucasus. And here it is not so important whether you 
have graduated from a military VUZ or have just been inducted 
into the ranks of the Armed Forces. That is why we have included 
among those awarded combat decorations and medals not only 
officers and warrant officers, but quite often enlisted men and 
non-commissioned officers. 
  [Denisov] Transcaucasus service personnel are granted 
certain 
privileges, knowledge of which is not widespread. In this 
connection, this could serve as an incentive for those who are 
wondering whether to enlist or not. 
  [Dyukov] There are many privileges. This includes 18 months' 
credit for 12 months of service, base pay plus half, and an 
additional two weeks of leave. I probably could not list all of 
them. Speaking of the material aspect, an enlisted man joining 
us on a draft basis, is paid, on the average, 80,000 to 100,000 
rubles. Contract service pays up to 200,000 rubles. However, I 
repeat that this is not the main thing. 
  Only by serving with us can a youth come to a rapid 
realization of his worth as a man and a person and appreciate 
the value of real service and Army brotherhood.

<F P=106> [Article by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent Sergey Knyazkov </F>
under the "Events and Comments" rubric: "Bugle to Sound March 
Order?: Talks Determining Future of 14th Army"] 
  [Text] As previously reported in KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, the 
eighth round of Russian-Moldovan talks is opening in Kishinev. 
Listed on the agenda are a draft of the Agreement on the Status, 
Conditions, and Procedure for the Withdrawal of the 14th Army, a 
number of other important issues governing the activity of 
troops, and social and pension coverage for military personnel. 
  The interests of Moldova, the Dniester area, and Russia are 
focused on the 14th Army. Moldova, acting with the republic's 
integrity in mind, is calling for the withdrawal of the 14th 
Army by the middle of this year. The reasoning here, according 
to Moldovan Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs Ion Butnaru, is 
that the army's withdrawal may "accelerate the resolution of the 
conflict between Moldova and the Dniester area." 
  Completely different is the view held by the leadership of 
the unrecognized Pridniestr Moldovan Republic, in that it 
expects the new leadership of the Moldovan parliament to provide 
not statements promising a resolution to the Dniester area 
conflict (something which have been given in abundance), but 
rather solid, document-based guarantees for reliable protection 
of interests of the PMR [Pridnester Moldovan Republic]. However, 
there are as yet no guarantees; the sole guarantee of peace and 
security on the left bank of the Dniester, in the opinion of the 
Dniester area residents, continues to be the 14th Army. And this 
in spite of the fact that relations between the PMR's leadership 
and the military authorities of the Russian Army have, for a 
number of reasons, suffered a noticeable decline. In all 
likelihood, the PMR's recent decision to appropriate and render 
as republic property all the weapons and property of the 14th 
Army is a reflection of this situation and an attempt to force 
Russia to play a more active role in resolving the conflict 
between Kishinev and Tiraspol. 
  In response, the 14th Army's military council demanded that 
the "provocative" decision be rescinded, and Commander 
Lieutenant-General Aleksandr Lebed issued the order "to employ 
weapons, firing for effect" to repel any attacks on Russian 
service personnel and military installations. The RF [Russian 
Federation] Minister of Foreign Affairs also made a strong 
statement on this subject. Nonetheless, Russia still faces 
holding difficult talks with Kishinev, even after condemning the 
acts perpetrated by the Tiraspol authorities, since we are 
interested in extending the mandate of the 14th Army's presence 
on Moldovan soil, possibly as a basis of the Russian Army. 
  This is where Kishinev must be realistic. Withdrawing the 
Army by the end of August and beginning of September 1994 is 
absolutely impossible. In addition, redeploying weapons and 
equipment, which are manned by local draftees and contract 
servicemen in the amount of 85 percent, is something which even 
the people of the PMR will not permit. And these realities must 
be deal with whether one wishes or not.

<F P=106> [Article by Captain Valeriy Russu: "Talks on Withdrawal of </F>
14th Army Continue"] 
  [Text] The eighth round of Russian-Moldavian [Moldovan] 
talks on reconciling the text of an agreement on the legal 
status, procedure, and time-table for the withdrawal of units of 
the 14th Army, stationed in the Dniestr region, has ended in 
Kishinev. Despite some progress, the talks were difficult. The 
stumbling block is the agreement's second article, which deals 
with the time-table for withdrawing the 14th Army from Moldavia 
[Moldova]. Differences over it have yet to be overcome. 
  As is known, the Moldavian [Moldovan] side is insisting that 
the army be withdrawn by July 1 of this year, while Russia would 
prefer to resolve this issue only after the special status of 
the Dniestr region has been defined and social guarantees 
provided for former servicemen and members of their families. 
The delegations exchanged new texts of the article in Kishinev 
and decided to continue its discussion in the next round. 
  Anatol Tsaran, the Republic of Moldavia's [Moldova's] 
ambassador to the Russian Federation and the leader of the 
Moldavian delegation to the talks, said at a press conference 
that the Moldavian side had proposed a new time-table for 
withdrawing the units of the 14th Army over one year or a 
maximum of two years. The Russian side disagrees with this and 
is proposing a longer period of time on account of the social 
and housing problems involved in withdrawing the troops and, to 
a certain extent, the unresolved Dniestr region issue. So far, 
the talks have for the most part succeeded in resolving only the 
issue of the troops' status. 
  During the just-ended round the delegation chiefs initialed 
a 
draft agreement between the two countries on issues of 
jurisdiction and mutual legal assistance with respect to matters 
relating to the temporary presence of Russian Army units on the 
territory of Moldavia, as well as an agreement between the 
Russian and Moldavian governments on social guarantees and 
pensions for former servicemen and members of their families. 
  As regards the 14th Army's property and weapons, the Chief 
of 
the Russian delegation at the talks, special ambassador Vladimir 
Kitayev, stressed all of it is owned by Russia. Representatives 
of the Dniestr region participated in the talks, as they had 
done in previous rounds. The next round is to be held in May in 
Moscow.

  [Text] The governments of Canada, Sweden, Ukraine, and the 
United States signed an agreement to establish a 
scientific-technical center in Ukraine. The center's program 
will focus on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, as well 
as the consideration, approval, and financing of projects that 
will employ scientists who previously worked in the armaments 
sector in peaceful, civilian scientific-technical fields. 
  The founding parties are planning to submit their proposals 
to the executive council in the very near future. All the 
countries that signed the agreement on founding this 
scientific-technical center have pledged substantial sums in 
U.S. dollars to help finance the center: the U.S.--10 million, 
Sweden--1.5 million, and Canada--2 million dollars. Ukraine has 
pledged to do everything necessary to prepare the center, 
allocate a building and equipment, and provide services.

Ukraine as Fuel for Nuclear Electric Power Stations"] 
  [Text] The first batch of cassettes [kaset] has arrived 
from Russia at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Electric Power Station, 
Europe's largest AES, as payment for the dismantled nuclear 
warheads. This means that the practical implementation of the 
measures provided for in the trilateral declaration of the 
Presidents of Ukraine, Russia, and the United States on this 
issue has begun. 
  Experts estimate that the amount of fuel delivered to the 
Zaporizhzhya AES is sufficient to operate one of the five 
reactors for a year. This will provide our country with 5.5-6 
billion kilowatt-hours of cheap electric power.

<F P=106> [UKRINFORM report: "They Are Prepared To Provide Ukraine </F>
with Assistance in Liquidating Nuclear Weapons"] 
  [Text] Meeting with President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine on 
21 February, the ambassadors of the world's 14 leading countries 
(Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, the Federal Republic 
of German, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Spain, 
Great Britain, and the United States) presented a declaration 
from the governments of their countries regarding their 
readiness to assist our country in the liquidation of the 
nuclear weapons deployed on the territory of Ukraine. As a 
follow-up to this initiative, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of 
Ukraine invited the representatives of the above countries, 
along with representatives from Greece, the Republic of South 
Africa, South Korea, the United Nations, and the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [MAHATE] to take part in the multilateral 
consultations, at which the scope and areas of assistance to 
Ukraine could be discussed. 
  These consultations began on 19 April at the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs of Ukraine. Taking part in them are 
representatives from the ministries of defense; 
machine-building, conversion, and the military-industrial 
complex; foreign affairs; and education; and the State Committee 
on Nuclear and Radiation Safety. Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy 
Shmarov delivered an opening statement. 
  It was stressed that a whole series of specific programs and 
projects in the areas that are of priority importance to Ukraine 
have been submitted for consideration by the Western countries 
and international organizations. 
  Responding to a request by journalists to comment on this 
important event, Valeriy Shmarov stated: It is very gratifying 
that many countries and influential international organizations 
have responded to our problems in the field of nuclear weapons 
liquidation. This is a show of great political support for us. 
As to actual economic assistance, each will help as best he can, 
as they say. The most tangible assistance at present has come 
from the United States. As we know, in accordance with the 
agreements that have been signed, the U.S. has allocated 350 
million dollars of assistance to be used in carrying out the 
disarmament program. These funds have not yet been received, but 
matters are moving along. It should be said, in all fairness, 
that Ukraine is already engaged in nuclear disarmament. Thus, 
any assistance would be very timely.

<F P=106> [Article by Serhiy Zhurets, NARODNA ARMIYA commentator: </F>
"Partnership for Peace: A Step Forward or Marking Time?"] 
  [Text] An international conference on "Security in Europe: 
The Central European Component" has begun in Kiev. The 
conference is being sponsored by the Ukrainian Center for the 
Study of International Security Issues. The purpose of the 
conference is to assist the leaders of Central European states 
to work out possible options for creating a system of collective 
security in Europe. 
  This is the third conference of its kind in the last two 
years. As a result of the work done in the past, experts, 
scientists, and diplomats from Belarus, Bulgaria, Hungary, 
Poland, Moldova, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and Ukraine have 
concluded that there is a need to conduct international research 
on the problems of security in Europe and to engage specialists 
from the Central European countries, as well as Russia and NATO, 
in this endeavor. 
  Considering the high level of representation, one could 
conclude that the desired goal has been successfully reached. 
The military and civilian specialists who came to Kiev included 
not only representatives from countries in the immediate 
vicinity of Ukraine, but also from Great Britain, Germany, 
Spain, the United States, and Switzerland. 
  If we isolate the problems that pertain solely to Ukraine 
from among all the issues discussed during the first day of the 
conference, it becomes apparent that buttressing security by 
having Kiev join NATO's proposed "Partnership for Peace" is 
regarded as far from the best and only solution. 
  Professor Volodymyr Bruz, representing the Ukrainian 
Institute of International Relations, proposed another option. 
In his opinion, we need to strive for an alliance of East and 
West in a single structure. This will relieve tensions among the 
countries that have been left outside NATO and the CIS agreement 
on collective security. Moreover, this will immediately 
eliminate the problem of the entry of these countries into 
already existing military alliances. Security will be guaranteed 
because all European countries will become members of a single 
structure. 
  The Ukrainian specialist cited Russia's rather negative 
reaction to the joining of NATO's initiative by former Warsaw 
Pact members as confirmation of his thesis. The situation with 
respect to Ukraine will be much more difficult. "Russia will not 
allow Ukraine to join NATO until after Russia herself becomes a 
member of NATO, if she ever does so," believes the Ukrainian 
expert. Ukraine's attempt to draw closer to NATO may aggravate 
Ukrainian-Russian relations. 
  However, Neville Hunter, the representative of NATO and a 
professor at NATO's military college, expressed the opinion that 
another structure should not be added to the already existing 
entities engaged in maintaining security. The North-Atlantic 
alliance is up to the job of resolving all problems. 
  The position of the Ukrainian defense department on this 
issue was expressed by Capt. 1st Rank Hryhoriy Perepelytsya, an 
officer of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. He 
noted: "NATO's `Partnership for Peace' program will help us to 
normalize relations with Russia with the help of already 
existing international standards and executive structures, which 
will be put into effect by the program. It is therefore in our 
interest for Russia to join NATO's initiative as soon as 
possible." 
  Moreover, in the opinion of the Ukrainian officer, joining 
the "Partnership for Peace" does not mean the direct entry by 
the partnership members into the North-Atlantic alliance. 
  The conference is continuing. Its goal is to create an 
international group of experts and to agree on a plan of action 
to study the problems of European security.

  [Text] The reformation of the Sevastopol Naval Institute is 
continuing in accordance with the new curriculum. 
  Two departments that used to train specialists to service 
nuclear reactors on surface vessels and submarines have thus 
been combined and transformed into a department for nuclear 
power installations. The experienced instructors in it will 
train specialists for the nuclear electric power plants of 
Ukraine. 
  The refitting of the teaching laboratory, which has unique 
simulators of the control panels of operational shipboard 
nuclear power installations, will soon begin under the 
supervision of department chief Captain 1st Rank Nikolay 
Peregudov. Experienced specialists--representatives of the 
Ministry of Nuclear Power of Ukraine--will be assisting in this 
work.

<F P=106> [Unattributed news item: "The Kiev Cadets--Overboard?"] </F>
  [Text] Close to 70 cadets from the fourth-year class of the 
Kiev Higher Naval School [KVVMU] have arrived in Sevastopol to 
serve a tour of duty in the Ukrainian Navy and in the Black Sea 
Fleet. Thirty-eight of the cadets have already begun their tours 
in the initial positions of deputy commanders of ships 3rd rank 
with VSPR and officers in the battalions and companies of the 
Ministry of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, while their colleagues 
(more than 30 of them) who had concluded contracts with the 
Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation have not gone to 
the Black Sea Fleet. 
  The Commander of the Black Sea Fleet, Admiral Eduard Baltin, 
rejected the cadets for tours of duty owing to the fact that the 
fleet has no money. This is even though advance agreement was 
reached between the command of the KVVMU and the command of the 
Black Sea Fleet on the tours for the cadets, which was confirmed 
by telegram of the Commander of the Russian Navy, Admiral Feliks 
Gromov. The next telegram from the same Gromov prohibited doing 
this. Why? This is not known. 
  The cadets from the KVVMU thus still do not have anything to 
do. While the commanding officer of their tours, Captain 2nd 
Rank Oleksandr Aksonov, tries to find a contact from the command 
of the Black Sea Fleet, the Chief of Staff of the Ukrainian 
Navy, Rear-Admiral Oleksiy Ryzhenko, has decided to accommodate 
the Kievans on the grounds of the Sevastopol Naval Institute.

<F P=106> [Interview with Rear-Admiral Viktor Makarov by </F>
Captain-Lieutenant Albiy Shudrya: "`The Institute is Being 
Reformed, Not Dissolved'"] 
  [Text] Reports have appeared in the city newspaper 
SLAVA SEVASTOPOLYA and other Crimean publications on significant 
cutbacks in cadets at the Naval Institute. The authors of those 
features assert that the higher educational institution is in 
complete decline, and its graduates have no prospects with 
regard to the service. They ask whether it would not be better 
to train lieutenants for the fleets of Russia, and not only for 
the Ukrainian Navy. What is the sense of the cutbacks that are 
taking place? A discussion by the senior officer of the press 
center of the Ukrainian Navy, Captain-Lieutenant Albiy Shudrya, 
with SVMI [Sevastopol Naval Institute] Chief Rear-Admiral Viktor 
Makarov began with that question. 
  [Makarov] The Armed Forces of Ukraine are being cut back as 
a 
whole; their size has been defined by the Supreme Soviet. The 
quantitative composition of the Navy is defined accordingly, and 
orders are placed from the state on that basis. We also train 
specialists for Derzhkomatom [State Committee for Nuclear Power] 
and Derzkomkordon [State Border Commission]. As for the training 
of officers for the Russian Navy, Russia itself has refused 
this, taking out all cadets who did not take the Ukrainian oath. 
No one demanded any payment for the training of those cadets. We 
were prepared to complete their training without charge, in 
accordance with the Dahomys and Yalta agreements. Proceeding 
from some political views or ambitions, all of those people who 
did not want to study here were called back from Sevastopol in 
April of 1993. 
  We are prepared to work according to that plan, however. 
Belarus will possibly order some specialists--they do not have 
very many military schools--and Kazakhstan could also resolve 
the issue of training cadres here. 
  If such a proposal were to appear, we would of course study 
it... 
  The institute is not collapsing and is not being dissolved, 
but is rather being reformed. The group of those who want to 
study is being cut back, as is occurring at all of the higher 
educational institutions of Ukraine--both civilian and military. 
The state will be training as many specialists as it requires. 
The laboratory base, simulators, a number of departments and 
support personnel are all being preserved at the institute. Some 
naval services are being accommodated in the freed-up spaces, 
close to 50 percent of the premises today. As for the 
accommodation of subunits of the National Guard, that is 
disinformation. 
  [Shudrya] Why were more cadets than are needed accepted last 
year? 
  [Makarov] We were proceeding from the Yalta and Moscow 
agreements between Ukraine and Russia. The discussion concerns 
the division of the Black Sea Fleet [ChF] in a ratio of 50 
percent to 50 percent. The order for the training of specialists 
was placed with a regard for that. We know today, however, that 
the resolution of the issue of the Black Sea Fleet at Massandra 
has been disrupted, and this group became unnecessary. The 
graduates of 1992-93 were thus greater than the requirements for 
officers. Some of the graduates, true, were sent to replenish 
the Ukrainian Navy. The ChF command, however, did not display 
any interest in assigning the young officers to vacant 
positions. Many of the graduates were discharged into the 
reserves. 
  [Shudrya] The cutbacks in cadets will lead to cutbacks in 
instructors. What will happen to the officers and scientific 
staff members? 
  [Makarov] We will not be dismissing the instructors, and do 
not intend to let anyone go. The naval scientific-research 
center is still far from fully staffed. There are many vacancies 
at command levels of the institute, and commanders of subunits, 
companies and departments are needed. There are also quite a few 
positions in the Ukrainian Navy that would suit our officers as 
well. I had a conversation with the Commander-in-Chief of the 
Navy, and I can report that such an opportunity will be granted 
in a case where there is a desire to continue service. There are 
also quite a few higher positions in the department of the Navy 
or at the newly created Armed Forces Institute of Ukraine. 
  [Shudrya] Newspaper features assert that the recruitment of 
cadets will now take place in Kiev. Has there really been such a 
decision? 
  [Makarov] There is such a version. People should come to the 
institute from other regions, not just from Sevastopol. Such an 
imbalance still exists. I feel that this is not entirely fair to 
the other inhabitants of Ukraine. The more so as many of the 
oblasts have assumed sponsorship of the Ukrainian Navy. Rivne 
Oblast, for example, is sponsoring the SVMI. The sponsors have 
assumed the obligation of sending their own representatives to 
take the examinations on a competitive basis. 
  [Shudrya] The institute has a good physical plant. Will it 
be 
preserved? 
  [Makarov] The physical plant that is needed by the Ukrainian 
Navy will be preserved, and no questions whatsoever can arise 
here. We do not intend to eliminate and dismantle it, but are 
rather proposing to use it, as before, for the training of 
cadets. As for a new physical plant, it still needs to be 
resolved where it will be. 
  [Shudrya] Tell me, if you would be so kind, will young men 
from Sevastopol be trained at the SVMI? 
  [Makarov] I have no doubt of it. The opportunities for 
access 
to the institute are the same for everyone. Knowledge, a desire 
to become a sailor, physical fitness and endurance, however, 
have to be mandatory. These criteria have always been taken into 
account. Today, in connection with the fact that the recruiting 
will be cut back, they move to the forefront. Our task is to 
select the best, wherever they may come from. Many unfortunately 
enter the institute only in order to study for a year or two in 
order to avoid the draft, and then leave. There are people from 
Sevastopol among those as well. I do not want us to err in 
selecting those for whom naval service is the path of the 
romantic.

<F P=106> [Article by Captain 2nd Rank Oleksandr Shcherbakov under the </F>
rubric "Our Special Correspondents Report From Sevastopol": "In 
the Interests of the State and the Institute"] 
  [Text] The teachers and cadets of the power-engineering 
department of the Sevastopol Naval Institute imeni P.S. Nakhimov 
have launched another semester under new conditions. Qualitative 
changes in the training programs of the specialists for both the 
fleet and for the national economy have taken place under the 
supervision of department chief Captain 1st Rank V. Kiryachenko. 
  The Department of Electric-power Engineering (Chief, Captain 
1st Rank S. Smyrnov), for example, has begun to train nuclear 
engineers for Derzhkomatom [State Committee for Nuclear Power]. 
  The instructors of the Department for the Operation and 
Repair of Ships, under the supervision of Captain 1st Rank A. 
Lobanov, have developed a comprehensive program for shipbuilding 
and ship repairs for all of Ukraine, and have begun to train 
cadets in it. 
  A program under which the training of frogmen instructors 
for 
the military and civilian fleets is conducted has been 
introduced in the Department of Underwater Training and 
Shiplifting (chief, Captain 2nd Rank V. Holovin). 
  These facts testify to one thing--that the Sevastopol Naval 
Institute is being reformed in the interests of the state and 
the fleet, and also in the interests of the professors, 
instructors and cadets of the SVMI.

<F P=106> [Article by Captain 2nd Rank Oleksandr Shcherbakov: "The </F>
Institute Becomes an Academy"] 
  [Text] The further reformation of the Sevastopol Naval 
Institute into the Naval Academy will occur by supplementing the 
already well-worked-out structure with newly created officers' 
classes and courses of study, as well as an academic section, 
SVMI Cadres Department Chief Captain 2nd Rank reports. 
  The further training or retraining of specialists, in cases 
where they are assigned to higher positions or in a case of 
changes in military hardware, will take place in the officers' 
classes and courses. The operational-tactical department will 
begin training the flag officer specialists so necessary to the 
Navy today. 
  This will provide an opportunity to combine under one roof 
the whole process of the selection, training and upbringing of 
specialists of all levels not only for the Navy, but for the 
Armed Forces of Ukraine and Minatomenergo [Ministry of Nuclear 
Power Engineering] as well. 
  The availability of the material and technical base and 
professorial and instructor personnel will make it possible to 
achieve this in the shortest possible time periods, and without 
substantial financial expenditures. 
  As concerns the first-year class of the Naval 
Institute--which was selected last year, proceeding from the 
Yalta agreements between the presidents of Russia and Ukraine on 
the Black Sea Fleet, on the basis of which the start of the 
creation of fleets of the two great Slavic nations was 
proposed--it will be cut back by roughly half. The best youth 
will be selected to continue their studies within the walls of 
the institute according to their rankings, which are affected by 
the level of success, discipline, health and physical training 
of the first-year cadets. The rest of the cadets will be offered 
studies at other military educational institutions of Ukraine. 
If they do not want that, they will finish the first year, 
receive academic certificates and be able to continue their 
studies at civilian higher educational institutions. 
  The new academic system is not only a self-contained cycle 
for the training of specialists, but will also provide an 
opportunity to preserve the material and technical base and the 
best personnel among the instructors.

<F P=106> [Article by Serhiy Zhurets, NARODNA ARMIYA commentator, </F>
under the rubric "Point of View": "Is Sevastopol Not Doomed To 
Share the Fate of Guantanamo?"] 
  [Text] The meeting of the 
heads of state and heads of government of the CIS countries that 
was held in Moscow is now behind us. In terms of results, two 
aspects of the meeting will be of special significance to 
Ukraine. 
  The first is that Ukraine has joined the economic union as 
an 
associate ember and signed all the economic agreements without 
exception -- a fact that will significantly affect future 
relations with all the members of the CIS. 
  The second is the attempt to untie the "Black Sea knot," 
which primarily affects relations between Ukraine and Russia, 
which worsened following the incident in Odessa. Yet another 
agreement was reached in Moscow on the division of the Black Sea 
Fleet and on creating a Russian military base on Ukrainian 
territory. 
  What are Kiev's prospects in light of this second aspect 
following the Moscow meeting of the presidents of Ukraine and 
Russia? Let us turn to Leonid Kravchuk's own words. And so... 
  Let us put it this way, what is ours and what is not 
ours? 
  All the bases that are now located in Ukraine--Odessa, 
Ochakiv, Izmayil, etc.--are on our land and they are seemingly 
not at issue. As to ships, Ukraine will take as many as she 
requires to meet her military strategic needs as outlined in her 
military doctrine. (According to the Russian media, Ukraine lays 
claim to 15-20 percent of the ships of the Black Sea Fleet.) 
  Where will the base of the Russian Navy be located? 
  We will know in ten days' time. This matter is to be decided 
by a team of Ukrainian and Russian experts. Nonetheless, Leonid 
Kravchuk showed his hand, as he put it, saying that although it 
would be better not to locate this base in Sevastopol for 
patriotic reasons, it is necessary to reckon with realities. And 
the realities are that a significant portion of the Black Sea 
Fleet will be Russian, and if the base of the Russian fleet is 
located elsewhere, the Russian military will need to be provided 
with living quarters, their children with schools, and their 
wives with jobs. Given the financial capabilities of Ukraine, it 
is unlikely that these could be made available in another city. 
  A Russian base on Ukrainian territory--is this to last 
forever? 
  Based on what the president says, it is apparently only a 
matter of leasing, and leases have expiration dates. 
Consequently, the situation should not be dramatized. 
  How much will the ships of the Black Sea Fleet, which 
will be handed over to Russia, cost, and what will be the price 
tag on the lease of Ukrainian territory to be used as a Russian 
military base? 
  According to the president, the cost of these ships still 
needs to be added up. As far as the cost of the lease for basing 
Russian ships is concerned, there are international rules and 
principles for computing the price of such arrangements. We will 
not be inventing something new. We will propose whatever these 
calculations show the amount to be. 
  What will be the status of this Russian base? 
  After Ukraine takes her portion of ships from the Black Sea 
Fleet and Russia takes hers, we will immediately have Russian 
troops on Ukrainian territory, rather than the joint troops we 
had up to now. And once the troops are Russian, their status 
will need to be defined. 
  But the president's decision on this issue is not final. 
This 
decision has to be ratified by the Supreme Council. 
  ...Let me explain that this is what the president thinks, 
but 
the final decision regarding the fate of the Russian base will 
depend, as Leonid Kravchuk noted, on the Supreme Council, whose 
present numerical composition does not allow it to pass 
legislation. 
  All of this is somewhat reminiscent of the second round at 
Massandra. That was the first occasion on which Leonid Kravchuk 
speculated about how profitable it would be for Ukraine to lease 
the Sevastopol naval base to Russia. That is also when the first 
calculations by independent experts appeared, in which the value 
of the Black Sea Fleet was assessed at 30 billion dollars. (It 
will be interesting to see what figure is presented this time.) 
After Massandra, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev declared 
the need for a military and political union between Moscow and 
Kiev. 
  But all that was in the past. Yet the fact that the problem 
of the Black Sea Fleet in the relations between Ukraine and 
Russia is being raised over and over again leads one to give the 
matter serious thought. These reflections indicate clearly that 
even after last week's meeting in Moscow of the presidents of 
Russia and Ukraine, it is premature to believe that this matter 
has finally been resolved. Is there anyone who still fails to 
understand that what is at stake is not only the fate of the 
Black Sea Fleet? Is there anyone who still fails to understand 
that behind the numerous recent promises by Russian 
leaders--both military and civilian--to protect Ukraine from all 
enemies from the south with an indivisible Black Sea Fleet, lies 
a defining of global military policy issues that are of extreme 
importance to Russia and which by no means exclude a military 
and political union between Moscow and Kiev, even though today 
this notion strikes us as absolutely impossible. 
  Yet who can say for certain today what will happen tomorrow? 
And is the creation of a Russian base on the territory of 
Ukraine a step that should be interpreted as giving in on a 
smaller issue in order to protect what is of greater importance? 
I do not know, I am not sure, especially as, unfortunately, we 
are drawing no lessons from the past. And yet, there was plenty 
to reflect upon: The outcome of the division of the foreign 
assets of the former USSR; the still standing decree of the 
Supreme Soviet of Russia (the soviet is gone, but the decree 
remains) on the status of Sevastopol; Russia's position with 
respect to nuclear disarmament in general and in the Odessa 
incident in particular, which both sides recognize as over, even 
though each side continues to believe its position to have been 
correct. 
  What next?.. 
  Even before the ink had dried on the documents signed by the 
presidents in Moscow, a storm of accusations began to rage. The 
very next day after the signing of the agreement, Vyacheslav 
Kostikov, the Russian president's press secretary, issued a 
statement concerning the Ukrainian reaction to the signing of 
the agreement on dividing the Black Sea Fleet. It states that 
following the meeting on settling the problems of the Black Sea 
Fleet in stages, the Ukrainian side began to interpret this 
agreement in a one-sided manner. Even before the negotiations 
provided for by the agreement had begun, continues the 
statement, the Ukrainian side began to put foward its own 
formulas pertaining to the leasing, dates, and location for 
basing the Russian Black Sea Fleet. The Russian side is forced 
to remind [Ukraine] of the harsh realities and urgent tasks that 
constitute the basis of the signed agreement. 
  I was particularly struck by the assertion: "Reckless words 
and unbecoming acts with respect to something as sacred to the 
[Russian] ation as the Black Sea Fleet." 
  Thus, even before the experts on the Black Sea Fleet picked 
up their pencils and began their calculations, Vyacheslav 
Kostikov gave an appealing demonstration that he is both 
efficient and knowledgeable. It is quite clear who is speaking 
through the press secretary. And when the Black Sea Fleet, which 
was no more than a fleet only yesterday, suddenly becomes 
"sacred to the Russian nation," we are well aware what arguments 
are used to defend and protect those things that are sacred to a 
nation. Thus the mention of harsh realities does not appear to 
be entirely out of place. This, however, leads to the inevitable 
conclusion that it is premature to speak of unravelling the 
"Black Sea knot" anytime soon, especially with the prospect of a 
foreign military base along the lines of Guantanamo appearing on 
Ukrainian soil.

<F P=106> [NARODNA ARMIYA report: "An Expression of Appreciation to </F>
the Minister of Defense"] 
  [Text] Recently, General of the Army Vitaliy Radetskyy, the 
defense minister, received a letter from Mr. A. Malynovskyy, the 
presidential representative in Zhytomyr Oblast. 
  Your assumption of the leadership of the defense ministry, 
states the letter, has ushered in important changes in the 
approach to building the Armed Forces of Ukraine. We are 
impressed by your energetic and consistent search for promising 
directions in the development of the Armed Forces, and, in 
particular, in reforming military education. 
  The latter is of particular concern to Zhytomyr residents, 
who are grateful to you for your attention to one of the oldest 
military schools, which has been located in Zhytomyr since 1946. 
On 8 December 1994, the school will celebrate its 75th 
anniversary. Since its establishment, it has trained more than 
30,000 officers for the Air Defense Forces [PPO]. At present, 
the school, which is the only one of its kind, is training 
highly qualified specialists for the antimissile and space 
defense forces. We therefore feel that the decision to close the 
school is hasty and without sufficient grounds. 
  Being aware that you have given our problems your careful 
attention, we wish to express our deepest gratitude to you 
personally and to the entire leadership of the Ministry of 
Defense and express the hope that you will ultimately reach a 
positive decision regarding the fate of our school. 
  We believe that one way to decide this matter is to use the 
school as a base on which to create the military division of the 
Zhytomyr Missile and Space Engineering and Technological 
Institute [institut raketno-kosmichnoho profilyu] and a National 
Space Center. Proposals to this effect have been submitted to 
the Cabinet of Ministers. Taking into account your support of 
these proposals, we ask permission to begin enrolling first-year 
students as soon as possible, thereby preventing the 
irreversible loss of the school's professors, instructors, and 
auxiliary teaching personnel--ends the letter from the 
presidential representative in Zhytomyr Oblast.

<F P=106> [Article by H. Pryshchepa, instructor at the Department of </F>
Air Force Tactics at Chernihiv VVAUL [higher military aviation 
school for pilots], under the rubric "Reaction": "The L-39 Will 
Yet Prove Useful. Concerning Some Problems in Training Military 
Pilots"] 
  [Text] In articles devoted to issues associated with 
the building of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, NARODNA ARMIYA has 
often dealt with the urgent problem of flight personnel 
training. In particular, the article "How To Train Military 
Pilots," published on 9 December 1993, focused on the need to 
create a method system of instruction for students in military 
educational institution [vnz] and of additional training for 
officers and on the need to develop training and combat-training 
airplanes for this purpose. Continuing the discussion on this 
subject, an experienced professional offers an opportune 
suggestion. 
  We know that frontline aviation and the aviation of the Air 
Defense Forces [PPO] are currently in a very difficult situation 
due to the economic crisis in which our Ukraine now finds 
herself. Command headquarters is doing everything it can to make 
it possible for pilots to fly, but, unfortunately, it has very 
limited supplies of materials and equipment, fuel and 
lubricants, and its ability to replace aviation equipment is 
also limited. Nonetheless, there is a solution. 
  During this severe economic crisis, I propose using a new 
system requiring only modest expenditures for training young 
pilots for our Air Force and Air Defense Forces. The point of 
this system is to enable all flight school graduates to complete 
the new program in one and one-half to two years and attain the 
level of first-class grade using the L-39 training airplane. 
There are many of these planes in Ukraine, and the available 
number of them makes it possible to use them for this purpose 
for the next few years. The fact that these planes use small 
amounts of fuel will allow each pilot to accumulate from 80 to 
100 flight hours per year. 
  In order to accomplish this purpose, a center for training 
fighter pilots first class, bomber pilots first class, and 
navigators first class could be created at the existing 
Chernihiv VVAUL, for example. The school offers a material base 
and a trained staff of pilots. 
  The most important elements in fighter pilot training are 
aerobatic flying [vyshchyy pilotazh], air combat with fighter 
airplanes, attacking ground targets involving simple and complex 
maneuvers, and flying by day and by night in clouds in poor 
weather. Can pilots not be taught all this at low cost on the 
L-39's? Later, a pilot trained to this degree can be retrained 
at an already existing base (the same Chernihiv base) on a 
fighter plane with an additional 15-20 hours for pilot training 
and combat use of the new sighting mechanism, and the best of 
them can also be trained to serve as instructors. 
  There will be those who will say that the L-39 is not a 
MIG-20 nor a SU-25. I agree. But where are we to get the money 
to train pilots to achieve the rank of airman first class and 
and airman second class on the MIG-29, which burns as much fuel 
in one flight as the L-39 during an entire flight shift? I am 
also relying on my own experience. I received my basic training 
on the MIG-21 BIS. I retrained on MIG-23's of almost all 
modifications, the MIG-29, and the SU-17MC without any 
difficulty and in a short period of time. I regard myself as a 
pilot with average skills, the kind that make up the majority in 
Ukraine and the world over. Even a three-year interval during 
which I did not fly while studying at the academy did not result 
in the loss of the skills I had acquired earlier. 
  A young officer coming to a unit after training in such a 
center will not be merely "personnel" ["shtatna odynytsya"]; he 
will be "combat personnel" ["boyova odynytsya"]. He will need 
only 25-30 hours of training on a combat airplane per year to 
retain his form and 20-30 hours on the same L-39. I see no 
better solution in the present difficult situation.

Vinnytsya. In accordance with our country's Military Doctrine, 
the speakers focused their attention on the directions being 
taken in the build-up and use of this branch of the Armed 
Forces. They noted that the principal trend in the development 
of military aviation is to create mobile forces within the Air 
Defense Forces. 
  Air Force Lt. Gen. Volodymyr Antonets, commander of the Air 
Force of Ukraine, delivered a speech based on scientific 
argumentation. Among those taking an active part in the 
conference were commanders of air formations, chiefs of

Unnecessary--Georgian-Abkhazian Agreements Signed in Moscow on 
April 4"] 
  [Text] An agreement on a cease-fire and the creation of 
conditions for the unimpeded return of refugees to Abkhazia was 
reached in the presence of UN Secretary-General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. 
Experts agree that the development lays a good foundation for a 
settlement of the protracted conflict. 
  However, all this has happened in the past, and more than 
once. Where haven't agreements been signed--in Moscow, Geneva, 
Sochi. Eduard Shevardnadze and Vladislav Ardzinba have gone to 
not only the Russian capital but also New York in search of 
truth. (Needless to say, each for his own version). Until they 
realized that they need not necessary look for the road to 
domestic peace in some distant land. But this was pointed out 
even earlier at the CIS countries' interparliamentary assembly 
by Georgian parliamentary speaker Vakhtang Goguadze. He was one 
of the first to say that a solution to the Abkhaz problem hardly 
required a trip to America, that it should be solved within the 
CIS framework. 
  And so an understanding has been reached. There remains to 
hope that the parties to the conflict will move from 
declarations of accord to its implementation--against the 
backdrop, needless to say, of active mediation efforts by Russia 
and other CIS countries and United Nations assistance in the 
search for a peaceful solution.

<F P=106> [Statute on Controls of Exports From the Russian </F>
Federation of Certain Types of Raw and Processed Materials, 
Equipment, Technology, Scientific and Technical Information 
Which Can Be Used in the Production of Weapons or Military 
Equipment] 
  [Text] 1. This statute specifies a system of measures for 
monitoring the export of certain types of raw and processed 
materials, equipment, technology, scientific and technical 
information which can be used in the production of weapons or 
military equipment (hereafter referred to as dual-purpose goods 
and services). 
  2. The procedure for monitoring the export from the Russian 
Federation of dual-purpose goods and services requires the 
following: 
  --the preparation and issuance of conclusions on the 
possibility of exporting dual-purpose goods and services 
included on List No. 74-rp of Certain Types of Raw and Processed 
Materials, Equipment, Technology, Scientific and Technical 
Information Which Can Be Used in the Production of Weapons or 
Military Equipment the Export of Which is Monitored and Effected 
Under License (hereafter referred to as the List) ratified by 
order of the President of the Russian Federation on 11 February 
1994; 
  --the licensing and drawing-up of customs accounts of 
dual-purpose goods and services. 
  3. All subjects of economic activities under the 
jurisdiction 
of the Russian Federation, regardless of form of ownership in 
the conclusion of contracts for export (transfer or exchange) of 
dual-purpose goods and services included on the List, must 
indicate in the text of the contract the end users and the 
purpose for which the exported goods and services are to be 
used, the commitment of the importer that such goods and 
services will be used only for purposes not directly or 
indirectly related to the production of weapons or military 
equipment and will not be reexported or transferred to anyone 
whomsoever without written orders to that effect from the 
exporter. 
  The obligations must be specially drawn up by the importer 
in 
an authorized state agency of the importing nation for each 
specific transaction for the delivery of any item of export 
included on the List in the form of an international (or 
national) import certificate or the like in the form of a 
document containing the obligations specified in the first 
paragraph of this point with a certified translation into 
Russian. 
  4. In the absence in the importing nation's legislation of 
standards governing the monitoring of exports of certain types 
of dual-purpose goods and services or the absence of a 
dual-purpose good or service imported from the Russian 
Federation on the national control list of the importing nation, 
an official document (notice) to that effect must be issued by 
an authorized state agency of the importing nation. 
  In this case the obligations of the importer contained in 
the 
text of the contract constitute an adequate basis for effecting 
the export. To the documents indicated is attached an extract 
from the commodity registry of the importing country or some 
other document confirming the legal status of the foreign 
importer according to the legislation of the nation in which he 
is located, with a certified translation into Russian. 
  The contract text must define the situation with respect to 
the exporter's right to verify that the good or service will be 
used in accordance with the stated purpose. 
  Setting up the monitoring of the obligations of foreign 
importers with respect to the use of dual-purpose goods or 
services imported from the Russian Federation is carried out by 
the procedure established in Decree No 1030 passed by the 
Council of Ministers and the Government of the Russian 
Federation on 11 October 1993. 
  If violations or nonobservance of the obligations are 
revealed during the verification, the contract is subject to 
abrogation. 
  5. The licensing of the export (transfer or exchange) of 
dual-purpose goods or services included on the List, is 
mandatory for all the subjects of economic activities within the 
Russian Federation and is performed for all types of foreign 
economic activities, regardless of the form of ownership, 
including direct production and scientific and technical 
relations, border and near-border trade, and commodity exchange 
operations, in accordance with this Statute. 
  The export (transfer or exchange) of dual-purpose goods and 
services included on the List is effected only under one-time 
licenses issued by the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations of 
the Russian Federation. 
  The issuing of a license is based on a conclusion of the 
Commission for Export Control of the Russian Federation under 
the Government of the Russian Federation on the possibility of 
exporting (transferring or exchanging) dual-purpose goods or 
services. 
  A conclusion from the Commission on Export Control of the 
Government of the Russian Federation under the Ministry of 
Economics of the Russian Federation (Russia's Export Control) on 
the possibility of exporting (transferring or exchanging) 
dual-purpose goods or services constitutes the basis for issuing 
a license. 
  The following are submitted for obtaining a conclusion in 
the 
Ministry of Economics of the Russian Federation (export control 
department): A request for the issue of a licence drawn up in 
accordance with the requirements established by the Ministry of 
Foreign Economic Relations of the Russian Federation; a copy of 
the contract; a copy of the agreement between the Russian 
producers and the exporter (when the export of the good or 
service is being effected through a middleman); the originals of 
documents describing the obligations of the importer (if they 
are not contained in the contract text) and the state agency of 
the importing nation as specified in points 3 and 4 of this 
Statute. 
  A conclusion on the possibility of export is valid for a 
period of no more than 20 days following the receipt of said 
documents. The conclusion is sent by the Ministry of Economics 
of the Russian Federation (the export control department) to the 
Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations of the Russian Federation 
and the requester. 
  The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations of the Russian 
Federation sends information (in a coordinated form) on licenses 
based on conclusions of Russia's Export Control to the Ministry 
of Economics of the Russian Federation (export control 
department). 
  Permission to reexport is issued to Russian exporters based 
on a conclusion of Russia's Export Control on the possibility of 
reexporting. For this purpose the Russian exporter submits to 
the Ministry of Economics of the Russian Federation (the export 
control department) certified copies of the contract between the 
foreign importer and a third person containing the obligations 
stemming from the contract and drawn up in the authorized state 
agency of the country of the third person in the form of an 
import certificate or other document specified by its national 
legislation. 
  6. The temporary withdrawal beyond the borders of the 
Russian 
Federation of equipment (products), processed materials, 
technology, scientific and technical information contained on 
the List for showing at exhibits and fairs and for advertising 
purposes may be effected without a license based on conclusions 
of Russia's Export Control. 
  In order to acquire a conclusion on the possibility of 
temporary removal a request is submitted to the Ministry of 
Economics of the Russian Federation (export control department) 
containing the name of the item of export (indicating the TN VED 
[not further identified] code) and the quantity, the purpose of 
the removal and the way in which the object is to be used; the 
name of the exhibition (or fair); locations where the object 
will be used, periods during which the object removed will be 
kept abroad; name and address of Russian organization effecting 
the export; foreign contracting parties; the name of the customs 
agency which will draw up the customs forms on the object; and 
also the obligations of the Russian organization removing and 
returning the item. 
  A conclusion on the possibility of temporary removal is 
issued within a 20-day period following the receipt of said 
documents. The conclusion is sent by the Ministry of Economics 
of the Russian Federation (the export control department) to the 
requester for submission to the customs agency indicated in the 
conclusion. A copy of the conclusion is sent to the State 
Customs Committee of the Russian Federation. 
  7. The removal of processed materials (items), equipment or 
technology containing information which is a state secret is 
effected in accordance with the Law of the Russian Federation 
"On State Secrets." 
  8. Customs documents must be drawn up by the established 
procedure on dual-purpose goods and services included on the 
List which are moved outside the borders of the Russian 
Federation. 
  The exporter submits the license obtained to the customs 
agencies, which serves as the basis for allowing the items to 
leave the borders of the Russian Federation. 
  In the case of temporary removal outside the borders of the 
Russian Federation of equipment (items), processed materials, 
technology, scientific and technical information included on the 
List for display at exhibitions and fairs and for advertising 
purposes, the customs agencies are provided with the conclusion 
of Russia's Export Control on the possibility of their temporary 
removal. 
  The State Customs Committee of the Russian Federation 
submits 
(in coordinated form) to the Ministry of Economics of the 
Russian Federation (export control department) information on 
the removal outside the borders of the Russian Federation of 
dual-purpose goods and services for which the conclusions and 
licenses indicated in points 5 and 6 of this Statute have been 
issued. 
  9. Persons exporting dual-purpose goods or services on which 
special export controls have been established in violation of 
the procedure specified by this Statute bear liability in 
accordance with legislation of the Russian Federation.

<F P=106> [Article by Vitaliy Tsygichko, professor, doctor of </F>
technical sciences, under rubric "Analysis": "What Kind of Army 
Do We Need?: On the Political Content of Russian Military 
Doctrine"] 
  [Text] The country's Armed Forces are a very 
important tool of national security, and so the most acute 
question at the current stage of creating a new Russian Army is 
what kind of army this should be, from whom and how it should 
defend us, what its goals and missions must be for the near and 
far term, and in what direction structural perestroyka of the 
Armed Forces will be accomplished in accordance with their new 
missions. 
  These questions must be answered by Russian military 
doctrine, the publication of which has been awaited impatiently 
both in Russia as well as abroad. The doctrine finally has been 
published and a broad discussion and interpretation of it is 
under way in the West, but this document's publication 
essentially has gone unnoticed by the mass media in our country. 
The article by Igor Serebryakov (NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, 8 February 
1994) is an exception. 
  Inasmuch as Russian military doctrine is a reflection of our 
state's overall national goals and policy, then the new military 
policy of the United States and NATO, which is in the stage of 
formation, also will be built in accordance with this document. 
  An analysis of debates being conducted in NATO and the 
United 
States on the fundamentals of future military policy attests 
that a rather fierce struggle is going on between proponents of 
a policy from a position of strength, who stubbornly refuse to 
see the realities of the changed world on the assumption that 
the cold war has not yet ended, and proponents of an alliance 
with Russia as a future partner of the West that is extremely 
important politically, economically and militarily. 
  Depending on its content, Russian military doctrine can 
substantially reinforce the position of one side and largely 
determine the West's long-range economic and military policy 
toward Russia. 
  A very important foreign policy function of military 
doctrine 
is to create a new democratic image of Russia as a state 
friendly toward former ideological enemies and with common 
interests in maintaining international stability and peace. The 
doctrine's political content, which spells out the state's 
long-range strategy in the national security area, acts as 
practical confirmation of the country's proclaimed political 
course. 
  Of no less importance is military doctrine's internal state 
function, called upon to formulate principles and priorities in 
the building and functioning of the state's military system and 
to substantiate long-range military organizational development 
strategy, which takes into account real threats to the country's 
security and its economic capabilities. 
  Igor Serebryakov's analysis indicates that the published 
doctrine fulfills neither a foreign policy function nor an 
internal state function. It is difficult to disagree with this 
inasmuch as the doctrine does not answer to the substance of a 
single one of the questions posed above. 
  Let us refer to the political content of the military 
doctrine. 
  In the traditional understanding of this term, it is absent 
in the submitted text of the doctrine. The document proclaims 
only some very general principles of state military policy 
irrespective of any kind of analysis of the real geopolitical 
situation and its development trends. Russia's place and 
interests in the new multipolar world are not considered; its 
attitude and long-range policy with respect to the former main 
enemy, the United States and NATO, are not defined; and the 
possibility of building collective security systems and of 
Russia's place in them is not evaluated. Without such an 
analysis, it is naturally impossible to indicate real and 
potential allies and enemies, predict threats and determine 
their directions and nature. All this means that there is no 
basis for developing fundamental doctrinal provisions such as an 
evaluation of theaters of possible wars and their presumed 
nature, likely forms and methods of warfare, possible 
participants of a conflict, and other provisions determining the 
real content of military policy and military organizational 
development as guides to practical activity in the national 
security area. Without these fundamental elements of military 
doctrine, the document that was submitted turned into a 
political declaration that is empty, but unfortunately far from 
safe for the country's interests. 
  The basic reason for the absence of a specific political 
content of the military doctrine unquestionably is the fact that 
until now there has been no document spelling out the country's 
long-range foreign policy course. This is connected above all 
with the absence of a legislatively incorporated Russian 
political doctrine reflecting the world and political outlook of 
the new state authority and its views on certain trends in world 
development and Russia's place in this process. 
  Military organizational development is a lengthy, sluggish 
and very costly process which cannot be oriented toward 
momentary interests of authorities and transient internal and 
external factors. In this context the authors' statement that 
this doctrine is a document for the transition period appears 
groundless at the very least. Provisions contained in doctrine 
are realized over decades, and so they must be based on a well 
grounded, long-range strategy comprising the foundation of state 
activity in the domestic and foreign policy area. 
  I am far from thinking that the military doctrine's 
developers do not realize everything said above. It is quite 
obvious that this document is strictly opportunistic and certain 
circles are using it in an attempt above all to incorporate a 
new domestic political function of the Armed Forces, i.e., that 
role which they played in the national tragedy of 3-4 October of 
last year. Another task is to obtain maximum possible funds and 
the freedom of choosing directions of military organizational 
development in the corporate interests of the military 
establishment. 
  The new military doctrine evoked bewilderment and great 
cauton abroad, because of its vagueness. Many western experts 
interpret the lack of desire to express oneself clearly 
concerning relations with NATO, the United States, Japan and 
other power centers and the absence of clearly formulated 
military policy priorities in the doctrine as an attempt to 
conceal its true goals and intentions. 
  The change in Russia's nuclear policy causes alarm. The 
principle of non-first use of nuclear weapons in any possible 
military conflict as proclaimed in the previous doctrine was 
replaced by a provision envisaging the possibility of delivering 
a preventive nuclear strike. This is perceived as a challenge 
and a veiled threat to the West. There is no doubt that the 
published document reinforces mistrust of the foreign policy 
course officially proclaimed by Russia and provides weighty 
arguments for our ill-wishers. 
  The circumstance that the military doctrine is equally 
suitable both for democrat Yeltsin and for extreme right 
nationalist Zhirinovskiy also causes concern. There is no trace 
of any kind of political orientation in it, and it would be 
naive to assume this is by chance. Legislative incorporation of 
the possibility of Army intervention in the country's internal 
affairs makes it a very important foreign policy factor that is 
potentially dangerous for incipient Russian democracy. The West 
sees this circumstance as evidence of political instability in 
the country and a result of the uncertainty of Russia's foreign 
policy course, which in itself represents a danger. 
  During the cold war years a persistent defensist mentality, 
presuming the presence of a constant danger of enemy attack, 
formed both in Russia and the West. When the ideological 
confrontation ended, the military both here in Russia and in the 
West began seeking new threats and is attempting to reanimate 
old ones. 
  The theory of multilateral strategic balance arose and now 
is 
being actively developed on this basis. That very same 
confrontation and the supposition that the one who has a 
military advantage can use military force to achieve its 
interests is the basis of this theory. The question of the 
substance of these interests and reasons for the possible 
appearance of contradictions which may lead to a wide-scale 
military clash or to world war is carefully avoided. 
  The presence of several opposing alliances or countries is 
presumed instead of the bilateral rivalry which faded into the 
past. Within the framework of such a model, each side naturally 
attempts to change the balance of forces in its own favor for 
purposes of greater security, chiefly by increasing military 
might, i.e., with the help of that very same arms race. 
  In other words, the new strategic stability model preserves 
old approaches inherent to the cold war period and again 
proposes a balance of power as a guarantee of security. Such a 
multilateral strategic balance model became the basis of 
Russia's new military doctrine, although it is quite obvious 
that this approach clearly contradicts the geopolitical 
situation which has been forming since the USSR's disintegration 
and contradicts the political course of the majority of states 
(including Russia), which proclaimed an aspiration for creating 
a collective security system based on cooperation, not 
confrontation in the military area. 
  In my opinion, a fundamentally new document should be 
developed in place of the published text of military doctrine, 
free of the deficiencies examined above and unequivocally 
spelling out the strategy for ensuring Russia's national 
security and specific directions for military organizational 
development. 
  Above all, the doctrine's political content should be 
developed not in private, as has been the case up to now, but 
publicly, with the involvement of a wide circle of specialists 
and the interested public. It should register clearly the aim of 
military cooperation with the West as the general goal and 
long-range orientation of Russian military policy. It must be 
realized that Russia's general line toward integration into the 
world market economy cannot be implemented without striving for 
cooperation with the West in the military area. 
  This fundamental provision must steer the doctrine from a 
mythical danger on the part of the West to the real threats and 
possibly future threats to Russia's national interests and to 
its citizens. Today the main threat stems from political 
instability on former USSR territory and from militant 
nationalism and separatism. One also cannot forget the potential 
threat to our country in Asia and about protection of Russian 
interests in the Far East. 
  Russia's entry into the world economic community makes it a 
natural ally of the West in the defense of common interests, but 
this by no means signifies that Russia does not have its own 
national interests, which may not coincide with or may 
contradict those of other countries or blocs. As a great 
Euro-Asiatic power, Russia represents an important part of the 
world balance of forces, which ensures consideration of national 
and regional interests in a multipolar world. Russia's basic 
line toward friendly relations of partnership with the United 
States and NATO in the military-political and military-technical 
area and their joint actions in defense of common interests must 
not contradict the independence and interests of the Russian 
center of power. Russia's military might should give it not only 
a guarantee of security, but also conditions for equal 
participation in world affairs and an opportunity to defend its 
own national interests. The new military doctrine should take 
full account of a reasonable balance between common interests 
with the West and Russia's own interests. The question of the 
rational degree of Russia's military integration with the West, 
which meets the country's national interests and geopolitical 
status, also must be resolved in accordance with this balance. 
  Possible ways of building a collective security system with 
consideration of today's realities should be formulated from 
this standpoint. The Russian Army's place and sphere of possible 
responsibility in this system and a realistic program for 
adjusting military cooperation with former enemies, leading step 
by step to guaranteed mutual security, must be stated. 
  An aspect of military doctrine such as excluding Army 
influence on society's political life and turning it into a 
guarantor of internal stability and a reliable tool for 
protecting the democratic state system from external threat also 
is extremely urgent. 
  The possibility of Army intervention in the country's 
internal affairs should be excluded legislatively, and this 
provision should be reinforced by socioeconomic conditions of 
the Armed Forces existence. Restoring the Army's worthy position 
in Russian society is a very important means of accomplishing 
this priority task. No Russian democratic statehood will succeed 
in being built without this. In all times and eras, only when a 
good material situation was provided for officers and men was 
the Army a reliable support for state authority and did not 
intervene in politics. 
  If this condition is not fulfilled, if officers and men drag 
out a miserable existence and regular personnel are not sure of 
their future, which is not secured materially, then the Army is 
quickly politicized, turning into a dangerous political force 
inclined to support those who promise to improve its situation. 
Leaders of antidemocratic forces understand this full well and 
are taking advantage of the situation at hand for their 
political goals. They unfolded broad, pseudopatriotic propaganda 
for returning the status of a great military power to Russia, 
for a special antiwestern path of Russian development, and for a 
totalitarian, postcommunist form of state government capable of 
returning the past importance and social prestige to the Army. 
On the right flank of this movement stand such odious political 
figures as Zhirinovskiy, whose totalitarian ideas have support 
in the Army and in a considerable portion of the population. 
  The situation at hand is leading to the Army's moral decay 
and to a drop in discipline, reliability and combat 
effectiveness of troops. The best young officers are leaving the 
Army, which unquestionably will affect its future. There is no 
moral-political unity in the Army itself, nor can there be under 
the conditions at hand. Officer meetings have turned into 
political clubs, which contradicts the very essence of Army life 
and creates the real danger of Army intervention in politics. 
The deepening economic crisis and deterioration in the material 
situation of regular Army personnel objectively contribute to a 
growth in the number of proponents of rightist forces in its 
ranks. Doctrinal provisions allowing Army intervention in 
domestic political processes only exacerbate trends dangerous 
for our fragile democracy. 
  A return to a totalitarian form of government invariably 
will 
lead to reanimation of ideological confrontation with the West 
and to a new cold war. Russia's path to integration into the 
world economic community will be closed for a long time and a 
real danger of war will reappear. 
  Under conditions of international economic isolation there 
can be no mention of any kind of transition to a market economy, 
inasmuch as, rephrasing the familiar clich&eacute; of Soviet 
propaganda, it is impossible to build capitalism in one 
individual country. It is quite obvious that such a prospect 
contradicts fundamental and most important national interests of 
the country and its citizens. 
  Under conditions of the economic crisis being experienced by 
the country and the rigid limitation of military expenditures 
connected with it, the most advisable way to preserve well 
supplied, combat effective Armed Forces dedicated to the regime 
is above all their sharp reduction to a level ensuring the most 
necessary security needs: security of borders, maintenance of 
combat readiness of minimum strategic nuclear forces, 
preservation of the necessary nucleus of branches of the Armed 
Forces, and creation of small rapid reaction forces based on the 
most combat effective formations of ground troops. In the 
military-political situation at hand, Russia can fully perform 
missions of defense by having an Army of no more than one 
million persons. A new system of the country's mobilization 
preparation should serve as a guarantee of security under 
conditions of a sharp reduction in the Armed Forces. 
  The new military doctrine could incorporate the proposed 
numerical strength of the Armed Forces as one of the goals of 
military reform and thereby facilitate a solution both to 
political and economic problems of the country. 
  A radical reduction in the Army is a complex, lengthy, 
painful process engendering a multitude of social problems. 
Great material expenditures, connected above all with provision 
of housing, pay and work to the officers and warrant officers 
being discharged, are needed to resolve these problems. But 
these are necessary social costs which must be undertaken for 
the sake of preserving political stability and future economic 
advantages of military reform. If the government and parliament 
will not undertake these expenditures, they may lose control 
over processes occurring in the Army, and this can have 
catastrophic political consequences. 
  The problem of manpower acquisition also will disappear with 
a reduction in the Army, when it will be possible to call up 
only literate, cultured young people wishing to serve in the 
Armed Forces. 
  A small Russian Army will be fully capable of beginning a 
gradual transition to professional principles of manpower 
acquisition on a contract basis, which will permit a 
considerable increase in its combat capabilities, political 
attitude and morale. 
  Such an Army will be a reliable support for Russia's 
democratic statehood and will be capable of reliably protecting 
the country's interests.

  [Text] I remember that in 1991 Marshal Akhromeyev, 
chief of the General Staff, stated that there were 1,939 
generals for the 3.8 million servicemen in the USSR Army. How 
many generals are there in today's Russian Army and the 
countries of the CIS? 
  [Signed] A. Lesovets, Vorkuta 
  After August 1991, the Russian Federation Army was rapidly 
reduced in size, and by April 1993 its numbers constituted 
approximately 2.3 million, but the number of generals had grown 
to 2,218. Just prior to last year's referendum the president 
conferred the rank of general on 256 officers. As of today, 
judging by figures that have appeared in the press and that have 
not as yet been refuted by the Ministry of Defense, there 
are approximately 2,500 generals or one general per 720 
servicemen for 1.8 million servicemen in the Russian Army. 
  There are problems with the surfeit of generals in other 
armies of the CIS also. Thus Georgia, for example, has been 
forced to increase the length of service between ranks to three 
years for junior officers and to five years for senior officers. 
The same trend has emerged in the Ukrainian Army, where, despite 
an appreciable reduction in troops, the number of generals has 
tripled. 
  For comparison: The U.S. Army has approximately 1,250 
generals, that is, one general per 1,500 servicemen (not 
counting the reserve). 
  There were 80 more generals in the Russian Army by the 
time of the May holidays....

<F P=106> [Unnatributed article: "Nine Questions for the Russian </F>
President's Team"] 
  [Text] Last week's publication of a document proposing the 
creation of military bases on the soil of the Russsian 
Federation, the CIS member countries, and Latvia leaves a number 
of questions unanswered. 
  1. How could the document be passed from the RF Ministry of 
Defense to the president's administration, if Minister of 
Defense Pavel Grachev knew nothing about it? 
  2. Why is it mentioned in the document that the MID 
[Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs] is informed of the initiative, while this 
ministry in reality had no knowledge of it whatsoever? Why did 
the document, (which is directly concerned with foreign policy), 
not receive the stamp of approval by the very ministry involved 
with foreign policy? 
  3. How is it that, in the president's administration, the 
document bypassed the people who are directly involved with 
coordinating Russia's foreign policy actions and who are 
responsible for the president maintaining communication with the 
MID and RF MO [Ministry of Defense]? It would definitely appear 
that they should be informed of all initiatives associated with 
these ministries. 
  4. Why indeed did the president, who is informed of the 
progress made in the talks being held between Russia and Latvia, 
sign the document? 
  5. Why is it that the document (the text is not an issue 
here), in which the RF MID and the MO were to merely hold the 
attendant TALKS with the CIS member countries and Latvia, did 
not bear the secret security classification? 
  6. How did the document fall into the hands of ITAR-TASS? 
  7. The failure to coordinate the actions taken by the MO, 
MID, and president's administration became an object of scrutiny 
by the press twice in 10 days (counting as the first time the 
changing of the day of signing of the Partnership for Peace), 
smacking of a scandal. What is this? Deep political differences 
which cannot be kept hidden, or is it bureaucratic confusion 
carried to absurdity? 
  8. Who (other than the Ministry of Defense clerk who 
included 
Latvia in the list of states on whose territory it is proposed 
to create Russian military bases) will be held responsible for 
what has happened? It must be realized that the scandal not only 
reinforces the world's thinking that Russia's foreign and 
domestic policy is unpredictable, but it also exerts a direct 
influence on the political, economic, and social conditions 
attending the Russian-speaking minority residing in the Baltics. 
  9. Can it be guaranteed that the same thing will not occur 
in 
the future? 
  Any citizen of Russia can and does ask himself the above 
questions. And if it so happens that an "explanation via 
diplomatic channels" satisfies Riga, this would definitely be 
insufficient as far as the Russian public is concerned.

"Reflections": "Russia-USSR-CIS-What Else?"] 
  [Text] Russia, and not just Russia, but practically all 
states located on one-sixth of dry land, now are experiencing 
the drama and tragedy of another transition period. 
  This is the second transition period in the 20th century. 
The 
first, which began with the revolution of 1917, ended in 
December 1922 with the transformation of Russia into the Soviet 
Union. With the Union's creation, a delayed-action mine was laid 
beneath its foundations in the form of the disparity between 
form and content and specifically between the declared equality 
of all peoples (with nations' right to self-determination right 
up to separation) and the state's totalitarian essence. 
  Such a disparity doomed the USSR either to lifelong, 
hopeless 
totalitarianism or to future reform. Reforms did not promise to 
be smooth, but the shocks which befell us proved excessively 
painful. These shocks were caused not by democratization, 
glasnost and pluralism in themselves, but by the fact that they 
developed with a hint of our boundlessness, irresponsibility, 
recklessness, the populism of politicians, and the 
indiscriminate fault-finding with everything. The absence of a 
proper legislative and legal base gave these phenomena an 
uncontrollability and at times even an absurdity. 
  Union leadership proved unready for such a development of 
events and attempted to solve the new problems by old methods, 
aiming both to acquire capital and maintain innocence, as they 
say. That is how the events in Tbilisi, Baku and Vilnius became 
real facts. At the same time, the Union leadership was 
encouraging claims of components at a lower level (autonomies) 
to their own sovereignty and independence (South Osetia, 
Abkhazia, the Dniester region, Gagauzia and so on), which 
whipped up the process of reckless sovereignization even more. 
  With great difficulty the center finally found an algorithm 
for solving the problem, a new Union treaty, which seemed to 
suit the majority of republics more or less. In my view, 
unjustified sluggishness was allowed in realizing this plan. 
Nevertheless, society as a whole was ready for legitimization of 
a fundamentally new Union by 20 August 1991. But this event was 
not destined to come about, since on 19 August we all became 
witnesses, and many also participants, of quite different events. 
  I believe that this date (19 August) became a unique point 
of 
reference for the next transition period in our history. It was 
after the August "flatulence" that many components of the USSR 
lost faith in the center's declarations and interest in its 
initiatives. 
  Some did so because of the center's inability to solve the 
problems which had come to a head in a civilized manner. Others 
felt they would be able to get by without such a center. All 
attempts to reanimate the Novo-Ogarevskiy process after August 
1991 failed. Many problems hung in the air and a general crisis 
was imminent. 
  Society naturally could not be in a state of uncertainty for 
long. It always needs supports--legal, organizational, moral. 
The Belovezh agreement on establishing the CIS, developed in 
Alma-Ata, became one such rather unstable and far from perfect 
support. It can be viewed as a landmark in the new transition 
period. 
  The imperfection of the CIS model lies in the fact that on 
the one hand it took into account existing realities, and on the 
other hand it left many questions unresolved. In other words, a 
new form of mutual relationship of states seemingly had been 
found, but there was no substance. A painful search for it 
continues to this day. Life was supposed to have become 
considerably better for people in the CIS than in the USSR. The 
importance and nobility of this task are obvious; the difficulty 
of its accomplishment also is obvious. How is it to be fulfilled? 
  Above all, don't hurry. Don't pull down everything to the 
foundations. Don't turn an evolutionary process into a 
revolutionary one. And most important, don't forget just what 
the CIS is--a zigzag of history or a historical necessity. 
  I consider it more important, advisable and necessary to 
engage in perfecting the form and content both of the 
Commonwealth itself as well as of the cooperation of peoples in 
it--without arrogance, without extremes, without shocks. And 
these steps must be taken above all by those who initiated and 
legitimized that which we have today. Now we are experiencing a 
dramatic moment in the struggle between national consciousness 
of former components of the USSR on the one hand, oppressed in 
the past and now hypertrophied, and collapsing imperial 
ambitions on the other. 
  Certain states go to the point of absurdity in their 
aspirations for absolute sovereignty. If it is a fuel crisis, it 
is their own; if it is hunger, it is sovereign; if it is 
currency, then it is whatever you like, just not Russian, and so 
on. The impression is created that our fully revved up 
independent states, not having a clue as to what conditions 
there will be at the destination, have made a dash toward the 
point of no return. The important thing was to cross it. 
  As I see it, the reasons for this lie in the fact that a 
certain portion of leaders of sovereign states are prisoners of 
the ambitions of small groups of people of a certain leaning who 
adjure that absolute sovereignty is a panacea for all 
troubles--economic, political and social. 
  Things have reached the point where politicians declaiming 
for closer integration into the CIS fear to speak loudly about 
their aspirations, since they will be tagged without delay as 
traitors to national interests by nationalists of all colors and 
hues, who obviously never are to understand that the main reason 
for an economic slump lies specifically in a severance of ties 
between states and peoples. 
  I never will forget a television report from Kharkov, when 
one elderly man was asked: "How's life?" He responded: "There is 
nothing to eat here, and they are making missiles." All the 
unpretentious wisdom of our people is contained in this. 
  A foreign journalist compared the USSR with a large swimming 
pool. Formation of the CIS divided this pool with bars: The 
water in it is common, but swimming is restricted. Further 
disintegration may lead to where the CIS will have to be 
compared with a large preserve in which each inhabitant will 
have his own absolutely independent cage. It is difficult to 
give recommendations and advice in our time, but why pull down 
that which is not falling in, break what is not breaking, or 
tear up what is not tearing, and specifically our age-old 
spiritual ties, our habits, our way of thinking and life? 
  Some state figures evidently are indifferent to the fate of 
those who are not finding their place on the expanses of the CIS 
today and of those who will live after them. But in spite of 
everything, one-sixth of the earth will survive; it is obligated 
to survive. It will take its worthy place in the universe. 
  If we gaze beyond the year 2000, it is not hard to see the 
following power centers in the future world: 

  -  North American continent; 
  -  Western Europe; 
  -  Japan and 
China; 
  -  the Muslim world. 


    With a weak Russia or CIS, the aforementioned power centers 
naturally may direct their interests here. But in view of the 
enormity of expanses (Catherine II contended that Russia is the 
universe) and the unreceptiveness of our peoples to various 
kinds of diktat of foreigners, a weak Russia, like a gigantic 
crater, will be capable of swallowing up all these power centers 
along with their interests. Herein lies the strength of a weak 
Russia. Thus, the danger of Russia to the world lies in its 
weakness. 
  Conversely, a strong Russia together with other CIS states 
is 
capable of serving as a unique balance, equalizing the universe 
and safeguarding it from ruin. Herein lies the strength and 
security of a strong Russia. 
  Russia is a bridge between East and West. It will remain a 
house for many peoples who rested against it and bowed down 
before it. Herein lies their fate and Russia's. It will continue 
to be the keeper of world peace and the security of peoples who 
populate the Commonwealth. 
  Being the largest element in a disintegrating but still 
functioning system, it keeps others afloat like a pontoon 
bridge--some by grain, some by timber, others by oil and natural 
gas, and still others by the ruble, but each and every one by 
hope. 
  By the very fact of its unsinkability, Russia is capable 
also 
of pulling out others, who, not being able to swim on their own 
and clinging to each other, most will likely drown if they 
become uncoupled from Russia. 
  It is of course possible to catch hold of someone else, but 
what will be the payment for help? 
  New market-dollar relations are formed relatively easily, 
but 
there is that which does not lend itself to recarving. It is 
spiritual space, which never was replaced by force and gold. The 
new helpers of course may offer a hand, but they will not pull 
you out. It is advantageous for them to keep everyone 
semisubmerged. 
  In my view, the disintegration of Russia is the most 
dangerous among other negative phenomena. Here too one sees the 
boundless desire of certain components to cross the point of no 
return as speedily as possible in general confusion. 
  Not only the autonomies, but also the krays, the oblasts, 
and 
even the cities have begun speaking of their sovereignty. It is 
easy to imagine that as soon as federation components begin to 
be called states, they immediately will be tempted to acquire 
all state attributes--army, currency, foreign policy, customs 
and so on. 
  It is difficult to answer this question, but it can be 
asserted that Russia will not survive its own CIS, or whatever 
it will be called there--it will turn into a kind of "black 
hole" which will swallow up the Russian state, natural 
resources, and possibly also peoples. New conquerors with old 
schemes will rush here, and we or our descendants will be forced 
to begin everything from the beginning, if we do not lose 
vitality. 
  The simplest, most tested method of stopping this element of 
disintegration is to stand everyone up at attention; whoever 
does not obey, "sort it out" and punish them. But this already 
has occurred. The present time, I am sure, will give birth to 
politicians capable of solving the most difficult and tangled 
problems by peaceful means alone. They will serve as a worthy 
counterweight to those who, having become accustomed to the 
smell of powder and blood today and having lost all faith in any 
authority, raise up their peoples with frenzy and doom for a 
struggle in "hotspots." 
  The most worthy way out of the situation at hand in Russia 
appears to be one in which a federal center and components of 
the federation accommodate each other. On this path some are 
obligated to cast off the armor of hegemonism and chauvinism, 
and others the armor of separatism and nationalism. But these 
cast-off "isms" should not be viewed as losses on the 
battlefield. Most likely this is harmful ballast needed by no 
one and restricting maneuver; having gotten rid of it, both will 
acquire confidence and mutual trust. 
  Simultaneously with this, it is necessary to work out a 
legislative and legal base together on key problems of our 
existence, coordinated to the maximum and acceptable to the 
components. 
  The common legislative and legal base in turn must not level 
out the morals, customs, traditions and other national features 
of federation components. These laws, common for all, must 
preclude such phenomena as, for example, establishment of an age 
qualification for the marriage of young people; an instruction, 
let's say, about what memorable dates to celebrate in federation 
components, except statewide ones; establishment of movie ticket 
prices, and so on. In other words, in the many-sided process of 
creating a new federalism, it is necessary to single out the 
general and the special. The general unites the center, the 
special is regulated locally. The general makes our society 
monolithic, and the special makes it flexible. 
  By virtue of originality, multinationality, and other purely 
Russian features, our future social and state system should not 
be driven artificially into the framework of American, British, 
Swedish, Japanese and other systems of regulating life, no 
matter how attractive and civilized they may seem to us. 
  Naturally, we must study and take in the experience of 
others, but today we are obliged to display our civilized nature 
above all in the ability to cover this most difficult transition 
period in our history without a scuffle, without blood, without 
tears and sufferings of the people, for the good of our children 
and grandchildren, who must live neither in a large cage nor in 
small ones. 
  We can and are obligated to create such a moral, legal, 
sociopolitical, economic and intellectual climate in Russia that 
many peoples, and not just of the CIS, would consider themselves 
lucky to live in it.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Vengerovskiy, a leader of the </F>
LDPR and deputy chairman of the State Duma, by Leonard Nikishin: 
"The Red Horse Is Swimming in `Dead Water': Zhirinovskiy's Team 
Is Raising the Stakes"] 
  [Text] In speaking of the Liberal-Democratic Party of 
Russia [LDPR], hardly anyone has in mind anything bigger than 
the figure of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. Meanwhile, the party of 
many millions that was successful in the elections for the State 
Duma has its own elite and its own "politburo," in a manner of 
speaking. True, this is almost unnoticeable in the shadow of the 
loquacious leader. What kind of people are they? Who is behind 
them? What do they want and do they fully share the views of 
Vladimir Volfovich? In part one can obtain answers to these 
questions from the conversation of the reviewer of OBSHCHAYA 
GAZETA, Leonard Nikishin, with Aleksandr Vengerosvksiy, one of 
the leaders of the LDPR and deputy chairman of the State 
Duma. 
  A regular officer and colonel in the Soviet Army, until 
recently he worked in one of the analytical centers of the 
Ministry of Defense. They also knew him in the GRU and in the 
Military-Industrial Commission. This predetermined the basic 
theme of the conversation: The fate of the domestic 
military-industrial complex and questions with respect to 
conversion of the defense industry. And although the 
conversation seemingly touched only on economic and production 
themes, one could not fail to notice that the statements of Mr. 
Vengerovskiy involved quite definite political approaches 
showing that the economy always serves politics. 
  [Nikishin] In the past, you dealt with defense.... 
  [Vengerovskiy] At present as well. As long as there is 
something to defend. 
  [Nikishin] You probably have your own approach to the 
problems in the conversion of defense branches. Do your views 
coincide with Zhirinovskiy's approach? After all, he declares 
that it is not necessary to carry out any conversion, that our 
military-industrial complex must work at full capacity. And 
where, if you please, will its output go? 
  [Vengerovskiy] We presently have about 5 million people 
employed in the military-industrial sphere. If you take them 
along with their families and the infrastructures that in one 
way or another are working for the military-industrial complex, 
then it is 15 million people. On the other hand, if you look at 
Russia's export sphere, then 1 kilogram of a military aircraft 
is worth $3,000, whereas for a civilian aircraft it is worth 
$1,000. And raw materials now being exported are worth about 20 
cents per kilogram. It is worthwhile to think about these 15 
million people: Will they be full-value citizens and live 
normally or will they form an explosive social medium? 
  The process that we call conversion was originally 
incorrect, 
because it was based on the illusion that Russia is surrounded 
only by allies and friends and that they are waiting for her 
with open arms as a beloved member of the world community. 
  [Nikishin] But there are calculations and forecasts on how 
much military output can be absorbed by the external market. We 
will simply be choked by exports of this kind and we will not 
ensure any prosperity for the people. 
  [Vengerovskiy] I want to remind you that just six years ago 
the USSR was second in the world in the export of arms. 
  [Nikishin] Of which a large share was given to various 
friends of ours on credit. 
  [Vengerovskiy] It seems that your information is not very 
correct. To meet the state budget, it was necessary to have not 
only petrodollars, which by that time were already drying up, 
but also other sources of revenue. And I, who worked for many 
years in state structures, know that the revenue came from the 
sale of arms. I know to which markets it went--it was the same 
ones that are prepared even now to take our arms if the state 
will assume a protectionistic position instead of pursuing false 
economic, military, and other doctrines, to which I also include 
"Partnership for Peace." 
  [Nikishin] And do you think that we should do this 
permanently? This is an abnormal structure of the economy. 
  [Vengerovskiy] Then I will come back with this question to 
you: Can the United States permanently produce arms? Despite the 
conversion carried out in the USSR and in Russia, it not only 
has not reduced its own military production but has even 
increased it. They are investing in new military technologies. 
Russia must have a geopolitical task that also includes the 
concept of the production and sale of arms. It must answer the 
question of what comes after this. 
  [Nikishin] Why is the United States not carrying out 
conversion? What, in your opinion, is the closing of the nuclear 
test range in Nevada all about? The weapons that have been 
stockpiled in the world led to just one thing: At some time they 
began to be used. 
  [Vengerovskiy] Yes, I also read Chekhov attentively. The gun 
that was hanging in the first act will certainly be fired in the 
last act. But the present local wars began not because of the 
accumulation of arms but because of the disruption of polarity 
in the world, when the second pole--the USSR--was liquidated. 
You see that the new world order is being established by no 
means with the laurels and doves of peace. Force is always used 
to resolve political questions. Are you trying to say that 
Russia should disarm? And as for Nevada, this is not serious. 
The Americans have already performed all the tests that they 
need. 
  [Nikishin] I am not talking about disarmament at all. But 
why 
should we return to the days of the Cold War, of blocs armed to 
the teeth? Do you see this as a guarantee of our future happy 
life? 
  [Vengerovskiy] No one intends to produce as much armament as 
there was before. We must, in the first place, produce enough 
military-industrial output for today's needs. Secondly, we must 
make weapons that correspond to contemporary warfare. Thirdly, 
we must supply absolutely new army structures with these arms. 
  [Nikishin] At the same time, just as before, other 
structures 
are just as sickly.... 
  [Vengerovskiy] Nothing of the sort. Over the last 30 years, 
the military-industrial complex also produced what we call 
consumer goods. Everything decent that we now have in the area 
of household equipment was, as a rule, a development and product 
of the enterprises of the military-industrial complex. We do not 
have anything better. 
  [Nikishin] One might think that the military-industrial 
complex has inundated us with first-class household appliances. 
Somehow I do not recall seeing such an abundance in our stores. 
But let us return to the basic output of the military-industrial 
complex--weapons. How do you propose that we drive our 
competitors from the arms market? 
  [Vengerovskiy] This requires a policy of state 
protectionism. 
As you know, Japan and America are savage enemies when it comes 
to trade and markets. One has to search for another state like 
ours that freely admits foreign competitors into internal 
markets and abandons its niches in foreign markets. The 
corruption that first completely ate away the structures of the 
Soviet Union and now of Russia led to our departure from the 
traditional arms markets. All of this must now be put back on a 
normal course. 
  In general, if we now take the so-called psychology of "new 
thinking," then it is more advantageous to import all industrial 
products from abroad, drive American cars, and use French 
perfume. And what remains as Russia's share if we are not even 
supposed to build missiles? We consider what happened in Russia 
to be a mistake. We will definitely give back to our state the 
majesty of being a world power and its scientific-technical 
level. 
  [Nikishin] But if this scientific-technical level does not 
lead to an increase in the well-being of the people.... 
  [Vengerovskiy] And you think that the standard of living of 
the people has improved in recent years? 
  [Nikishin] No, but was it really high during the Breshnev 
years, when everything was subjected exclusively to the 
interests of the military-industrial complex? 
  [Vengerovskiy] Can you now afford to buy an apartment, an 
automobile, or even a refrigerator? 
  [Nikishin] No. But this, with the possible exception of the 
refrigerator, is something that I could never afford. 
  [Vengerovskiy] I am very grateful to my country for the fact 
that I received a free education, that I have the chance to live 
in the apartment that they gave me at that time, and that I also 
made all the main purchases in my life at that time. At the 
present time, with my salary of 350,000 rubles as deputy 
chairman of the Duma, I cannot afford such purchases. This is 
possible for people who in the years of perestroyka were able to 
rob the state by destroying it, establish their own private 
capital, and go abroad. It is quite clear who lives well in 
Russia now. 
  But let us return to the problem of the military-industrial 
complex. It is above all the defensive possibility of the state 
to hold back the onslaught of external enemies. As soon as we 
were deprived of it, "the enemies burned down our own hut." And 
you and I are standing on the burned-out site. 
  Gigantic investments are required to convert military 
production. No one will ever provide them. If the state becomes 
delirious and thinks that we are surrounded by nothing but 
friends, then what happens is what happened with the USSR and 
now with Russia. There are no conversion programs in America. I 
have information to support this assertion. On account of my 
activities in the party, I head an intelligence service. With 
the help of plenty of Russian patriots abroad, we have complete 
information about what it happening and where. 
  [Nikishin] You spoke of the new technological level of the 
military-industrial complex. How do you see this? 
  [Vengerovskiy] It is not just the production of arms. Above 
all we must preserve basic science. Brains are always expensive. 
But there will not be any conversion until there is money for 
it. Otherwise this is debauchery. The state order does not exist 
in its previous volume but the state has not insured defense 
enterprises and has not provided any money for their 
reorientation. Give me capital investments for the renewal of 
equipment and machinery and I will be pleased to produce tape 
recorders like Sony does, to make refrigerators like those of 
General Motors, and to build cars better than those of Mercedes. 
But without working capital the plants began to simplify their 
production programs and to make titanium shovels and stoves, 
etc. In the past, we were essentially able to compete with the 
West in all areas of scientific-technical progress. But the 
CPSU, which became completely rotten from the top, let someone 
like Gorbachev come to power who destroyed everything as a 
consequence of his incompetence, to put it mildly. After him 
came an obkom secretary with his thinking. What else can we say? 
Our country deserves intelligent leaders. Professionals came to 
the Liberal-Democratic Party, not theoreticians in playing the 
accordion and not political scientists, who yesterday were 
asserting that communism was not far off. We are practical 
self-made people. And there is no reason to chuckle over 
Zhirinovskiy's book "Last Push to the South." 
  [Nikishin] No, we were not able to stand up to competition 
with the West. The second scientific-technical revolution 
by-passed us. And it did not happen in Gorbachev's time at all 
but much earlier. I do not want to chuckle over "Last Push," for 
this book evokes other feelings. For me there is a great deal 
there that is unacceptable. 
  [Vengerovskiy] Overall I am also not very pleased with it as 
an example of literary creativity. I was educated with other 
literature. But there has not been any fascism in our party, 
there is none, and there will be none. Fascism will appear in 
the country when the petty storekeepers, the so-called 
merchants, who have become accustomed to having a good standard 
of living through speculation, begin to fall into ruin. And this 
will certainly happen. Then they will demand the restoration of 
the status-quo. It is clear what idea is best for this. But this 
time they will not point to the Jews. They have all left. 
  P.S. After the conversation, Aleksandr Vengerovskiy--an 
absolute pragmatist and, in his own words, a practical 
person--gave to the correspondent of OBSHCHAYA GAZETA several 
brochures that apparently are among the favorite reading 
material of the leaders of the LDPR and their flock. One work 
made up of several sections is entitled "Mertvaya voda" [Dead 
Water]. Its authorship belongs to some center or group of 
persons called the "internal predictor." The first part is 
called "Depressurization" and the second part "Inscription." I 
am not going to assess this "catechism" but I will just quote a 
few revelations in it that evoked a sense of dark humor in me. 
  "Reasoning according to AUTHORITY--INTELLECTUAL 
PARASITISM--is the primary quality of the crowd; in it one can 
see the striving of the crowd to live according to prepared 
formulas that are provided by the authorities to which it is 
subject.... The destruction of the AUTHORITY TRADITION 
prevailing in the crowd turns the crowd into rabble.... The 
crowd or rabble may be organized into structures: parliamentary, 
trade-union, party, etc." 
  "Jesus said in the Sermon on the Mount: `Until heaven and 
earth pass not one jot or one tittle will in any way pass from 
the law (of Moses) until all shall be fulfilled.' As is clear 
from the quote from the `Old Testament,' this `all' means the 
global Zionist-Nazi dictatorship, which in terms of Christianity 
is called the `kingdom of God on earth.'" 
  "The revolution was a manifestation of the depletion of the 
reserve of stability in terms of the depth of identity of goal 
vectors as a result of an unstructured closed state through the 
Masonry of the post-Peter `elite' on the supra-Jewish global 
predictor." 
  "I.V. Stalin is the only one of the party `chiefs' about 
whom 
it can be said that his education allowed him to develop his own 
conceptual activity." 
  "I.V. Stalin and some part of the group supporting him that 
came from the people rose in their world view above the broad 
popular masses and the `elite' and attained the quality of 
priesthood [zhRECHEstvo] (life expression [zhizneRECHEniye)." 
  "The leaders of the Third Reich were originally under the 
control of the highest suprastate Zionist Masonry." 
  "It is illegitimate to transfer the parliamentary experience 
of the West to Russia, because parliamentarianism is simply a 
screen over the directive-address system of Masonic mafia 
control." 
  "It is useful to reissue the work of I.V. Stalin, 
`Ekonomischeskiye problemy sotsialisma v SSSR' [Economic 
Problems of Socialism in the USSR] and those who have the 
opportunity should read it and think about it now."

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Yermolin: "Defense Budget, Benefits to </F>
Service Members: View of the State Duma" 
  [Text] On Thursday the Chairman of the Committee of the 
State Duma for Budget, Taxes, Banks and Finances Mikhail 
Zadornov held a press conference whose main topic was the draft 
state budget for 1994. After becoming acquainted with the 
supplied materials, the committee concluded that the draft did 
not allow for the real dynamics of socioeconomic indices of the 
current year. In particular, in January and February the volume 
of production dropped not by 9 percent, as planned, but by 24 
percent. What is more, the draft did not adhere to the 
priorities of economic policy proclaimed in the presidential 
message. And finally, a number of documents, without which the 
Duma members did not think it possible to accept responsibility 
for adopting such a budget, had not been submitted. The 
committee will recommend to the Duma that it take into 
consideration the budget report of the Government of the Russian 
Federation and continue work only after the described 
deficiencies had been corrected. 
  Regarding the defense budget, all factions without exception 
are talking about it today. And in particular the leader of the 
"Vybor Rossii" [Choice of Russia] faction Yegor Gaydar has his 
own opinion about military expenditures. Responding to a 
question from a KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent, he stressed that 
the faction will favor the adoption of that version of the 
defense budget which was submitted today by the government of 
the Russian Federation. As Gaydar stated, "Today in the defense 
budget there are no surface reserves" allowing it to be reduced 
solely at the expense of the Defense Ministry. However, the 
leader of "Vybor Rossii" believes that "a long-term program of 
military reform and long-term program of reductions in the Armed 
Forces is required." In the future, Gaydar sees a reduction in 
military expenditures through structuring of the Armed Forces 
and reduction in military units "which today are undermanned and 
therefore not combat ready." 
  However, Yegor Gaydar's position is not fully shared by his 
colleagues in the faction or by the Chairman of the Defense 
Committee Sergey Yushenkov. He stated to the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA 
correspondent that he would try to obtain ratification of the 
defense budget "at least at the 1993 level." But the present 
proposed level of defense expenditures, as you know, is less 
than last year. 
  The press has stated that a number of ministries are 
insisting on revision of the benefits list for service members. 
In the press service of the Government of the Russian 
Federation, it was reported that at the last session of the 
government, this question was not raised, and it is still not 
known whether the question will be considered next Thursday. 
However, the position of the departments which are forced to pay 
for a number of benefits granted to service members by the RF 
Law "On the Status of Service Members" partially from their own 
pockets has been and remains unchanged: Such benefits should be 
paid from the federal budget. This is understood by all, but the 
"damned question" of money (which apparently the state, it turns 
out, does not have for the adopted law) stirs up public opinion 
and heats up passions. The departments do not want to pay 
benefits to the army at their own expense. The Defense Ministry 
does not have a kopeck for this purpose. The federal budget, 
with which all agree, is not made of rubber either. What is the 
solution? 
  They are searching for it, including in the State Duma. 
Sergey Yushenkov said that the question will be considered at a 
session of the Defense Committee. The Duma members have 
different approaches to the question. Yushenkov himself wants to 
continue seeking implementation of the "benefits" articles of 
the law and ensure their financing with a concrete line in the 
federal budget.

"Meeting in the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation"] 
  [Text] Moscow, 29 Apr--Minister of Defense of the Russian 
Federation Pavel Grachev emphasized a significant congruence of 
the Russian and Israeli military doctrines after talks with 
Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister and minister of defense of Israel. 
The meeting lasted more than an hour. 
  Pavel Grachev noted the importance of comprehensive 
cooperation, including military, between Russia and Israel. Of 
course, he said, after the first meeting we could not examine in 
detail the possibilities that are opening up to us. But there is 
already a mechanism to put these plans into effect: An Israeli 
military attache has begun to operate in Moscow and the staff of 
the Russian military attache in Israel will go to work in Israel 
at the end of April or beginning of May. We will entrust them 
with the elaboration of the corresponding program. As minister 
of defense, our guest asked me to make an official visit to 
Israel and there we will sketch the outline of our future 
bilateral relations in the military area. 
  The prime minister of Israel declared that the Russian 
leadership and above all President of Russia Boris Yeltsin 
assured him of Russia's striving to achieve peace in the Middle 
East. That same striving is something that we share, I. Rabin 
said, although we have different ties and relations with third 
countries. But when the goals are identical, the corresponding 
interests arise, which, I hope, will lead to the successful 
conclusion of Arab-Israeli negotiations.

<F P=106> [Article by Col. Oleg Falichev: "The Main Thing Is Combat </F>
Readiness: Press Conference of the Minister of Defense"] 
  [Text] The Armed Forces of Russia have an anniversary 
on 7 May 1992: It is two years since the beginning of their 
formation. That is enough time to summarize results and to talk 
about problems and prospects. 
  This is really what was discussed at the press 
conference in the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the 
Russian Federation, where Minister of Defense Gen. of the Army 
Pavel Grachev spoke to Russian and foreign journalists. 
  "Two years is truly a short time," he said. "But for 
military 
people these years were extraordinarily filled with doings. In 
this time we realized very clearly the kind of responsibility 
that the army has. For this reason, one of the main results of 
its formation is this: The armed forces are a dependable 
institute of the state and the guarantor of its security. Real 
patriots of the motherland are now serving in the army under 
these difficult circumstances. They serve in accordance with 
their conscience and not for rubles and dollars. The truth is 
this: Whatever difficulties Russia may experience, the armed 
forces will retain their combat capability and will remain 
controllable. I thank the officers, generals, and soldiers for 
this." 
  The main task today, the minister of defense stressed, is to 
support the army and navy at a level of combat readiness that 
quarantees the defense of the state under any conditions. And it 
is being fulfilled. The Strategic Nuclear Forces remain the 
guarantor of the security of Russia. And they will continue to 
be the main means of deterring the unleashing of nuclear war. 
  The process of establishing new force groupings is being 
concluded. The Mobile Forces will play an important role in 
them. Work is now under way in the forces to bring them up to 
prescribed strength. 
  The minister of defense gave a brief assessment of what has 
been done in each branch of the armed forces. He said that the 
mixed principle of manpower acquisition will be retained. In 
1994, for example, it is planned to accept 64,000 men in the 
Ground Forces. And it is planned to have 50 percent of them be 
contract service personnel by 1995. The minister found a 
shortcoming in the fact that we have not yet learned to work 
with this contingent. As a result, about 25 percent of the 
contract people had to be discharged. 
  As for the Air Defense Forces, about whose demise there has 
been much talk, they will remain. It is planned to reorganize 
them into Aerospace Defense Forces. 
  Overall the Minister of Defense had a rather high assessment 
of the combat readiness of the troops. The situation is best in 
the Strategic Missile Forces, Moscow Military District, 
Leningrad Military District, the GRVZ [Group of Russian Troops 
in Transcaucasus], and Leningrad Naval Base. Things are worse in 
the Pacific Fleet. The minister of defense stressed that 
beginning with the summer training period the armed forces will 
put rigid demands on the work. Two years was enough time, he 
said, to eliminate shortcomings and to establish efficient work. 
Among the problems that require a decision at the national 
level, Gen. of the Army Pavel Grachev named the dependable and 
stable financing of the armed forces, their adequate strength 
level, the conclusion of the troop withdrawal, and the provision 
of housing and facilities for the troops in the territory of 
Russia. 
  We will speak in more detail in the next issue about 
the problems raised at the press conference with respect to the 
development of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.

<F P=106> [Interview with Shota Shotovich Chipashvili, Academy of </F>
Natural Sciences corresponding member, State Prize laureate, 
deputy director of Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of 
Problems of Information Science, by Anatoliy Pokrovskiy, date, 
place and occasion not specified: "What Is Behind the `Nuclear 
Briefcase'?"] 
  [Text] This ordinary-looking attache case lately has 
been and is giving rise to many different rumors. It is 
understandable that in troubled times of cardinal changes in 
upper echelons of state authority, all of us would like to be 
sure that neither amateurish decisions, nor absurd chance, nor 
some maniac's evil will will be able to set in motion the 
nuclear ruin of mankind. 
  At one time this "nuclear briefcase" was created for 
our country's supreme leadership, permitting the final decision 
on use of strategic nuclear forces to be kept constantly under 
supreme control. 
  This is where our conversation began with Sh. Sh. 
Chipashvili, Academy of Natural Sciences corresponding member, 
State Prize laureate, deputy director of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences Institute of Problems of Information Science. 
  [Chipashvili] Of course, public interest in the 
"nuclear briefcase" can be understood, and the press also 
constantly "stirs up" this topic. All this is explainable by 
political aspects and the state level of those persons for whom 
the "briefcase" is intended. 
  Doctor of Technical Sciences M. S. Loginov, the head of this 
work who is presently alive and well (he received the Hero of 
Socialist Labor title for it), can tell much of interest about 
the fascinating story of this item's creation and introduction. 
  But from a technical standpoint, this is just a portable 
personal subscriber device, which is a diminutive particle of an 
enormous iceberg--the unified, comprehensive, automated system 
for command and control of the country's entire Armed Forces, 
created under the direction of General Designer Academician 
Vladimir Sergeyevich Semenikhin. 
  [Pokrovskiy] It follows from your words, Shota 
Shotovich, that the public at large knows little about such a 
global program and Academician Semenikhin's role in the 
country's history? 
  [Chipashvili] You are absolutely right, especially 
as the successful solution to this enormous national problem led 
to our country's attainment of strategic military inviolability. 
  One would like to believe that in the final account all 
aspects of this work gradually will find worthy, truthful and 
sufficiently complete coverage in the open press. 
  This is especially important now, when there is 
indiscriminate discrediting and smearing of everything 
previously achieved. This often is done by those who do not have 
a sufficiently realistic impression about much from our past, 
and in the best case have become casually familiar with very 
superficial or inferior information, on the basis of which 
amateurish or opportunistic conclusions and generalizations 
subsequently are made. 
  [Pokrovskiy] Just what is the Armed Forces automated 
command and control system? 
  [Chipashvili] You asked a very difficult question. 
It is impossible to portray the entire problem as a whole in a 
popular manner in a newspaper article, even in general outline. 
  But I am sure you will bring in for cooperation many of 
Academician Semenikhin's companions-in-arms who are now alive 
and well, and the impressive panorama of the solution to an 
enormous national problem gradually will come out in the pages 
of your newspaper. 
  To begin with, let us recall what kind of situation shaped 
up 
for the country's defense capability approximately in the early 
1960's. 
  By this time atomic and hydrogen weapons had been created 
and 
were being upgraded constantly. This entire program is linked 
above all with the name of Academician Igor Vasilyevich 
Kurchatov and the collectives he headed. 
  Diverse means of delivering these weapons (for ground, air 
and sea basing) had been created and were being developed. The 
main program here is connected with the name of Academician 
Sergey Pavlovich Korolev and his collectives. 
  Thus a fundamentally new and at the same time paradoxical 
situation began to form both in our Armed Forces and in the 
armed forces of leading world powers. 
  On the one hand, the stockpiling of enormous arsenals of 
mass 
destruction weapons seemingly was making the powers strong and 
was creating the illusion of an enemy's instantaneous defeat 
with the surprise of being first to attack. 
  On the other hand, the looming threat of a more and more 
powerful enemy surprise first strike was forcing the sides to 
build up nuclear potentials. 
  The potentials of mass destruction weapons grew and the 
military threat to the sides increased. 
  This paradox could be resolved only by completing the 
triad--by creating an automated system for command and control 
of all kinds of strategic weapons which not only ensures 
one-hundred percent probability of a retaliatory strike, but 
also makes it more powerful because of a correction to initial 
plans, i.e., being first to attack becomes tantamount to suicide. 
  This last enormous amount of work was headed up in the final 
account by Academician Semenikhin as General Designer. 
  Initial interpretation of the entire upcoming enormous task 
of creating the Armed Forces automated command and control 
system was accomplished in the mid-1960's under the direction of 
Doctor of Technical Sciences V. V. Konashev, who later became 
Academician Semenikhin's first deputy and closest 
companion-in-arms and a Lenin and State Prize laureate. But all 
necessary preconditions were not yet ripe in the country as of 
that period for beginning wide-scale practical work on such a 
very large Soviet automated command and control system. 
  [Pokrovskiy] But this meant that not only scientific 
and technical problems, but also very complicated organizational 
problems had to be solved... 
  [Chipashvili] Specifically very complicated ones. 
  Fortunately, in those times not everything was as bad as 
certain indiscriminate slanderers of our past now try to 
represent it. 
  I can attest that the party CC Defense Department, the 
Military-Industrial Commission, and heads of all sector 
ministries which had been set in motion directed all this 
enormous, comprehensive work in solving the problem of creating 
the Armed Forces automated command and control system at the 
proper level, on a large scale and in a businesslike manner. 
  In all his posts (both in the party CC and in the Ministry 
of 
Defense), D. F. Ustinov devoted much attention to this problem 
and was its active proponent. 
  The Ministry of the Radio Industry was the leading ministry 
for the problem as a whole and bore full responsibility to the 
country's leadership. Deceased Minister P. S. Pleshakov put much 
of his energy and health into creating the Armed Forces 
automated command and control system, and therefore conferral of 
the Hero of Socialist Labor title on him for this system was a 
deserved assessment of his personal contribution. 
  Directorates subordinate to Marshal of Signal Troops A. I. 
Belov acted as the general client from the Ministry of Defense. 
Broad military, scientific and technical erudition, 
understanding and support of risky new solutions, readiness to 
assume responsibility at any level in the interests of the job, 
a constant desire to become personally familiar in practice with 
results achieved, and all this with precise, businesslike 
exactingness--these personal qualities of Marshal Belov played a 
role of deciding importance in the success of work on the Armed 
Forces automated command and control system. 
  General K. N. Trofimov, Marshal Belov's closest assistant 
and 
a person of profound erudition, great experience and highest 
morals, who was awarded the Hero of Socialist Labor title for 
this work, was a match for the Marshal. Unfortunately, he died 
tragically in a helicopter crash during a flight between Armed 
Forces automated command and control system sites. 
  General Staff Representative General V. P. Shutov, a 
champion 
of new principles of operational work based on modern 
information technologies, who was awarded the State Prize and 
who was an active, creative participant of the work, died with 
him. 
  The military science of command and control took a very 
perceptible quality leap with creation of the Armed Forces 
automated command and control system. The leading scientific 
research institute of the Ministry of Defense, together with 
institutes of branches of the Armed Forces and military 
academies, created new battle management algorithms and 
successfully introduced them in the system. General B. I. 
Strelchenko, chief of the leading institute and a doctor of 
military sciences, was awarded the State Prize. 
  An enormous volume of work was done to construct hardened 
rooms for command and control sites throughout the country's 
territory. This epopee needs a separate narrative. 
  Thousands on thousands of specialists worked far from home 
for many years on the industry's test benches and at Ministry of 
Defense sites. The organization headed by A. V. Myshletsov, who 
was awarded the Lenin Prize, was the leading organization in 
this process. 
  Specialists of different departments, different profiles, 
different ages and different nationalities made up those 
unified, friendly collectives, which were united by a sincere 
desire to successfully realize what had been conceived. 
  There was an enormous number of institutes, design bureaus 
and plants which took part in this work of many years and, by 
the way, in many former republics of the USSR. The memoirs of 
chief designers of branch automated command and control systems 
and of individual unique technical systems and articles will be 
interesting. The most prestigious prizes and high government 
awards were deservedly bestowed on the majority of these 
companions-in-arms of Academician Semenikhin. 
  The Council of Chief Designers, which included the immediate 
scientific-technical and organizational directors of all 
functional automated command and control systems, which were 
joined in the unified Armed Forces automated command and control 
system, functioned constantly under Academician Semenikhin's 
direction. Very much of interest also could be told both about 
this Council and about Academician Semenikhin's closest kindred 
spirits and colleagues. 
  [Pokrovskiy] Everything you enumerated indicates that 
journalists still owe a great debt and must cover this 
little-known page of our history more fully. 
  [Chipashvili] It is desirable that Academician 
Semenikhin's companions-in-arms and colleagues who are alive and 
well and who possess the full scope of historical information 
publish their memoirs about the very useful and instructive 
experience of creating such an enormous automated command and 
control system. For work on the Armed Forces automated command 
and control system essentially permitted forming a powerful, 
world-class domestic school on all aspects of comprehensive 
automation of the process of command and control of 
heterogeneous structures. 
  It should not be forgotten that unified thematic and 
engineering solutions on a world level were worked out in 
developing and realizing the Armed Forces automated command and 
control system which, in addition to their direct purpose, are 
suitable for use at the present time in creating automated 
systems for management of regions, sectors and the entire 
national economy of the country as a whole. What has been built 
up must not be lost! 
  [Pokrovskiy] We have been speaking all the while of the 
problem as a whole. Couldn't you tell briefly about something 
more specific? 
  [Chipashvili] Insofar as I can, I will try. 
  Everything that was realized in creating the Armed Forces 
automated command and control system was rather revolutionary 
both for the Armed Forces and for the country's science and 
engineering. But even against this background, the development 
and creation of the data exchange system for the Armed Forces 
automated command and control system on a fundamentally new 
conceptual and scientific basis was such a revolutionary and 
risky measure that it still generates a feeling of surprise, 
admiration and pride in our science and engineering. 
  Based on his own experience of creating automated command 
and 
control systems for individual branches of the Armed Forces, 
Academician Semenikhin understood well that data transfer 
questions were assuming ever greater importance in the problem 
of command and control. 
  Based on this, Academician Semenikhin gave constant, steady 
attention to the problem of creating a data exchange system as 
the basis of a unified Armed Forces automated command and 
control system. 
  Specialists realized from the very beginning that it was 
impossible to create such a comprehensive Armed Forces automated 
command and control system with the old approach to questions of 
data transfer--not only would requisite characteristics not be 
achieved, but the number of communications channels also had to 
be so enormous that it would exceed the bounds of what was 
reasonable. Ever larger staffs and command and control 
facilities must turn into enormous communications centers, with 
all ensuing consequences. 
  And proposed ideas of creating a data exchange system for 
the 
Armed Forces automated command and control system based on 
principles of switching individual portions of information 
through special automated centers seemed so unusual, 
unpredictable and risky for that time that far from everyone 
(even specialists) was agreeable to making the fate of the 
entire Armed Forces automated command and control system 
dependent on the possibility of realizing these new ideas. 
  It should be recalled here that all this occurred long 
before 
the accumulation of world experience and the appearance of 
international recommendations on a similar problem, which 
subsequently resulted in the enormous labor of large collectives 
of highly qualified specialists from different countries. Our 
developers not only had to develop very complex data exchange 
procedures for the first time on their own, but also ensure 
fulfillment of unprecedentedly high demands on the quality of 
data transfer with the use of essentially all types of 
communications channels, often of very poor quality, over 
enormous territories. 
  Despite all these difficulties, a large-scale territorial 
data exchange system was developed and realized for the first 
time based on a fundamentally new ideology, with unique 
indicators of functioning reliability and of the validity and 
probability of communicating data, a system which became a 
highly reliable, unifying foundation for all systems and 
subsystems of the Armed Forces automated command and control 
system. 
  When actual quantitative indicators of functioning of the 
data exchange system had been generalized for the first time, 
even the developers were pleasantly surprised. It was for a more 
understandable report to state leaders that the famous 
comparison which Academician Semenikhin very much loved was 
calculated: Reliability of data transfer over the data exchange 
system allows the distortion of no more than one out of the 
total number of characters in 165 volumes (i.e., 5.5 sets) of 
the "Bolshaya Sovetskaya Entsiklopediya" [Great Soviet 
Encyclopedia]. 
  The data exchange system also is being operated successfully 
at the present time, and many of its characteristics have not 
been surpassed to this day not only in domestic, but even in 
world practice. 
  Academician Semenikhin was very proud of the results of work 
on the data exchange system and highly esteemed its chief 
designer, his deputy, Russian Academy of Sciences Corresponding 
Member I. A. Mizin, who was awarded the Lenin Prize for this 
work. 
  [Pokrovskiy] I had occasion to meet Vladimir 
Sergeyevich and prepare his interviews and articles for PRAVDA. 
Of course, the talk in them was not about military, but peaceful 
use of computers, particularly about the unified computer 
system. For some reason I did not have occasion to hear high 
praise of it. 
  [Chipashvili] Insofar as I recall, Academician 
Semenikhin appeared in PRAVDA, including also under a pseudonym, 
following guidelines of that time about maintaining secrecy. 
  With respect to the second part of your question, I would 
not 
like to enter into polemics, but I will express my view of the 
situation briefly. 
  No matter what was said there, all defense equipment without 
exception was of domestic origin. All this was done by our 
brains and our hands. In places we were ahead, in places we were 
not... On the average it was parity--in the modern world it is 
impossible to break ahead abruptly. 
  But everything that shoots, crawls, swims and flies is all 
domestic. And when computers began to be developed rapidly, all 
onboard computers [vychisliteli] (or "kompyutery," as you like) 
were and are only domestic. 
  And we were not somewhere behind in the area of fixed 
computers. The problem appeared when the question arose of mass 
production of computer equipment for command and control systems. 
  [Pokrovskiy] Since political points have appeared in 
our conversation, how do you assess the effect of the Armed 
Forces automated command and control system on higher politics? 
The fact is, results of work on the Armed Forces automated 
command and control system could not remain unnoticed in other 
countries... 
  [Chipashvili] The system's capabilities for giving 
political and military leaders timely information for making 
important decisions on a retaliatory strike and the real-time 
realization of these decisions with any effect of the attacking 
side all led to the suicidal nature of the idea of a first 
strike. 
  [Pokrovskiy] What would you like to say in 
conclusion? 
  [Chipashvili] Just one thing. Large-scale, 
epoch-making problems also require corresponding directors, and 
as a rule they become inseparable from one another in history. I 
would like to express the assurance that Academician Semenikhin 
as a person and his work to create the unified Armed Forces 
automated command and control system will find worthy coverage 
in our press and literature.

<F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Poroskov: "Fall Draft Ends in March; </F>
What Will Spring Draft be Like?"] 
  [Excerpt] Yesterday's issue of KRASNAYA ZVEZDA published 
the edict of the Russian Federation President "On Drafting 
Citizens of the Russian Federation for Military Service in 
April-June 1994, and on Discharging Privates, Seamen, NCOs, 
Petty Officers and Military Construction Workers Having Served 
the Established Term of Military Service." On 15 April of this 
year the defense minister signed the corresponding order. These 
documents will evoke joy in some, and anxiety over a son's 
soldierly fate in others. For workers of mobilization offices 
and military commissariats they mean the beginning of another 
period of hard work, full of worries and, sometimes, unresolved 
problems. 
  In recent years the draft has become a painful point for the 
country, a point of intersection of often diametrically opposed 
interests of different people and departments. And the main 
purpose of this matter of statehood--providing for the country's 
defense--has faded somewhere back into second or third priority. 
  The fall draft of last year essentially dragged on into 
February and March of this year. Of course in the official 
terminology of military commissariats the draft ended on 31 
December 1993, followed by a period of assignment of the 
recruits to the forces. But for practical purposes this has all 
obviously been a single continuous period. 
  The causes of this unprecedented phenomenon are known: 
Almost 
80 percent of draftees received deferments from service--50 to 
continue their studies, 23 for health reasons, 4 for work in the 
arts, education and public health, and 3 because of their family 
situation. Seventy thousand potential draftees are on the run. 
Consequently last year less than 22 percent of persons on the 
draft rolls were drafted. For comparison, in neighboring Finland 
this figure is equal to 90. 
  Through the efforts of the Main Organizational and 
Mobilizational Directorate of the Main Staff, of workers of the 
military commissariats and draft boards, and of representatives 
of the heads of local administrations, at the beginning of this 
year we were able to achieve a turning point in this negative 
trend: Eighty percent of the planned number of draftees were 
already in the army and navy. By the end of March, the figure 
increased. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Berezko under the rubric "The Arsenal": </F>
" A Chemical Laboratory Under Armor"] 
  [Text] Those who once served in subunits of the chemical 
troops will remember the equipment used for conducting radiation 
and chemical reconnaissance, of course. It consisted of the 
corresponding model of a BRDM [armored radiation patrol vehicle] 
or Uazik. The new chemical reconnaissance vehicle (RKhM-4) is 
based on the BTR-80. 
  The RKhM-4 is capable of conducting radiation and chemical 
reconnaissance in difficult topographical and meteorological 
conditions day or night. It is adapted for surmounting natural 
and artificial obstacles and water barriers. It performs 
reconnaissance effectively in temperatures of -40 to +40 degrees 
C and at altitudes of up to 3,000 meters. 
  The equipment on the RKhM-4 makes it possible to measure the 
gamma-radiation level in an area and the degree of radioactive 
contamination of various objects and to perform constant, 
automatic monitoring of the air. It can also perform a large 
number of other missions to provide a complete and comprehensive 
assessment of the radiation and chemical situation. 
  In peacetime the RKhM-4 can be used for reconnoitering the 
situation along main pipelines and for mopping up following the 
dumping of radioactive or chemical substances.

<F P=106> [Interview of Colonel-General of Aviation Viktor Prudnikov </F>
by Aleksandr Ivanov, place and date not given: "Air Defense 
Troops Will Be the Basis for Creation of an Aerospace Defense"] 
  [Text] On the eve of a military professional holiday 
we traditionally talk about the problems, concerns, and affairs 
of the "birthday boys." That is why our correspondent met with 
the CINC of the Air Defense Troops Col-Gen of Aviation Viktor 
Prudnikov. 
  [Ivanov] Viktor Alekseyevich, what has changed in the PVO 
[Air Defense] Troops in the last year? 
  [Prudnikov] A lot has changed. These changes are associated 
primarily with military reform. 
  The Order of the President of the Russian Federation and the 
corresponding order of the Ministry of Defense practically gave 
a new face to the PVO Troops. In the future they will be the 
basis for creation of Russia's aerospace defense. That is a 
natural future, because the air and space spheres are so 
interrelated that they have long been viewed as an inseparable 
whole. 
  The principle of formation of the PVO system will also be 
changed. It will acquire a quite different content and will 
become territorial. Within the time periods designated by the 
defense minister, zones and regions of air defense will be 
created. It remains only to establish them legally, through the 
appropriate documents. I assume that this will require special 
study. 
  If we consider the specific results of combat readiness and 
activity of the troops, then it must be stressed that we have 
been able to preserve the quality and reliability of the PVO 
while reducing them quantitatively. 
  My second point is that all outmoded arms and equipment have 
been eliminated. Units and subunits are equipped now with the 
most modern and powerful systems and complexes which will make 
it possible to retain efficiency of use while shrinking the 
combat formations. 
  But perhaps one of the most urgent problems is the fate of 
those who work at radar consoles, in the cockpits of the fighter 
interceptors, in the missile systems. Last year was quite hard 
for them. As a result of the cut, thousands of officers and 
warrant officers were released. And although we tried, to the 
extent possible, to allow for the interests and desires of each, 
I cannot say that the process is a painless one. Even those who 
do not fall under the cuts begin to lose confidence in tomorrow. 
  This situation requires that the military council, the troop 
command and the cadre organs conduct purposeful work to 
strengthen social protection, and requires an individual 
approach in deciding the fate of each who is subject to the 
organizational personnel measures. We strive to do everything so 
as not to offend those who faithfully served the Fatherland for 
many years. We will not discharge service members without 
apartments. 
  The current material and financial support of the troops is 
a 
matter of concern. Last year we were not able to achieve 
regularity in payments even of pay and allowances. Even now in a 
number of units service members have not received their pay for 
March. It is hard for the families of officers and warrant 
officers to live under these conditions, for most of them have 
no other sources of income. 
  We are striving to distribute the money we do get as 
uniformly as possible. I have ordered that we first satisfy the 
remote garrisons, and that officer personnel receive their pay 
last. 
  [Ivanov] Viktor Alekseyevich, how then is the main mission 
of 
the PVO Troops, maintenance of high combat readiness, being 
accomplished? 
  [Prudnikov] In the near future, if we do not thoroughly 
correct the system for supplying the units with resources to 
conduct combat training in a planned fashion, then I must say 
bluntly that the status of combat readiness will begin to drop. 
By this I mean that the fliers must fly, and the missilemen and 
the radar operations must turn on their systems and perform 
their training drills and fires. Daily training must be 
conducted. And this is not happening today to the full extent 
because we don't have the resources. 
  Nonetheless, combat training is proceeding. For now we have 
tried to conduct everything that was planned for this training 
year, the exercises, fires, operational assemblies, and 
conferences in their full extent and on time. 
  [Ivanov] Just a year ago, monitoring of the use of Russian 
air space was a very serious problem. What is the state of 
affairs now? 
  [Prudnikov] Unfortunately this question has not been 
resolved. In order to have everything necessary to monitor the 
air border and the flights of aircraft through it, we must 
perform a great volume of work, very expensive by today's 
standards. The normative documents are also necessary, to 
regulate the use of Russian air space. Their lack makes it 
harder for the PVO Troops to perform their missions. 
  I won't say that this state of affairs has led to any 
flagrant violations. Virtually everything depends on the 
discipline of those who pilot the aircraft. But we have already 
encountered incidents of violations. Not long ago we were 
compelled to use the on-duty air forces to force an intruder 
aircraft to land at Mineralnyye Vody for a customs inspection. 
  [Ivanov] The PVO Troops have already experienced several 
cuts. Now there is a new stage. But is there some sort of limit 
in numerical strength and the complement of the groupings beyond 
which the combat readiness of the troops will drop? 
  [Prudnikov] The minimal acceptable numerical strength of 
personnel and PVO groupings have been calculated. The figure was 
reported to the leadership of the Armed Forces. I will say that 
there is understanding of the problem. Now the Main Staff of the 
service is working on proposals to reduce the troops in such a 
way as not to do harm to their combat strength. 
  [Ivanov] In 1991, ex-president Gorbachev ordered the 
creation 
of the Strategic Deterrence Forces, to which troops of the 
Missile-Space Defense were assigned from the PVO Troops. As far 
as I know, even now there is talk of variants of a transfer of 
the Missile-Space Defense Troops to another Armed Service. The 
motivation is simple, they say these troops are not precisely 
working in air defense. 
  [Prudnikov] My opinion is not based on that fact that there 
is no need to transfer anything to anyone. If it helps matters, 
then there's nothing more to say. 
  But let us see how and why the Missile-Space Defense was 
included in the PVO system. They proceeded first of all from the 
fact that to ensure safe protection of the state from air and 
space, a strong command and control system was needed. It was 
created, and it works successfully. And it would not be 
advisable to touch anything in it today, let alone tear 
something out. 
  [Ivanov] One last question, Viktor Alekseyevich. Recently 
various high state and military authorities have been receiving 
letters in which veterans and service members have expressed 
their concern about the future of the PVO Troops. You have 
partly answered this. Still, how well-founded is their alarm? 
  [Prudnikov] At present a very serious and intense study is 
in 
progress to determine the structure of Russia's air defense. As 
far as I know, the proposals have been reasonable, 
well-considered, and not directed toward weakening the combat 
might of the PVO. But I must say the following in this regard. 
There is no need to sound a false alarm, at times without 
knowing the actual situation, or pelting the country's and the 
Armed Forces' leadership with collective letters. I don't think 
anyone will allow the collapse of the air defense. 
  I want to congratulate all of those who serve in the PVO 
Troops, and the industrialists and contractors on their holiday, 
and to thank them for their selfless labor and devotion.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vitaliy Poluyanov by Col. Valeriy Usoltsev, </F>
place and date not given: "Changing the Saber for the Sea"] 
  [Text] The Ussuri Cossacks are going to serve in the 
naval infantry with this slogan. Perhaps a first in the 
centuries-long history of the Russia Cossacks. "The Cossack 
gallops across the valley." But now what: "Over the seas and 
waves, now here, tomorrow there?" It is one thing when the 
Cossack fights on dry land, but now he attacks from the ocean 
depths. Is such a thing possible? 
  We went with these questions to the military 
ataman of the Ussuri Cossack Troop, Vitaliy 
Poluyanov. 
  [Poluyanov] What is so surprising about it? You could put it 
like this: "The Cossack doesn't fear the devil or the deep." Or 
don't you agree? Well, let that be a joke, but seriously, what 
sort of times are these? A time of the highest military 
technology. Do you think we fight with saber and pike? Not at 
all, today give us Cossacks the infantry fighting vehicle, 
tanks, missiles, Kalashnikovs. 
  But then the Cossack is a special state of martial spirit, 
and not a prescription for a specific combat arm. 
  The naval infantry is the elite. These are real men. And 
that's what we Cossacks want to join. We have lived for three 
years with the idea of reinforcing the ranks of the naval 
infantry. And finally it has come true. Everyone has agreed, it 
has been arranged with the military commissariats and with the 
naval command. A Cossack company has been created from our 
draftees. Although to tell the truth, we were aiming for a 
battalion immediately. That didn't work out. 
  [Usoltsev] What prevented it? 
  [Poluyanov] We did it ourselves. Our boys. They have to get 
more fit, supplement their knowledge. The selection process for 
the naval infantry is very strict. But that's as it should be. 
  But anyway, we will work on our designated bottlenecks, as 
they say. We have set the goal of preparing a whole Cossack 
battalion of the naval infantry by autumn. 
  [Usoltsev] Well, how are today's draftees doing, do you have 
any information? 
  [Poluyanov] The most complete. By order of the Council of 
the 
Cossack association, stanitsa residents travel around 
to the subunits where our Cossacks are serving and check on 
their deeds and misdemeanors. If there are any, which God 
forbid, we reprimand them and hold them to a strict accounting. 
But in general everyone is satisfied with our Cossacks, in the 
motorized rifle subunits, in the missile subunits, in the Air 
Defense Forces, and in the border guards. 
  [Usoltsev] What are the goals for the future for the Ussuri 
Cossacks? 
  [Poluyanov] Forming a Cossack squadron. It would be nice to 
have a Cossack nuclear vessel in the ocean depths too. What are

  [Text] Head of the government Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, First Deputy Minister of Defense of Russia Andrey 
Kokoshin, and Vice-Admiral Vladimir Grishanov, commander of the 
Leningrad Naval Base, took part in the dedication ceremony for 
the first warship of this class that has been launched in Russia 
and the in raising of the Andreyev flag on it. 
  The last similar destroyer of the first rank was built at 
the 
"Northern Shipyard" joint-stock company back in the time of the 
USSR. The "Besstrashnyy" will become part of the Northern Fleet, 
where several such ships are already based. 
  Viktor Chernomyrdin noted that task of building the new 
Russian fleet must be resolved under extremely difficult 
conditions in connection with the loss of a number of military 
bases in the Baltic, Black Sea, and Caspian Sea and also with 
the complex economic situation and the difficult political 
circumstances. 
  In commenting on the raising of the Andreyevskiy flag on the 
destroyer "Besstrashnyy," Andrey Kokoshin said that this was a 
real celebration for the Armed Forces. 
  It was very difficult for the Ministry of Defense and the 
personnel of "Northern Shipyard" to complete the construction of 
the "Besstrashnyy" under the conditions of the extremely acute 
situation with respect to the financing of the state defense 
order, noted Andrey Kokoshin. The leadership of the Ministry of 
Defense continually had to follow the course of the work and 
provide for even financing. Presently, analogous work is being 
done with respect to the completion of the heavy nuclear missile 
cruiser "Petr Velikiy," a destroyer, and an antisubmarine ship.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Maryukha: "`Third Repartition': Will It </F>
Clear Up the Fate of the Black Sea Fleet?"] 
  [Text] The striving of the Ukrainian side to divide the 
Black Sea Fleet on an individual basis and thereby to "bury" it 
as an operational-strategic formation covering the southern 
flanks of Russia and Ukraine has already become an unfortunate 
tradition. The agreements signed by the leaders of the two 
countries in Yalta, Dagomys, Zavidovo, and Massandra, which 
alleviated some accumulated tension, only temporarily cooled the 
zeal of the Ukrainian military, who intended to have a "perhaps 
small but their own" fleet by confiscating the property of 
Russia. The fact that the Black Sea Fleet with all of its 
infrastructure is really Russian can be seen convincingly not 
only in the Massandra protocol but also in its exclusive Russian 
financing since September of last year. 
  Last Friday, after a meeting of the heads of state of the 
CIS, presidents Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk also drew a 
line under the latest attempt at a unilateral division of the 
Black Sea Fleet begun by the Ukrainian special forces in Odessa. 
An agreement was signed on the staged settlement of the problem 
of the Black Sea Fleet, which contains three basic directions. 
The document states that the Ukrainian Naval Forces and the 
Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation will be based 
separately and the Ukrainian side gets 15 to 20 percent of the 
Fleet's ships. It is planned to prepare an agreement on the 
parameters of such a division within 10 days. 
  It was essentially a matter of the first Russian proposals 
on 
the division of the property of the former Union and the 
allocation to Ukraine of those ships and units of the Black Sea 
Fleet whose presence is adequate to resolve the tasks in the 
protection of the naval boundaries of the sovereign state. 
  On Saturday, however, a statement by Vyacheslav Kostikov, 
press secretary of the President of the Russian Federation, was 
disseminated that stressed that once again the Russian side was 
forced to remind people of the hard reality that was the basis 
of the joint document of the two presidents: "Unweighed words 
and actions are inappropriate when it is a matter of something 
that is sacred to the nation, as is the Black Sea Fleet." Is it 
appropriate to remind people that none of the sides must put 
into doubt the sincerity of the negotiating process? It turns 
out that it is. 
  Figuratively speaking, the ink had not yet dried on the 
signed agreement when the first alarming reports were received 
from Izmail, Ochakov, and Nikolayev on the violation of the 
spirit and the letter of the indicated document by the Ukrainian 
side. It is there where the Western Naval Region of the 
Ukrainian Naval Forces is being organized and its Chief, Capt 
1st Rank Dmitriy Ukrainetz decided "to grow into the situation 
in advance." A Ukrainian brigade commander--Capt. 1st Rank 
Yaroslav Fedorishin--has already been assigned to a brigade of 
river craft of the Black Sea Fleet in Izmail and the seamen have 
been promised high pay for swearing allegiance to Ukraine, 
whereas the rest will be forced to leave the boundaries of the 
republic. Ukraine has begun the systematic and unilateral 
seizure of Fleet property even before a mechanism is worked out 
for the division of the Black Sea Fleet as set forth by the 
agreement. Meanwhile, Kiev is already spreading its own 
interprepations of the signed document with respect to the time 
for which bases are leased and the places where the Black Sea 
Fleet will be stationed. 
  The times specified by the agreement for the separation of 
the bases to avoid conflicts between the Black Sea Fleet and the 
Ukrainian Naval Forces are extremely rigid, something that was 
not in the previous documents that left the resolution of the 
problem to the distant future. But the mechanism for a new 
"watershed" may "break down" again and again because of the 
unilateral actions of the Ukrainian military people, 
complicating the relations of the two sides. Still, one would 
like to believe that the time of ultimatums with which the 
Ukrainian Ministry of Defense entered the territory of Russian 
military units under the cover of the assault rifles of special 
forces has passed. There is a document guaranteeing this and 
cemented by the signatures of the leaders of the two neighboring 
friendly countries, and there is still a whole week remaining 
for the achievement of a common point of view at the level of 
experts and working groups on the division of the Black Sea 
Fleet. The purpose is to accurately carry out the achieved 
agreements in the localities. This must be clear, above all, to 
the Ukrainian military people, who are presently not called upon 
to show any "initiative" in the interpretation of the agreement 
signed by their commander-in-chief.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Ubran, "Short-Lived Militia"; "The </F>
Estonian Army is Seeking Allies, the `Kaytseliyt' Enemies"] 
  [Text] Military Review 
  The defense forces of the Estonian Republic include regular 
armed forces (2.5 thousand men), and a militarized volunteer 
organization, the "Kaytseliyt" (roughly 6.5 thousand members) 
and the security services of the state. In turn the state 
security services consist of the border troops (4 thousand men), 
the rescue service, and the coastal defense. 
<H5>  We Monitor Everyone, Even the Police </H5>
  When creating its own army, the Estonian government put the 
"Kaytseliyt" in first place. Only now have they acknowledged 
their error. 
  The "Kaytseliyt" (Defense League) is an organization 
which appeared in the capacity of people's militia back before 
the war. It was restored in 1990. In the autumn of the same year 
it conducted an exercise to restore the prewar border of 
Estonia, digging in border barriers on foreign territory in the 
Leningrad oblast. In 1991-1993, the militiamen launched several 
armed attacks on Russian service members in the Estonian 
Republic. 
  When the volunteers "implemented" slogans having to do with 
fighting the occupiers, this was supported in every way by the 
political elite. But when it became clear that the Russian Army 
was leaving sooner or later, another solution was found for the 
military patriotism of the "Defense League." 
  Last summer in Pullapae the volunteer jaeger 
company, which consisted of soldiers of the Karu "Kaytseliyt" 
force, barricaded itself in their barracks as a token of protest 
against the fact that the government was unable to purge the 
ranks of the army of the "former communists and officers of the 
Soviet Army." Even though the mutiny itself ended bloodlessly, 
shots were fired. In November, when the former commander of the 
Pullapae mutineers Asso Kommer was arrested, there was an 
exchange of fire between the police and the jaegers, 
and two policemen were wounded. 
  The scandal has not died down as yet. Even though recently a 
government commission investigating the jaeger 
affair disclosed the results of its work, the problems have not 
been fully eliminated. In the opinion of the commission, the 
conflict occurred primarily because the status of the 
jaeger company had not been defined, and for this 
reason the company constitutes an "alternative military unit 
attracting both those who are interested in bearing arms, and 
those who are interested in combat training outside the control 
of the main staff of the defense forces." 
  Other unsavory facts about the "Kaytseliyt" were also 
discovered. For example, the commission got hold of a document 
which indicated that the Parnu militia was conducting 
"counterintelligence against the municipal prefecture police." 
It turns out that local "Kaytselliyt" members had received the 
mission from their Tallinn leaders of "constantly surveilling 
the activities of the police." 
  Although the "Defense League" has many highly placed 
patrons, 
the authorities have begun to take action to eliminate the 
"partisan subunits." And in a future law on state defense 
evidently there is no mention of the "Kaytseliyt" as a military 
formation. Its functions will be rolled back to preparation of 
draftees and reservists. 
  Aleksander Einzeln, the commander of the defense forces and 
a 
former American colonel invited back to the motherland (where he 
became a Major General), is insisting on this. "The problem is 
that many of these boys are acting more like members of a street 
gang than like members of the armed forces," he commented on the 
situation in the NEW YORK TIMES, "and we need to get rid of the 
swindlers, thieves and adventurers." 
<H5>  What Commander Would Not Love a Fast Career </H5>
  After the "strike" of the jaeger company, the 
nationalists in parliament blocked a decision on punishing the 
culprits. But paying no mind to the radicals, Einzeln 
immediately discharged around 1500 "Kaytseliyt" soldiers. And 
just as demonstratively, he left in service the former communist 
and Soviet officer Colonel Ats Laaneots, the chief of the main 
staff of the defense forces, against whom the volunteers had 
been acting. 
  Laaneots has retired only now, in April, when his authority 
officially expired. But he turned over the job to his 
49-year-old deputy chief of operations, Colonel Avro Serel, who 
is also one of the "formers." Why did Einzeln pay no heed then 
to those who seem to see communists everywhere? It is simply 
that the defense forces require professionals. You see, now most 
of the Army officers are quick promotions, as they say here, 
from the initial period of independence. Only six percent of 
them have higher education, and most of the commanders have 
completed only a six-month training course. 
  But life rapidly dispelled the illusions of the first years 
of independence. And in this context, the interview with the 
commander of the Kaleva battalion, Captain Alar Laneman, 
published in the newspaper ESTONSKAYA ZHIZN is quite 
characteristic. Five officers are envisioned for each company in 
his battalion, but usually there is only one. And he generally 
has no experience in service, and cannot cope with the great 
loads. It is no surprise, Laneman admits, that some of them "got 
off track and began to push too hard." For this reason, many of 
the young officers were "simply shoved out" of the battalion. 
  Who is having as meteoric a career in Estonia as the 
politicians? 
  The 27-year-old journalist Yuri Luyk, becoming Minister 
of Defense after the Pullapae crisis, this January returned to 
his former place of work, and was confirmed as Minister of 
Foreign Affairs. (He began his political career in 1991, taking 
over a department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs). And the 
military department is headed by a classmate from Tartu 
University, Indrek Kannik, who also worked earlier at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Like Luyk, he is a deputy of the 
state council from the rightwing coalition party "Isamaa." 
  But still, one must give the young ambitious politicians 
their due. The task set two years ago of gradual integration 
into NATO is being accomplished here most actively, if one 
compares the efforts of all the Baltic states. And the chief 
obstacle, the creation of an army on the same principles as in 
the West, is now starting to be overcome in Estonia. 
  Despite the economic difficulties, Prime Minister Mart Laar 
last spring with the help of the then Defense Minister Hayn 
Rebas, concluded a contract with the Israeli state company 
"Tass" for delivery of NATO-standard small arms and antitank 
weapons (with spare parts). The parliament easily "swallowed" 
the astronomical cost of the deal for the Estonian Republic," 50 
million U.S. dollars, and in January of this year a ship with 
the first lot of foreign weapons was unloaded at the port of 
Tallinn. 
  Yuri Luyk also evidently will go down in history for 
announcing preparations for production of NATO caliber 
ammunition in the Republic. The present minister Indrek Kannik 
and following ones will also have their share of worries. 
Estonia has undertaken to pay off the sum required by the 
contract with "Tass" by the start of the year 2000. It is then 
when plans are to bring the numerical strength of the regular 
forces to 12 thousand, which is precisely how many can be 
supplied with the purchased weapons. 
<H5>  The Peacekeeping Battalion Is Lucky -- There Is Someone to </H5>
Attack 
  It is still hard to speak of combat readiness of the defense 
forces. And joining NATO is not exactly an immediate prospect. A 
military alliance is now possible only with the nearest 
neighbors, Latvia and Lithuania. The decision has already been 
made to form a combined peacekeeping battalion in order to then 
offer its services to the U.N. 
  And the first test of the forces was on February 20-22, when 
one company from each country gathered for an exercise at a 
range not far from Viru. 
  Participating were: One hundred and fifty service 
members from Latvia, representing a motorized rifle battalion 
stationed in Aluksne, 129 Estonian soldiers (Company "C" of the 
Kupriyanov battalion); 96 men from the Lithuanian brigade 
"Gelezhinas Vilkas" (1st Company of the Panevezys 
Battalion). 
  Against the background of numerous statements regarding 
preparation for peacekeeping operations, the plan of action of 
the future U.N. soldiers appears strange. Here is how the 
Estonian press describes the exercise: "The first day the 
combined battalion withdrew under the pressure of enemy forces . 
. . They (the subunits) cleanly emerged from the encirclement, 
and by evening the withdrawal had stopped. The next day a 
counterattack began which ended in a brilliant victory." 
  One could of course cite other details. But this is the main 
thing. It is thought that the goal of any peacekeeping operation 
is to stop fire and separate the belligerent parties. Here 
everything is different. 
  It is no accident that immediately after the Viru maneuvers, 
the "Kaytseliyt" leadership began to demand an "all-Estonian 
defensive exercise," again dragging out its slogans about the 
struggle with the occupiers. It is a good thing that after the 
results of the work of the "jaeger" commission were publicized, 
the enthusiasts supporting the "Defense League" decreased both 
in the state assembly and in the government. 
  The venture has collapsed. They say that after this, one of 
the "Kaytseliyt" leaders began work on his memoirs--a good sign 
that his time had passed.

"The Fourth Draft Is Like the Previous Fifth Point: 
Russian-Latvian Agreement Threatened"] 
  [Text] The Latvian 
Sejm did not approve the intergovernmental agreement with Russia 
on social protection for military pensioners initialed back on 
15 March, despite the fact that it was undoubtedly aware of the 
official statement made by President of the Russian Federation 
Boris Yeltsin just yesterday. Among other things, it stressed 
the fact "we have not planned and are not planning to build 
military bases on Latvian territory. This has to do only with 
the temporary functioning of a single Russian establishment 
under civilian control, the radar station in the city of 
Skrunda". (KRASNAYA ZVEZDA covered relations between our nations 
in greater detail on 20 April). 
  Public opinion has also forced President of the Republic of 
Latvia Guntis Ulmanis to alter his position. He spoke out in 
favor of an agreement on the withdrawal of Russian troops prior 
to 31 August of this year, on social protection for servicemen 
for the period of troop withdrawal and for temporary retention 
of the radar station at Skrunda. Speaking of the fourth 
agreement, which has to do with social protection for military 
pensioners and their families residing in Latvia, Ulmanis 
proposed the establishment of a group of experts, which would 
continue the quest for mutually acceptable solutions for the 
next 10 days. 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA learned yesterday that Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin and Latvian President Ulmanis had reached 
agreement by telephone to hold a meeting in Moscow in the 
immediate future. 
  The precise date of the meeting, at which it is planned to 
sign the initialed agreements between the two countries, 
specifically the one on the withdrawal of Russian troops and 
rent for the radar station at Skrunda, has apparently not yet 
been set.

<F P=106> [Article by Vitaliy Denisov: "Fighting Continues in </F>
Karabakh, and Each Side Attempts to Show Itself in the Best 
Light"] 
  [Text] In an interview with a KRASNAYA ZVEZDA 
correspondent, Murad Petrosyan, deputy commander of the army of 
Nagornyy Karabakh, refuted a report by the Azeri side of 
allegedly high losses on the part of Karabakh forces. He said 
that Karabakh forces are sticking with defensive tactics, and 
are suffering significantly fewer losses than the enemy. Last 
week Karabakh detachments lost several dozen men killed, while 
the Azeri Army lost over 600. In the words of Petrosyan, forces 
of the army of Nagornyy Karabakh captured 15 light armored 
vehicles, 8 tanks and 5 IFVs as trophies, and brought down one 
airplane of the Azeri air forces. 
  According to a statement from Petrosyan the Armenian side 
also possesses information indicating that Afghan mujahadin are 
taking part in fighting on the Azeri side east of the rayon 
center of Mardakert. 
  The Azeri Ministry of Defense evaluates its position more 
optimistically. In its statement it noted that the offensive has 
been halted in all sectors, and over the last three days the 
advancing troop formations lost 16 units of armored equipment in 
the Terter sector.

"Military Review": "The Order Is To Cross the Border: Karabakh 
Battalions Entered Shaumyanovskiy Rayon and Azerbaijani Aviation 
Committed Acts of Retribution in Response"] 
  [Text] Negotiators at the peace talks change, but the 
war goes on. After the unsuccessful winter offensive by 
Azerbaijani troops (KRASNAYA ZVEZDA wrote about this on 30 
March), a convenient moment seemingly has come again for 
beginning a settlement of the conflict. 
  But official Baku still responded with a "sovereign no" to 
the proposal to introduce Russian forces of separation between 
the belligerents and to hold talks on the political status of 
the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. And the situation 
again was reminiscent of a lull before battle, especially as the 
Nagorno-Karabakh Republic confirms its resolve to force the 
enemy to reckon with it by one method--military. 
  Back at the beginning of last year the Karabakh Defense 
Staff 
worked out a plan together with the Armenian Main Staff for 
establishing so-called security zones around the 
Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. Operations to seize Azerbaijani 
territories--Kelbadzharskiy, Agdamskiy, Fizulinskiy, 
Zangelanskiy and other rayons--were worked out and then carried 
out on the basis of this plan. Judging from everything, the 
rapid restoration of the status quo at the front after failure 
of the Azerbaijani offensive added to Karabakh confidence that 
they would win the war. That is how the decision came to create 
one more "security zone," this time to the north of Karabakh. 
  Previously settled basically by Armenians, Shaumyanovskiy 
Rayon (renamed Geranboyskiy Rayon by the Azerbaijanis) covers 
the path to the strategically important city of Gyandzha. Major 
forces, particularly 2nd Army Corps, are stationed here. It is 
common knowledge that last year former Corps Commander Colonel 
Surret Guseynov used units of this corps to act against then 
President Abulfaz Elchibey. A change of power took place in Baku 
as a result. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-019-19A>      FIGURE </FIG>


  There is a large number of refugees in Gyandzha from 
Kelbadzharskiy Rayon, which was occupied by Armenian troops in 
April of last year. In case combat operations unfold in 
Shaumyanovskiy Rayon, the refugees (as also happened last year) 
can become that spark from which there will be an outburst of 
discontent with Azerbaijani central authorities. There already 
are preconditions for this. 
  In March Karabakh raiding parties consisting of local 
Armenians came to within 40-50 km of Gyandzha. The 
"reconnaissance in force" was successful then, but according to 
reports from Stepanakert, the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Defense 
Army now has liberated the villages of Talish in Mardakertskiy 
Rayon and Gyuristan in Shaumyanovskiy Rayon. Combat operations 
continue in the direction of Shaumyanovsk and the city is 
threatened with serious danger. 
  It was not by chance that Baku called the new Armenian 
offensive an attempt to destabilize the situation in the 
republic. And now, when Azerbaijani aviation has joined in the 
combat operations after almost a year's break, it is clear that 
a very important psychological point has been overcome. 
  During 1992-1993 Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Defense Army air 
defense weapons shot down over 10 enemy aircraft. There are two 
pilots in the Stepanakert prison (one a native of Russia, the 
other of Ukraine) who were shot down in the Karabakh sky. There 
were private understandings that they would be handed over to 
"interested countries" after trial if the bombings did not 
continue. 
  The Azerbaijani Air Force committed an "act of retribution" 
against Stepanakert and other cities of the Nagorno-Karabakh 
Republic on 10 April, right after two Karabakh battalions 
penetrated into Shaumyanovskiy Rayon. And on 12 April air 
strikes were delivered against the Armenian cities of Goris and 
Kafan. 
  Aerial bombings of peaceful communities of course are 
incapable of interfering with a continuation of the Karabakh 
offensive. The "Armenian occupation corps" (Baku's terminology) 
is conducting combat operations basically by small assault teams 
difficult to detect from the air. But the fact will remain a 
fact: The war has entered a new bloody phase.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Akshintsev: "Russia Losing </F>
the Arms Market: USA Already Exporting Seven Times More"] 
  [Text] The arms trade problem has recently acquired special 
urgency, as a result of which the mass media report on it 
practically daily, evoking numerous discussions and debates. 
  In the discussion of the question as to whether or not 
Russia 
should sell arms, one is astounded by the simplicity with which 
many of our citizens approach this complex, delicate problem. 
Having digested a certain amount of superficial information, and 
not burdening themselves with a meticulous, comprehensive 
analysis, in all seriousness they offer proposals which not only 
possess content that often recalls the line of reasoning 
followed by Manilov in Gogol's Dead Souls, but which 
may also lead to serious negative consequences. 
  In the estimation of the Ministry of Defense, the USA's 
share 
of the world arms market is currently around 60 percent. 
However, citing available official international data, Doctor of 
Historical Sciences A. G. Arbatov, a prominent specialist in 
security matters, asserts that of the total volume of world arms 
exports, which was $18 billion in 1992, the USA's share was 
approximately $8 billion, or only 46 percent. 
  How correct are these estimates, and which is closer to the 
truth? 
  Of course, the differences in the indicators are the product 
of different procedures for calculating them, and there is 
nothing prejudicial in this. Something else is 
important--correct manipulation of data obtained by means of 
some specific methodological approach, and a clear understanding 
of their limits. 
  Having no information on the procedure by which the volumes 
of arms exports by different countries were estimated by 
specialists of the Ministry of Defense, we need to offer some 
clarifications regarding estimates of the world arms trade 
volume and the USA's share of it. 
  The principal data were obtained from an analytical survey 
of 
armament and disarmament problems covering 1993, prepared by 
specialists of the Stockholm International World Problems 
Research Institute (SIPRI). There can be no doubt as to the high 
professionalism and objectivity of this well-known 
organization's scientists. And as with anyone concerned with 
maintaining one's scientific image, SIPRI specialists accompany 
the cost indicators of world arms trade volumes cited by them by 
the corresponding methodological explanations. 
  It follows from these explanations that the data reflected 
in 
the SIPRI survey embrace only five basic forms of conventional 
arms: Warplanes and helicopters; armored equipment and artillery 
systems of 100 mm and higher caliber; radar stations and other 
electronic systems (tracking, control, guidance etc.); guided 
missiles; ships of the principal classes (with displacement 
greater than 100 tonnes). That is, export and import of forms of 
armament such as ammunition, infantry weapons, artillery 
armament of up to 100 mm caliber, military launches etc. are 
disregarded. 
  Considering the complexity and the practical impossibility 
of 
clearly tracking deliveries of this assortment of military 
property, SIPRI specialists make special reference to their 
well-known table, which contains data on the world trade volume. 
  In the meantime when he cites SIPRI data but fails to 
mention 
this reference, Mr. A. G. Arbatov unwittingly reduces the real 
volume of arms trade in the world, and the roll played in it by 
the USA. An estimate of the difference may be obtained by 
comparing the SIPRI estimate with indicators contained in a 
special annual report written by the research service of the 
U.S. Congress on deliveries of conventional arms to Third World 
countries. 
  Thus according to the last report, which accounted for all 
deliveries of American arms through state and private channels, 
in 1988-1992 the USA exported weapons and military equipment to 
developing countries amounting to $36.2 billion in current 
prices. Considering that according to SIPRI data Third World 
countries represented only 36 percent of American exports of the 
main forms of conventional arms in the indicated period, and 
making the assumption that this proportion also applies to 
deliveries of other types of military property abroad, we find 
that total exports of weapons and military equipment by the USA 
in 1988-1992 were approximately $100 billion. In the meantime, 
we see an indicator of only $55 billion in the SIPRI survey; 
however, it corresponds only to that part of armament which the 
USA supplies to other countries. Thus, one of the indicators 
exceeds the other by 82 percent. 
  With regard for this, and ignoring the nonessential error 
due 
to differences in prices observed in the Congressional report 
and in the SIPRI survey, and adopting an average coefficient of 
excess for the entire five-year period, we find that American 
arms exports in 1992 exceeded $15 billion. 
  Why cite all of these complex calculations, which are 
tiresome to the reader and which aren't commonly found in 
newspapers as a genre? To once again demonstrate to our people 
that we continue to approach arms trade, which is such a complex 
problem, in a very superficial way, without accounting for the 
evolving realities. As a result, while we were waging a campaign 
of directive and, in many ways, unilateral conversion, and 
debating whether Russia should sell arms or not, the leading 
foreign military exporters, chiefly in the USA, began building 
up the efforts to increase their exports, including by 
penetrating into markets abandoned by us. As a result, a 
significant imbalance revealed itself in world arms trade, which 
was pointed out in particular by Russian President B. N. Yeltsin 
in his report to a joint meeting of the Council of the 
Federation and the State Duma in February 1994. 
  Thus, while according to calculations the volume of American 
arms exports exceeded $15 billion in 1992, this indicator was 
only $2.3 billion for Russia (taken from the cited report to the 
U.S. Congress, and corresponding to our arms exports to Third 
World countries, because for practical purposes there were no 
deliveries to other countries in 1992). Indicators contained in 
the United Nations conventional arms register also attest to 
presence of such a large imbalance in the volumes of American 
and Russian exports of weapons and military equipment (a factor 
of more than seven times, and not the four times arrived at when 
using SIPRI data). Corresponding with this, in 1992 the USA 
exported 1,241 tanks (82 percent of world exports), 706 IFVs and 
APCs (63 percent), 166 large-caliber artillery systems (17 
percent), 165 warplanes (69 percent) and 6 helicopter gunships 
(75 percent). Of these types of arms, Russia exported only 7 
tanks, (0.5 percent), 198 IFVs and APCs (18 percent) and 26 
warplanes (11 percent). 
  The Soviet military-industrial complex was distinguished by 
a 
high potential in relation to creating and exporting defensive 
products, permitting it to successfully compete in the world 
arms markets. However, the USSR's disintegration significantly 
weakened this potential. 
  First, in the heat of the infighting that engulfed us, and 
desiring to reach the finish line first, we began pursuing an 
uncoordinated arms export policy, and developing ill-conceived 
competition, which is ultimately leading to serious political 
and economic losses for all parties. In particular, when the 
same types of equipment are aggressively offered in the same 
markets, their prices decrease. 
  Second, disturbance of the unified military-economic space 
seriously undermined our possibilities for designing 
state-of-the-art, competitive arms. Because of nondelivery of 
certain units and parts by some neighboring sovereign state it 
is impossible to manufacture and export entire weapon systems. 
Even Russia suffers this fate in some cases, despite the fact 
that it possesses the most powerful military-industrial base in 
the CIS. A meeting with the director of a certain defense 
enterprise comes to mind in this connection. When asked about 
seeking new export orders, he replied that he wasn't especially 
troubled by this (there was a demand for his products), and that 
the main problem was filling the orders already placed, which 
was jeopardized by violations of cooperative deliveries. 
  This negative factor elicits serious apprehensions among our 
potential customers regarding the ability of CIS exporters to 
ensure dependable post-sales maintenance of the delivered weapon 
systems, which is extremely important to successful activity in 
the world arms market. 
  As a result of these and a number of other causes, some 
countries that have been traditional importers of Soviet 
armament are starting to actively seek alternative sources of 
deliveries. For example India, which was the biggest purchaser 
of Soviet armament (the latter represented 80 percent of India's 
military imports in 1987-1991), has been developing military and 
economic cooperation with Western countries in recent years, 
thus attempting to insure itself against possible failures of 
military deliveries from CIS states. Concurrently, capitalizing 
on the problems in our military-industrial complex, arms 
exporters in Eastern Europe are also rushing into the Indian 
market. For example, during a recent visit to Delhi by a 
high-placed Hungarian military delegation, it was announced that 
Hungary was prepared to supply India with spare parts and 
equipment for MiG airplanes as well as for T-55 and T-72 tanks. 
  Unfortunately, many of us who are concerned about 
proliferation of arms in the world believe the main threat in 
this sphere to be coming from the Russian military-industrial 
complex, which is striving to sell its state-of-the-art, 
competitive defensive products in the foreign market. But this 
is a deeply mistaken position, inasmuch as the solution to this 
problem must be approached under the conditions of strict 
parity, with all of the principal exporters and importers 
involved. Otherwise, tensions in certain regions of the world 
would not be reduced, inasmuch as other countries would deliver 
weapons there. In the meantime, not only will we fail to earn 
additional hard currency necessary to reform the Russian 
economy, but under the conditions of limiting defense orders to 
our own armed forces, ultimately we will transform from an arms 
exporter into an arms importer.

Makarevskiy, Russian Academy of Sciences World Economics and 
International Relations Institute Disarmament and Security 
Department, under rubric "We and Our Expectations: Militaria": 
"Military Reform Is Proceeding, But More Slowly Than One Would 
Like"] 
  [Text] Military reform in Russia is not someone's 
whim. It is an objective necessity, a response to changes which 
occurred in Europe and the former Soviet Union over the last 5-6 
years. 
  Back during 1989-1990, when sharp debates were going on 
about 
professionalization of the Army, when former heads of the 
Ministry of Defense flatly denied the need for conducting 
military reform, it essentially already had begun... 
  Its beginning was marked by the withdrawal of Soviet troops 
from Warsaw Pact member countries. Events were accelerated 
further by the dissolution of this military-political 
organization, reaching their culmination in 1991, when the 
Soviet Union itself disintegrated and the Russian Armed Forces 
were deprived of a strategic second echelon (the Baltic, 
Belarus, Ukraine). Thus, Russia's strategic troop grouping had 
to be created anew, and this, strictly speaking, is one of the 
main components of military reform. 
  Attempts to defend unified Union Armed Forces and then 
create 
unified CIS forces proved fruitless, and so establishment of a 
Russian Army and simultaneously the planned reform of existing 
military structures began in May 1992. The basic goal of 
military reform is a quality improvement in the Army under new 
geostrategic conditions, with consideration of Russia's new 
military doctrine and the reduction in troop numerical strength 
to optimum size. Its realization (difficult in itself) is taking 
place against the background of a sequence of problems, each of 
which also is rather complicated. It is the scheduled (and 
sometimes also unscheduled, but in any case massive) withdrawal 
of troops from abroad, the significant reduction in authorized 
personnel strength, the great personnel shortage in the troops, 
destruction of excessive combat equipment under the Paris 
Agreements, and conversion of military industry. 
  The principal difficulties of Armed Forces reform lie in 
this 
interlacing of problems being resolved simultaneously in a 
country experiencing political and economic crisis. They are 
exacerbated by the situation in countries of the near 
abroad--military conflicts in the Caucasus, Central Asia and 
Moldova, into which Russian troops have been drawn in one way or 
another. 
  The military reform plan was designed for 8-9 years and 
broken into three stages. We now are in the second stage 
(1993-1995). 
  Its task of creating a new strategic grouping of troops 
should be completed next year. 
  The next military reform task is to upgrade the intrabranch 
structure of troops in connection with the change in their 
stationing and the reduction in overall numerical strength of 
the Armed Forces to the level of two million persons, and to 
upgrade weapon and command and control systems (in particular, 
this means a transition from the "army-division" system to a 
"corps-brigade" system). 
  A reduction in troop numerical strength requires improved 
professional training of personnel. A serious problem arose over 
troop manpower acquisition, which can be solved only by 
combining a conventional call-up with acceptance of soldiers on 
a volunteer, contract basis. This problem is difficult to 
resolve. There are difficulties with the call-up because of the 
great indulgences established at one time by the former Supreme 
Soviet (essentially only one-fifth of the overall number of 
potential draftees enter the Army). Not everything is simple 
with acceptance under contract as well. The numerical strength 
of NCO's and contract privates was supposed to be 30 percent in 
1993, but this is only half fulfilled. On the one hand, there is 
a clear lack of funds. On the other hand, contract personnel 
want both to receive a decent salary and to have easier 
service--basically logistic and maintenance positions are being 
filled. Considerably fewer are willing to take combat positions. 
  Creation of mobile forces is an important element of 
military 
reform. At first the thought was to create two large groupings 
of mobile forces--Immediate Reaction Forces as a first echelon 
ready to act in a matter of hours, and Rapid Deployment Forces 
as a second echelon consisting of formations with heavier 
equipment (the numerical strength of each grouping is up to 
100,000-150,000 persons). It was planned to establish these 
forces in two military districts, Volga and Ural. The idea of 
creating such large mobile forces was connected with the fact 
that Russia now is incapable of keeping large troop groupings 
along all its immense borders. They began creating the mobile 
forces in 1993, but the initial plan now is being transformed. 
It is possible that the central mobile forces will be of lesser 
makeup, but on the other hand small mobile forces will be 
established in all military districts, above all Moscow, North 
Caucasus and others. 
  Of course, there were mobile forces in the makeup of the 
Soviet Armed Forces previously as well--above all these were the 
Airborne Troops and units of the Naval Infantry. The novelty of 
the present mobile forces concept lies in the fact that they 
must be interbranch in nature, have a wider range of weapons and 
have the capability of performing major operational-strategic 
missions independently. 
  One other element of military reform is a reform of troops 
on 
a territorial basis. By 1995 it is planned to establish the 
Joint Territorial Command headed by a commander-in-chief (in the 
rank of deputy minister of defense) in Komsomolsk-on-Amur. The 
goal is more effective command and control of all forces and 
assets in the Far East, including not only the Ground Troops, 
but also the Pacific Fleet, Air Force, Air Defense, and if 
necessary the Border Troops and Internal Security Forces. Then 
it is planned to set up such a command in Ulan-Ude for 
centralizing command and control in the Transbaykal and in 
Siberia. Reform of military structures in the North Caucasus was 
announced even earlier. This means that territorial commands 
operating within limits of certain territories of Russia and 
heading up the reform of Russian troops are being established in 
place of previous commanders-in-chief of axes, which in terms of 
operational purpose basically were aimed at the West. (They 
supported the command element of border military districts and 
groups of forces abroad). One can see in this the beginning of 
reorganization of branch structures of the Armed Forces. But a 
reform of branch structures is a very complicated matter. For 
example, an attempt to create unified Air Defense Forces based 
on Air Defense Troops and the Air Force in Ukraine ended in 
failure. The new command and control entity which had been 
established, numbering 250 generals, officers and warrant 
officers, was disbanded and everything returned to square one. 
  Finally, one of the most important tasks of military reform 
is to elevate the professional level of Armed Forces personnel. 
But as we already said, there are considerable difficulties here 
which cannot be overcome in a year or two. Draftees must come 
into the Army better trained and more mature. The viewpoint of a 
number of authoritative military persons who insist on raising 
the draft age to 19-21 is quite correct. Eighteen years is too 
"green" an age for military service. A draftee should begin 
service no earlier than age 19 and a volunteer from age 21, 
while also having all other qualities of a professional soldier 
(appropriate physical development, necessary level of education 
and so on). 
  There is a mass of objective and subjective difficulties in 
the path of military reform in Russia. I will risk declaring 
that not one major military power of modern time, nor Russia 
itself in the past, conducted military reforms under such 
difficult conditions in which the present Russian Federation now 
finds itself. 
  Reform unquestionably is under way, however, although not as 
fast or as vigorously as one would like. But the important thing 
still lies ahead: With a favorable development of events, a 
qualitative renewal of Russian Federation Armed Forces will 
materialize no earlier than 1996.

military sciences and professor; Colonel (Ret) P.N. Bobylev, 
candidate of historical sciences and docent; Captain 1st Rank 
(Ret) P.M. Shabardin, candidate of philosophical sciences; and 
Major-General S.I. Syedin, doctor of psychological sciences and 
professor: "A Conceptual Breakdown or Defamation the Past (On 
the Development and Problems of Russian Military Science)"] 
  [Text] Major changes in the world also largely affect 
military affairs, including problems of military history and 
practice. 
  Above all, I want to express concern over the decrease in 
interest of leaders of the Armed Forces and many officers in 
methodological problems of military science. Something is also 
being developed now. Fresh ideas are also being born. But a not 
entirely good tendency of isolating scientific thought from 
practical activities is emerging. 
  This also happened in the past, when much was determined a 
priori by political guidelines and the demand for new knowledge 
and ideas was rejected. However, today, unfortunately, this no 
longer involves only big leaders. At a recent conference of 
historians, we did not see even representatives of the editorial 
staff of the Military Encyclopedia, who more than others should 
be interested in a professional discussion of their problems. 
Such an arrogant self-isolation will in time make itself felt by 
a decrease in the quality of their labor and can be reflected in 
the accomplishment of tasks facing the Armed Forces of Russia. 
  A conclusion suggests itself. It is necessary, in my view, 
to 
attract more decisively the attention of the public and leading 
military personnel to this problem; constantly and on a high 
professional level show what specifically is being overlooked 
now due to underestimation of new ideas; and more thoroughly 
develop new scientific ideas and submit them for discussion by 
experts and the public. 
  A second problem that bothers me concerns sciences studying 
defense problems and war as a whole. Seemingly, scientific 
thought has convincingly proven that military science alone 
cannot study war as a complex socio-political phenomenon. By 
studying armed struggle alone, one cannot understand the essence 
and origin of wars. To do this, one must comprehend such matters 
as a society's economic system, processes of the birth of 
classes, the causes of contradictions between states, and so 
forth. But this, as we know, is not the subject of military 
science. 
  Before, in socialist countries it was customary to believe 
that general problems of war were revealed in the 
Marxist-Leninist doctrine on war and the army; other doctrines 
on war were ignored. Thus, the object and subject of knowledge 
narrowed substantially, and many very complex phenomena had to 
fit into the methodological framework of one doctrine alone. I 
am confident that war, like any other phenomenon, can be studied 
objectively by studying all doctrines and theories directly or 
indirectly concerning it, adopting the best that is in them. In 
Western countries, the science studying the general problems of 
war (its essence, origin, socio-political and economic 
fundamentals of military might, the army's role and place in 
society, and so forth) is called the study of war. In discussing 
these problems at the conference of historians, O.A. Belkov said 
that they could study military politology. It was planned to 
legitimize the concept of "philosophy of war" or "general theory 
of war." But these terms, in my view, do not fully express the 
essence of the problems. 
  Military politology is legitimate only as a component part 
of 
general politology. But in the cognition of war one encounters 
not only political but also philosophical, economic, and social 
problems. Thus, general knowledge about war can be known based 
on comprehensive studies of various sciences. The term "general 
doctrine on war and the army" is more accurate. 
  Now about the topic of military science. Recently, people 
have appeared who have poor knowledge about the essence of the 
question they are trying to interpret in their own way. 
  There are opinions about the need to include in the topic of 
military science political and economic problems and knowledge 
of other sciences (physics, cybernetics, geography, and others). 
The article "What Is Military Science?" was published in the 
journal VOYENNAYA MYSL. In particular, the author writes that to 
solve the "entire set of problems facing military science, it is 
necessary to know...economic, social, ecological, demographic, 
and other aspects of war, and the corresponding sections of 
military science engage in this." It further emphasizes: "It is 
known that whereas a field of knowledge has an object and 
subject for cognition and its own laws, this is a science 
according to all parameters, and the social order for knowledge 
of this science determines its affiliation--in this case 
military."[.sup]1[/] It must be said that we have not 
encountered for a long time now any examples of a more dense 
ignorance in our military press. If you assume that such an 
approach would be adopted by science, this would give rise to 
complete confusion in classification of scientific knowledge. 
  Indeed, it is necessary to know and take into account the 
economic, ecological, and other aspects of war. The Ministry of 
Defense needs knowledge gleaned from various sciences, and 
military science uses it. This is the essence of interaction and 
mutual penetration of sciences. But it is impossible and 
illegitimate to include physics, mathematics, and other fields 
of knowledge in military science just because they are used in 
military affairs. 
  People who react so frivolously to resolving methodological 
problems do not understand that sciences must not be classified 
arbitrarily. They differ primarily according to the subject for 
cognition and those objective phenomena and laws which they are 
able to experience. 
  Warfare, armed forces, methods of preparing and conducting 
combat operations by them in modern conditions, taking into 
account prospects of development, are the subject of military 
science. 
  War and armed struggle are a two-sided phenomenon in which 
both sides deal with common laws, principles, and objective 
phenomena. Therefore, military science is unified, and its 
previous division into "Soviet" or "bourgeois" is artificial. 
  Openness of military science, military cooperation with 
other 
countries, and exchange of knowledge are important today. 
Unfortunately, recently we have stopped publishing military 
literature in general, and books by foreign authors are not 
being translated or published, although even during the 
"stagnant" years we had the opportunity to read Manstein, 
Guderian, Eisenhower, and others. We need to know foreign 
military literature. Without this we cannot acquire full-fledged 
military knowledge. I would also like to express the desire that 
questions of methodology of military theory and practice be 
studied more thoroughly at military academies and thus increase 
the overall culture of the officer corps. Moreover, it is 
impossible to plan and organize military-scientific work and 
scientifically compile training programs without precisely 
defining the subject and content of military science and the 
military problems of other sciences. 
  Finally, not only are the methodological reference points 
changing. Many new problems of military science are arising 
which require the soonest possible study. For example, at the 
conference, all the historians agreed that nuclear war is 
impossible. 
  The viewpoint on the unlikelihood of a conventional world 
war 
in the near future is also well-founded. Achieving political 
objectives by using military force will now be accomplished 
basically by three methods: setting limited objectives and 
accomplishing them successively in local wars; subversive 
operations against other countries; indirect strategic 
operations. 
  All our military theory, field manuals, and training 
literature are oversaturated with developments of waging nuclear 
and conventional world wars. Obviously, the fundamentals of 
nuclear planning should also change. In our view, it will have 
to be limited to the elaboration of the fundamentals of nuclear 
deterrence and methods of armed struggle calling for the use of 
armed forces in local wars and in a major conventional war, but 
taking into account the threat of possible use of nuclear 
weapons. 
  In this regard, many new questions arise in the area of 
organizational development and training of armed forces, on 
which, in our view, the main efforts in military-scientific work 
should be concentrated. 
  General of the Army M.A. Gareyev, doctor of military 
sciences, professor 
  Military-historical science (like all historical science in 
our country) is in a deep crisis. The problem of cadres of 
military historians and also of military-historical work among 
personnel of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation also 
remains acute. The tasks placed before military-historical 
science by life are intense, serious, and diverse. Many of them 
cannot be accomplished in a few months, but they must not be put 
off. 
  The most difficult problem at this stage is eliminating 
"blank spaces" in military history, particularly of the Soviet 
period. We also do not now have a complete picture of their 
amount, although in recent years quite a bit was said in 
articles on historical topics. One of the immediate practical 
tasks, in our opinion, is a historiographic assessment of 
all that has been done in the area of military history, 
particularly recently. Now, when many previously 
inaccessible documents have become known, it turned out that the 
"official history" was truncated according to a number of 
parameters, far from reality. Historians were authorized to work 
with those documents and publish those works which "worked" for 
the society's political system that existed until recently and 
increased its prestige. Everything negative in the life of the 
country and army was carefully metered out in doses, and 
everything unfavorable was covered up, hushed up. When something 
secret suddenly became open, it was denied with persistence 
deserving of better use (as was the case with the secret 
protocol to the Soviet-German Non-aggression Treaty of 23 August 
1939). So, almost everything new in scientific-historical 
publications of recent years is the "negative" that was hidden 
earlier, which (it is important to emphasize this) is also a 
part of our history. 
  Unfortunately, publication of such facts and documents 
earlier unknown to science often resulted in their authors being 
labeled as "slanderers" by those who wanted to know only that 
history which was presented to us all the preceding years. 
  It should be noted that today, too, researchers are not 
confident that they are writing "the entire truth," since access 
to many fundamentally important documents has been made 
difficult up to now. As we know, a whole set of facts is often 
required in order to prove something, but only one fact or 
document is enough to refute this same thing (for example, in 
the case of the above-mentioned secret protocol). Therefore, the 
likelihood is great that the historical concepts developed today 
may prove to be unsound in the near future after the appearance 
of new information about which we do not yet know and about 
whose scientific importance we cannot even guess. However, this 
does not mean that historians have to wait until "everything is 
known." 
  An urgent practical task, in our view, is the creation 
of such works which would outline the current vision of problems 
of the country's military history, particularly its Soviet 
period, based on already accessible documents and 
materials. Accomplishing this task, to our regret, is made 
extremely complicated by the state of publishing in our country. 
But this is the topic for a special conversation. 
  Of course, the search for new archival documents and 
materials with their subsequent publication must be stepped 
up to create new works. A beginning has been set for this: the 
publishing center TERRA published a transcript of the December 
(1940) meeting of the top command personnel of the Red Army. It 
was prepared for press by associates of the Institute of 
Military History and the Russian State Military Archives. Next 
was a publication of collections of documents of the State 
Defense Committee, the General Headquarters of the Supreme High 
Command, the people's defense commissar, and other leadership 
bodies of the USSR Armed Forces during the Great Patriotic War. 
These collections will include declassified documents and 
materials not published before. Their publication will make it 
possible to take a new look at problems which seemed solved long 
ago, eliminate many "blank spaces," and help create objective 
scientific works about the Great Patriotic War. Certainly, 
introducing a huge mass of new documents into scientific 
circulation will mean a real breakthrough in elaborating such 
works. 
  As far as military history instruction at military academies 
and schools is concerned, the requirements of training programs 
to provide students (officer cadets) with "in-depth and sound 
knowledge of military history" will remain a good desire. The 
number of training hours allotted to a subject (up to 50 hours 
in schools and up to 150 hours in academies) does not permit 
this. In addition, the unending process of "shortening" the 
subject continues. The unsound practice existing at some 
military educational institutions, when up to 75 percent of the 
training time is allocated to group types of classes, is faulty. 
With a lack of new textbooks, they do not produce the desired 
results. In these conditions, more time must be allotted 
to lectures. For only in this way can we effectively summarize 
new material on the military history on Russia and convey it to 
the students. 
  Finally, it is necessary to analyze military history as 
a science. For the time being, it is only declared that 
military history includes the history of wars, the history of 
military art, the history of organizational development of the 
armed forces, the history of military equipment, and the history 
of military thought, as well as a number of auxiliary 
disciplines. However, none of these component parts (other than 
the history of military art) so far has been elaborated in 
scientific terms and presented not only in the form of a book 
but even a good scientific-theoretical article. I think that, in 
this regard, an extensive field of activity is opening up for 
those who are involved with general problems of military history 
and its methodology. 
  Colonel (Ret) P.N. Bobylev, candidate of historical 
sciences, docent 
  One of the most important component parts of organizational 
development of the Russian Armed Forces--military 
education--is in need of a scientifically sound concept 
today. Successful resolution of this problem is impossible 
without combining the efforts of representatives of various 
fields of military knowledge. In working up a concept of 
education, it is necessary, above all, to take into account the 
radical nature and depth of army reforms being conducted and 
planned as a whole. 
  In these conditions, the novelty, complexity, and 
responsibility of resolving educational problems lie in the fact 
that the efficient and actively operating system of 
ideological-political, moral, and psychological training of 
servicemen that was developed over decades in the USSR Armed 
Forces had actually collapsed. A rejection of many 
once-unwavering theoretical and ideological dogmas followed. 
Many traditional forms and methods of educational work have been 
significantly constricted. 
  Re-creation of the education system has begun and is being 
accomplished with a search for the corresponding spiritual and 
moral reference points that are acceptable for the new Russia 
and its practically new army. Much from the historical past, 
especially the Soviet past, has to be rejected in this process. 
At the same time, much inevitably will have to be preserved, 
something forced to "remove anew," and enrich the current system 
of spiritual values with something. 
  In terms of content, the spiritual and moral values and 
reference points are to draw in, on the one hand, all the 
natural and historical experience of education and, on the 
other, everything new emerging from modern public life evolving 
in the direction of democratization and humanization of public 
relations in the country and the world as a whole. 
  The system of spiritual and moral values and reference 
points 
of military service have always included moral norms and ideals. 
Today, honesty, a high degree of patriotism, heroism, 
discipline, and so forth remain the moral norms of the defender 
of the fatherland. 
  In preserving the in-depth fundamentals, the ideals of 
military service today need to be freed from archaisms, 
pseudo-values, and utopianism. Above all, the patriotic idea of 
serving the homeland, enriched with democratic ideals, universal 
values, and the principle of the supremacy of human rights must 
emerge in a naturally primordial form. 
  Faith. It is more complicated. But since the human psyche, 
including the psyche of a solder, is impossible without faith, 
here a very broad field of activity is opening up for military 
psychologists. Pluralism of religion is to enrich a soldier's 
spiritual and moral ideals. 
  By no means does the process of freeing a soldier's 
consciousness from the syndrome of "class struggle," "class 
morality," "image of an enemy," and other ideological guidelines 
of communist-totalitarian thinking mean that the emphasis in 
educational work with servicemen can be placed only on fostering 
loving feelings for everything and a peaceful nature merging 
with the worst variants of pacifism. 
  A soldier is called upon to know, understand, and sharply 
sense the watershed between good and evil, nobility and 
meanness, true and false patriotism, and identify and understand 
such anti-democratic, anti-humane social phenomena as racism, 
fascism, terrorism, aggression, and so forth. 
  Acquiring and assimilating moral norms and ideals by 
soldiers 
in the process of education can become the basis not only of 
their truly patriotic activities but also spiritual immunity 
with respect to any irrational misanthropic ideas which may be 
in use in the military environment in conditions of the often 
vulgar understanding of pluralism of ideas, views, and opinions. 
  A system of specialized bodies in the Army and Navy, putting 
into practice new forms and methods of individual and group 
(collective) education, is called upon to serve the new content 
of the spiritual and moral makeup of the Army. 
  In doing so, military researchers have grounds for a most 
attentive attitude toward structural elements of educational 
work already created or being created or, as it is now called, 
work with personnel in the Russian Armed Forces. It seems to me 
there is a real danger of a mechanical inheritance of many 
organizational principles, forms, and methods of this work from 
the recent past, the negative results of which are obvious. In 
particular, the primitive didactic principle of education widely 
used in the recent past is not very effective and does not reach 
the heart of today's young person. It must be replaced by rich 
pluralistic information activities and promotion of 
self-education. 
  I am confident that practical resolution of such important 
problems of education needs a revival of the progressive Russian 
military-pedagogical school and true reform of training military 
educators at all levels. Recent political workers in the Army 
and Navy from the Marxist-Leninist and communist school were not 
notable for their educational ability, since both in schools and 
academies they were trained according to the 
"jack-of-all-trades" principle. Experts of the human soul of 
this sort during the course of reforms must make room for true 
professionals of spiritual and moral education of servicemen. In 
turn, special educational institutions, faculties, and 
departments of a military-pedagogical, military-psychological, 
and military-historical orientation are called upon to engage in 
training them. At the same time, taking into account the 
steadfastness of the principle of one-man command in the armed 
forces, commanders of all ranks are to possess 
military-psychological and military-pedagogical knowledge and 
skills. 
  The fundamental and multiple-aspect nature of problems of 
military education require an initial conceptual basis. The 
concept of education in turn cannot but take into account such 
factors as the scientific-theoretical substantiation of value 
reference points of education, the sum total of spiritual and 
moral norms and ideals being cultivated, and, finally, the 
qualitative state of the specific object of education. Its 
development is possible only on the scale of the state through 
the collective efforts of researchers and practical workers. The 
basis for this, it seems to us, has been created. Above all, the 
new Constitution of the Russian Federation and Russia's military 
doctrine must become the legal reference points of military 
education as a whole. 
  Captain 1st Rank (Ret) P.M. Shabardin, candidate of 
philosophical sciences 
  Military psychology is not among the generally recognized 
social-humanities disciplines comprising the methodological 
basis of organizational development of the armed forces. But at 
the same time, it is generally known that a modern army and navy 
cannot be built without psychology. The experience of the 
Russian Army is evidence of this. It is recorded in the Military 
Encyclopedia, published in 1912 in St. Petersburg and edited by 
I.D. Sytin, that in view of the complexities of military 
affairs, the study of it is broken down into a whole series of 
studies comprising the task of specific sciences. This should 
include, above all, tactics and military psychology. 
  Military education "on the one hand, should rely on 
conclusions of a person's psychology and physiology and, on the 
other, a study of the internal and external nature of 
war."[.sup]2[/] 
  A department of military psychology was formed in the 
Russian 
Army in 1908 under a society of ardent supporters of military 
knowledge. It had the task of developing military psychology as 
a branch of general and military sciences studying the best 
training and use of the psychic aspect--forces, means, and 
methods of armed struggle.[.sup]3[/] 
  At the same time, I would like to note the paradoxical 
aspect 
in the development of military psychology in recent years. 
Before reforming the political bodies in the armed forces into 
military-political bodies and then into structures for work with 
personnel at the Military Political Academy (today the Academy 
of the Humanities), three educational psychological disciplines 
were taught: military psychology--for officer political workers; 
military psychology and methods of its instruction--for officer 
instructors of military psychology; psychology of higher 
military school--for instructors in other humanities disciplines. 
  Today, the cycle of educational and psychological 
disciplines 
being taught at the academy includes such subjects as the 
history of psychology, general psychology, social psychology, 
military psychology, psycho-physiology, age psychology, 
psycho-hygiene and psycho-therapy of military service, 
experimental psychology, psychology of pedagogical activities, 
professiology, and methods of teaching psychology. A number of 
special courses have been introduced (psychology of conflicts, 
medical psychology, psychology and interrelations, and others). 
  Skilled training programs and subject plans have been 
compiled for all educational disciplines. But here is what is 
surprising: at the military academy, the training program and 
subject plan were particularly poorly developed for the 
"military psychology" discipline. This was the result of the 
fact that many topics of a historical-psychological, general 
psychological, social-psychological, and other nature "went" 
into related educational disciplines, where they also were to be 
"registered" according to content. That is, the person "went" 
with his psychic phenomena, the collective "went" with the 
socio-psychological characteristics, and the content of military 
psychology faded. 
  Such a situation even further increased the need to resolve 
the question on the subject of military psychology. Is there a 
need for military psychology to include all the topics of 
general, social, and other divisions of psychology, having made 
only a corresponding verbal balancing act? Experience shows that 
the answer is no. Military psychology today as a scientific 
discipline is increasingly developing into the psychology of 
stress situations. It includes three main divisions: preparing 
for the behavior and actions of servicemen in stress (combat) 
situations; control and self-control of the mental state of 
servicemen, their behavior, and actions in stress situations; 
psychological rehabilitation of servicemen after coming out of 
stress situations (after stress-causing pressure). 
  In the course of these directions, a number of original and 
interesting studies have been conducted at the department of 
psychology at the Academy of the Humanities. Thus, B.I. 
Khoziyev, candidate of psychological sciences and docent, 
performed work to increase the quality of training (combat 
training) of military specialists of various fields. Colonel 
S.M. Zakharik defended a dissertation on the theme "Forming 
Psychological Stability of Paratroopers to the Influence of 
Factors of Modern Combat." Lieutenant Colonel V.Ye. Popov is 
successfully studying the problem of psychological orientation 
of servicemen after extreme pressure. A number of other works 
can also be cited that merit attention. 
  In conclusion, I would like to note that, in our view, 
military psychology is on the verge of a stage of qualitative 
development, summarization of earlier results, and breaking up 
its content during the course of modern research into a new 
scientific discipline--military psychology of stress situations.

sciences and professor

"Turkey's Defense Minister Has Arrived in Moscow"] 
  [Text] On 20 April Minister of Defense of the Republic of 
Turkey Mehmet Gelhan arrived in Moscow on an official visit. 
  As is the custom in the West, the 65-year-old Gelhan is not 
a 
professional military man but a politician. He was one of the 
founders of the ruling Correct Way Party in Turkey. Prior to 
being appointed to his present post, he served as minister of 
state in the Tansu Ciler Cabinet. 
  By a convergence of circumstances the visit by the head of 
the Turkish military ministry to Russia coincided with a drastic 
exacerbation of the situation in the former Yugoslavia, as well 
as with stepped-up activities between Azerbaijan and Armenia. 
Since Turkey has interests in both areas, it has proposed its 
own alternatives for resolving the conflict. This set of issues 
will undoubtedly be the primary subject of discussion during 
talks with Russia's military leadership. 
  The main purpose of the visit, however, is still one of 
further developing bilateral technical military cooperation. It 
is no secret that a significant portion of the armament of 
Turkey's army does not measure up to contemporary requirements, 
and Turkey is interested in modernizing them with new purchases 
abroad. in October 1992 Turkey was the first NATO country to 
conclude an agreement with Russia on shipments of weapons and 
combat equipment, including helicopters and armored equipment. 
In May of last year the heads of the military ministries of the 
two countries signed a memorandum of mutual understanding 
calling for bilateral cooperation in the areas of military 
training and the defense industry. 
  The signing of these agreements, especially the former, 
evoked a clear-cut reaction in the West. However, from all 
accounts, it will not pose an obstacle to the development of 
interaction between Russia and Turkey in the military area.

"Political Decisions Are Essential for the Establishment of 
Russian Bases in the CIS"] 
  [Text] On the afternoon of 20 
April Army General Pavel Grachev, Russia's minister of defense, 
met with Turkey's Defense Minister Mehmet Gelhan. 
  During the discussion the sides covered bilateral 
interaction 
in the military area within the framework of the UN, the CIS and 
on an independent basis. The problem of flank limitations on 
arms and equipment for Russia in the south as a result of the 
collapse of the Soviet Union and the establishment of the 
Commonwealth of Independent States was raised during the 
meeting. Also discussed were issues pertaining to settlement of 
the Bosnian problem, the Armenian-Azerbaijani military conflict 
and implementation of the Treaty on Collective Security for the 
CIS States. 
  Among other things, Pavel Grachev declared that the Russian 
Federation would establish bases in the CIS states with their 
agreement. According to him, there will be three bases in 
Georgia and one in Armenia. It is planned to locate in 
Azerbaijan a Russian military facility needed by all the CIS 
states. It involves the Gaballa facility, a station for the 
prevention of a missile attack. The Russian Federation's 
minister of defense also reported that political decisions and 
the appropriate legal basis are essential for establishing 
Russian bases in the CIS countries. 
  At the culmination of the talks there was a ceremonial 
signing of a Russian-Turkish intergovernmental agreement on 
cooperation in the military-political area. 
  On 21 April Russia's First Deputy Minister of Defense Andrey 
Kokoshin met with Turkey's Defense Minister Mehmet Gelhan. 
  The meeting covered problems pertaining to the development 
of 
the situation in the Transcaucasus and Yugoslavia. It discussed 
prospects for the peaceful settlement of the conflicts. Also 
discussed were issues pertaining to the practical implementation 
of an agreement just signed by the defense ministers of Russia 
and Turkey.

"The First Bell For Pyongyang: The Defense Ministers of the 
Russian Federation and South Korea Have Signed a Declaration of 
Cooperation"] 
  [Text] Yesterday in Moscow the ministers of defense of 
Russia and South Korea (Republic of Korea) signed a Declaration 
of Cooperation and a Memorandum on Mutual Understanding in 
Military Affairs between the Ministry of Defense of the Russian 
Federation and the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Korea. 
"We have agreed to cooperate even more," said General Grachev. 
South Korea and Russia also officially expressed their 
satisfaction with the level of understanding achieved in the 
spirit of a similar declaration previously signed. 
  Moscow proposed, and this was supported in principle in 
Seoul, that a joint group of experts in the military-political 
area be set up to develop the concept of a system of collective 
security in the Asia-Pacific region. General Grachev hopes to 
draw experts from other interested countries into such 
consultations of experts (the USA, China, North Korea and 
others). 
  Pavel Grachev expressed "concern over the situation of 
nuclear affairs in North Korea." Moscow considers Pyongyang's 
withdrawal from the Treaty on Nonproliferation of Nuclear 
Weapons to be extremely undesirable. In the future certain 
measures "to influence" (pressure) North Korea are possible, 
fairly mild ones at first. This extremely friendly reception of 
the Minister of Defense of the Republic of Korea in Moscow is 
obviously the first bell for Pyongyang. 
  General Lee Byung Tae announced that "we have found a common 
point of view on those measures which must be taken to prevent 
the situation in the region from deteriorating. North Korea must 
remain within the Treaty on Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons 
and become a full and, most important, a responsible member of 
the international community." 
  Pavel Grachev accepted an official invitation to visit Korea 
in '95. Russia's minister expressed his hope that it would be 
possible at that time to sign agreements on closer cooperation 
with South Korea, including agreements in the technical military 
area. General Lee Byung Tae, in turn, promised to do everything 
possible to see that a future visit by our minister to Seoul 
would be fruitful. 
  Recently the Japanese press has written extensively about 
the 
sale of old Russian submarines to North Korea for scrap through 
the intermediary of a Japanese company. Feliks Gromov, 
commander-in-chief of the Russian Federation's Navy, however, 
has assured a SEGODNYA corespondent that this matter "was not 
raised" at all in the talks with South Korea's defense minister. 
All of official Seoul's attention is focused on Pyongyang's 
possible nuclear armament. Old submarines are apparently of 
interest only to the journalists.

<H5>  Preface </H5>
  I once had occasion to hear the usual, grumbling squabble of 
two old women, contemporaries of Soviet power. It was about some 
everyday matters, about a faucet that was not working, about a 
torn up country road... But one sentence struck me: "No matter 
what you want, during peacetime the rural soviet did nothing..." 
  Peacetime! 
  Does that mean that these old Russian women, who have seen 
much, equate today to wartime?.. 
  On the other hand, why wouldn't they? Throughout the remote 
parts of the country that have become independent, real blood is 
being shed. Army units have found themselves in a real ambush in 
many places. Bursts of automatic weapons are heard on streets 
that just recently were peaceful. 
  Is today peacetime? It can be argued that it is wartime. But 
the fact that people in the military have begun to play a far 
more noticeable role today--in politics, parliaments, and power 
structures--is a noteworthy characteristic of our days. Some of 
them were drawn into politics--as such a powerful force as the 
army could not help but be drawn into politics. Some broke into 
politics in an attempt to make a reality of their own ideas and 
notions about the country's future. Some came, having been 
elected to bodies of power, and found their path here. And some 
simply were continuing to serve, but it was here at their duty 
station that they became well known. 
  Well-known military leaders of Russia is the subject of this 
book, the first in the "40 x 40" series devoted to all those 
whose names are in the newspaper, who influence the lives and 
destinies of millions, and who to their own degree form reality. 
  Alksnis and Yazov, Lopatin and Grachev, Lebed and Kasatonov, 
these names one way or another will remain in the history of 
recent years. But who are these people? How did they grow up, 
where did they serve, what do they believe in, and what do they 
hope for? Few know these things. 
  We have tried to fill this gap. The basis for this book was 
information gathered over recent years by the Dossier Service of 
the Aleksandr Information and Publishing Firm and the Institute 
of Mass Political Movements of the RAU-Press Agency. These data 
were collected from various sources: from the press, from 
comments and recollections of colleagues, and from statements of 
the heroes of this book themselves. The authors of the book 
wanted to depart from rigid biographical outlines given in 
various reference books. This book attempts to fill the classic 
principle of "who is who" with some living portrait traits, 
comments of knowledgeable people, and little-known details 
giving a picture of the people being described here. 
  For events are not simply actions. They are also characters. 
  In the series "40 x 40", we plan to tell, of course, not 
only 
about "who is who" among today's officers and generals. 
Materials are being prepared for the same type of book on 
politicians; there are plans to publish the biographies of 
well-known entrepreneurs, church figures, and leaders of parties 
and national movements. And every time this will be 40 of the 
most well-known people in their field, real "players." The "40 x 
40" concept belongs to Russia, but we plan to talk not only 
about Russians but also well-known figures of other republics of 
the former USSR, both present and past. 
  These publications may be ordered in advance, and the 
address 
for accepting orders can be found in the back of this book. We 
will also be happy to hear your suggestions and remarks. 
  We wish you the very best! 
  The Authors 
<H5>  Anatoliy Alekseyevich Alekseyev </H5>
  This person can justifiably be called both an antipode and 
the double of the Chairman of the Movement for Social Protection 
of Servicemen "Shchit," Vitaliy Urazhtsev. Even their work was 
similar--after Captain 1st Rank Anatoliy Alekseyev was appointed 
chairman of the Committee for Affairs of Servicemen and Their 
Family Members under the president of the USSR in September 
1991. In essence, he became a lucky competitor of the founders 
of the independent movement for social protection "Shchit"--at 
least luckily receiving such a reliable presidential "cover." 
  Anatoliy Alekseyev was born in Pskov Oblast on 1 January 
1950. He graduated from the Leningrad Higher Naval Engineering 
School imeni F.E. Dzerzhinskiy in 1972. He served in the Pacific 
Fleet 12 years. In 1984, he was transferred to Kronstadt as an 
instructor of Navy technicians, where in 1990 he was elected as 
a people's deputy of Russia. He worked as chairman of a 
commission of the RSFSR Supreme Soviet investigating the deaths 
and injuries of servicemen and military construction workers and 
protecting their legal rights and interests. He was a captain 3d 
rank. 
  In September 1991, he (and also V. Lopatin, a well-known 
military reformer, and Alekseyev's deputy, Leonid Glushchak) "as 
an exception" was promoted a grade for services in defense of 
the "White House." This took place, however, without the 
necessary command recommendations. There were only two 
applications. Glushchak asked for a commendation for Alekseyev, 
and Alekseyev asked for one for Glushchak. 
  In March 1992, the general procurator of Russia, Valentin 
Stepankov, protested these orders as issued "with violations of 
the requirements of existing legislation" and demanded that they 
be rescinded. 
  In early May 1992, the commander in chief of the Combined 
Armed Forces of the CIS, Marshal of Aviation Yevgeniy 
Shaposhnikov, rescinded his orders. And A. Alekseyev ceased 
being a captain 1st rank, and L. Glushchak ceased being a 
colonel of justice (NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 7 May 92, KRASNAYA 
ZVEZDA 6 May 92). 
  The political career of A. Alekseyev was seriously 
complicated by the position of the Movement of Soldiers' 
Mothers, which more than once demanded Alekseyev's resignation 
and even organized a hunger strike at the RSFSR Supreme Soviet 
building in order to achieve this resignation. True, among those 
close to this circle of specialists there exists the conviction 
that Urazhtsev, the leader of "Shchit," was behind this 
demand... True or not, USSR President M.S. Gorbachev, "taking 
into account the appeal of the congress of the `Soldiers' 
Mothers of Russia' movement and the opinion of servicemen's 
parents," decreed "to declare it inadvisable for candidates for 
the position of chairman of the Committee for Affairs of 
Servicemen and Their Family Members under the USSR president to 
be seen as interested in public associations" (that is, to all 
intents and purposes, `Shchit,' as number one on this list) and 
suspended the powers of committee chairman Alekseyev. 
  At the Second Extraordinary Congress of the All-Union 
Council 
of Parents of Servicemen, convened at the initiative of the USSR 
president in order "once and for all to unite all movements of 
soldiers' parents and develop a common program of actions." 
Anatoliy Alekseyev, already chairman of the All-Union Council of 
Servicemen's Parents, offered to remove from the meeting the 
leader of "Shchit," his colleague in the Russian Parliament, 
RSFSR People's Deputy Vitaliy Urazhtsev... 
  Russian President Boris Yeltsin settled the dispute, 
abolishing Alekseyev's committee on 6 May 1992, which by that 
time had become a Russian committee, and decreed to create a 
corresponding new committee in Russia's Ministry of Defense 
(without Alekseyev). 
  Alekseyev believes that "Commander-in-Chief Shaposhnikov 
exerted every effort to remove the committee." "When the 
committee was created, Shaposhnikov jokingly said: If such a 
committee will be created and is headed by Alekseyev, who will 
control me, I will put in for retirement" (NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 
15 May 92). 
  Alekseyev ended up in "retirement" first. "But we will not 
give up," stated the chairman of the abolished committee. "As 
long as I am chairman of the Council of CIS Servicemen's 
Parents, I will fight negative phenomena in the Army." 
  Soldiers' Mothers and members of the Council of CIS 
Servicemen's Parents told of the support given them by the 
committee--an outlet for parents, and the chairman personally 
and solemnly promised to help defend the committee, for which 
"they will do everything." All the more so because the council 
is already receiving letters with threats of self-immolation if 
the president does not repeal his decree (NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 15 
May 92). 
<H5>  Viktor Imantovich Alksnis </H5>
  Perhaps few officers have played such a significant role in 
politics of recent years. Few could like USSR People's Deputy 
Colonel Viktor Alksnis, almost a symbolic figure for the entire 
ideological trend. As a result, few have been attacked so 
harshly by political opponents as he. Except for his antithesis, 
although representing the other flank, and also a symbol--Telman 
Gdlyan. 
  Viktor Imantovich Alksnis is Latvian, but was born in 
Siberia 
in 1950. His grandfather, Yakov Ivanovich Alksnis, a party 
member since 1916 and a Red division commissar during the Civil 
War, served up to 1931 to the post of chief of the Red Army Air 
Force. Like many military leaders of his rank, he was repressed 
and executed in 1938. A little earlier, this inhabitant of flat 
No. 100 in the "House on the Quay" himself, as a member of a 
special military presence, had participated in the trial of his 
friend Marshal Tukhachevskiy. A transcript of this case was 
confiscated from him during the arrest. In the words of family 
members, in his final months of his freedom Ya.I. Alksnis did 
not give up on it, trying to understand how such a thing could 
have happened. 
  After Khrushchev's rehabilitation of the victims of 
Stalinism, the family of Viktor Alksnis returned home to Riga in 
1957. 
  Alksnis tells little about his childhood, but it is known 
that it was similar to the childhood of almost all offspring of 
new Bolshevik families--it is unimportant from one or another 
side of the rifle sight or camp barbed wire: With the spark of 
his grandfather's glory, with the quiet whisper behind the back, 
and with archives and memoirs of relatives who told something 
different than the textbooks. And with attempts at comprehending 
what has taken place... 
  Viktor Alksnis followed the military path of his ancestor. 
He 
graduated from the Riga Higher Military Aviation Engineering 
School imeni... It is appropriate to interrupt here, for the 
future military engineer each day passed by a plaque bearing the 
name of his rehabilitated Ya.I. Alksnis. 
  His military occupational specialty was radio engineer. In 
the last years before the stormy start of his political career, 
he serviced MiG-29 aircraft. He served in the Baltic Military 
District: He was a senior engineer-inspector of a military unit 
in Riga. 
  On the wave of Gorbachev's perestroyka, Viktor Imantovich 
Alksnis was drawn into politics. In 1989 he became a USSR 
people's deputy and participated in the work of the first 
congress of deputies. At that time and later, he made the 
following statements: 
  "Today we all--communists, social democrats, constitutional 
democrats, monarchists--are citizens of a great country. It is 
our duty to preserve this country and pass it on to our children 
and grandchildren... Destruction of the USSR will bring a 
terrible threat to every family, every person. Collapse of the 
USSR is a threat to the whole world." 
  "I am a communist, but long ago I favored a multiparty 
system. I consider this to be a sign of a rule-of-law state." 
  Observers consider 16 November 1990 to be the peak of his 
career, when at a session of the USSR Supreme Soviet he gave the 
president an ultimatum to put order in the country within 30 
days. 
  It was at this time, in the words of Alksnis, that M. 
Gorbachev authorized the KGB to tap his telephone (at the Moscow 
Hotel). Excerpts from the transcript of the tap were 
systematically reported to Gorbachev, and he even made notes on 
them. All materials were stored in the safe of Valeriy Boldin, 
former director of the USSR President's staff, who was arrested 
under the case of the State Committee for the State of Emergency 
[GKChP]. The materials were confiscated by the Russian 
Procurator's Office. 
  According to his political views, Alksnis sided with the 
communists, whose main goal was to preserve the USSR namely as a 
union of Soviet and socialist republics. Alksnis instantly 
distanced himself from the increasingly radical positions of his 
Latvian colleagues and somehow imperceptibly fell from the 
political palette of his republic. Therefore, few were surprised 
when in 1991 he became co-chairman of the deputy group 
"Soyuz"--the same group that most consistently expressed the 
power-communist views of advocates of the USSR. And in 
accordance with the logic of political struggle, Alksnis 
actively opposed any impulses to revise the country's 
nation-state system: "What is to be done with the signing of the 
Union Treaty? It will not be signed at all. This is a tale for 
small children... The treaty will not work, just as the ideas of 
republic cost-accounting, constitutional oversight, the 
presidency..." 
  Under the ever-increasing polarization of public life 
between 
democracy, recognizing the right of nations to 
self-determination, and communism--having begun to seize 
positions in national movements, but officially advocating a 
unified USSR, Alksnis began to cooperate actively with the most 
radical forces demanding to restore power almost by armed means: 
"We must create a market economy, but political stability in the 
country is needed to do this. A strong hand must sweep away all 
customs barriers in the path to a market economy. 
  "I see imposing a state of emergency throughout the country 
as the only solution. A Committee of National Salvation should 
be formed on a coalition basis. Let it include left-wingers, 
right-wingers, and centrists. One condition--reject fighting on 
ideological matters (socialism, capitalism, and so forth) for 
the sake of saving a unified federative state. The congress 
should transfer all executive and legislative powers to this 
committee and disband for the period of forming the market, 
about 5-10 years." 
  It is not by chance, therefore, that Alksnis supported the 
August GKChP--not Yanayev himself, then at least the goals of 
the putsch organizers. He assessed the collapse of the coup this 
way: "This was a difficult defeat during those August days. But 
as a military man, I also know army wisdom: Losing one 
engagement does not mean losing the battle; losing the battle 
does not mean losing the campaign; and losing the campaign does 
not mean losing the war. Therefore, it is not evening yet." 
Already in July 1992, he confirmed this confidence with a 
statement made over television that he "was helping in every way 
by non-parliamentary means to overthrow the current government," 
and unless an armed coup becomes the staging like the putsch of 
the GKChP, he certainly would take part in it. 
  Together with the radical journalist Aleksandr Nevzorov, he 
heads the Russian Liberation Movement "Nashi," which emerged 
after the army action to seize the Vilnius television center in 
1991. He became one of the organizers of the Sixth Congress of 
the USSR People's Deputies "in the underground," which demanded 
restoration of the USSR, rejection of "capitalization" of the 
economy, and so forth. Alksnis also had a quite specific 
position with respect to the armed forces: "If Russia has an 
army, this will be the finale both for Russia and the Union. 
Today the former USSR is personified practically only by the 
army. Russia's attempt to take the armed forces under its 
jurisdiction will lead only to more destabilization in society, 
to exacerbation of relations between the republics and Russia..." 
  Lately, Viktor Alksnis is rarely seen on the pages of the 
press, on speaker's platforms, or at rallies. However, the 
majority of analysts will not hide far away their folders of 
excerpts labeled "Alksnis," believing that the stern colonel has 
still not had his final say in politics, especially since the 
word "communism" made a noteworthy evolution on his lips: "They 
are trying to present me as an orthodox communist, although I am 
not interested in any `isms.' I consider myself a nationalist." 
This, it seems, is not far from the truth: An American 
journalist, having analyzed all 52 speeches made by Alksnis at 
the Congress and sessions of the Supreme Soviet, did not find a 
single reference to socialism or communism. 
  In October 1992, Alksnis joined the Organizational Committee 
of the National Salvation Front, soon after banned by President 
B. Yeltsin. 
  Alksnis's wife is a history instructor. His favorite 
television journalist is A.G. Nevzorov. He is an ardent fan of 
the Beatles. Of the classical writers he prefers Bach and 
Vivaldi. He listens with pleasure to songs of the bards, 
especially Okudzhava and Vizbor. 
<H5>  Rulsan Sultanovich Aushev </H5>
  He was born in the village of Bolodarskoye, Kokchetav 
Oblast, 
Kazakhstan, to the family of a white-collar worker. He is an 
Ingush by nationality. His family ended up in Kazakhstan as a 
result of the sadly well-known Stalin decree of 1944, under 
which Chechens and Ingush were resettled from their native land 
in the Northern Caucasus to Central Asia and Kazakhstan. True, 
by the time he was born, the purely punitive actions against 
entire nationalities were ended, but some of his first 
recollections of childhood were restrictions of the right to 
move, the need to register at the commandant's headquarters, and 
conversations about what had happened with his people in the 
terrible year of 1944. 
  Aushev has been in the Army since 1971. He graduated from 
the 
Ordzhonikidze Higher Combined-Arms Command School. In general, 
as they tell it, the three brothers--Ruslan, Adam, and 
Bagautdin--chose the military profession at the order of their 
father: Several hundred men from the ancient Aushev family 
fought at fronts of the Great Patriotic War as privates, but no 
one had become an officer. That is why Sultan Yusupovich advised 
his sons to enroll in military schools. 
  Ruslan's service went normally at first: lieutenant, 
captain, 
platoon, company, garrison, exercises, alert. His stellar hour 
came in Afghanistan, where he commanded a motorized rifle 
battalion. 
  After several successful combat operations and, most 
importantly, after the Kremlin leadership made the decision to 
no longer be silent about the participation of Soviet troops in 
battles but, on the contrary, to describe the war as a heroic 
deed of real men--they took notice of Ruslan Aushev. He was one 
of the first Soviet soldiers to receive the title of Hero of the 
Soviet Union for participation in combat operations in 
Afghanistan (Decree of the Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet, 
7 May 1982). He was almost the ideal soldier: brave, courageous, 
reliable. For example, there was an instance when he was 
seriously wounded while repelling an attack on an Afghan-Soviet 
column; however, he agreed to go to the medical battalion only 
after the attackers had retreated. After an operation lasting 
many hours and treatment, he again returned to Afghanistan. 
  For many he has remained a symbol of the Soviet 
soldier-internationalist, helping the friendly people of 
Afghanistan to fight counter-revolution and to build a new life. 
  It must be noted that Aushev has never once publicly talked 
about the true essence of that war. On the other hand, he also 
was not among those who fiercely attacked Academician Andrey 
Sakharov when he accused Soviet military authorities in 
Afghanistan of the intentional destruction of their soldiers 
when they ended up being surrounded. 
  In 1985, R. Aushev graduated from the Military Academy imeni 
M.V. Frunze. 
  In 1989, Lieutenant Colonel R. Aushev, commander of a 
motorized rifle regiment of the Far East Military District, was 
elected USSR people's deputy (from the Ussuriysk Territorial 
Electoral District of Maritime Kray). He finished serving in the 
Far East in the position of deputy chief of an army combat 
training department. 
  Today his military rank is major-general. He is chairman of 
the Committee for Affairs of Soldier-Internationalists of the 
CIS member-states. 
  In connection with his appointment in September 1991 as 
chairman of the Committee for Affairs of 
Soldier-Internationalists under the USSR President (minister for 
Afghan veterans), he has been transferred into the reserve of 
the armed forces. 
<H5>  Matvey Prokopyevich Burlakov </H5>
  This person with such a specifically Russian name is 
presently serving in Germany, in the center of the country with 
which Russians have fought twice over the last century. He is 
commander-in-chief of the Western Group of Forces, and in this 
post he is encountering perhaps the most serious difficulties of 
all his peers: Amidst the temptations of "developed capitalism," 
he must keep the Army from degradation to the state of a group 
of uncontrollable armed people trading whatever they like in 
pursuit of an extra hundred convertible German marks. 
  Matvey Prokopyevich Burlakov was born on 19 August 1935 in 
the city of Ulan-Ude to a working-class family. He graduated 
from the Omsk Military School imeni M.V. Frunze in 1957, the 
Military Academy imeni M.V. Frunze in 1968, and the Military 
Academy of the General Staff of the USSR Armed Forces in 1977. 
  He began his officer service as military school graduates 
usually do--in the position of rifle platoon commander and later 
commanded a company. He served in various regions of the 
country--in the Far East, in the Far North, in the Transbaykal 
region. "In the 36 years I have spent in the Army, I have had 
the opportunity to replace dozens of garrisons," the general 
noted. From 1968 he was a deputy regimental commander and from 
1969 to 1973 a regimental commander. Then he was a division 
commander for four years and in 1977 became an army corps 
commander. He was an army commander from 1979 to 1983 and from 
1983 to 1988 chief of staff and first deputy commander of the 
Transbaykal Military District. 
  Then fate did him a favorable turn--he was sent to a 
civilized "overseas" assignment, to Hungary, to command the 
Southern Group of Forces. True, time was already marking off the 
final months of the Soviet forces stay in this country, and 
Matvey Burlakov was quickly drawn into the negotiations on the 
withdrawal of the Army from Hungary--with all the bills and 
payments, desertion, transfer of property, transportation, 
ecological claims, and the like. Such experience at the "top" 
was considered quite useful, and in 1990 Burlakov was sent to an 
even more important "front"--to a unified Germany. 
  He was named commander-in-chief of the Western Group of 
Forces (replacing 65-year-old General of the Army Boris Snetkov) 
before 1992, when he officially began to be considered the 
"authorized agent of the Russian Federation Government for the 
Western Group of Forces," which does not mean that he stopped 
being number one in the Western Group of Forces [WGF]. This post 
in the Soviet Army was always considered very important: This 
position was held in various years by Marshals of the Soviet 
Union Grechko, Kulikov, and Kurkotkin, and Generals of the Army 
Lushev and Ivanovskiy. Matvey Burlakov commented on his 
assignment to the FRG in this way: "I will never get used to the 
difficulties of army life," he said in an interview with TASS. 
  Observers note General Burlakov's attempts to establish 
closer and trusting relations with federal and land authorities 
of the FRG, the population, and the Bundeswehr command 
authorities. He began holding regular "open houses" in the 
Soviet garrisons. A public affairs office was created to 
establish closer ties with the German public and press in the 
WFG. A new rubric, "Get to Know Us, Germany," was introduced in 
the newspaper of the WGF, SOVETSKAYA ARMIYA, and an office for 
coverage of life in the WGF in German is being created at the 
Volga radio station. 
  But on the other hand, many Russian military men prefer to 
remain cautiously silent about Burlakov's activities in 
connection with the openly growing commercialization of the Army 
today. Fairly scandalous disclosures have appeared in both the 
German and Russian press concerning certain representatives of 
the higher command staff selling nearly all the military 
property they could that was under their control. In a special 
report devoted specially to this topic, the Hamburg weekly DER 
SPIEGEL stated, in particular, that high-ranking military are 
involved in machinations concerning subventions of the European 
Community, financial accounts, and various fraudulent deals. In 
doing so, they gladly use the 12 billion marks and also the 
various benefits allotted to them by the German government. 
"Directly or through illegal transactions, huge sums of currency 
from property of the Western Group of Forces are ending up in 
private accounts in Zurich, Geneva, or New York," claims the 
weekly. They use such methods as the organizing of joint stock 
companies by officers in order to sell Army property through 
them not without benefit for themselves; selling through private 
channels goods received by the Army which are exempt from 
customs and taxes; taking advantage of the fact that, from the 
legal standpoint, the territory of units of the Western Group of 
Forces is considered foreign territory, that is, tax-free zones 
on which it is very profitable for German firms to 
operate--naturally, not without an appropriate bonus for those 
who authorize this. 
  In this connection, DER SPIEGEL cites a photograph from the 
first page of a commercial proposal of the firm Mir Trade with a 
handwritten resolution by General Burlakov: "The proposal is 
good and we must support relations because everything is much 
cheaper." However, the magazine found evidence that the Mir 
Trade's products are more expensive than those of its 
competitors, and its deliveries are usually late and, in 
addition, small and of poor quality. DER SPIEGEL quotes one of 
Burlakov's subordinates, who stated in this regard: "Either he 
cannot do better, or he does not know better, or he has been 
bribed." 
  Earning currency by all methods has become a calamity 
eroding 
the fighting spirit of the troops. But Russian sources maintain 
that all this would have been impossible without decisions on 
this sort of activities made at fairly high levels: It is not 
likely that German firms would have been granted the 
"opportunity to visit an exhibit at one of the military units of 
models of WGF property authorized for sale" without their 
consent. 
  Matvey Burlakov is married to Viktoriya Nikolayevna. Their 
son is an officer who began serving in a remote garrison after 
graduation from a military school. They also have a daughter. 
  According to certain sources, the general is considered 
accessible and simple in dealing with journalists. He enjoys 
chess, swimming, and volleyball. "I try not to miss a single 
literary work or theatrical play, if duty permits," he likes to 
emphasize. 
<H5>  Valentin Ivanovich Varennikov </H5>
  He is a general of the army and was born 15 December 1923 in 
Krasnodar. He graduated from the Military Academy imeni M.V. 
Frunze in 1954 and the Military Academy of the General Staff of 
the USSR Armed Forces imeni K.Ye. Voroshilov in 1967. 
  He began military service in 1941 as an infantry school 
cadet. During the Great Patriotic War and the postwar years, he 
was a battery commander, regimental artillery and intelligence 
officer, and regimental commander. He was the standard bearer in 
the Victory Parade of 1945. In 1960 he became deputy commander 
of a motorized rifle division and then division commander. 
Between 1967 and 1971 he was a corps commander and army 
commander. He was first deputy commander in chief of the Group 
of Soviet Forces in Germany 1971-1973; commander of the 
Carpathian Military District 1973-1979; chief of the Main 
Directorate and first deputy chief of the General Staff of the 
USSR Armed Forces 1979-1984; first deputy chief of the General 
Staff of the USSR Armed Forces 1984-1989. During this period he 
was in Afghanistan. He was commander in chief of the Ground 
Forces and deputy USSR minister of defense 1989-1991. In the 
military districts he was known as a great admirer of technical 
innovations. 
  Like other top military leaders, Varennikov also assumed 
public posts: He was a deputy of the USSR Supreme Soviet, 
9th-10th convocations, and deputy of the RSFSR Supreme Soviet, 
8th and 11th convocations. At the same time, he has been a CPSU 
member since 1944 and in 1986-1990 was elected a candidate 
member to the CPSU Central Committee. He was a delegate at the 
"perestroyka" 28th CPSU Congress. When during the course of 
perestroyka Mikhail Gorbachev decided to hold at least limited 
democratic elections, General Varennikov was elected in one of 
the distant electoral districts and in 1989 became a USSR 
people's deputy. 
  He has been awarded the Order of Lenin, the Order of the 
October Revolution, four Orders of the Red Banner, an Order of 
Kutuzov First Class, two Orders of the Patriotic War Second 
Class, Order of the Red Star, and the Order for Service to the 
Motherland in the USSR Armed Forces Third Class. 
  Varennikov was considered an advocate of a hard line in 
relations with union republics, and it obviously was not by 
chance that he represented the interests of the USSR Armed 
Forces during negotiations with Latvia in April 1991. 
  General Varennikov cannot be reproached for lack of 
political 
activeness: Among USSR people's deputies, he was an ardent 
supporter of preserving communism in the USSR and the USSR 
itself, for returning to a planned distribution economy, and for 
instituting order. In July 1990, he spoke out against 
depoliticization of the Army. 
  In personal terms, they speak of him as a person not without 
a disposition toward increased comfort, outward luster, and a 
certain amount of play-acting. In May 1991, the Union Parliament 
(Commission on Privileges) raised the question that Varennikov's 
family flew on vacation aboard a special-schedule military 
aircraft. Then the matter was hushed up. The current head of the 
CIS Combined Armed Forces, Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov, also took part 
in this matter. At the same time, according to comments, one 
cannot say that Varennikov lacks personal courage and bravery. 
  He was arrested in August 1991 in the Emergency Committee 
case as one its most active organizers. It was charged, in 
particular, that he delivered an ultimatum to Gorbachev at Foros 
and then to Kravchuk in Kiev. President Boris Yeltsin publicly 
accused Varennikov of demanding his execution, which the general 
categorically denied. 
  Varennikov is married to Yelena Tikhonovna. They have two 
sons. 
<H5>  Dmitriy Antonovich Volkogonov </H5>
  A military adviser to the President of Russia, and lately, 
after a serious illness, rarely appearing in public, 
Colonel-General Dmitriy Antonovich Volkogonov was born in 1928. 
He has been in the armed forces since 1949. 
  He graduated from a military tank school and the Military 
Political Academy. He is a people's deputy of the Russian 
Federation. 
  He has gone from senior department instructor of the 
Military 
Political Academy imeni V.I. Lenin to deputy chief of the Main 
Military Political Directorate of the Soviet Army and Navy 
(Glavpur). In 1990, he was appointed chief of the Institute of 
Military History. 
  He is a doctor of philosophical sciences, doctor of 
historical sciences, and a corresponding member of the Russian 
Academy of Sciences. He has authored about 50 books, the main 
ones of which are considered those which comprise the trilogy 
"The Leaders" [Vozhdi] (Lenin, Stalin, Trotskiy). 
  Volkogonov participated in drawing up the new edition of 
"History of the Second World War," but was criticized for an 
excessively free (from the military leadership's viewpoint) 
interpretation of the events of those years and was discharged 
from the staff of the editorial college by Minister of Defense 
Dmitriy Yazov. 
  Both before and during perestroyka, as deputy chief of the 
Glavpur, he wrote a great many books, pamphlets, and textbooks 
aimed at "improving combat and political training and 
ideological literacy of soldiers and officers" and actively 
participated in the struggle "for the purity of Marxist-Leninist 
theory." 
  Volkogonov himself does not hide the following: "I have 
exerted much effort to strengthen the communist system, for 
which I do not dismiss responsibility from myself... I was both 
a Stalinist and for a long an orthodox Marxist and believed that 
this system could be reformed, as Gorbachev tried to do. But I 
became convinced very soon that communism and totalitarianism 
could not be reformed; they simply had to leave the historical 
arena..." 
  Back in 1989, in the book "Triumph and Tragedy. I.V. Stalin. 
A Political Portrait.", Dmitriy Volkogonov wrote about Lenin. 
"This man's genius was great...," "True socialism, as Lenin saw 
it, is when man is at the center of attention. Lenin's concept 
of socialism is democracy, humanism, man, social justice." 
However, already in 1992, D.A. Volkogonov interprets Lenin as an 
"unattractive personality" and a "primitive philosopher." 
  Elected a people's deputy of Russia in 1990, he immediately 
declared himself a pro-democracy politician representing the 
left wing and supporting Boris Yeltsin. Out of fear that the 
Congress of People's Deputies might move to the right, he and 
Stepashin created a left-of-center deputy group with a liberal 
democratic orientation: "The faction is small, 1/8 to 1/10 of 
all deputies. They are predominantly the intelligentsia, 
professors, and representatives of industrial circles." On the 
whole, the group "Left-Center" numbered about 100 people in the 
Congress and about 30 in the Supreme Soviet. At one time it was 
the Left-Center that proposed the compromise version on the 
question of land ownership adopted by the Congress. Volkogonov 
explains his political choice in this way: "The Cromwells and 
Peters the First were more left of center. They were fairly 
radical, but did not lose reason." 
  Such a position moved him to the very top of the power 
mountain: The general is a member of the President's 
Consultative Council, was chairman of the State Commission for 
Creating the Ministry of Defense, Army, and Navy of the Russian 
Federation, and headed the Parliament Commission on the Receipt 
and Transfer of Archives of the CPSU and KGB. Nevertheless, he 
states: "I am simply a scientist. And I am involved in politics 
only because of the situation that has taken shape in the 
country." 
  Unlike B. Yeltsin, who just recently promised the beginning 
of prosperity for the fall of 1992, he believes that Russia will 
reach the lowest point of the crisis only at the very end of 
this year or the beginning of next year, namely reach, but not 
pass, for the period of the "plateau" may last 2-3 years. And 
the entire transition period, in the opinion of Dmitriy 
Volkogonov, may drag out 10-12 years. 
<H5>  Pavel Sergeyevich Grachev </H5>
  Russia got its own Ministry of Defense on 16 March 1992. 
Those who predicted that Andrey Kokoshin or even Galina 
Starovoytova would become minister of defense did not proved 
true. The president himself took over the position, true with 
the stipulation that it was "temporary." Yeltsin appointed 
Colonel-General Pavel Grachev as his first deputy. Then in early 
May, Yeltsin entrusted him with the duties of minister of 
defense and promoted him to the rank of general of the army. 
  On 18 May 1992, General of the Army Pavel Sergeyevich 
Grachev 
was officially appointed minister of defense of the Russian 
Federation. In Russian history, he is one of the youngest 
military ministers (he became minister at 44). 
  Pavel Grachev was born on 1 January 1948 in the village of 
Rvy, Tula Oblast. His mother was a milkmaid, his father a 
metalworker. No one in the family had ever been in the military. 
After he graduated from school, he enrolled in the Ryazan 
Airborne School. In 1969, he graduated as a lieutenant and was 
sent to Kaunas as commander of a parachute platoon. Then he was 
commander of a training company at the Ryazan School, commander 
of a battalion in Lithuania and in a training division. In 1978, 
in the position of battalion commander he enrolled in the 
Academy imeni M.V. Frunze. Upon graduation from it in 1981, he 
was sent to Afghanistan to the separate 354th Parachute Regiment 
as deputy commander. Six months later, he became commander of 
that same regiment. Between 1983 and 1985 he was chief of staff 
of the 7th Division in Kaunas. In 1984, he was promoted early to 
colonel. 
  In 1985, he was again in Afghanistan as a division 
commander. 
("I spent a total of 5 years and 3 months in Afghanistan, 
commanding paratroopers at the forward edge of the battle 
area"). In 1988, he entered the General Staff Academy. He 
graduated in 1990 and was appointed first deputy commander of 
the Airborne Troops. "Two tours in Afghanistan, two academies 
with distinction," his friends emphasize. 
  In January 1991, he became commander of the Airborne Troops. 
After the putsch, he was appointed first deputy minister of 
defense of the USSR by decrees of Yeltsin and Gorbachev. 
  The name of General Grachev became widely known after the 
events of August 1991, when the 40-year-old commander of the 
Airborne Troops, as he himself said, "refused to participate in 
the assault of the Russian White House." True, some expressed 
rather obvious doubts about this version (especially since prior 
to the trial of the organizers of the GKChP, it does not appear 
possible to establish conclusively whether or not an order for 
an assault even existed), but no one could seriously counter 
this story with anything. 
  However, the German newspaper DIE ZEIT cites facts the 
indicate at least an ambiguity of the actions of the paratroop 
commander during the critical days of August. According to its 
data, his deputy, Aleksandr Lebed, obviously not without the 
knowledge of his chief, drove to the White House on 
reconnaissance not with somebody, but with Karpukhin, commander 
of the KGB assault group "Alfa." It was this group, according to 
Karpukhin's confession, that was directed to assault the pocket 
of Russian resistance to the GKChP. 
  Pavel Grachev himself explains his actions thusly: "On 19 
August, Yazov ordered me to take five installations under 
guard--State Television and Radio, the Moscow City Soviet, the 
RSFSR Supreme Soviet, the State Bank, and the State Depository. 
But Yeltsin had also managed to assign security for himself. 
Therefore, initially it was not a question of failure to carry 
out an order: I tried to maneuver between the Army leadership 
and the Russian government. After all, the same orders can be 
carried out differently..." 
  One way or another, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his 
then-chief military adviser, General Konstantin Kobets, did not 
refute Grachev's statements. (What is more, the president 
awarded him a phrase which probably was worth a high order 
during those days: "He protected us here.") 
  The instantaneous appointment of the young general as 
chairman of the Russian State Committee for Defense Issues shows 
that either true or cleverly played loyalty was rewarded. 
  He received the title of Hero of the Soviet Union for 
"accomplishing combat missions with minimal human losses" in 
Afghanistan. He has also been awarded two Orders of Lenin, an 
Order of the Red Banner, and an Order of the Red Star. 
  At the Army Conference of Soldier-Internationalists back on 
24 May 1991, P. Grachev stated the following: "The Army today is 
one of a few elements able to prevent the final destruction of 
our state. The process of chaotic sovereignization with attempts 
to create republic armies, which can lead to catastrophic 
consequences, prompts us to this thought... Today the struggle 
continues. And in it the fate of the most sacred and valuable 
thing we have is being decided--the fate of the motherland, the 
fate of the great union of Soviet people and its army." In this 
regard, the general demanded that "Soviet patriotism and 
adherence to socialist choice" be formed in personnel. 
  In 1991, at age 42, the guards major-general became 
commander 
of the Airborne Troops of the Soviet Union (a colonel-general 
position). As some high-ranking army sources claim, recommended 
by the very person he replaced in this post, Colonel-General 
V.A. Achalov. The latter by that time was blamed for the fact 
that under his leadership, during the mass democratic 
demonstrations in the fall of 1990, two divisions of 
parachutists advanced on Moscow. After unintelligible 
explanations of the military that these were exercises, for the 
crossing to agricultural work and the "potato" march of the 
paratroopers was firmly linked to suspicions of a planned 
overthrow or, in any event, practicing it at operational 
exercises. These suspicions seemed exaggerated, but the events 
of August 1991 confirmed them to some extent. 
  Ye. Shaposhnikov, who had taken over leadership of the 
Ministry of Defense, took Grachev as his first deputy. 
  As the minister's right-hand man, Grachev had to participate 
in negotiations on the fate of the USSR Armed Forces on the 
entire territory of the former state. He tried to throw up 
bridges with the governments of the Baltic states that had 
received their independence, pointing out, nonetheless, the 
impossibility of the withdrawal of USSR troops in a short space 
of time. The general also had to argue with Chechen President 
General Dudayev, who decided to create his own army. 
  Colleagues note Grachev's outstanding duty qualities and a 
certain military bravado. And this bravado, as a rule, has 
evoked the liking and not the fear from leaders. These personal 
qualities, apparently, were also to the liking of Boris Yeltsin, 
who went hunting and sweated in a bathhouse together with him, 
according to sources claiming to be in the know. 
  As far as the new minister's political views are concerned, 
it has not been possible to fix any stable views. Among 
political observers, he is considered a much more conservative 
figure than his previous chief, Marshal Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov. 
Basically, Grachev's speeches come down to expressing a 
determination to maintain by any means the combat effectiveness 
of the Army--the Soviet Army in the past or the Russian Army 
today--and to defend the country's interests in the military 
sphere. However, malicious tongues claim that Grachev 
understands these interests in a distinctive way. According to 
informed representatives of Russia's State Committee for Defense 
Issues, one of the general's first actions in the new post as 
minister was to visit the Moscow Garrison Stockade, where he 
personally engaged in drill training with officers being 
punished... Some of them who know him from working together 
maintain that the minister is "extremely power-hungry and does 
not tolerate objections, much less criticism." However, others 
believe that this is not quite true and that power should be 
inherent in an army commander. 
  Today, Pavel Grachev makes it understood that he follows 
Yeltsin's policy and will continue to do so, no matter what it 
is (although informed analysts believe that the military policy 
of the president is also the policy of Pavel Grachev due to the 
lack of other institutions of forming such policy in Russia). 
  The appointment of Grachev as minister of defense shocked 
many democratically oriented military people: In their opinion, 
one can forget about serious reforms in leadership of the Army; 
the ideas of a civilian Ministry of Defense have died without 
having been born; and there can be no talk of purely military 
autonomy of the General Staff. Many Army pragmatists, it is 
reported, were upset by the removal of Marshal Shaposhnikov, who 
was considered in the troops to be a fairly considerate 
commander who protected, above all, the social interests of the 
military. On the other hand, according to fragmentary 
information coming from units, many officers do not have feel 
respect either for Grachev or Shaposhnikov, believing that they, 
"no matter what they thought, they violated the oath of 
allegiance in August by not carrying out the commander's order." 
  Pavel Grachev is married and has two sons. The oldest son, 
Sergey, is graduating from the same Ryazan Airborne School and 
is to be assigned to the Transbaykal. The younger son, Valeriy, 
is in his first year at the Moscow Suvorov School, but, in the 
father's opinion, will probably not be a military man. 
<H5>  Boris Vsevolodovich Gromov </H5>
  "There is not a single Soviet soldier behind me." He went 
down in history with this statement. 
  The only thing not known is what was behind that statement: 
Relief and awareness of a well-fulfilled duty, or the secret 
despair of a commander who had lost a war he did not start. 
  And, it seems, this was not the only war lost by the 
general... 
  Boris Vsevolodovich Gromov was born on 7 November 1943 in 
Saratov. He graduated from the Kalinin Suvorov School in 1962 
and the Leningrad Combined-Arms Command School imeni S.M. Kirov 
in 1965. He began his officer service in the position of 
commander of a rifle platoon and later a company in the Baltic 
Military District. 
  After graduating with honors from the Academy imeni M.V. 
Frunze in 1972, he successively held the positions of battalion 
commander, regiment chief of staff and commander, and motorized 
rifle division chief of staff and commander. He was promoted 
early to major, lieutenant colonel, and colonel. 
  He graduated from the General Staff Academy in 1984 with a 
gold medal and was assigned as deputy commander of an army and 
later commanded an army, first in Belorussia and the 40th Army 
in Afghanistan between 1987 and 1989, simultaneously being the 
authorized agent of the USSR government for affairs on the 
temporary stay of Soviet troops in the Democratic Republic of 
Afghanistan [DRA]. 
  He had already served twice in Afghanistan before this--from 
February 1980 through August 1982 and from March 1985 through 
April 1986. 
  He is a Hero of the Soviet Union and has been awarded five 
orders and many medals. 
  In September 1992, Gromov became deputy minister of defense 
of Russia. For many observers, this appointment was unexpected. 
With the departure of M. Gorbachev, Gromov was deprived of the 
most powerful support in the highest echelons of power. He had 
no sponsors in the Main Commissariat of the CIS Combined Armed 
Forces, and the minister of defense did not demonstrate any 
special favor. And suddenly he is promoted to one of the key 
posts of the military hierarchy. 
  It is believed that the personal qualities of the new deputy 
minister played the main role in this: youth and a high degree 
of professionalism (undeclared political sympathies also played 
a significant role). Secondly, his Afghanistan military 
biography. With the good graces of Vice President Rutskoy, 
former Afghanistan veteran commanders are gradually occupying 
key posts in the central apparatus of the military department 
and in the troops. Finally, Gromov has a reputation as a 
supporter of a hard line, which, under conditions of today's 
growing chaos, is becoming increasingly popular. All this 
enabled the well-known Zbigniew Brzezinski to recommend to 
analysts and politicians: "Watch General Gromov. The hidden 
supporters of Soviet centrism are linking their hopes to him." 
  Of course, professional qualities alone are not enough to 
win 
the kind of popularity that the colonel-general enjoys today in 
Russia--fate also had to play a part. Boris Gromov became widely 
known after the 40th Army he commanded left Afghanistan. 
  Experts maintain that under him the war was conducted most 
competently, responsibly, and with the fewest casualties. 
  The withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan in 
1988-1989 
was accomplished under his command. Gromov, as the captain of a 
sinking ship, was the last to go to the Soviet shore from the 
bridge across the Amu-Darya River. Only prisoners of war were 
left behind him... 
  Next he was appointed commander of the Kiev Military 
District, from where he was unexpectedly transferred to the 
position of first deputy to USSR Minister of Internal Affairs 
Pugo. Since that time, persistent rumors have begun to travel 
back and forth that Gromov was "stern," that he was called upon 
to put pressure on democrats by using his Army experience, and 
that he was an advocate of harsh measures to protect communism. 
His signature on the famous "Word to the People," considered the 
"ideological program" of the putsch plotters and which demanded 
"restoration of socialist ideals" in the USSR, also added fuel 
to the fire. 
  Rumors were going around that it was under his direction 
that 
fairly harsh actions were taken with respect to Lithuania and 
other Baltic republics. In any case, experts agree that the 
famous Riga and Vilnius OMON's could not have operated with such 
decisiveness without support in the leadership of the USSR 
Ministry of Internal Affairs. One way or another, the scenes of 
atrocities by the military in Vilnius and the deaths of peaceful 
civilians in the Lithuanian and Latvian capitals shook the 
country and caused massive protests. Among those against whom 
these protests were directed was also Boris Gromov, whom 
democrats have since firmly linked with the ideas of force for 
the sake of preserving "socialist ideals." This was the second 
war lost by the general... 
It is curious that having become deputy minister of defense, 
he conducted negotiations with the Lithuanian government on ways 
to normalize the situation in that same Lithuania. 
  In the presidential elections in Russia, the pair of Ryzhkov 
and Gromov, nominated as vice president, collected a total of 
16.85 percent of the votes, taking second place in this 
"handicap." 
  Suspicions regarding Gromov's inclination to use force to 
solve problems and toward the fact that he may become the 
dictator whom Russia fears one day led to a huge scandal over 
his name. The general even brought suit against USSR People's 
Deputy Colonel Vilen Martirosyan, who in an interview with a 
Kiev newspaper listed him among the forces "lenient toward a 
military coup in the country." 
  It is known, however, that Gromov spoke out categorically 
against the Army's participation in internal conflicts and 
crisis situations, especially if they are associated with 
inter-ethnic conflicts. 
  Judging from General Pavel Grachev's words, Gromov behaved 
fairly loyally during the putsch: "I talked with General B.V. 
Gromov by phone, and he replied that he would not bring the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs troops anywhere." Gromov was 
present at the meeting on 20 August with Marshal Yazov at the 
USSR Ministry of Defense, where, according to the German 
newspaper DIE ZEIT, specific tasks were set forth for assaulting 
the Russian White House, but, as Gromov asserted immediately 
following the putsch, "I was concerned only about Ministry of 
Internal Affairs troops not being sent into the streets of 
Moscow." 
  General Gromov's role in the August events will possibly be 
cleared up with by history, as may the role of General Grachev. 
But for now, one this is obvious: It is not likely that he will 
become a real political figure on the right flank anytime in the 
foreseeable future. On the other hand, increased attention on 
him will not likely enable him to organize anything resembling 
an anti-government organization of officers unnoticed. 
  General Gromov is married--for the second time. His first 
wife died in an aircraft shot down in Afghanistan during its 
very approach to the Soviet border. There are two sons from that 
marriage--Maksim (now a cadet in a military school) and Andrey 
(in seventh grade). The general's present wife, who was given 
the nickname of "brilliant Faina" in Kiev, also lost her husband 
in Afghanistan. She became intimate with Gromov, having in her 
arms two twin girls--Zhenya and Valya, who graduated from first 
grade in 1992. 
<H5>  Petr Stepanovich Deynekin </H5>
  He is a colonel-general of aviation and presently 
commander-in-chief of Russia's Air Force. The last position 
prior to this--commander in chief of the USSR Air Force and 
deputy minister of defense of the USSR--from August 1991, 
becoming truly stellar for military aviators, whose commander, 
Marshal Shaposhnikov, refused to send against the Russian 
leadership. 
  He was born in the city of Morozovsk, Rostov Oblast, on 14 
December 1937. Deynekin's father, Stepan Nikolayevich, work as a 
history teacher at one of the farms on the Don and right before 
the war went to serve in aviation. He was killed in a crash in 
1943 "in the line of duty" at the age of 26 years. 
  Petr Deynekin followed in his father's footsteps into 
aviation. He graduated from the Balashov Military Aviation 
School for Pilots in 1957, the Military Air Academy imeni Yu.A. 
Gagarin in 1969, and the Military Academy of the General Staff 
in 1982 with a gold medal. 
  He began his officer service as an assistant aircraft 
commander in Long-Range Aviation. In 1973, he was commander of 
an aviation regiment, then a division commander. In 1982, he was 
appointed deputy commander of an air army. In 1985, he was 
commander of an air army. In 1990, he was first deputy commander 
in chief of the USSR Air Force. 
  Deynekin is an Honored Military Pilot of the USSR (1984). He 
has a total of 5000 flying hours. According to him, "during his 
younger flying years, he flew 500 hours a year!" He has 
qualified on nine types of aircraft, including the modern Tu-160 
base strategic bomber. The fact that he flew the famous American 
B-1B Lancer bomber in May 1992 as crew commander with an aerial 
refueling indicates the degree of his flying skill. 
  In conversations, this stocky, black-haired man without a 
trace of gray gives the impression of a strict professional not 
striving to meddle in political processes and ready to deal with 
the facts as they are. The collapse of the USSR, causing a 
division of the Army, including the Air Force, is reflected in 
the general's public speeches only as a need for a new 
understanding of his military duty: "We have begun practical 
work to bring the Air Force in line with the concept of 
organizational development of Russia's Armed Forces," says the 
general, noting today's political reality. However, he mentions 
the precept of Peter the Great: "He who has taken the oath to 
the banner must stand by it to the death." Analysts recall that 
Petr Deynekin actually "protected" a group of officers who had 
committed an unauthorized flight in their combat aircraft from a 
Ukrainian airfield to Russia and stated that they did not wish 
to take the Ukrainian oath. 
  At the same time, he deserves the real credit for preventing 
a split of the Army into rival political groupings. When at the 
All-Army Officers' Assembly, convened at the request of the 
communist-oriented portion of the military several weeks after 
the August putsch, some of those gathered there demanded the 
resignation of Marshal Shaposhnikov, who, in their opinion, was 
too loyal to "the democrats ruining the Army," it was Air Force 
Commander in Chief Deynekin who stated that if Shaposhnikov 
goes, so will all the military pilots. The pro-communist 
delegates decided against open confrontation, and analysts 
consider namely this episode to be the key point in the 
establishment of control over the Army by the new Russian 
leadership. 
  In the opinion of observers, General Petr Deynekin enjoys 
popularity among the troops. In turn, he is also considered a 
great patriot of the Air Force, placing it above the others in 
the age-old rivalry between branches of troops. He is also 
popular among the managers of the military industrial complex: 
One of his major accomplishments is that 18 billion rubles were 
invested in the aviation industry during just the first six 
months of the crisis year of 1992. 
  He is married and has three children. 
  He loves to spend his free time in nature (hunting or 
fishing) with family and friends. He reads much. He loves 
windsurfing and water skiing and goes to the theater. 
<H5>  Viktor Petrovich Dubynin </H5>
  On 10 June, at a meeting in the Ministry of Defense of 
Russia, Boris Yeltsin announced his decision to appoint 
Colonel-General Viktor Petrovich Dubynin to the position of 
chief of the General Staff and first deputy minister of defense 
of Russia. 
  He was born on 1 February 1943 in the city of 
Kamensk-Uralskiy (Sverdlovsk Oblast). He graduated from the Far 
Eastern Tank School in 1964. He began his service in the troops 
in the position of tank platoon commander. He commanded a 
company, battalion, and regiment. 
  In 1981, he headed a tank brigade stationed at the border 
with Poland. In an interview with the Polish press in April 
1992, Dubynin admitted that if General Jaruzelski had not 
imposed martial law in Poland in December 1981, Soviet troops 
would have entered and occupied the country. General Jaruzelski 
confirmed this statement. 
  Dubynin graduated from the Military General Staff Academy in 
1984. After graduating from it, he became first deputy commander 
of an army. In 1986, he became commander of an army in the 
Turkestan Military District. He participated in the war in 
Afghanistan. In 1987, he was commander of a tank army in the 
Belorussian Military District. 
  Between 1988 and 1989, he was chief of staff and first 
deputy 
commander of the Kiev Military District. 
  In June 1989, he became commander of the Northern Group of 
Forces stationed in Poland. 
  In February 1991, General Dubynin refused to allow the 
Polish 
military department to conduct an inspection on the territory of 
one of the military units where, the Poles claimed, Soviet 
chemical weapons located. A number of deputies of the Polish 
Sejm (parliament) wanted to declare Dubynin persona non 
grata for an "improper attitude towards Polish colleagues." 
  In April 1991, General Dubynin began overseeing the 
withdrawal of Soviet troops from the territory of Poland (they 
had been there since 1944, however, no one had ever raised the 
question of their withdrawal before). The troop withdrawal that 
had begun at that time according to a schedule agreed upon only 
between the command authorities of the Northern Group of Forces 
(i.e., V. Dubynin) and the Ministry of Defense of Poland. It was 
anticipated that an inter-state treaty on this matter would be 
ready and signed by Mikhail Gorbachev and Lech Walesa in late 
1991. However, at that time, as a result of the instability of 
the Polish side and the well-known August events in the USSR, 
preparation of the documents was dragged out, and the meeting 
between the presidents did not take place. The documents were 
signed by L. Walesa and B. Yeltsin in April 1992. Speaking 
during the departure of the first subunit of Soviet troops from 
Poland for the homeland, General Dubynin admitted that the USSR 
at one time had secretly stored its nuclear weapons on the 
territory of Poland; however, it had withdrawn them back before 
the start of the troop withdrawal. Answering questions by 
correspondents recalling the incident with chemical weapons, 
Dubynin remarked that the USSR has never had a single chemical 
weapon of any type on the territory of Poland. 
  The short history of the general's appointment to the new 
position is noteworthy. On the first day of a conference at the 
Ministry of Defense of Russia held 10-11 June, Viktor Dubynin 
was officially designated as responsible for the withdrawal of 
Russian troops from the territory of Poland. But already on the 
second day, the president announced his new appointment. It 
remains only to guess what kind of a secret is hidden behind 
this little-known fact. 
  Attentive observers also note the following fact: All 
previous chiefs of the General Staff had one of the three 
"nuclear briefcases." Dubynin does not have it--the third 
"briefcase" (after the president and minister of defense) is in 
reserve... 
<H5>  Dzhokhar Musayevich Dudayev </H5>
  A native of the Chechen-Ingush ASSR and a Chechen. Born in 
1944 at the time when all Chechens were sent by order of Stalin 
to Kazakhstan and Central Asia. He spent his childhood here 
right up until Khrushchev authorized the Chechens and Ingush to 
return to their homeland in 1957. His passport data are 
distorted. His birth date of 15 May is written approximately. 
  At one time he completed a physical mathematics course and 
then the Tambovsk Higher Military Aviation School imeni M. 
Raskovaya, and the Military Air Academy imeni Gagarin in 1977. 
He joined the CPSU in 1968 and has not formally left the party. 
He served in Siberia, Afghanistan, and other regions. He is a 
military pilot-engineer 1st class and has 12 governmental awards. 
  Since childhood his peers remember his as a very passionate 
person, even for a Chechen (however, according to those around 
him, today Dudayev has learned to restrain his emotions and 
appear quite calm in all situations), fairly straightforward, 
not without ambition, bordering on ambitiousness. It is likely 
that this is what helped him achieve promotions in the military 
that are quite rare for representatives of his nationality--to 
the position of division commander. What is more, he is the 
first Chechen general in the Soviet Army. 
  Colleagues characterize him as a strict, quick-tempered, 
abrupt person whose handwriting is even nervous. He also was 
often reproached for authoritarianism and love of power. In the 
words of his comrade in arms Yusup Soslanbekov, among Estonians 
(his division was stationed in Tartu) Dudayev was known as the 
"rebellious general," having once refused to carry out an order 
on blockading the television station and parliament of Estonia. 
  It could not be established if this was actually the case, 
but according to comments of those who served with him, in 
previous years Colonel Dudayev was more than loyal with respect 
to the CPSU. Quite aggressively, in the words of one of the 
political workers who served under him, "he taught political 
affairs officers how to love the party": "You are called upon to 
serve the party as chain workers which the Central Committee has 
released and is paying money for this!" 
  However, today he believes that he did more for this party 
than it did for him. 
  Dudayev retired back in May 1990, when, as they told it, 
Chechens arriving in Tartu requested him to do so. Dudayev and 
his air division were assigned from Tartu to Groznyy. 
Assumptions were stated that in doing so, 1000 nuclear warheads 
in the air division's inventory were also brought to Groznyy. 
When Dudayev put in for retirement, Deynekin, presently 
colonel-general and commander of the CIS Air Forces, flew to him 
in Groznyy and offered Dudayev high Army posts, including 
commander of an air army. Dudayev replied: "The highest position 
for me is to be an ordinary Chechen." And he headed the 
Executive Committee of the Nationwide Congress of the Chechen 
People (OKChN) in opposition to the authorities. In essence, he 
came to power on the wave of popular revolt, after the Executive 
Committee sided with the Russian Parliament and President 
Yeltsin during the first hours of the putsch on 19 August 1991. 
The republic's parliament came to its senses only on 21 August 
and adopted a decree condemning the Emergency Committee, but it 
was too late. Freedom Square filled with people. Barricades were 
built. People were recruited into the "National Guard." 
  As a result, the OKChN Executive Committee dissolved the 
republic's Supreme Soviet and led the former chairman of the 
Supreme Soviet, Doku Zavgayev, out of the building. The dirty 
work was done by national guardsmen--armed detachments of 
volunteers created by the chairman of the OKChN Executive 
Committee, General Dudayev. Thus, he ended up with the power, 
and Russia's Supreme Soviet was faced with a dilemma--to 
recognize it or not to recognize it: The illegitimacy of the 
new, and initially perceived as allied, regime was indisputable. 
  However, the dilemma soon resolved itself: After several 
harshly stated demands by Dudayev about granting Chechnya 
complete independence from Russia, the White House condemned his 
regime in equally harsh terms in the decree of 8 October 1991 by 
the Presidium of the RSFSR Supreme Soviet and by the Supreme 
Soviet of 10 October 1991 "On the Political Situation in 
Chechen-Ingushetia." In response, Groznyy announced setting 27 
October as the date for elections for parliament and president 
of the republic, with which it beat back the attacks by jurists: 
Dudayev was soon elected president entirely legally. 
  On 2 November 1991, according to the official formula, "as a 
result of the long national-liberation struggle of the Chechen 
people," the "Chechen State" was proclaimed. 
  Dudayev's supporters expressed joy over Dudayev's election 
as 
president by firing hunting rifles, assault rifles, machineguns, 
and pistols in the center of Groznyy. 
  The Chechens fully supported the general. The editor of the 
newspaper SVOBODA, Lecha Yakhyayev, wrote about Dudayev: "He is 
not like all of us. He does not have a red cent to his name, nor 
does he have a powerful family or tribal clan behind him, and 
what is most dreadful--he is honest." His former colleagues also 
are not inclined to suspect him of violating the second 
commandment; no one can claim that he was a thief, says one of 
his subordinates. In any case, today General Dudayev serves as 
the personification of a "new leader" for activists of the 
national movement: military bone, a "firm hand," and a 
democratic reputation. 
  In the opinion of some experts, it is not a question of a 
wide-scale shift of Chechen values, but of Dudayev's personal 
ambitions and the persons associated with him, about whose 
demands the general dissatisfaction with the state of affairs in 
the country was localized. Typical in this regard are the words 
of Judge Shepa Gadayev: "Dudayev is an honest person, is not 
connected to our system that is corrupted at all levels, and is 
not involved in the covering up of tribal and selfish top-level 
ties. Only such energetic and unselfish people can change this." 
This is also confirmed by Russian analysts: "He did not choose 
the national idea, it chose him. D. Dudayev came to the congress 
as a guest and was elected chairman of the Executive Committee." 
  Since the general transferred the House of Political 
Enlightenment to the Islamic Institute the next day, there 
continues to be a variety of speculation about the "Muslim 
component" of his politics. Some analysts believe that Dudayev 
is actually a willing leader for the movement of Islamic 
fundamentalism. The behavior, statements, and politics of the 
former orthodox communist seem to many to confirm this thought: 
From exotic details such as Dudayev banning the practice of male 
gynecologists under the threat of criminal punishment to a 
persistent quest for contacts with Muslim republics of the 
former USSR and the Muslim world abroad. 
  It is curious that it was the Islamic Path Party that 
nominated the retired general as a presidential candidate: "The 
Islamic Path Party nominates Dudayev as its candidate for 
president of the Chechen Republic. Only the election of Dudayev 
as president of the Chechen Republic will stabilize the 
situation, preclude the possibility of clan opposition, and lead 
the republic to democratic reforms," it states in the decision 
of this party's council. "I have become the first president of 
the Chechen Republic by the will of Allah and of the people," 
was the first statement Dudayev made at a press conference after 
a preliminary counting of votes. 
  "I am a Muslim," Dudayev himself asserts. "This religion has 
been close to me since childhood. I do not observe the hours of 
prayer and turn to Allah usually in my heart. I ask him to 
protect me from evil, vices, and evil spirit." 
  However, many attentive politologists believe that the Islam 
in his politics is a screen, and Dudayev is persistently seeking 
support of the Muslim world to fight for the hegemony of 
Chechnya in the Caucasus and creation under its aegis a certain 
"Commonwealth of States and Peoples of the Great Caucasus," and 
also to be prepared for a possible serious clash with the mother 
country. It is precisely this conflict with Russia that 
determines today's imperatives of the general-president's 
foreign and domestic policy. 
  Presidential candidate Dzhokhar Dudayev built his campaign 
on 
a main thesis: Sovereignty outside of Russia. Dudayev, in turn, 
evokes fears in Moscow not only by his distinctly expressed 
extremism in achieving independence but also threats to initiate 
terrorism in Russia in the event of an attack by the latter on 
Chechnya. He himself does not hide this, saying: "To those in 
the White House who issue completely insane orders and are 
willing to organize global bloodshed on our land, I dare to 
reassure: We will deliver a terrible blow. Thirty minutes will 
be enough for there to be a mountain of corpses. And the grief 
of the mothers of Russian soldiers will be immeasurable." 
Dudayev threatens to "burn Russia in a nuclear fire" and states: 
"My physical destruction is the state program of the leadership 
of Russia." 
  As far as other aspects of Dudayev's politics are concerned, 
it obviously will be characterized by two factors in the future: 
Chechnya's desire to dominate in the Northern Caucasus and 
repression of the opposition. Among analysts, the following 
statements of the general-president are considered more than 
typical: "We do not forget that we bear the responsibility for 
the fate of our fraternal peoples of the Caucasus. Uniting the 
peoples of the Caucasus into a unified community of equals is 
the only correct and promising path in the future. We, and I 
personally, attach special significance to the question of 
unifying the Caucasus. We are obligated to become the initiators 
of this unification, for we are at the center of interests of 
the peoples of our mountain territory, both geographically and 
economically, as well as ethnically." Dudayev believes that such 
a path also has a good economic base: "We intend to switch to 
our own currency. After all, we have rich land and are almost 
the richest in the world in mineral resources, soil fertility, 
and climate. The republic exports to 140 countries." 
  However, the objective indicators are less optimistic. 
Despite the fact that Chechen-Ingushetia has essentially a 
monopoly in production of aviation oils, supplying more than 90 
percent of their consumption in the CIS. There are 200,000 
able-bodied people unemployed in the republic. In several 
populated areas, up to 80-90 percent are unemployed. 
Chechen-Ingushetia ranks in last place at 73rd in the CIS for 
nearly all vitally important indicators. It ranks third from 
last for infant mortality. 
  Therefore, it is not by chance that the president is 
intensifying the search for ways to increase assistance from 
abroad, in particular, in organizing the petroleum industry and 
obtaining Arab credits. Thus, in August 1992, at the invitation 
of King of Saudi Arabia Fahd bin Abd al-Aziz and Amir of Kuwait 
Jabir al-Ahmad al-Sabah, he visited these countries. He was 
given a warm reception, but the request to recognize the 
independence of Chechnya was not granted. But there was still a 
perceptible propaganda effect from this visit, especially 
against the background of Russia's growing difficulties in the 
Northern Caucasus. 
  The general-president uses constantly changing tactics with 
respect to Russia--from emphasized loyalty within the framework 
of economic relations (not without regular threats, however, of 
reconsidering such a policy) to rather harsh actions within the 
framework of political relations. His supporters stated that 
"formally we have been in a state of war with Russia since 1859, 
for no treaty was signed at that time." Some experts consider 
his words, which he often repeats, to be programmed: "In the 
event of aggressive actions by Russia against the Chechen 
people, all of the Caucasus will rise up. And Russia will lose 
its peaceful life for a long time. Seeing that undisguised 
violence is being committed against the Chechen people, the 
whole Muslim world will rise up. Chechnya is the center of 300 
years of confrontation between the Caucasus and Russia." In 
corridors of the "Unified Caucasian Home" round table held in 
Groznyy in early September, Dudayev stated that "the future of 
world civilization belong to the origin of world 
civilization--the Caucasus." 
  A curious detail: Instead of a monument to Lenin, Dudayev 
has 
decided to place a monument to Khrushchev in Groznyy--Nikita 
Sergeyevich returned the Chechens to their homeland. The general 
has declared his great respect for Mikhail Gorbachev. He also 
once offered political asylum to the former leader of the GDR, 
Erich Honecker, who was being pursued by FRG justice: "It is not 
difficult for us to rescue and protect one destitute old man." 
Dudayev called Honecker a self-sufficient democrat who "erected 
the Berlin wall by no means of his own will." 
  Dudayev is a good athlete and, as they say, an excellent 
family man. His wife Alla is an artist. They have three 
children--a daughter and two sons. One of the local newspapers 
called him a messenger from God. He is also sometimes called a 
"Chechen Yeltsin." 
  Since September 1992, Dudayev has been living in a small 
house in the community of Katayama, which is in the city limits 
of Groznyy. Before this he and his family lived with his older 
brother. 
  The general usually does not dwell at great length on his 
personal life. He once said, however: "I have had no personal 
life since I became involved in politics. Everyone in my family 
loves painting; my wife is a designer and draws a great deal. I 
like music, the poetry of Lermontov, Pushkin, the Decembrist 
poets, and the Russian classical writers--Tolstoy, Chekhov... I 
study karate, and my black belt instructor is always with me." 
In his childhood, he "played soccer and took up 
wrestling--classical and free-style. I even became republic 
school champion," Dudayev once recalled. And now, being 
president, he can launch a helicopter or aircraft high into the 
air. 
<H5>  Vladimir Grigoryevich Yegorov </H5>
  He is an admiral and commander of the Baltic Fleet, which 
was 
created by Peter the Great. 
  He has an open Russian face with soft, typically Slavic 
features, which somewhat conceal the harsh aspect of his eyes. 
But it is possible that this is the result of the tension of the 
last months after the breakup of the USSR and the proclamation 
of independence of the Baltic states laying claim today to a 
part of the property of the fleet and the former Soviet defense 
system in the water areas of the Baltic Sea. 
  The admiral admits that it is a rare night that he is not 
awakened two or three times by telephone calls. The admiral's 
concerns are more than understandable: Russia instantly lost a 
number of very important naval bases and an established coastal 
defense system, the mutual fire support of whose elements was 
formed back under Peter the Great. Three not too friendly 
states, moreover with whom there are numerous unsettled property 
disputes, are potentially hanging over the disrupted lines of 
communication between Kronshtadt and Kaliningrad... 
  However, many fleet officers admit that in such conditions 
Admiral Yegorov is a person doing what he should be doing. "If 
there are sailors from God, Vladimir Grigoryevich Yegorov is one 
of them," notes one who knows his colleague well. 
  Yegorov was born, according to some sources, in Tambovsk 
Oblast, and, according to his official biography, in Moscow on 
26 November 1938. He graduated from the Higher Naval School 
imeni M.V. Frunze in 1962 and the Military Academy of the 
General Staff in 1990, the latter without attending class. 
  He passed through all key fleet positions in succession, 
beginning with head of a department. He then was an executive 
officer, after that he commanded a large antisubmarine warfare 
ship, and was brigade chief of staff. He commanded a brigade of 
ships for seven years. After that he was commander of a naval 
base and headed the Mediterranean Squadron. His last position 
was first deputy commander of the Baltic Fleet. 
  In the fleet he is considered a "gentle" commander who does 
not like harsh rebukes of subordinates done for show. Yegorov 
himself only partly shares such assessments. "If I talk 
respectfully with people without cursing them or trampling their 
hat, is this gentleness? I demonstrate firmness when it is 
necessary, without flaunting it.." 
  Experts note his diplomatic abilities demonstrated in 
contacts with representatives of the Baltic states. Many credit 
him for the fact that the recent attacks by Estonian troops on 
Russian military units in Tallinn have not led to major armed 
clashes and interstate complications. In addition, in the fleet, 
relating differently to the Soviet Union's loss of its strategic 
positions and in general skeptically assessing today's political 
processes, they recall with satisfaction the admiral's response, 
when a correspondent from the American magazine NEW YORKER asked 
if the return of the St. Andrew's flag to ships of the Russian 
Navy means an admission that life was better under tsarism than 
under communism: "We did not live under a tsar," the commander 
stated. 
<H5>  Oleg Aleksandrovich Yerofeyev </H5>
  Vice Admiral Oleg Yerofeyev is the thirteenth commander of 
the Northern Fleet. 
  He was born in 1940 in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsk. As those who 
have known him for a long time note, he has been attracted to 
the Navy since childhood--especially since not only his home 
town and simultaneously a major naval base played a part in 
this, but also the fact that Yerofeyev was born into a family of 
a military man, the commander of an air regiment. 
  He graduated from the Caspian Higher Naval School in 1961. 
He 
began his officer service on a diesel submarine in the Northern 
Fleet, but already in 1963 was transferred to the more 
privileged nuclear-powered submarine fleet. To date he has been 
permitted to command six projects of nuclear-powered submarines. 
He commanded a strategic submarine, then a division of attack 
submarines, and was chief of staff of a flotilla in the Pacific 
Ocean Fleet. 
  He graduated from the Naval Academy and the Military Academy 
of the General Staff, after which he was appointed commander of 
a flotilla of submarines in the Northern Fleet. Three years 
later he was chief of staff of this same fleet. He had a 
connection to the much talked about accident involving the 
nuclear submarine Komsomolets, but his name did not come to 
light in the scandalous newspaper articles concerning this. 
  He was appointed commander of the Northern Fleet in March 
1992. 
  He is a candidate of military sciences and has a daughter 
and 
granddaughter. He does not flaunt his political convictions, 
limiting himself to purely professional opinions about fleet 
combat effectiveness. 
<H5>  Igor Vladimirovich Kasatonov </H5>
  In recent months, arguments are not dying down and passions 
are raging over this name. 
  For some he is a symbol of military honor; for others he is 
a 
reactionary who does not want to recognize the realities of the 
new life. For both, however, it is unquestionable that he is a 
powerful personality having clear-cut ideas about military duty, 
law, and commander's authority. 
  Such is how the press wrote about the commander of the Black 
Sea Fleet, Igor Kasatonov. 
  I.V. Kasatonov was born on 10 February 1939 in Vladivostok 
to 
the family of a military seaman. His father, Vladimir Kasatonov, 
was once even the commander of the same Black Sea Fleet which 
until recently his son commanded and generally was fairly widely 
known in Navy circles. 
  I.V. Kasatonov graduated from the Black Sea Higher Naval 
School imeni P.S. Nakhimov in 1960. He is a naval gunner by 
specialty. He began his officer service in the position of 
battery commander and then was head of a department. 
Subsequently, he went from executive officer to commander of an 
antisubmarine warfare ship. Subordinates characterize him as a 
"stern muzhik" who knows the service and is able to achieve 
order. 
  He graduated from the Sevastopol Instrument Building 
Institute already as an officer and in 1975 graduated from the 
Naval Academy, after which he was appointed chief of staff of a 
division of ships. He graduated from the Military Academy of the 
General Staff in 1979. He commanded a division of ships from 
1980 to 1982 and became commander of a flotilla in 1982. In 1988 
he was appointed firs deputy commander of the Northern Fleet and 
in September 1991 began commanding the Black Sea Fleet, which 
came under crossfire of mutual claims to it by Ukraine and 
Russia. 
  The events developed swiftly. 
  "Everything began with the fact," the admiral says, "that L. 
Kravchuk summoned us three commanders of the districts and the 
Fleet and announced that henceforth he was commander in chief of 
forces of the Republic of Ukraine and that we along with the 
personnel, weapons, and equipment were being transferred to him. 
To put it mildly, this surprised me... There are 46 
nationalities in the Fleet..." 
  Then the admiral was ordered to administer the oath of 
allegiance to Ukraine to the Fleet before 10 January, and report 
to Kiev before 12 January the names of those who refused to take 
a second oath in their lives. 
  Kasatonov refused to transfer his sailors. "I said: I have 
already given a pledge of allegiance to Ukraine, as well as to 
Russia, Belorussia, Kazakhstan, and the other republics of the 
Union..." 
  He was immediately declared persona non grata in 
Kiev. But Kasatonov remained in Sevastopol. 
  Ukraine announced a blockade of the Fleet. There was no more 
fuel. They stopped paying the officers. They shut off the water 
to Sevastopol and raised prices. 
  On 30 January, in a telegram to the commander in chief of 
the 
CIS Combined Armed Forces, Marshal Ye. Shaposhnikov, and the 
commander in chief of the Navy, Admiral V. Chernavin, Leonid 
Kravchuk accused Kasatonov of a rude and scornful attitude 
toward a group of people's deputies and officials of the 
Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The admiral had refused to 
receive them and forbid them to visit military ships, units, and 
subunits. The president of Ukraine emphatically demanded the 
removal of Admiral Kasatonov from his position. 
  As a result, Vice Admiral Kasatonov was drawn into politics 
very quickly, and now he can be compared perhaps with General 
Aleksandr Lebed, who tried with some success to calm down the 
sides in the Dniester conflict by using harsh political 
statements. The statements by Kasatonov, who during this time 
had become an admiral, are perhaps less graphic in nature, but 
to make up for it his actions are a constant annoyance for the 
Kiev leadership, beginning with the fact that he has refused to 
take the Ukrainian oath and ending with the fact that the 
Ukrainian representatives have been unable to establish control 
over the Fleet by force. 
  "In my opinion, someone in Ukraine sees the Black Sea Fleet 
as a commercial commodity which may be profitable to sell or, 
say, exchange for oil. Unfortunately, the professional approach 
absolutely is not visible here." "...Literally everyone is 
taking it upon themselves to judge the fate of the Fleet: 
agronomists, journalists, housewives... Legally, it is obvious: 
The Black Sea Fleet is a component part of the CIS forces. All 
my actions as commander of the Fleet stem from this..." 
  Admiral Kasatonov, so clearly opposing the Ukrainian 
leadership, was in quite a delicate situation, however. After an 
understanding was reached between Kravchuk and Yeltsin 
concerning the fate of the Black Sea Fleet--and on the principle 
of joint appointment of its commander--virtually none of the 
observers rated the chances of Igor Kasatonov staying in 
Sevastopol as high. 
  By decree of the president of the Russian Federation dated 5 
October 1992, Admiral Kasatonov was appointed first deputy 
commander in chief of the Russian Navy. 
  In October of that same year, he was nominated as a people's 
deputy of Russia to fill the position vacated in Krasnodar Kray 
by Vladimir Shumeyko, who was appointed first vice prime 
minister of the government of Russia. Among the two dozen 
challengers were the ataman of the Kuban Cossacks, former KGB 
General Oleg Kalugin, and co-chairman of the Party of Economic 
Freedom, Konstantin Borovoy. 
  He is married and has three children. 
<H5>  Konstantin Ivanovich Kobets </H5>
  Former state adviser for defense to the president of the 
Russian Federation and today chief military inspector of the 
Armed Forces of Russia, Army General Konstantin Ivanovich Kobets 
was born in 1939 to the family of a steel-worker. He graduated 
from the Kiev Military Communications School, the 
Electrotechnical and Polytechnical institutes, the Military 
Communications Academy, and the Military Academy of the General 
Staff. 
  In 1986, Kobets participated in the clean-up following the 
Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant accident and in 1987 in 
restoration communications facilities in areas of Armenia 
destroyed by the earthquake. General Kobets is a professor and 
doctor of military sciences. From 1987 to 1991, Colonel-General 
Kobets was chief of the Signal Troops of the USSR Armed Forces 
and deputy chief of the General Staff. 
  In June 1990, residents of Chekhovskiy Rayon, Moscow Oblast, 
elected him people's deputy of the RSFSR. On 31 January 1991, 
the Presidium of the RSFSR Supreme Soviet confirmed him as 
chairman of the RSFSR Supreme Soviet Committee for Defense and 
State Security. Then, in March 1991, the committee was renamed 
the State Committee for Public Security and Cooperation with the 
USSR Ministry of Defense and the USSR Committee for State 
Security. Kobets remained its chairman. 
  At that time, the military and journalists writing about the 
Army believed that the appointment of Kobets as chairman of the 
committee was to be the compromise that could suit not only 
Boris Yeltsin but also, taking into account their long 
friendship, Minister of Defense Dmitriy Yazov. 
  According to informed sources, military service and studies 
have long linked Konstantin Kobets and Marshal Yazov. They 
maintained friendly relations right up until the events of 
August 1991, when Yazov joined the Emergency Committee, which 
separated the friends on different sides of barricades. 
  Opinions were also expressed that the main idea behind the 
appointment of Kobets was to use him to try to eliminate 
democratically oriented people in the military who, it was 
believed, had "ensconced themselves" in the committee, above all 
Deputy Chairman Vladimir Lopatin. Nevertheless, the general 
proved himself to be quite loyal on the committee. The conflict 
with democrats came down to a debate over whether the Defense 
Committee should be a military or civilian department. However, 
with the constant reorganizations and shake-ups taking place in 
the committee during its year of existence (of which workers of 
the committee accuse then-prime minister of Russia, Ivan 
Silayev, who experienced, in their view, an incomprehensible 
reluctance to deal with its problems), it does not seem possible 
to cite the merits of Kobets more or less noted by the public. 
  Nevertheless, General Kobets said this about himself: "If a 
Russian sits, he will not get to the end..." 
  On 19 August 1991, Boris Yeltsin, in addition to everything 
else, resubordinated to himself the troops stationed in Russia, 
appointing Kobets minister of defense. Thus, he became the first 
minister of defense of the Russian Federation--but only until 6 
September 1991. 
  After the failure of the putsch, after returning to Moscow, 
Mikhail Gorbachev, at the recommendation of Yeltsin, promoted 
Kobets to the rank of general of the army. At the same time, 
captive of the post-putsch moods, the USSR president made the 
decision to conduct military reform in the country, created a 
committee for preparing and conducting the reform, and assigned 
Kobets to head the committee. Thus, Kobets had his post in the 
Russian defense department taken away from him, which was given 
to the rising star of that time--the commander of the 
paratroopers who remained loyal, Pavel Grachev. According to 
available information, General Kobets and several of those close 
to him received expensive gifts as a reward for participating in 
cleaning up after the coup. They mention receiving automobiles 
for themselves and aides, as well as household appliances. In 
addition, it is claimed that his secretary, who absolutely did 
not demonstrate her worth during the three-day confrontation and 
calmly went home, when everyone was waiting for the night 
assault, received an order after the victory over the putsch, 
while there was nothing for the many real defenders. 
  Kobets himself mentioned his past friendship with General 
Kalinin, chief of the Moscow garrison during those days in 
August, and also said that he thought much about him, trying to 
outplay on an operational map the friend who had become a combat 
enemy. This probably made Kobets publicly express sympathy for 
those who ended up "on the other side:" "You talk to me about 
victory, and I sit and think: All the same, it is good that I am 
not the minister and that I did not may a career for myself in 
all this and did not take the blame to heart. Now everyone 
knows: The military of `that camp' are state criminals, and I 
know many of them personally, studied with them, and worked with 
some of them... It is hard for me to look their families in the 
eye. This is also a tragedy." 
  When the leaders of the union republics almost unanimously 
began to call for creating their own armed forces, Kobets and 
Shaposhnikov, the new USSR minister of defense, suggested to the 
president to strive to preserve a unified army, unified command 
and control of strategic nuclear forces, while preserving 
unified military-strategic planning, and a unified system of 
training military personnel with logistic support and budget 
financing. At that time, these views found support at the 
highest echelons of power and slowly began to be put into 
practice. 
  At the same time, Vladimir Lopatin, who was the deputy 
chairman under Kobets on the Committee for Defense Issues, 
assailed his former boss with harsh public criticism. He charged 
that the general, being chairman, did nothing to form the State 
Committee for Defense Issues and took no steps to clarify the 
role of top Army officers and generals in preparing and carrying 
out the coup d'etat, although he also headed the corresponding 
commission. Some remained convinced that Kobets at that same 
time did not forget about solving his personal problems. 
  On 25 March 1992, Decree Number 300 was signed, abolishing 
the service of the state adviser to the RSFSR president for 
defense issues "in connection with creation of the Ministry of 
Defense of the Russian Federation." Kobets was "reassigned to 
the Headquarters of the CIS Combined Armed Forces" and 
essentially ended up being removed from staff. 
  Beginning 4 April 1992, Kobets was deputy chairman of the 
State Commission for Forming the Ministry of Defense of the 
Russian Federation. He headed a group for determining a listing 
and status of troops stationed on the territories of states of 
the "near abroad." However, cynics in the Army say it is "a 
place for him until retirement." For what does this commission 
do today when its goals have been achieved and it no longer has 
any real powers any more?.. 
  Then in September he was appointed to the post of chief 
military inspector of Russia's Armed Forces... Journalists were 
interested in knowing if this appointment was a revival of the 
"paradise group" of the USSR Ministry of Defense. The military 
department, it is reported, gave a short and clear answer: "No!" 
<H5>  Andrey Afanasyevich Kokoshin </H5>
  In the second half of February 1992, the Democratic Russia 
and Military for Democracy movements, as well as representatives 
of the military-industrial complex and military science, among 
whom were the general director of the Mashinostroyeniye 
Scientific Production Association [NPO], G. Yefrimov, and the 
general designer of the Almaz NPO, B. Bunkin, and academicians 
Ye. Velikhov, Yu. Ryzhkov, and others recommended to Russian 
Federation President B. Yeltsin and the Supreme Soviet of the 
Russian Federation to appoint A. Kokoshin minister of defense of 
Russia. 
  On 3 April 1992, Boris Yeltsin appointed Andrey Kokoshin 
deputy minister of defense of the Russian Federation. Prior to 
this, he was deputy director of the USA and Canada Institute of 
the Russian Academy of Sciences and corresponding member of the 
Russian Academy of Sciences. 
  Andrey Afanasyevich Kokoshin was born on 26 October 1945 
into 
the family of an officer. He graduated from the instrument 
building faculty of the Moscow Higher Technical School imeni 
N.E. Bauman in 1969. After graduation he studied defense 
technologies and then worked on using them for peaceful 
purposes. In 1972, Kokoshin completed his graduate studies at 
the USA and Canada Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences and 
in 1973 became a candidate and in 1982 a doctor of historical 
sciences. He became a professor in 1987. 
  He is a reserve officer. He has not served in the Army. 
  At the Academy of Sciences and the USA and Canada Institute, 
they say that Kokoshin is an "active social and political 
figure" who has been and is part of numerous initiatives and 
movements of scientists for disarmament and for strengthening 
peace. And this is indeed the case--today he is: Director of the 
Center for Conversion and Privatization at the USA and Canada 
Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, a member of the 
National Commission for Promoting Conversion, first deputy 
chairman of the Committee of Russian Scientists for Global 
Security. 
  In the 1980's, Andrey Kokoshin was among the main experts 
who 
participated in preparing disarmament treaties between the USSR 
and the United States and also other western countries. It is 
believed that he was one of the main developers of the military 
doctrine of the Warsaw Pact member-states adopted in 1987. He 
advanced and actively supported the "global double zero" 
position and defended the opinion that the "Krasnoyarsk radar 
did not go beyond the framework of the ABM Treaty." Then, 
however, Gorbachev had to revise positions, heeding the opinions 
of his western opponents. Kokoshin also had to change his 
opinion. 
  In general, many of those who known him maintain that 
Kokoshin is an extremely cautious person, which often makes him 
a "hostage to compromise." 
  Of his political views, the public knows only that he is an 
"advocate of ending the war between the `whites' and the `reds'." 
  During visits by Russian President B. Yeltsin to countries 
of 
Western Europe and the United States in late 1991 and early 
1992, A. Kokoshin was engaged in his usual job--he was head of a 
group of experts on military-political issues and issues of 
conversion. 
  Andrey Afanasyevich Kokoshin was the first Soviet scientist 
in late 1991 to address the U.S. Congress on questions of USSR 
military doctrine and military reform. 
  A.A. Kokoshin has authored a large number of articles and 
sections of 12 monographs on questions of military policy, 
conversion, and disarmament, published not only in the USSR but 
also in the United States, Japan, Germany, and other countries. 
  However, due to his cautious nature, he also has not 
strengthened his positions in the Grachev Ministry of Defense 
and, despite his lofty position, has no real power here. 
<H5>  Mikhail Petrovich Kolesnikov </H5>
  First deputy chief of the General Staff of Russia's Armed 
Forces, among military personnel, Colonel-General Mikhail 
Kolesnikov is considered a staff officer down to the bone. This 
is probably not correct, for as the right hand of the chief of 
the General Staff, General Dubynin, he has also passed through 
all levels of command positions, up to and including commanding 
an army. But it is also true that he has served in chief of 
staff positions at various levels off and on since 1977. 
  Mikhail Kolesnikov is a Siberian and was born on 30 June 
1939 
in the city of Yeysk, Krasnoyarsk Kray. He graduated from the 
Omsk Tank Technical School in 1959. He began serving in the 
troops in the position of platoon commander and then commanded a 
company and battalion. In 1975, after graduating from the 
Military Armored Troops Academy, he was appointed commander of a 
regiment. Beginning in 1977, he was chief of staff and deputy 
commander of a division, and in 1979 he was commander of a tank 
division. 
  He graduated from the Military Academy of the General Staff 
in 1983. He became a corps commander in 1983. He then commanded 
an army in the Transcaucasus Military District. From 1987 he was 
chief of staff and first deputy commander of the Siberian 
Military District. From 1988 he was chief of staff and first 
deputy commander in chief of the Southern Sector. From 1990 he 
was chief of the Main Staff and first deputy commander in chief 
of the Ground Forces. From 1991 he was deputy chief of the 
General Staff of the USSR Armed Forces. Here he was 
characterized both by superiors and subordinates as one of the 
most experienced staff workers of the Armed Forces of Russia. By 
Decree of the Russian Federation President dated 10 June 1992 he 
was appointed first deputy chief of the General Staff of the 
Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. 
  Judging from certain silent comments, Mikhail Kolesnikov is 
rather restrained with respect to the policy of the present 
government and, in general, of the democrats who took power 
after 21 August 1991. However, it is difficult to be specific in 
this regard, for he has limited himself to a discussion of 
almost purely Army problems in his few official speeches. 
<H5>  Georgiy Grigoryevich Kondratyev </H5>
  Colonel-General Georgiy Kondratyev, deputy minister of 
defense of Russia, was born on 17 November 1944 in the city of 
Klintsy, Bryansk Oblast. He graduated with honors from the 
Kharkov Tank Command School in 1965. In 1973, after graduating 
with honors from the Military Armored Troops Academy, he became 
chief of staff of a regiment. From 1974 he was a regiment 
commander, and from 1978 he was a deputy commander and then 
commander of a division. 
  He graduated with a gold medal from the Military Academy of 
the General Staff in 1985 and was appointed first deputy 
commander of an army in the Turkestan Military District. From 
1987 he was commander of an army. From 1989 he was first deputy 
commander of the Turkestan Military District and was the last 
commander of the Turkestan Military District. 
  He was appointed deputy minister of defense of the Russian 
Federation by Decree of the President of the Russian Federation 
dated 10 June 1992. 
<H5>  Anatoliy Mikhaylovich Kornoukov </H5>
  Lieutenant-General of Aviation Anatoliy Mikhaylovich 
Kornukov, commander of the Moscow Air Defense District, was born 
on 10 January 1942 in the city of Stakhanov, Lugansk Oblast. He 
graduated from the Chernigov Higher Military Aviation School for 
Pilots in 1964. 
  He began his service in the Air Defense Troops as a senior 
pilot. In 1974 he was commander of a fighter regiment. After 
graduating from the Military Command Academy of Air Defense 
imeni G.K. Zhukov in 1980, he was commander of a fighter 
division and then commander of a fighter corps. 
  He graduated from the Military Academy of the General Staff 
of the USSR Armed Forces in 1988. He successively held positions 
of first deputy commander of Fighter Aviation of the Air Defense 
Troops, first deputy commander of an air defense formation, and 
from 1989 was commander of an air defense formation. He was 
appointed commander of the Moscow Air Defense District in late 
September 1991. 
<H5>  Aleksandr Ivanovich Lebed </H5>
  He was born on 20 April 1950 in Novocherkassk, Rostov 
Oblast, 
into a working-class family. His father is Ivan Andreyevich, his 
mother is Yekaterina Grigoryevna. Although many men from the 
Lebed family had occasion to fight (his grandfather returned 
from the Great Patriotic War as a ranking noncommissioned 
officer and his father returned as a senior sergeant), Aleksandr 
was the first to become a professional military man. Later, two 
brothers followed in his footsteps. 
  He graduated from the Ryazan Higher Airborne Command School 
imeni Leninist Komsomol in 1973. (Prior to this, he had applied 
at the Armavir Aviation School, but each time was not accepted 
for health reasons). 
  For eight years, from 1973 to 1981, he commanded a platoon 
and then a company at his school. In other words, he was 
assigned a command back when he was still a cadet. You see, the 
most zealous graduates are left at the school. According to 
available information, A. Lebed was a platoon commander in the 
same company which was commanded at that time by Russia's 
present-day minister of defense, Pavel Grachev. 
  He participated in combat operations on the territory of the 
Republic of Afghanistan as commander of an airborne battalion in 
1981-1982. There is almost no information about his combat 
operations, but it is known that the battalion carried out 
primarily missions to intercept caravans with weapons. 
  He studied at the Military Academy imeni M.V. Frunze between 
1982 and 1985. After graduating, he commanded an airborne 
regiment in 1985-1986. 
  He was deputy commander in 1986-1988 and then commander of 
an 
airborne division in 1989-1991. 
  He was promoted to the rank of general in 1991 and appointed 
deputy commander of the Airborne Troops for combat training and 
military educational institutions. 
  On 19-20 August 1991, an airborne battalion of the Tula 
Division commanded by A. Lebed provided security for the Russian 
White House. According to other information (in the words of his 
boss, Pavel Grachev, in a careless interview following the 
putsch), Aleksandr Lebed was only conducting reconnaissance of 
the defense of the Russian parliament building. And not alone, 
but with the head of the elite group of KGB "Alfa commandos," V. 
Karpukhin, who had been given the order to storm the White 
House. According to the German newspaper DIE ZEIT, the plans of 
the plotters at that time was to direct OMON subunits to clear 
people from the road to the parliament building. After that, 
"Alfa" was to storm the building floor by floor, as it once did 
in Kabul, and in the end arrest Boris Yeltsin. Members of the 
"Alfa" group subsequently refused to storm the building, but at 
that time no one could have known this, and Karpukhin was 
accompanying Lebed and reconnoitering the approach routes to the 
White House, estimating the number of civilian defenders who had 
gathered around it, and recording it all on video. On 20 August, 
the chief of the Information Directorate of the USSR Ministry of 
Defense, Lieutenant-General V. Manilov, called Lebed's switch to 
the side of the White House "such low-grade rumors that it was 
awkward to comment on them" and stated that they "were totally 
unfounded." 
  There exists written eyewitness testimony: "At 1500 hours on 
19 August, General Lebed, carrying out the order of his 
commander (Grachev), demanded the chief of security and 
protection of government facilities of the Russian Federation 
"to remove the guards and leave the building by 1600 hours," 
otherwise "paratroops would shoot everyone." 
  However, there are also other versions circulating: 
According 
to the newspaper RESPUBLIKA, at one of the few meetings with 
USSR Minister of Defense Yazov, after seeing Lebed, Yazov 
spitefully asked: "What, you haven't shot yourself yet? I would 
have done so long ago if I were in your shoes..." Rumors 
circulated around Moscow about the suicide of General Lebed. 
  Those who have known Lebed for a long time characterize him 
as a soldier who adhered to the principle that "the Army is 
outside of politics and that the Army does not wish to be drawn 
into another round of public merrymaking." True, Lebed once was 
a CPSU member and at the constituient congress of the RSFSR 
Communist Party (June 1990) was elected a member of its Central 
Committee. 
  Still, less than a year went by after the putsch and the 
general was again "drawn into" politics: In June 1992 he was 
appointed commander of the 14th Army stationed in the Dniester 
region, where he replaced General Yu. Netkachev. This happened 
after the memorable action by Moldavian troops in Bendery, where 
many peaceful residents died in three days, and the Russian Army 
gazed upon the bloody mess with indifference. 
  Lebed became even more famous in the Dniester region than 
during the days following the putsch. This was primarily because 
he brought order to the troops of the 14th Army, which was 
recognized not only by command authorities and journalists but 
also by the soldiers themselves, who suddenly felt needed and 
responsible. He also "put in order" the Dniester region itself, 
where harsh, even brutal statements by the general and 
absolutely unambiguous measures cooled down both sides. When 
Kishinev failed to heed his warning about the "armed neutrality" 
of Russian troops, the general did not even stop at giving the 
order to make a missile and artillery strike against the 
Kitskansk bridgehead of the Moldavian Army. The effect, 
according to witnesses, "was quite impressive," and in the end 
the "hawk disguised as a swan," and the Moldavian press called 
the new commander of the army. He turned out the be the only 
person who was able to really start to separate the warring 
sides. This was also recognized. It is curious that even the 
left-wing press limited itself merely to recording the general's 
stated position with the directness and specificity inherent to 
him. For example: 
  "I can no longer regard Snegur, the legally, I emphasize 
legally, elected president of Moldova, as president... In place 
of a power leadership, he has organized a fascist state. And his 
clique is fascist..." 
  When he was in Kishinev, Lebed refused in an emphatic manner 
to shake the hand of the minister of defense of Moldova, Mirche 
Kostash, who had given the order to take Bendery: "The minister 
of defense is a general, or more precisely he is not a general, 
but a cannibal from DOSAAF." Such a stand by A. Lebed also 
raised his prestige among the Cossacks, who in August 1992 
elected him honorary member of the Black Sea Cossacks. 
  He was also unfriendly with the Russian leadership: 
  "They are destroying a power, everything is crumbling and 
being stolen before your eyes, and what kind of discipline can 
there be here? Any person, especially one wearing shoulder 
boards, must feel the power behind them. This is his mainstay. 
He then feels he is a citizen and disciplines himself 
internally. During the perestroyka years, all of this was lost. 
Now perestroyka has tightly entered its second 
phase--`shooting.' When the third phase of `roll call' will 
come, it is hard to say..." 
  "It is time to stop hanging around the swamp of a 
little-understood and little-intelligible policy..." 
  "We have done enough begging around the world, like goats 
begging for a carrot. It is time to get down to business. 
Observe supremacy of power. Let us get involved..." 
  The general's statements about the Russian leadership's 
policy with respect to its own army are also quite unprejudiced: 
A mass of equipment is being transferred to the Moldavian Army, 
and its requests are being poorly met. The general recalls that 
half a century ago, his father fought the Romanians at 
Stalingrad. 
  After such statements, A. Lebed was ordered not to meet with 
journalists, but the impassioned campaign anticipated by many to 
condemn the extremist general in the manner of those who once 
attacked Viktor Alksnis, who was much more restrained and who 
possessed no real power--this campaign did not take place. True, 
according to sources claiming to be informed, sanctions on 
Aleksandr Lebed were still ensued: By mid-July he still had not 
been confirmed by the president in his position. In addition, 
the decision promoting him to lieutenant-general was not 
signed--supposedly the only one on the list of those submitted. 
He did not receive this rank until three months later... 
  The general is married. His wife, Inna Aleksandrovna, was 
born in 1948 and is a housewife. They have three children--two 
sons and one daughter. Son Aleksandr, 20 years old (born in 
1972), and daughter Yekaterina, 19 years old (born 1973), are 
students at the Tula Polytechnical Institute. The youngest son 
Ivan, 13 years old (born 1979), is in school. As is typical for 
children of officers, he has changed schools eight times in 
eight years. 
  One of A. Lebed's brothers, Aleksey Ivanovich, a 37-year-old 
guards colonel, fought in Afghanistan. He has a combat order and 
medals. He commands an airborne regiment stationed in Kishinev 
which is presently being transferred to Abakan. 
<H5>  Vladimir Nikolayevich Lobov </H5>
  Strictly speaking, he is retired. But he played his part in 
developing the Russian Army if only by the fact that he became 
chief of the General Staff immediately after the events of 
August 1991 and planned to make it the central body of direct 
command and control of the troops and their preparation of 
combat operations (patterned after the Americans). 
  Vladimir Nikolayevich Lobov was born in 1935 in Bashkiriya 
to 
a large Russian peasant family. He served 37 years in the army 
and went from private to general of the army, doctor of 
sciences, and professor. 
  He graduated from secondary school and the Ryazan Artillery 
School simultaneously. He began his officer service in the 
Strategic Rocket Forces. 
  He graduated from the Military Academy imeni M.V. Frunze and 
the Military Academy of the General Staff. 
  He headed the Combined Armed Forces of the Warsaw Pact 
member-states, being first deputy chief of the General Staff of 
the USSR Armed Forces. In the fall of 1991, the Warsaw Pact 
ceased to exist without excessive fuss, and General Lobov was 
"exiled" to the chiefs of the Military Academy imeni M.V. 
Frunze. He worked there only two months and was involved in 
student recruitment. However, according to another version, he 
fell in disgrace for defending the idea of contacts between the 
military-political blocs of the Warsaw Pact and NATO. 
  Then he commanded the Central Asian Military District. In 
this capacity he experienced quite a bit of trouble when during 
the student unrest in Alma-Ata he refused to put troops on the 
streets of the city. But this incident taught him little: In 
August 1991, he refused to carry out the order of the putsch 
organizers to become military commandant of one of the areas of 
Moscow. He later said in this regard: "After being notified of 
the troops introduced into Moscow, I experienced a strong 
feeling of outrage and protest. This must not be done--tanks 
against unarmed people... Unfortunately, very many servicemen 
during those troubled days of August had to resolve an almost 
unresolvable moral contradiction. We must spare military people 
from such ordeals once and for all. We must spare them by law." 
  Nevertheless, the rather well-known G. Arbatov once 
remarked: 
"Lobov is a person who deep in his heart holds similar views to 
those of the coup plotters, in any case on questions of policy." 
  In general, Lobov was remembered by many as a military man 
with progressive views. Beginning in 1985, he expressed in 
various forms his disagreement with the policy of the previous 
army leadership. 
  Within the army, he is known as a supporter of progressive 
military doctrines and a modern professional and unified army. 
It is believed that his views on this point were completely 
confirmed by the Americans' actions during Operation Desert 
Storm. He is open to dialogue concerning reform with author 
collectives of all alternative projects and representatives of 
the republic. 
  He is noted for his education level (doctor of military 
sciences, candidate of historical sciences, professor) and also 
the breadth and professional nature of his views. 
  At the very start of perestroyka back in 1986, he proposed a 
program of fundamental reform of the army. But he was not heard. 
  The following can be considered the most typical of his 
statements: 
  "We caution against splitting up the armed forces into 
national armies." 
  "The more separate armed forces there are, the more real the 
danger of confrontation between republics." 
  "Let us be objective: The USSR and the United States are 
separated by a huge distance. Even if we ignore this 
circumstance, the land groupings located on their territories do 
not pose a real threat to us with their combat capabilities... 
We are watching to see that parity in the main area--nuclear 
arms--is not disrupted." 
  "The main task is to preserve the unified armed forces to 
protect the economic space which will take shape as a result of 
the new interrelations." 
  Immediately after the putsch, he was appointed chief of the 
General Staff of the USSR Armed Forces and was finally given an 
opportunity to implement his views. 
  In the three months that he was in the position of chief of 
the General Staff, Lobov, in his own view, had time to do very 
much: The Strategic Deterrence Forces were created; the 
transition to a professional army was prepared; the compulsory 
term of service was reduced to 18 months; steps were taken for 
social protection of officers; and much else... 
  He believed that there was no room for blind executors in 
the 
General Staff, especially in its top echelon. However, he 
himself could not find a common language with the command 
authorities of the armed forces. 
  Shaposhnikov made a complaint against him: "Recently, you 
have been writing much in the newspapers and magazines..." At 
the collegium he announced that Lobov had submitted a request to 
be relieved of his duties for health reasons (he could not be 
discharged for age or for duty discrepancies). However, it 
turned out that Lobov had refused to write the request himself. 
  According to Major Vladimir Lopatin, former deputy chairman 
of the State Committee of Russia for Defense Matters, this 
reflected the "troubling signs of dissension in the new 
leadership": "A triangle had taken shape: General of the Army 
Konstantin Kobets, General of the Army Vladimir Lobov, and 
Marshal of Aviation Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov. The contradictions 
revealed themselves openly for the first time at the Collegium 
of the Ministry of Defense on 17 September. It was a question of 
dividing up the functions of the Ministry of Defense and the 
General Staff. Each proposed his own model and, accordingly, 
more power for himself. In the end, these contradictions also 
led to the retirement of the chief of the General Staff." 
  The preparations to remove General Lobov were accomplished 
in 
deep secrecy (there were no rumors at all, which is rare for the 
General Staff). One week before retirement, the former chief was 
sent on a visit to England and was immediately removed from the 
position upon arriving. It is said that officials of the British 
Defense Ministry were most offended, having wasted much effort 
on organizing the first visit in history to Great Britain by a 
chief of the General Staff of the USSR Armed Forces. 
  On 14 December 1991, Ye. Shaposhnikov submitted a memorandum 
to President Gorbachev, in which he recommended discharging 
General Lobov from the ranks of the armed forces. 
  Shaposhnikov was victorious in the end--everything remained 
as before in the Ministry of Defense, and the General Staff also 
remained just one of its subdivisions. Pavel Grachev was the 
only winner in the end... 
  In general, 1991 turned out to be extremely unfortunate for 
Lobov: He was removed from office four times. He buried his 
mother and younger brother that same year. 
  At the constituent congress of the Russian fund "Rekviyem" 
[Requiem] (for the revival and preservation of spiritual values, 
the search and protection of monuments of history and military 
burials in Russia and abroad, development of friendship and 
cooperation of citizens of various countries), Lobov was elected 
its president in July 1992. 
<H5>  Vladimir Nikolayevich Lopatin </H5>
  Official references call him a "statesman of the Russian 
Federation. An irony of fate is the fact that the "statesman" 
has already been unemployed for several months now, and for the 
time being it is not apparent that anyone is concerned about the 
future fate of the former deputy chairman of the RSFSR State 
Committee for Defense Issues... 
  Vladimir Lopatin was born on 16 March 1960 in the settlement 
of Fomka, Yeniseyskiy Rayon, Krasnoyarsk Kray, into a 
working-class family. His father is Nikolay Alekseyevich 
Mayorov; his mother is Anna Dmitrevna Buzuyevskaya (Lopatina). 
  He graduated from the Achinsk Construction Technical School 
in 1977 and the Kurgan Higher Military-Political Aviation School 
in 1981. 
  He entered the armed forces in 1977. He was a Komsomol 
committee secretary at a repair and technical base of the 
Northern Fleet Air Forces 1981-1982; Komsomol committee 
secretary at a naval missile-carrying aviation regiment of the 
Northern Fleet Air Forces 1982-1983; senior instructor for 
Komsomol work of the political department of the Northern Fleet 
Air Forces 1983-1985; assistant for Komsomol work to the chief 
of the political department of a naval missile-carrying aviation 
division of the Northern Fleet Air Forces 1985-1987; and 
propagandist at an aviation-technical base of the Northern Fleet 
Air Forces 1987-1989. He was chief of the University of 
Marxism-Leninism at a garrison officer's club 1989-1990. 
Immediately following his election as a USSR people's deputy in 
1990, Vladimir Lopatin stated that he was a democratically 
oriented figure who is not afraid to criticize harshly the 
highest-ranking figures. This made him popular in democratic 
circles. It is known that when he was at the Congress of 
People's Deputies, Lopatin rejected the demand of then-chief of 
the General Staff Moiseyev to wear his uniform to the meetings: 
"We are not in formation here," stated Lopatin. 
  In 1990, Boris Yeltsin appointed him his deputy chairman of 
the RSFSR State Committee for Public Security and Interaction 
with the USSR Ministry of Defense and KGB, and in the absence of 
an appointed chairman, Vladimir Lopatin actually headed Russia's 
Defense Department for several months. 
  He stood out from those around him not only by his political 
engagement, but also, for the first time in recent years, by the 
clearly expressed program of military reform created by him 
together with several progressively thinking young military men. 
This earned him the rather open hatred of the top leadership of 
the armed forces at that time. 
  Vladimir Lopatin visited more than 10 foreign countries in 
the position of deputy chairman of the State Committee. It was 
he who was the first of the high-ranking Soviet military men to 
be received in Washington by U.S. Secretary of Defense R. 
Cheney. He was the first of our military to give reports in 
several parliaments outside the USSR. 
  During the days when it was still possible to preserve the 
Union, he visited all the republics, trying to organize military 
cooperation between them. 
  In 1990, he was discharged into the reserve in connection 
with his transfer to a job in a civilian agency without being 
left on active military service. 
  He was a USSR people's deputy from 1989 through January 
1992. 
In 1990, he was expelled in absentia from the ranks of the CPSU 
at a party meeting of the military unit where he was on the 
party register--as newspapers having the corresponding proof 
wrote--at the demand of USSR Minister of Defense Dmitriy Yazov 
and his political workers. 
  Subsequently, after President Gorbachev intervened into the 
situation, he was reinstated, and in that same year of 1990 he 
announced he was withdrawing from the ranks of the party. He 
developed the concept of military reform never implemented. 
  In September 1991, "as an exception," he was conferred a 
military rank two steps higher than his present rank "for 
services in defense of the White House." The cosmically high 
position upsurge of Major Lopatin met with approval in the 
democratic camp. But he himself did not approve of such a step, 
and in April 1992 he publicly turned down the promotion. 
  His has a wife, Yelena Leonidovna, born in 1963, and a son. 
<H5>  Leonid Sergeyevich Mayorov </H5>
  This name has acquired notoriety in conditions of the 
unsettled disputes with the Baltic states with respect to the 
fate of the Russian Army on their territories: Colonel-General 
Leonid Mayorov was appointed commander of the Northwestern Group 
of Forces stationed in the Baltic in July 1992 (in place of 
Colonel-General V.A. Mironov). 
  Mayorov was born on 22 July 1941 in Georgiyevsk, Stavropol 
Kray. He graduated from the Military Motor Vehicle Command 
School in 1961, the Military Academy of Rear Services and 
Transportation in 1972, and the Military Academy of the General 
Staff in 1986. 
  Mayorov passed through all levels of command: He commanded a 
company, division, and army. In 1976, he was appointed chief of 
staff and deputy commander of a motorized rifle division, and 
three years later he became division commander. He served in the 
Transbaykal Military District, also as chief of staff and then 
as commander of an army. From 1981 and until recently he was 
chief of staff of the Volga-Ural Military District. This draws 
to himself the attention of many columnists, for such a fact 
signifies service under the direct command of General Makashov, 
known for his conservative communist views and his active 
non-acceptance of the democratic regime. 
  Suppositions about the "Afghan" past of the new commander 
were not confirmed. Colonel-General Mayorov had to serve abroad, 
but only in Mongolia. He also was involved in the withdrawal of 
Soviet troop from this country. 
  The colonel-general realistically views his role in the 
Baltic: "The group of forces today have ended up at the junction 
of acute political interests." Hence, the increased attention to 
himself. At the same time, he assesses quite critically the 
position of the Baltic leaders: "Not a word about the fact that 
during the postwar years these very troops helped restore the 
national economy, disarmed tens of thousands of mines, and build 
hundreds of homes, dozens of nurseries, and stores..," but at 
the same time "the passage of legislative acts restricting the 
activities of the troops, seizure of military facilities with 
the use of armed formations..." 
  General Mayorov, according to experts, nevertheless 
demonstrates a quite moderate approach to solving the problems 
with the Baltic states. He tries to find non-conflict junctions 
between the Russian Army and local authorities. One of his 
proposals is to create joint groups with local authorities with 
rights of some kind of "joint coordinating group." True, the 
proposal has not yet been accepted by the Baltic side, but this 
does not disturb the reputation established by Mayorov in the 
troops as one of the intelligent politicians in the army. 
  It is curious that this is already the third politically 
notable military man from the "nest of Makashov"... 
<H5>  Albert Mikhaylovich Makashov </H5>
  "Patriotism is the instinct of self-preservation of a 
nation." These words have become the motto of one of Russia's 
most politically active military men. It seems that he truly 
believes in them. But many are troubled by the fact that the 
general's patriotism has a very red shade... 
  Albert Makashov was born on 12 July 1938 in the village of 
Levaya Rossosh, Voronezh Oblast, to a Cossack family. His father 
was a military man and served in the cavalry and the mechanized 
troops. He ended the war as a senior lieutenant. His mother, a 
nurse, from the Old Believers, named her son in honor of Saint 
Dmitriy Salunskiy, but under pressure from people's physician 
Natalya Vasilyevna, who raised the mother, recorded the name of 
the future general as Albert in honor of one of the characters 
from George Sand's novel "Consuelo." 
  Makashov graduated from the Voronezh Suvorov School, which 
he 
entered at the age of 12. He graduated from the Tashkent Higher 
Combined-Arms Command School in 1960. He then graduated from the 
Academy imeni M.V. Frunze and the Military Academy of the 
General Staff of the USSR Armed Forces, both with gold medals. 
  He began his service as a commander of a reconnaissance 
platoon and was commander of a division reconnaissance company, 
chief of intelligence of a tank regiment, and commander of a 
battalion, regiment, division, and an army. 
  He served in the Transcaucasus, Kiev, and Ural military 
districts and in the Western Group of Forces. 
  In December 1988, being a lieutenant-general, he was 
commandant of a special area of Armenia that was subjected to an 
earthquake. To accelerate assistance to Armenian cities, the 
government allocated considerable money, and up to 20,000 
personnel, 770 pieces of engineering equipment, and 1,500 motor 
vehicles were transferred to General Makashov. 
  Besides the purely economic work, Makashov was also 
entrusted 
with functions of monitoring the political situation. At that 
time the Nagornyy Karabakh conflict continued to flare between 
Armenia and Azerbaijan. General Makashov, appointed military 
commandant of Yerevan by decree of the Presidium of the Supreme 
Soviet of Armenia, was given additional powers. The "Karabakh 
Committee," an Armenian organization advocating the annexation 
of the Nagornyy Karabakh Autonomous Oblast to Armenia, was 
banned. Seven of its eleven leaders were arrested. "The main 
task is to restore citizens' constitutional rights. Unsanctioned 
demonstrations, rallies, strikes, and spectacles have been 
banned. The military has control of transportation, 
communications, mail, telegraph, and other spheres of 
life-support for the city with a population of one million," 
TASS reported during those days. 
  The following was written about Makashov: "Albert 
Mikhaylovich sleeps and eats in his office, leaving it only to 
check the posts which are assigned throughout Yerevan. Officers 
who have known Makashov for a long time claim that during this 
time their general has turned gray and declined in health--such 
tremendous responsibility." 
  From January 1989 to September 1989 A.M. Makashov commanded 
Ural Military District. Then for two years, from September 1989 
to September 1991, after combining and enlarging the military 
districts, he was commander of the Volga-Ural Military District. 
  Makashov spoke at the 19th All-Union Party Conference in the 
summer of 1989. 
  When General Makashov rose to the speaker's rostrum, there 
were few who knew his name. He left it as a person to whom the 
attention of the Soviet and foreign press was riveted. His 
speech was remembered by many as frankly "Bolshevik." In it he 
accused the Soviet leadership at that time of intentionally 
breakup of the country and of retreating from the basic 
principles of the CPSU. For many his image was that of a stern 
military dictator. 
  Evaluating his speech at the 19th Party Conference 
("Communists of the Army and Navy are outrages by the inaction 
of the CPSU Central Committee, Politburo, and Government with 
respect to their protectors, to those who are persecuting their 
soldiers"), he said that he deliberately called fire on himself 
and achieved his set goal. "It has become clear to everyone that 
the one who runs down the Army wants its collapse." 
  In August 1990, western information agencies reported that 
they had information that General Makashov had traveled to Iraq 
and was connected with developing Iraqi plans to capture Kuwait. 
However, the Ministry of Defense categorically denied this 
report. 
  In 1989, Makashov was elected a USSR people's deputy. 
  At the Constituent Congress of the Russian Communist Party, 
remembered for the wild discussions about the place of 
communists in governing the country and the role of the 
Communist Party in the state, Makashov was elected a member of 
the Central Committee. 
  On 13 May 1991, the leadership of several military units and 
labor collectives of the Volga-Ural Military District and the 
Sverdlovsk Higher Political Tank and Artillery School put 
forward and began collecting signatures for the nomination of 
A.M. Makashov for the position of president of the RSFSR. On 
that same day, the general agreed and entered the election 
campaign, naming the Marxist economist V. Sergeyev as his 
candidate for vice-president. 
  It took him only two days to collect more than 100,000 
signatures to register as a candidate for president of Russia. 
More than 20,000 of the signatures came from Yekaterinburg, a 
city where Yeltsin's positions are traditionally strong. 
  At campaign rallies, the general gave unflattering marks to 
the "hasty and rash withdrawal of our troops from Eastern 
Europe," the presidential elections in Georgia, and conversion 
of the defense complex. The challenger expressed the opinion 
that the USSR "was artificially led into an impasse," which he 
proposed getting out of with the aid of a program developed by 
him that called for a "reasonable combination of a planned and 
market economy" on the "territory of a unified and indivisible 
RSFSR within the 1945 borders" and revival of the "state right 
to foreign trade, patriotism, and traditions of all peoples of 
the RSFSR." This program was supported by some servicemen and 
also veterans who saw a danger in the restructuring course of 
Gorbachev and the dangerous, in their view, radicalism of Boris 
Yeltsin. The West German magazine DER SPIEGEL wrote during those 
days: "...Colonel-General Albert Makashov is the favorite of the 
ultra-right and a fervent opponent of Gorbachev. He advocates 
preserving Russian within the 1945 borders, `Sovietization of 
the economy,' and the `spiritual heritage of the Cossacks' and 
opposes foreign capital and also cosmopolitans, parasites, and 
exploiters." 
  The general was unsuccessful in the elections--he received 
3.74 percent of the votes. Nevertheless, Makashov gained great 
notoriety in Russian communist and Russian patriotic circles. 
The newspaper RUSSKIY VESTNIK wrote this about him: "This is a 
political leader who has toiled his entire life in the 
provinces. This is his main support. He has not been spoiled by 
the school of bureaucratic nomenklatura games." 
  In August 1991, Makashov ended up among those who actively 
supported the GKChP. It was reported that he even sent a 
telegram in support of all the decisions of the putsch 
organizers, and he nearly tried to bring jurisdictional troops 
to combat readiness. In any event, after Gorbachev's return to 
Moscow, as an active accomplice of the GKChP, Makashov was sent 
into retirement seven years before the official retirement age 
for a pension. Therefore, the general considers himself not in 
the reserve, but in disgrace. 
  The USSR broke up. After this, the name of the general, as 
it 
seemed, disappeared from the newspapers. However, in early 1992, 
it reappeared on their pages. He spoke at a rally on 23 
February. Then in late February-early March he was part of an 
organizational committee for convening an "Extraordinary 
Congress of the USSR People's Deputies." The Congress was held 
on 17 March 1992 in the settlement of Voronovo near Moscow, 
where a small group (about 200 people) of former deputies called 
for the revival of the USSR and repeated the thesis of their 
adherence to the ideas of the CPSU. 
  The general stated his opinion on nearly all topics of the 
country's life, but in particular devoted many words to the 
armed forces. He spoke out against: 
  --a completely hired army: "Today only four countries-the 
United States, Canada, Great Britain, and Luxembourg--have hired 
armies. History has shown that no hired army has existed long or 
defeated a serious enemy." 
  --depoliticization: "The first political bodies in the 
Russian Army appeared under Kerenskiy. When they say it is 
necessary to depoliticize the army, I see a desire to destroy 
one of the strongest aspects of our reality. You cannot have a 
neutral army. If you drive the party (CPSU) from the armed 
forces, another ideology will instantly take its place." 
  --withdrawal of troop from Eastern Europe: "Take just our 
district. The waiting list for housing has reached 9,000 officer 
not counting those arriving... In addition, new troop deployment 
areas have not been prepared to receive equipment..." 
  --capitalism: "We will not have Swedish, German, or French 
capitalism. Russian capitalism will have a terrible, inhuman 
face..." 
  Today the general often reiterates: "I favor dictatorship, 
but dictatorship of law. And here I am an advocate of stern 
measures and strong power. Otherwise we are heading for a 
disaster..." 
  On the whole, the general's political service record can be 
set forth in the following manner: Participant in the Initiative 
Congress of Communists of Russia (April, July, and October 
1990). Delegate to the Constituent Congress of the Communist 
Party of the RSFSR (June 1990) and the 28th Congress of the CPSU 
(July 1990). Was a participant in the First (April 1991, in 
Leningrad) and the Second (July 1991, in Moscow) Congresses of 
the Communist Initiative Movement. In the presidential election 
on 12 June 1990 he ran for the post of RSFSR president (A.A. 
Sergeyev for vice-president). Delegate to the Constituent 
Congress of the Russian Communist Workers' Party (in 
Yekaterinburg, 23-24 November 1991), where he was elected member 
of the Central Committee and then member of the Organizational 
Bureau of the Central Committee. After being discharged from the 
ranks of the Soviet Army (October 1991), he became actively 
involved in political activities. He was one of the sponsors of 
convening the Sixth Congress of USSR People's Deputies (March 
1992) at which he was elected member of the Standing Presidium 
of the Congress. 
  In October 1992, Makashov joined the Organizational 
Committee 
of the National Salvation Front, soon banned by President B. 
Yeltsin. 
  The general is married to Lyudmila Maksimova. They have 
three 
children and five grandchildren. Their son is a serviceman. 
  The general's hobbies include driving an automobile. He 
began 
driving back in 1956 in an American Dodge. He drives virtually 
all types of civilian and combat vehicles (just as he shoots all 
types of weapons). He bought his Volga back when he was serving 
in Germany. 
  He drinks only on holidays, mainly Russian vodka, although 
at 
the two academies he liked wine and even had the nickname of 
"Dry Wine." He quit smoking after being wounded, back when he 
was a captain. 
  He reads many books on the history of Russia. He prefers the 
novels by Valentin Pikul. Of the classical writers, he admires 
Shakespeare. 
  Although, in his words, he is totally tone deaf, he admires 
Grieg and considers Boris Godunov the model of operatic art. He 
loves folk music and Cossack songs. 
<H5>  Valeriy Ivanovich Mironov </H5>
  Colonel-General Valeriy Mironov, deputy minister of defense 
of the RSFSR, was born on 19 December 1943 in the city of Moscow. 
  He is from the family of a serviceman. He lost his parents 
early. He has worn shoulder boards since 1955, when he was 
accepted at a Suvorov School. After that, he enrolled in the 
Moscow Higher Combined-Arms Command School imeni Supreme Soviet 
of the RSFSR and became a so-called "Kremlin cadet." He began 
his officer service in 1965 in the usual way--in the position of 
platoon commander and then company commander. 
  He held command and staff positions without missing a single 
one. "Nothing extraordinary--neither abrupt upsurges nor 
patronage of influential persons." 
  In 1973, after graduating from the Military Academy imeni 
M.V. Frunze, he was appointed regiment chief of staff and deputy 
commander. He was a regiment commander in 1975, deputy division 
commander in 1977, and division commander in 1979. 
  As he says: "Behind me are the garrisons of the Turkestan 
Military District and the Arctic. Kushka and Pechenga. Heat and 
cold." 
  His division was among the first dropped into Afghanistan in 
December 1979. 
  He graduated from the Military Academy of the General Staff 
in 1984. He was first deputy commander of an army in 1984 and 
first deputy commander of the Leningrad Military District in 
1989. He was commander of the Northwestern Group of Forces 
(previously the Baltic Military District) in 1991. In this 
position, he participated in a large number of negotiations with 
hard-line Baltic politicians and, in the opinion of observers, 
proved to be a pretty good diplomat, although not adapting to a 
changing situation too quickly. The withdrawal of Russian troops 
from the Baltic states also began under him. It took place in an 
exceptionally organized manner. 
  Mironov says: "I do not consider myself to be an aggressive 
person, but I do not agree with the turning the other cheek." 
  He was appointed deputy minister of defense of the Russian 
Federation by decree of the Russian Federation President dated 
10 June 1992. He is responsible for personnel and work with 
personnel. 
  He has two children. His daughter is preparing for work as a 
teacher, and his son is in school. 
<H5>  Aleksandr Gennadyevich Mochaykin </H5>
  He was born in 1948 in Ukraine. His mother is Ukrainian and 
was a prisoner in a Nazi concentration camp, where she was 
liberated by her future husband and his father. He graduated 
from school in Nagornyy Karabakh. He is fluent in Ukrainian and 
Azerbaijani. He worked at the Ilichevskiy Shipyards (Odessa 
Oblast). After compulsory service in the Tank Troops, he 
enrolled in a military school. 
  After school, he served in the ranks of lieutenant to 
captain 
first rank on submarines in the Northern Fleet. His last 
position was assistant commander of a submarine division for 
work with personnel. He participated in a number of long-range 
cruises and served in remote garrisons. 
  At the All-Army Officer's Assembly on 17 January, he was 
elected to the Coordination Council of Officer Assemblies of the 
CIS Combined Armed Forces. He visited the Dniester Region and 
the Nakhichevan Autonomous Oblast in this capacity. He sees the 
council's task as preserving the unity of the officer corps of 
the former USSR Armed Forces without getting involved in 
politics. 
  He is considered a representative of right-wing conservative 
circles in the army. 
  He is married with two children. One of his sons is serving 
in the Ministry of Internal Affairs. 
<H5>  Yuriy Maksimovich Netkachev </H5>
  The general, until recently a regular division commander, 
during the course of the Moldavian-Dniester conflict became a 
notable political figure, primarily because it was clear to all 
parties involved or not involved in the clash: The only serious 
combat force--the 14th Army--was in his hands and controlled by 
him. Hence another role: The role of commander who, it is 
possible, with all his strength kept the Army from breaking up 
into armed detachments fighting for different fronts--and ended 
up in the wrong... 
  Yuriy Netkachev was born on 10 April 1945. 
  He graduated from the Military Academy of the Armored Troops 
in 1976 and the Military Academy of the General Staff in 1988. 
  In January 1992, he was appointed commander of the 14th 
Army, 
after the previous commander, Lieutenant-General G. Yakovlev 
(who, they say, enjoyed prestige), was removed from this 
position at the demand of Moldavia for his sympathies to the 
"separatists," that is, for the Dniester region. 
  Netkachev, arriving from Belorussia, took his place. He 
immediately ordered an armored door to be placed on his hotel 
room... Then, on the order of Netkachev, combat equipment was 
disabled. He drove to the combat engineers with his "spetsnaz" 
company, soldiers and officers were driven into the barracks, 
and "spetsnaz" mined all military supply depots. 
  The general immediately stated that "soldiers of the 14th 
Army will never fight against their own people and will not 
participate in any conflicts." He himself cited one of the 
reasons for this peaceful nature: "I do not plan to turn the 
army that the people have entrusted to me into a mountain of 
corpses." 
  Strange as it may seem, the idea of saving soldiers' and 
officers' lives and neutrality of the army enjoyed little 
popularity in the troops, who long ago had put down roots along 
both sides of the Dniester. Many soldiers of the 59th Division 
transferred to the guards and the "Dniester" Battalion. The 
battalion in Parkany was transferred to the jurisdiction of the 
PMR [Dniester-Moldovan Republic] at almost full strength. At the 
same time, the Moldovans also actively undertook privatization 
of the army: As was reported, it was deprived of two out of 
three divisions and most of the artillery. A surface-to-air 
missile brigade also "left" for Kishinev. 
  By July 1992, all that was left of the army was the 
headquarters, which had under its command the 59th Guards 
Motorized Rifle Division, engineer and logistic support units, 
and units of district and central subordination. Officers 
bitterly joked: You can build an army in front of the army 
commander's door. 
  Having been educated at the Academy of the Armored Troops 
and 
the Military Academy of the General Staff, Major-General 
Netkachev meanwhile continued to balance on a razor blade, 
trying to maintain neutrality between the two sides. It seems he 
actually considered the primary purpose of his stay in the 
Dniester region to be to prevent the troops from being drawn 
into combat operations. "The 14th Army is subordinate to the CIS 
and will not fulfill any demands of the Dniester Republic," he 
stated in March of that year to the United Council of Labor 
Collectives of Tiraspol and the local women's committee, which, 
having actually taken him prisoner, offered to send the army's 
personnel and combat equipment to protect the borders of the 
Dniester region. On the other hand, the commander was also 
subjected to stiff pressure on the part of Kishinev, demanding 
he withdraw his troops from the territory of Moldavia and 
transfer their combat equipment to the republic. 
  It must be said that in March 1992, the general was 
officially notified that the women's strike committee of the 
Dniester region headed by Galina Andreyevna, well-known in these 
parts and whom the people called "admiral," had sentenced him to 
death by hanging for his efforts to maintain the neutrality. 
Somewhat later, on 25 March, he received a letter from the 
People's Front of Moldova, in which he was also promised that he 
would not die from natural causes. 
  It was difficult to take this as a joke, especially after 
the 
report of the arrest of Igor Smirnov, the Dniester president, in 
the very center of Kiev by special services of Moldova and the 
kidnapping of General Yakovlev, former commander of the 14th 
Army, in Odessa Oblast. 
  In military circles, Yuriy Netkachev is considered an honest 
servant who by fate has ended up between two millstones. 
Observers note, however, that up to now he has found a way out 
of the difficult situation by using the following formula: The 
conflict between Moldavia and the Dniester Republic can be 
resolved "only by both sides compromising." At the same time, he 
sometimes reminded that the "army cannot remain an outside 
observer while blood is being shed on the land where it is 
stationed." 
  On 19 May 1992, virtually the first day after Pavel Grachev 
became minister of defense of Russia, it is asserted, he sent a 
telegram to Yu. Netkachev (true, the Ministry of Defense denies 
its existence) which stated: Since "it is Russian land in the 
Dniester region and the situation has worsened, we must protect 
it by all means and methods available." This somewhat 
invigorated the general. 
  Yuriy Netkachev inferred that he is one of those commanders 
who is not inclined to "turn the other cheek." For example, he 
stated to the chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Dniester 
Republic, G. Marakutsa, that the army reserves the right to 
return its weapons "using force and available means." But during 
the course of subsequent events, it turned out that the general 
did not have enough resolve to use force in another regard--to 
stop the slaughter in Bendery in late June 1992, which left a 
nearly indelible mark of his name in the troops. 
  General Lebed, who replaced him in Tiraspol, stated harshly 
that Netkachev had committed almost a military offense, 
permitting the murder of innocent people in plain view of the 
army. 
<H5>  Valentin Nikolayevich Panichev </H5>
  He was born in 1941 in Vologda Oblast. After graduating from 
school, he worked at an experimental aircraft plant. He 
graduated from the law faculty of Leningrad State University in 
1967 and since that time has been in bodies of the procuracy. He 
was the procurator in Pskov and Rostov oblasts and is a state 
legal adviser third class. In the spring of 1992, he was 
appointed chief of the Main Administration for Monitoring 
Observance of Laws on the Armed Forces of the General Procuracy 
of the Russian Federation--chief military procurator. 
  He has never served in the Army and has had no connection 
with it. 
  "Konek" is an "investigative organization." It is notorious 
for the fact that it pled the much talked about "Rostov 
case"--the search for the maniac-murderer Chikatillo. 
  In Panichev's opinion, "in the Army there is a total lack of 
a qualified preliminary investigation service, a criminal 
investigation type operational-investigation service, and OBKhSS 
[Department for Combating the Embezzlement of Socialist Property 
and Speculation]. 
<H5>  Viktor Alekseyevich Prudnikov </H5>
  Deputy minister of defense of the USSR and commander in 
chief 
of the Air Defense Troops, Viktor Alekseyevich Prudnikov was 
born on 4 February 1939 in Rostov-on-Don to a large family (nine 
children). He was left without a mother at an early age. 
  He enrolled in a special school of the Air Force at the age 
of 14. He enrolled in the Armavir Military Aviation School for 
Pilots at the age of 17 and graduated in 1959. He began service 
in the troops as an instructor pilot at a training air regiment. 
He graduated from the Military Air Academy imeni Yu.A. Gagarin 
in 1967 and was appointed deputy commander of an air squadron. 
  Prudnikov has been in the Army 38 years already. He has 
served on the western border, in the Far East, and in Siberia. 
He was promoted early to lieutenant colonel and colonel. 
  He was commander of an air squadron in 1968. He was a 
fighter 
regiment deputy commander for flight training in 1970 and was 
appointed regiment commander a year later. He was deputy 
commander of a division in 1973, commander of an air defense 
division in 1975, and first deputy commander of a separate air 
defense army in 1978. 
  He graduated from the Military Academy of the General Staff 
in 1981 and was appointed first deputy commander and in 1983 
commander of a separate air defense army. From 1989 through 31 
August 1991 he commanded the Moscow Air Defense District, after 
which he became air defense commander in chief of the USSR. 
Viktor Prudnikov was appointed air defense commander in chief of 
Russia in August 1992. 
  According to colleagues, he is a man of "exceptional honesty 
and decency." 
  During his free time he swims and plays tennis. He goes to 
the theater whenever he can. 
  He is trying to raise his two sons to be "honest, 
industrious, and decent people." His oldest son enrolled in a 
higher civil aviation flight school, but his health failed. "We 
lost our youngest son to an untimely death." 
<H5>  Aleksandr Vladimirovich Rutskoy </H5>
  The charged atmosphere of perestroyka in Russia has drawn 
out 
a number of colorful figures who have become noticeable images 
on its political scene. 
  One of the most astonishing upsurges--even against the 
background of our present patron-president's career, rich with 
incidents--was made by Russia's vice president, Aleksandr 
Rutskoy. Malicious tongues among political opponents sometimes 
call him "unsinkable," although for the sake of accuracy this 
epithet would be more fitting for Boris Yeltsin. As far as 
Aleksandr Rutskoy is concerned, he would more likely be 
considered "fireproof." He not only was shot down twice in an 
aircraft in Afghanistan, not only returned to flying after being 
grounded due to a wound, and with a promotion, but the most 
important thing--he retains an astonishing political vitality 
despite the fact that continually drawn into the constant flow 
of political battles. What is more, according to his own 
testimony, true, he maintains friendly relations with the 
president, although he has repeated subjected Boris Yeltsin's 
policies to harsh criticism. 
  In short, considered by opponents to be among the camp of 
fanatical Russian "national-patriots" and evoking the irritation 
of professional democrats by his ties with the 
military-industrial complex, giving many the impression of a 
"dashing colonel" by his manners, Vice President Rutskoy is 
considered among politologists devoted in detail as one of the 
most mysterious figures in Russian politics. 
  Aleksandr Vladimirovich Rutskoy was born in 1947 in the city 
of Kursk. He grew up in a professional military family. His 
grandfather served in the Railroad Troops; his father was a tank 
crew member and served the entire war from the first to the last 
day and fought his way to Berlin. He was a lieutenant colonel in 
the reserve and died in early 1991 at the age of 67. The Rutskoy 
family, judging by everything, was devoted to the communist 
ideal: His father was a CPSU member for 47 years and his 
grandfather for 52 years. 
  Aleksandr Rutskoy has two brothers: Vladimir, also a pilot, 
and younger brother Mikhail who graduated from the Academy of 
the Ministry of Internal Affairs in 1991 and became a senior 
criminal investigation agent in Kursk. 
  Aleksandr Vladimirovich Rutskoy graduated with honors from 
the Barnaul Higher Military Aviation School for Pilots, the 
Military Air Academy imeni Yu.A. Gagarin, and in 1990 the 
Military Academy of the General Staff. 
  He was involved with the flying club back when he was a 
schoolboy. He worked as a metalworker at an aircraft plant. He 
was drafted in 1965 and was a rifleman-radio operator in the 
rank of sergeant. He demonstrated leadership qualities back in 
flight school. He drew well; once in a school wall newspaper he 
drew himself in general's shoulder boards. After graduating from 
military school, he served as an instructor pilot at the 
Borisoglebsk Aviation School imeni V.P. Chkalov. 
  After graduating from the Military Air Academy, he was 
assigned to the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany. In 1984, 
Rutskoy was assigned a quite honored and very promising mission 
in terms of his career: To form a regiment for new aircraft 
(young pilots just out of school, average age 22). "In one year 
I trained kids to the Class II level," Rutskoy recalled with 
pride later. For some reason, those under his care nicknamed 
their boss "Lobachevskiy." 
  He participated in combat operations in Afghanistan in 
1985-1986 and 1988. He flew 428 combat sorties. He was grounded 
for health reasons after being seriously wounded in 1986, but 
returned to Afghanistan one and a half years later in the 
position of deputy commander of air forces of the 40th Army. In 
1988 he was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. 
  Rutskoy himself had this to say about his Afghanistan 
adventures: 
  "I was sent to Afghanistan in 1985. This was the only 
regiment that did not lose a single pilot. We were the only ones 
who began to fight in the Afghan mountains. But the regiment was 
disbanded. 
  "I headed another regiment, totally untrained. We lost seven 
pilots in three months. Then I got shot down in the vicinity of 
Jawar. I had a fractured spine and was wounded in the arm. After 
I got out of the hospital, I was suspended from flying duties 
and assigned as deputy chief of the Combat Training Center in 
Lipetsk. In 1988, they proposed that I return to Afghanistan as 
deputy commander of the 40th Army air forces. 
  "In 1988, the enemy began to receive surface-to-surface 
missiles for shelling garrisons. I created a squadron of 
ground-attack aircraft, recruiting the best pilots. Then, in the 
vicinity of Khost I was shot down by F-16 fighters from the 
Pakistani Air Force, and the wind carried me over Pakistan. I 
shot back for five days and avoided pursuit. I was wounded 
again. I had a contusion and was captured. I was a prisoner for 
1.5 months and was later exchanged. I weighed 48 kg at that 
time." 
  The latest adventure of the indefatigable colonel caused a 
great echo. Only a very narrow circle of people know or at least 
assume what the military leader could do "in the vicinity of 
Khost" in a position whose duties did not call for direct 
participation in ground-attack or fighter operations. In the 
end, Rutskoy was exchanged for a Pakistani spy, after which he 
returned to the USSR. 
  The combat glory and popularity of the colonel considerably 
eased the way for him in 1990 to the RSFSR deputy mandate from 
one of the electoral districts in Kursk. In his election 
campaign, he spoke basically from strictly communist positions 
and defended the unity of the USSR, but the following passages 
could be considered most typical: 
  "The people have the Army--an integral element of the 
socialist social organism. For many generations of Soviet 
people, military service became a school for instilling 
responsibility, courage, and patriotism and taught occupying an 
active position in life. The clean air of perestroyka today is 
promoting an upsurge in duty and political activeness of people 
wearing the uniform. The reaction of the Army and Navy community 
to negative phenomena is becoming increasingly sharp, and an 
atmosphere of mutual respect, openness, businesslike criticism, 
and self-criticism is becoming more noticeably established in 
military collectives. I see this as the key to a further 
increase in combat readiness of the armed forces and in their 
prestige." 
  "In 1984, the Soviet Union represented a great power, its 
Army a mighty force that was factor of peace stability on the 
planet. Everything that occurred from then on, from 1985, under 
the name of perestroyka--this was the most genuine collapse..." 
  During the 1989 election campaign, radical democrats 
sometimes called him a "fascist." 
  Rutskoy became a member of the RSFSR Supreme Soviet, where 
he 
was chairman of the deputy group Communists for Democracy and 
also chairman of the RSFSR Supreme Soviet Committee for Affairs 
of Invalids, Veterans of War and Labor, and Social Protection of 
Servicemen and Their Family Members. 
  He was demobilized after being elected RSFSR people's 
deputy: 
"I have been detached to the Supreme Soviet." 
  Further activities of Aleksandr Rutskoy are closely linked 
to 
politics, particularly politics of the Communist Party. When the 
Old Square [Staraya Ploshchad] made the decision to create the 
Russian Communist Party, Rutskoy became one of the most active 
members of its leadership. He has been a member of its Central 
Committee since 1990. 
  True, already then his parliamentary activities evoked 
dissatisfaction of astute Kursk veterans. They accuse the 
colonel of "failing to keep a promise to the voters to support 
the CPSU" and also that he "today defends the positions of the 
Democratic Party, which contradicts his election assurances." 
  According to informed political observers, the RSFSR 
Communist Party one way or another was doomed to split due to 
the excessive contradictions that had accumulated by the fifth 
year of perestroyka in the class of party bureaucracy. No one 
predicted that the person responsible for the split would be not 
some liberal "dove" outraged by the extreme conservatism of 
First Secretary Ivan Polozkov, but one of the most brilliant 
hopes of the communist nomenklatura. 
  The new faction, which included more than 100 Russian 
communist-deputies, emerged at the most appropriate time right 
on the eve of the emergency powers which Yeltsin demanded. 
  As a result, the leader of the "democratic communists" was 
expelled from the CPSU (after 21 years of party service) "for 
actions contrary to the Rules of the CPSU and aimed at splitting 
the party and dissociation from the work of the primary party 
organization." 
  Rutskoy's wife left the CPSU one year before this, and his 
sons did not plan to join. 
  It was since then that observers closely following the 
Russian political solitaire began to get a strong opinion about 
the brilliant improvisation talent of Rutskoy the politician, 
who, essentially changing little, constantly finds himself at 
the center of interests of various forces. Many emphasize that 
there are real political structures behind the vice president: 
His People's Party of a Free Russia, 80 deputy-parliamentarians 
of patriotic factions, and also commercial structures allied 
with him, (Fund for Social Development and Revival of Russia; 
Congress of Russian Business Circles). 
  When the election campaign for president of Russia was 
launched in the spring of 1991, number one candidate Boris 
Yeltsin made an unexpected offer to Rutskoy--be nominated 
together with him as a candidate for vice president. And the 
offer was made literally on the last day set aside for this, and 
Yeltsin had not made such attempts before this. 
  It was no secret to anyone that drawing Rutskoy closer was 
the result of pragmatic calculations of an election campaign: 
The hero of Afghanistan and communist dissenter was to attract 
to the Yeltsin electorate members of the Russian Communist Party 
advocating reforms and some of the officers. At the same time, 
Yeltsin showed voters that although he is not a communist, he 
would not fight with the communists after taking office. This 
was important at that time. 
  The Yeltsin-Rutskoy tandem won the election by a large 
margin 
and on the first ballot. 
  One of the first notorious actions by Rutskoy in the new 
post 
was...a mistake. A still-inexperienced politician, but with 
military readiness for tangible actions, he got involved in a 
losing confrontation with the euphoric Chechen nationalism. 
Given the obvious illegality of the takeover by General Dudayev 
(Rutskoy said of Chechen: "This is not a revolution, this is 
banditry"), the emergency situation imposed on the territory of 
Chechen-Ingushetia, it is believed, at the vice president's 
insistence, led directly to a war which would inevitably assume 
a terrorist nature. This, naturally, was an unacceptable risk 
for the leadership of Russia. And although Rutskoy hardly 
abandoned his conviction ("A politician must be able to give it 
on the nose. Why, of course."), the afront with Chechnya, when 
President Yeltsin had to take back his decree on imposing an 
emergency situation, did quite a bit of damage to the vice 
president's political positions. According to knowledgeable 
persons, some of Rutskoy's opponents were carnivorously smiling 
at that time in the corridors of the White House! 
  It is said that Rutskoy cannot live without extreme 
situations. Maybe that is why August 1991 became a stellar time 
for him. He supervised the defense of the White House, formed 
strike detachments of Afghan veterans, and rushed to Foros 
aboard an aircraft... 
  In December 1991, Rutskoy commented favorably about creation 
of the CIS. However, judging by everything, he was quite 
skeptical about the government reforms of Yeltsin and Gaydar: 
"Another gigantic experiment which they have grown accustomed to 
conducting on Russia." His comment about young members of the 
government as "boys in pink short pants" has become well known. 
  What is more, during one of his first trips around the 
country after the start of the January reforms, he hotly 
criticized the government's course and even threatened to resign 
in Barnaul with the words: "I do not want to be the president's 
Chinese dummy," "I do not trust the boys in pink short 
pants"--i.e., Burbulis, Gaydar, and Shokhin. 
  Today, Rutskoy is outraged by what he calls anarchy instead 
of democracy: "We are now in the most petty and vulgar 
dictatorship--a dictatorship of the street and street leaders." 
  The vice president himself does not doubt his loyalty to the 
fundamental goals of the country's current leadership: He also 
favors reform, democracy, and privatization. However, he has 
again taken up a key niche in Russian politics, often stating 
that he is neither for the left nor the right. But for the 
people and for Russia ("first the fatherland, then membership in 
some or other party"), Rutskoy is able to mobilize the 
population's patriotic feelings and thus control the activeness 
of any political direction. The democrats in Boris Yeltsin's 
entourage have fought long against the committee for emergency 
situations and civil defense remaining under the vice president. 
That is probably precisely why the drawing of the vice 
president's card was the main intrigue of recent months. Judging 
from statements by the leaders of all three current oppositions 
(radical-democratic, patriotic, and communist), they tie many of 
their hopes to Rutskoy: When he spoke at the Congress of 
Civilian and Patriotic Forces of Russia in February 1992, there 
was talk in the corridors that it was the vice president who 
might become the head of some government of "national 
confidence," whose task is to reform the nation-state system and 
the economy. 
  Communist parties trying to be revived also support him. 
Their leaders state frankly that they "are with Rutskoy when he 
speaks out against liberalization of prices." What is more, as 
certain deputies and members of the Russian Federation Supreme 
Soviet claim, intensive closed consultations take place in the 
offices, apartments, and dachas of representatives of the 
top-level echelon of the military-industrial complex, the former 
CPSU, and the disbanded USSR Council of Ministers in order to 
work out a program to "pull" Russia out of the crisis situation. 
Supposedly, "representatives of Yeltsin's closest entourage, 
including Vice President Rutskoy," participate in the 
consultations. 
  However, it is most noteworthy that before calling in the 
"ministers engaged in production" into the government, President 
Boris Yeltsin needed Rutskoy very much as a person whom he 
openly called "the last legal political hope" of the 
military-industrial complex. This is especially important when, 
in the words of Academician Ryzhov, Rutskoy "as a hero and 
general can also count on the support of the Army." True, with 
representatives of the director corps coming into the government 
and an increase in the role of Arkadiy Volskiy with his Civilian 
Union, Rutskoy's influence as a semi-representative of the army 
and the military-industrial complex is decreasing. Nevertheless, 
in recent months he played an important part in the peacemaking 
process in Moldavia and South Ossetia--true, almost according to 
Lebed's recipe: First attack the corresponding republic 
leadership with statements, after which, according to historical 
experience, a declaration of war should follow; and then 
reconcile and reconcile during the course of almost intimate 
confidential consultations. But then again, such tactics have 
been successful twice... 
  Many columnists regarded as a very sympathetic step Boris 
Yeltsin's decision directing the vice president's irrepressible 
energy to advance agriculture. He was deprived of many of his 
previous powers, which Rutskoy himself talks about with 
unconcealed resentment: "When I returned from Pakistan (where he 
negotiated the exchange of Russian prisoners), I learned about 
the president's decree abolishing all my powers and 
responsibilities. All those structures which were subordinated 
to me under this decree were transferred to the jurisdiction of 
the government. The decree was signed on 19 December 1991, when 
the president was in Italy..." "I was involved in creating the 
Center for Operational Control of the Course of Reforms. I began 
setting up a tax inspectorate resembling the American system and 
dreamed about bringing order to the tax policy. I was unable to 
create a committee for protection of economic interests to 
monitor economic ties and commercial structures. I planned to 
organize state-insurance oversight. They also took away the 
committee for conversion affairs. We drew up a package of 
documents for a national guard. We were planning to reform the 
Internal Troops. That was also taken away. Yes, I still formed a 
commission for humanitarian aid and assigned a squadron of Il-76 
aircraft to it. I created a headquarters for transportation, 
shipment, and distribution. They made a mess of this, too." 
  What is more, after this quiet palace coup (which, informed 
sources believe, those same "boys in pink short pants" were 
behind), Rutskoy received several painful blows simply against 
his pride. Yeltsin moved to Old Square into the former residence 
of the Central Committee, and Rutskoy was "forgotten" on the 
fourth floor of the White House. Compiling recommendations for 
the Cabinet of Ministers, Burbulis granted the vice president 
only "the right of a consultative voice." Only after Shakhray's 
intercession was insulting wording removed. 
  Now under Article 121-7 of the Constitution, the vice 
president carries out assignments of the president. 
  In the opinion of some observers, Rutskoy today is the 
Yeltsin of 1987. Both are near the leader of a state. Both walk 
among the people and ride with them on public transportation. 
Both dislike official policy, both curse it. Then--retirement, 
adoration by the people, and...an upsurge? 
  Having instructed Rutskoy to advance agriculture, President 
Yeltsin nevertheless did not grant him specific powers. After 
waiting unsuccessfully for two months, the vice president began 
to act independently. The government created the Federal Center 
for Land and Agro-industrial Reform, undoubtedly on the vice 
president's recommendation. In addition, following the best 
traditions, he wrote a book on agrarian reform in Russia. It is 
a sizable book with a large number of tables and diagrams. 
Taking advantage of the weight of his office, Rutskoy, some 
believe, is able to pull agriculture from the present swamp 
(especially since the administrative-command mentalities are 
still quite developed here). If he does not, the skeptics 
cynically add, he "will be the first" whose political career 
"gets bogged down in a Soviet rural swamp." 
  Rutskoy's favorite pastimes are drawing and sculpture, the 
military press claims. In all the garrisons in which he has 
served, he has left a memory of himself--a canvas or a 
sculptured portrait. He keeps parrots--Fedya and Marusya--and a 
dog named Aron. He is an excellent cook. He is friends with V. 
Vinokur and Yu. Nikolayev and bosom friends with Nikita 
Mikhalkov. He drinks coffee and tomato juice. He rarely takes a 
drink--Smirnov vodka. He works long hours and sleeps four hours 
a day. 
  He was married twice. His oldest son Dmitriy is 20 years 
old, 
and his youngest Aleksandr is 18. 
<H5>  Viktor Nikolayevich Samsonov </H5>
  Someone called him the "most August" general. This nickname 
reflected, probably, the role of the chief of the Leningrad 
Garrison during the August 1991 events, when he, it seemed, one 
of the most active executors of orders of the GKChP members, did 
not lead his soldiers against the democratically oriented 
demonstrators. On 19 August, speaking over Leningrad television, 
Samsonov announced the imposition of an emergency situation in 
the city on the Neva. According to eyewitnesses, he was not to 
self-controlled at operational meetings of leaders of the State 
Administration of Internal Affairs, the Administration of the 
Committee for State Security, and military command authorities, 
and constantly demanded that force be used against the 
demonstrators who were protecting Mariinskiy Palace. It is known 
that from 19 to 21 August, Samsonov issued orders which demanded 
that his subordinate units not permit people's deputies on their 
territory. Nevertheless, the mayor of St. Petersburg, Anatoliy 
Sobchak, called the colonel-general one of the heroes of the 
putsch days. Maybe it was because the troops did not go beyond 
Gatchina, nearly mirroring the episode of 1917 when the White 
forces trying to restore lawful power were dispersed by the 
Bolsheviks and also stopped at Gatchina... 
  Former first deputy minister of defense of the USSR 
Colonel-General Viktor Nikolayevich Samsonov was born on 10 
November 1941 at the Dukhovnitskiy Sovkhoz, Dukhovnitskiy Rayon, 
Saratov Oblast. He graduated from the Far Eastern Higher 
Combined-Arms Command School in 1964 and began serving in the 
troops as commander of a maritime infantry platoon of the 
Pacific Fleet. He soon became a company commander in this same 
regiment. 
  In 1972, after graduating from the Military Academy imeni 
M.V. Frunze, he was appointed chief of staff of a motorize rifle 
regiment. Then he was commander of a motorized rifle regiment 
and chief of staff of a tank division. In 1981, he graduated 
from the Military Academy of the General Staff and was appointed 
commander of a motorized rifle division in the Transcaucasus 
Military District. 
  Subsequently, he was chief of staff of an army, commander of 
an army, and chief of staff of the Transcaucasus Military 
District. 
  In 1990, he was appointed commander of the Leningrad 
Military 
District. Here he played the most unequivocal role during the 
August putsch... 
  It is curious that the Samsonov's appointment as commander 
evoked a serious negative reaction among many deputies of the 
St. Petersburg City Soviet at that time. Thus, the council of 
the "On the LNF Platform" demanded that an emergency session of 
the Presidium of the Soviet be convened, linking the appointment 
of Samsonov to the "sharp intensification of activities by 
reactionary forces in St. Petersburg and Russia." 
  But the general rehabilitated himself by his actions during 
the coup attempt. Or they helped rehabilitate him, correctly 
understanding the correlation of forces--but this was also quite 
a bit for a person who might not have refused to carry out the 
order. As a result, he joined the leadership of the post-putsch 
armed forces as one of the most trusted generals. On 7 December, 
by order of M. Gorbachev, Samsonov was appointed chief of the 
General Staff of the USSR Armed Forces, unexpectedly replacing 
Lobov. From there he moved smoothly to the CIS Combined Armed 
Forces. 
  In general, this appointment evoked numerous objections, 
primarily by its illogical nature: It is believed that Samsonov 
knows little on the scale of all the armed forces (he never 
worked in the General Staff). His assistants also been in their 
position only two months by that time. There was even a version 
that all this was nothing more than a purely political action: 
The Belovezhskoye Agreement was signed one day after the hasty 
appointment of the new chief of the General Staff, which put an 
end to the USSR. 
  It is known that Samsonov is an advocate of a professional 
army, development of a system of measures for protection of 
servicemen, and also conduct of military reform. 
  He is married and has two children. 
<H5>  Vladimir Magomedovich Semenov </H5>
  Colonel-General Vladimir Magomedovich Semenov, commander in 
chief of the Ground Forces of Russia, was born on 8 June 1940 in 
the village of Khurzuk, Karachayevo-Cherkess Autonomous Oblast, 
Stavropol Kray. He is Ossetian by nationality. 
  He graduated from the Baku Higher Combined-Arms Command 
School in 1962. He began his service in the troops as commander 
of a motorized rifle platoon. He then was commander of a 
company. He graduated from the Military Academy imeni M.V. 
Frunze in 1970 and was appointed commander of a motorized rifle 
battalion and then chief of staff of a regiment. He was 
commander of a regiment in 1973 and chief of staff and deputy 
commander of a division in 1975. He graduated from the Military 
Academy of the General Staff of the USSR Armed Forces with 
honors in 1979. He was a commander of a division in 1979 and 
commander of an army corps in 1982. He was commander of an army 
in 1984. 
  He was first deputy commander in 1986 and commander of the 
Transbaykal Military District in 1988. On 31 August 1991, he was 
appointed deputy minister of defense of the USSR and commander 
in chief of the Ground Forces, replacing General of the Army 
V.I. Varennikov in that post. He holds a similar post in the CIS 
Combined Armed Forces. 
<H5>  Nikolay Sergeyevich Stolyarov </H5>
  In 1991, Major-General of Aviation Nikolay Stolyarov was 
appointed by USSR President Mikhail Gorbachev as assistant 
minister of defense of the USSR and chairman of the Committee 
for Work with Personnel. Actually, as informed military analysts 
believe, Marshal Shaposhnikov, then minister of defense, was 
behind Stolyarov's appointment as top "political officer" of the 
armed forces. In addition, Stolyarov is called a friend of 
Rutskoy from his flying days in the past, which also played and 
plays a pretty important role in his destiny. 
  At that time the chief of the analog of the former Main 
Political Directorate expressed his credo as such: "...I dream 
of creating a team of real professionals. Intelligent people not 
stamped by dogmas. And it would be wrong to close the search in 
a notorious circle. My principle, perhaps, is to praise a person 
for his merits and not for the lack of shortcomings." 
  Many believe that Stolyarov was able to achieve his goal: On 
a committee of 144 people, he gathered together 2 doctors of 
sciences, 25 candidates of sciences, and 6 distinguished workers 
in culture. 
  N.S. Stolyarov was born in 1947 in the village of 
Aleksandrovka, Gomel Oblast, to a working-class family. He began 
working at age 16. He graduated from the Yeysk Higher Military 
Aviation School for Pilots in 1969. He has served in Air Force 
units in command and staff positions. 
  He graduated from the Military Air Academy imeni Yu.A. 
Gagarin in 1977 and completed its post-graduate studies in 1980. 
He taught historical materialism from 1980 to 1990. He is a 
docent and candidate of philosophical sciences. 
  He has written in-depth, in the opinion of experts, research 
on M. Bakunin and other scientific works. 
  Nikolay Stolyarov has been active in political 
activities--and on the communist flank. At the 28th CPSU 
Congress, he was nominated for the post of general secretary of 
the CPSU Central Committee as one of the alternatives to M. 
Gorbachev. In September 1990, he was elected chairman of the 
Central Control Commission of the Communist Party of the RSFSR. 
In this position he was directly linked to such events as the 
expulsion of Aleksandr Rutskoy and his supporters from the 
Communist Party of the RSFSR. 
  However, he held a quite moderate stand and was known in 
democratic and also journalistic circles for his sober-minded 
thinking and liberal views. He was clearly not on track with the 
Communist Party of the RSFSR, and his break with the party 
leadership, increasingly taking the bit in its teeth, soon 
became obvious. 
  During the events in August, as it is asserted, he arrived 
at 
the White House and stood in ranks with its defenders. True, he 
said that he "was not running with an assault rifle..." But on 
the other hand, "I prepared draft documents with which the 
government of Russia appealed to the people and servicemen over 
government communications channels, and he negotiated with the 
organizers of the putsch... Sometime after our conversation, 
Yanayev himself searched for me and even tried to seek advice 
about what statement to give and how to explain himself to the 
people." 
  He flew to Foros together with Aleksandr Rutskoy: "I 
arrested 
Yazov, the former minister, with trembling hands." 
  On 29 August 1991, Nikolay Stolyarov was appointed deputy 
chairman of the USSR KGB, it is believed, at the recommendation 
of A. Rutskoy. His stay in this position remained not very 
visible. Here he dealt with questions of educational and 
personnel work. 
  Democratic figures call attention to the evolution of 
General 
Stolyarov's statements during the months following the putsch: 
From concern about democracy and its protection to fairly harsh 
statements about the need for order and strengthening the role 
of the state, including in the foreign arena. 
  In November 1991, Deputy Chairman of the USSR KGB N. 
Stolyarov said: "We are very concerned that Russia with its 
still-weak democracy does not have a strong system of law and 
order and military support of democratic gains and opportunities 
for reform. It seems to me that the path of a transition to a 
Russia of ready-made structures of the USSR KBG, including its 
central apparatus, may be quite productive. The same goes for 
the Army. ...The question is to preserve Russia as a unified 
state. No one can deny that Russia has up to the last moment 
observed the rules of gentlemanly relations with other 
republics. And they acquired independence not without the 
arbitration role of Russia. We must not give the leaders of the 
new states any more reason to thing that Russia's gentlemanship 
was dictated by its weakness. Today, it is necessary to have the 
instruments for confirming its quite sufficient strength--the 
Army, organs of security, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs." 
  January 1992: "...I state with full responsibility: We 
intend 
to the least extent to intrude into political processes, to 
dictate terms to whomever. In our totally unbalanced society, 
only a madman would try to do that. But in today's complex 
situation, we in the military do not want to be people who are 
indifferent to events which concern us above all." 
  February 1992: "The Army always was a `behind-the-scene' 
force in political processes. Now, true, everything is moving to 
the point where it may be forced to become an independent 
political force. However, whether or not it will be one will 
depend on the politicians... There are conditions under which 
the Army will be silent in political disputes--and both the 
presidents and the governments known them. Behind these 
conditions is the choice of the path over which the development 
of events will proceed... I think that the Army with its 
uneasiness, and a dangerous uneasiness, most of all serves for 
unity of the civilian society, its overcoming the syndrome of 
political aggressiveness, since the Army must not be brought to 
the point where the cannons begin to do the talking... 
  "...How zealously they are trying to prove to us that the 
breakup of the Soviet Union is an historical inevitability, that 
in its place there is only historical reality--the CIS! However, 
in society an understanding is increasingly maturing, which in 
the Army existed invariably, that the breakup of our waning, 
super-centralized, complex, but historical state is an 
anti-historical process..." 
  On 1 October 1992, Stolyarov was appointed chairman of the 
Council for Social Support of Servicemen of the Supreme Soviet 
of the Russian Federation. 
  He is married and has two children. His son is a cadet at a 
flight school for navigators, and his daughter is a student at 
the Moscow State University imeni M.V. Lomonosov. 
<H5>  Boris Vasilyevich Tarasov </H5>
  The constituent congress of the "Otchizna" movement was held 
in Moscow on 22 February 1992. General Boris Tarasov became its 
founding father. 
  In his opinion, "the movement will draw in positive people, 
people of labor who still do not consider their life to have 
been lived in vain." In his words, "the movement is against 
totalitarianism, but in favor of establishing a strong power 
based on national traditions." "We must light the torch of 
salvation for the people," said Tarasov at the conclusion of his 
speech at the congress. 
  Boris Vasilyevich Tarasov--a lieutenant-general, until 
recently a member of the Military Council, and chief of the 
Political Directorate of the Volga-Ural Military District--is 
from the ancestral lands of another well-known pro-communist 
figure, Albert Makashov, a former commander of the military 
district. 
  Tarasov was born in 1932. He graduated from the Military 
Political Academy imeni V.I. Lenin. 
  He is one of the coordinators of the parliamentary faction 
of 
Otchizna (the other coordinator is Major-General Bazarov, also 
an organizer of the movement and a confederate of the "mutinous 
retired officers"). 
  For the time being, it is difficult to determine whose 
influence is stronger in the movement, Tarasov's or Makashov's. 
However, the former colleagues, and now speaking under the same 
flag, try not to sit at the same table and support one another 
from a distance. It is difficult to say if this is a military 
tactic in the struggle for the leadership post or the spirit of 
competition. For now, General Tarasov is scoring points through 
frequent speeches, and admirers of Albert Makashov are calling 
on him to become active. 
  Recently, the parliamentary faction Otchizna has become 
noticeably more active. This is evident by the trip to 
Sevastopol, during which the retired general-deputies met with 
sailors of the Black Sea Fleet, advocating a "unified and 
indivisible" Russia. 
  In talking about Russia's borders, Tarasov constantly 
emphasizes its old borders, accusing the republic's current 
leadership of giving back all of Russia's gains in the past 
several centuries ("above all, this concerns the Russo-Turkish 
and Russo-Livon wars"). It is because of these speeches that 
Boris Tarasov enjoys success among national-patriots and 
supporters of the former union. Although today he says that 
extremism is unacceptable to him, in his words, this is 
explained primarily by the fact that the number of supporters of 
the Otchizna movement is not yet very great. But the general is 
confident that the future belongs to it. 
  In addition to Tarasov, the Coordination Council of the 
movement includes Albert Makashov and Viktor Anpilov. Otchizna's 
representation in the Russian parliament is still not 
great--eight people's deputies. According to various estimates, 
total membership in the movement is no more than 1,500. 
<H5>  Vladimir Mikhaylovich Toporov </H5>
  Colonel-General Vladimir Toporov, deputy minister of defense 
of the Russian Federation, was born on 7 February 1946 in the 
city of Baranovichi (Belorussia). He graduated from the Odessa 
Artillery School in 1968. He began service in the troops as a 
platoon commander of an antitank battery; he then commanded a 
battery in an airborne regiment. 
  In 1975, after graduating from the Military Academy imeni 
M.V. Frunze, he was appointed deputy commander of a regiment. He 
became regiment commander in 1977. In 1979, he was deputy 
commander of a division. 
  He graduated from the Military Academy of the General Staff 
in 1984 and was given command of a division. In 1987, he was 
appointed first deputy commander and in 1988 commander of an 
army. In 1989, he was chief of staff and first deputy commander 
of the Far East Military District, the same one which was once 
commanded by Dmitriy Yazov, which some observers are inclined to 
see as Toporov belonging to the Yazov "team." 
  In 1992, he was commander of the Moscow Military District. 
He 
was appointed deputy minister of defense of the Russian 
Federation by decree of the president of the Russian Federation 
dated 10 June 1992. 
<H5>  Vitaliy Georgiyevich Urazhtsev </H5>
  Lieutenant Colonel Vitaliy Urazhtsev is probably one of the 
most "scandal-ridden" figures on the Russian military-political 
scene. He is not the only one, but also his comrades in arms in 
the Union of Social Protection of Servicemen (Shchit) which he 
heads, supporters from other organizations, and simply fellow 
travelers who are united with Shchit by some need... There is an 
incident known with Major Moskovchenko, who gave a slap in the 
face to the Moscow Military Commandant Major-General Smirnov. 
Observers are reminded of the scandals at the congress of 
parents of servicemen who have died, when supporters of the 
right-protection union Shchit and the republic movement 
Soldiers' Mothers of Russia were literally thrown out of the 
hall. They also tried to remove Urazhtsev himself--from the 
All-Army Officers' Assembly, which the co-chairman of Shchit 
called "premature" and not possessing a "legal basis for 
discussing the problems of the Army and Navy." This was not seen 
by informed observers as a surprise--they had long known about 
the true hatred which the regular Army chiefs organizing that 
meeting harbored for Vitaliy Urazhtsev. 
  At the same time, the person possessing such a striking, 
scandalous notoriety was characterized (although it is difficult 
to confirm or refute this officially) by his comrades in the 
reserves as a regular industrious officer, only with an 
uncontrollable passion for fairness. That is probably why since 
childhood he was listed among the activists--back in school he 
was council chairman of a Pioneer detachment and then secretary 
of a Komsomol organization. 
  He was born in 1944 in the working-class settlement of 
Krasnaya Rechka, Khabarovsk Kray. His father was an officer in 
the Soviet Army. 
  After graduating from school, he enrolled in a theatrical 
studio and then in the Ryazan Higher Airborne Command School. He 
graduated from the journalism faculty of the Moscow State 
University and the Military Political Academy imeni V.I. Lenin. 
  In 1973, he was assigned to the Department of Komsomol Work 
of the Main Political Directorate. 
  In 1979, at the age of 35, he was assigned to the position 
of 
deputy chief of the political department of a tank division 
stationed on the territory of Poland. 
  He ended his Army career as an instructor at the prestigious 
Higher Combined-Arms Command School imeni Supreme Soviet of the 
RSFSR. 
  He was a member of the CPSU since 1964. In 1990, he was 
expelled "for demagogic statements directed at the armed forces." 
  In 1989, when the Shchit movement was created to protect 
servicemen, he was its chairman and then one of its co-chairmen. 
  Established on 29 March 1989, the Union of Social Protection 
of Servicemen, Reservists, and Members of Their Families 
(Shchit) in its best time had a membership of over 40,000 
people. This organization advocated creating a professional army 
and opposed using the armed forces in conflicts between 
nationalities. Associates of Shchit made independent 
examinations for investigation of acts of "dedovshchina" [hazing 
of new conscripts], outrages, and lawlessness in the Army 
environment and helped the Soldiers' Mothers Movement. 
  In 1990, he was elected people's deputy of the RSFSR. He is 
a 
member of the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet Committee for 
International Affairs and Foreign Economic Ties. 
  Immediately after the August putsch, his stars seemed to 
catch fire: He became chairman of the Fund for Formation of a 
National Guard of Russia. True, soon representatives of the 
president's team hastened to dissociate themselves from this 
organization, and the idea of creating a National Guard of 
Russia was up in the air, making Urazhtsev almost an impostor. 
This also became, it seems, that symbolic line behind which the 
popularity of the Shchit leader began to fall and, conversely, 
the diverse complaints against him began to increase... 
  In March 1992, his powers as co-chairman were suspended. At 
the Third Congress of the Union in April 1992, he was not 
elected to leadership bodies--and this also turned out to be the 
result of the same scandals that resulted in former comrades in 
arms of the lieutenant colonel closed the doors of his 
organization before him with wording like "he did not handle it" 
or "he did not live up to it." 
  But Urazhtsev did not become flustered and in the fall of 
that same year, with the help of strong young people from the 
"Vityaz" Center of Protection, organized another Third Congress 
of his own. Four advisers of ministers of defense and industry 
of the Russian Federation attended the congress as delegates. 
The congress approved the "course toward coming together with 
new democratic bodies of power of all levels." Only one of the 
greetings to the congress was read--from Alan Chumak. Instead of 
those who were invited but did not show up--Yeltsin, Gaydar, and 
Khasbulatov, a well-known satirist spoke--Aleksandr Ivanov, 
today a member of the Political Council of the Party of Economic 
Freedom. 
  Urazhtsev is married and has two sons, ages 19 and 6. 
<H5>  Vladimir Nikolayevich Chernavin </H5>
  Vladimir Nikolayevich Chernavin was born on 22 April 1928 in 
what is today the Ukrainian city of Nikolayev into a Russian 
family. 
  Due to his young age, he did not end up in the war, but it 
had a serious influence on his choice of his own destiny: He 
graduated from the Baku Naval Preparatory School. Then in 1951, 
he graduated from the Leningrad Higher Naval School. He joined 
the CPSU in 1949 while in school. 
  Chernavin graduated from the Naval Academy in 1965 and 
almost 
immediately entered the Military Academy of the General Staff, 
graduating from it in 1969. 
  He began his officer service as a torpedo officer on a 
submarine. He received his first independent position in 1956, 
becoming commander of a submarine. He was on ships until 1974, 
when he became chief of staff of the Northern Fleet. Then he 
became first deputy commander and in 1977 commander of the 
Northern Fleet. 
  His advancement in the service was very quick: in 1981, he 
was chief of the Main Staff of the Navy and first deputy 
commander in chief of the Navy. In 1983, he was promoted to the 
rank of admiral of the fleet. In 1985, Chernavin reached the 
high point in his military career and became commander in chief 
of the USSR Navy and deputy minister of defense. 
  According to Soviet state tradition, high positions in the 
party and representative bodies must correspond to high 
positions in employment. In 1981, he was a candidate member of 
the CPSU Central Committee; in 1986, with the "Gorbachev draft" 
he was a member of the CPSU Central Committee, which he remained 
until the very dissolution of the party. At the same time, he 
was a deputy of the USSR Supreme Soviet, 10th and 11th 
convocations. In full accordance with the same tradition, in 
March 1989 he was nominated (and then elected) as a people's 
deputy of the USSR from the "land" city of Lenkoran (Azerbaijan). 
  According to some comments, Admiral Chernavin is respected 
in 
the Navy. Not only high, according to professionals, duty 
qualities but also purely human qualities play a significant 
role here: The admiral did not equivocate when the newest 
nuclear-powered submarine Komsomolets went down in the Norwegian 
Sea together with most of its crew, but he stoically assumed the 
brunt of the blow, explaining the causes of the accident. 
  After the breakup of the USSR, Admiral of the Fleet 
Chernavin 
ended up in an ambiguous role: The USSR Navy was to cease to 
exist together with the state, but there was nowhere for the 
ships and sailors to go. The heads of the state of the CIS 
immediately declared the Navy to be common property, and 
Chernavin officially became commander in chief of the CIS Navy 
in 1991. 
  The admiral is the holder of two orders of Lenin, an Order 
of 
the October Revolution, and an Order of the Red Banner. In 1988, 
in connection with the 60th anniversary, he was awarded the 
Order of the Red Star. On 18 February 1991, by decree of Mikhail 
Gorbachev, he was conferred the title of Hero of the Soviet 
Union. 
  It is fairly difficult to talk about Vladimir Chernavin's 
political views. In the opinion of observers, he has avoided 
high-sounding statements, although in his speeches he stayed in 
the general semantic background of the speeches of top military 
leaders--with "protection of sacred boundaries," "socialist 
achievements," and so forth. He was not a dissident, but he did 
not thirst for the ideology of developed socialism. A curious 
episode occurred on 18 March 1992: The so-called "underground" 
Congress of People's Deputies of the USSR under the leadership 
of S. Umalatovaya, V. Alksnis, and others nominated Chernavin 
for the post of president of the USSR. Chernavin immediately 
stated that he had nothing to do with this congress and that no 
one had came to him with such a proposal. However, informed 
observers do not believe that this sort of "nomination" could 
have occurred in a blank space and do not rule out more or less 
innocent contacts between the admiral and "restorers" of the 
USSR. On their part, the commander in chief's obvious 
displeasure with the results of the collapse of the Union, 
especially the consequences of this for the Navy, could have 
prompted them to take such actions. 
  In September 1991, he stated that under no circumstances 
would the Baltic Fleet cease to exist, although the independence 
of the Baltic states would have a significant effect on its 
combat effectiveness. When tension arose between Ukraine and 
Russia regarding Ukraine's claims on the Black Sea Fleet, the 
admiral firmly stood on the side of the Russian leadership and 
supported the commander in chief of the Black Sea Fleet, Admiral 
Kasatonov, in his almost emphatic refusal even to discuss these 
questions. He official stated that "Ukraine's decision to take 
the Black Sea Fleet under its jurisdiction does not correspond 
to the Minsk Accords," and in April 1992 he even visited the 
17th Brigade in Sevastopol which had pledged allegiance to 
Ukraine and called upon the seamen to maintain their loyalty to 
the CIS. 
  Recently, there have been rumors that Admiral Chernavin will 
soon retire--especially after the appointment of Admiral Feliks 
Gromov commander of Russia's Navy. Again, they cite as one of 
the reasons the suspicion that the admiral still does not quite 
acknowledge the new realities. On the other hand, Chernavin 
remains commander of the CIS Navy, and no one here knows about 
the alleged decision to retire. 
<H5>  Yevgeniy Ivanovich Shaposhnikov </H5>
  He became the fourteenth and last minister of defense of the 
USSR, closing the chain of post-revolution leaders of the Soviet 
military department, among whom were Trotskiy, Voroshilov, 
Zhukov, and Ustinov. Dmitriy Yazov was the thirteenth, making up 
for his decisiveness and his bad luck in Matrosskaya Tishina 
[Sailor's Silence]. 
  Yevgeniy Ivanovich Shaposhnikov was born on 3 February 1942 
on the Bolshoy Log farmstead, Aksayskiy Rayon, Rostov Oblast, to 
a working-class family. There were four children in the family. 
His father died at the front shortly before the war ended. 
  Shaposhnikov graduated from the Kharkov Higher Military 
Aviation School in 1963. He became a CPSU member that same year. 
He served as a pilot, holding the following military positions: 
pilot, senior pilot, flight commander, deputy squadron 
commander, squadron commander... 
  In 1971, he became deputy commander and then commander of an 
air regiment. Already four years later he was deputy commander 
of a division and soon commander of a fighter division. Another 
four years later he was deputy commander of the air forces of 
the Carpathian Military District. In 1984, he was transferred to 
the same position in the Odessa Military District, where he soon 
became commander of the district air forces. In 1987, he went to 
the GDR for one year as commander of the air forces of the Group 
of Soviet Forces in Germany. 
  In 1988, he was appointed first deputy commander in chief of 
the Air Force. 
  In 1990, Shaposhnikov was commander in chief of the Air 
Force. He graduated from two academies--the Military Air Academy 
imeni Yu.A. Gagarin (in 1969) and the General Staff Academy (in 
1984). 
  He was elected a member of the Central Committee at the 28th 
CPSU Congress. 
  On 23 August 1991, Shaposhnikov, as the press attested, 
immediately stating that aviation would not help the putsch 
organizers, became USSR minister of defense. He was not in the 
position long--only until the breakup of the USSR, after which 
he was appointed commander in chief of the Combined Armed Forces 
of the CIS. According to reports of the Russian Committee for 
Defense, he turned out to be one of the few, if not the only, 
deputy minister of defense who was not tarnished by cooperation 
with the GKChP. In a certain sense, he also assisted the Crimean 
actions of Rutskoy to free the USSR president. 
  Shaposhnikov suited the democrats. In the words of General 
A. 
Tsalko (by the way, a former pilot), former deputy chairman of 
the Russian Committee for Defense Questions, Shaposhnikov is a 
"normal guy" and a "bright spot" among military men. Democrats 
are impressed, in particular, by the fact that the minister 
knows how to wear a civilian suit and an imported tie, and his 
smile is a pleasant contrast to the constantly sullen Dmitriy 
Yazov with an unhealthy face. But, of course, democrats cited 
among his credits the removal of the party from the Army and 
requests for decisive military reforms. 
  However, it was reforms that became the weak point in the 
general's positive image. "There simply are none," asserted 
Vladimir Lopatin, well-known deputy chairman of Russia's State 
Committee for Defense Questions. 
  The new minister of defense did not evoke any tearing away 
reaction among the military--he is an experienced professional, 
a servant. 
  Judging from statements in the press, Shaposhnikov does not 
demonstrate a longing for political statements, limiting himself 
to discussion of purely economic matters and social needs of 
servicemen. According to some comments, military people 
appreciate his efforts on housing construction: He promised to 
ease the apartment problem for officers in two or three years. 
Among his personal accomplishments, one can cite the fact that 
80 percent of the funds allocated to the Air Force for capital 
construction went to housing construction. He developed the 
"Zabota" [Concern] program of social assistance for servicemen. 
The marshal personally approved lists for receipt of apartments 
by subordinates. Under him, Military Transport Aviation began to 
engage in commercial transportation. True, some suspect that all 
is not so simple: malicious tongues maintain that this is done 
to legitimize free transportation of generals, their families, 
and their household goods. Shaposhnikov stated the following to 
the USSR Supreme Soviet Commission on Questions of Benefits and 
Privileges: "To prohibit something to someone was... somehow not 
very ethical." He himself did not go by any lists of privileges. 
For example, he did not have either his own or an official 
dacha. But columnists have written in this regard about an 
entire system of specific ethical "coordinates." Shaposhnikov 
confirms this opinion: "We are all children of lawlessness." 
  When he was still commander in chief of the Air Force, 
Shaposhnikov gave the impression of being a keen administrator 
and analyst of trends in development of aviation. He rather 
professionally analyzed the course of the recent Persian Gulf 
War, especially its military air aspect, although he did not 
avoid the temptation to accuse the Americans of "increasing the 
number of casualties" among the peaceful population. However, 
one must make mention that this could be the professional 
jealousy over the defeat of an army armed by the same weapons as 
his own army--especially when many pilots are complaining about 
the loss of skills due to few flying hours. 
  Shaposhnikov himself has 3000 hours of flying time and has 
mastered aircraft from the MiG-15 to the MiG-23. Even today he 
is considered fit for unrestricted flying duty. "Of course, I am 
stern," the marshal himself asserts. "I have always been very 
serious about work." And maybe that is why his career was so 
brilliant: At age 34 he was "assigned" to the position of 
division commander, and at age 37 he was a general... One of his 
colleagues in the GDR comments on Shaposhnikov's rapid rise this 
way: "He had no relatives, no fixers. He did it himself. To put 
it simply, he is a good pilot, from God." 
  Apparently another important thing is that among fliers, 
where many, speaking cautiously, do not demonstrate the miracles 
of abstention from alcohol, Shaposhnikov stood out for his 
restraint in this matter. They recall how he even organized 
"anti-alcohol courses" in one of the regiments in which he 
served. 
  On the whole, Marshal Shaposhnikov, apparently, could and 
did 
turn out to be just the long-awaited, unpoliticized professional 
in the post of minister of defense. 
  At the same time, the pro-communist so-called Standing 
Presidium of the Congress of People's Deputies of the USSR, 
chaired by S. Umalatovaya, in June 1992 decided: "For the 
collapse of the USSR Armed Forces, cowardice, and betrayal of 
the interests of the Union and its peoples, for ignoring the 
decisions of the All-Army Officer's Assembly... to relieve 
Shaposhnikov from the position of minister of defense of the 
USSR, deprive him of all military rank awarded to him by the 
supreme bodies of power of the USSR, and reduce him to the 
ranks." 
  With the breakup of the USSR, the inevitable breakup of its 
armed forces also began. The new states began snatching up 
armies and divisions like hotcakes, laying claim to their part 
of the Soviet legacy. The sphere of Marshal Shaposhnikov's 
command was also reduced with this process--especially after the 
decision to create the Russian Army based on CIS units. By 
August 1992, one year after his stellar hour, the press and 
politicians had almost forgotten about him. He remained 
commander in chief without an army... 
  But informed observers do not rule out the fact that 
considering the differences between Russia and other countries 
of the commonwealth, it is possible that Shaposhnikov may still 
become one of the key figures in the power struggle in the CIS 
Combined Armed Forces. They recall the words of Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk at a meeting of the leadership of 
Ukraine and command personnel of military units and subunits 
stationed in the republic on 11 January 1992: "I do not like the 
position of a person who says one thing today, something else 
tomorrow, and whatever he likes on Monday, depending on what 
side of the bed he got up on. Today I deeply regret the 
appointment of Marshal Shaposhnikov. But I do not have the 
opportunity to correct the mistake". (The officers and generals 
present welcomed these words with prolonged applause). 
  The marshal is married and has three children. 
<H5>  Dmitriy Timofeyevich Yazov </H5>
  He was born on 8 November 1923 in the village of Yazovo, 
Okoneshnikovskiy Rayon, Omsk Oblast. There were 11 children in 
the family. He graduated from the Moscow Infantry School imeni 
Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR in 1942, the Military Academy imeni 
M.V. Frunze in 1956, and the Military Academy of the General 
Staff in 1967. 
  He has been in the Soviet Army since 1941. He was a 
participant in the Great Patriotic War and was a platoon 
commander and deputy company commander in the Volkhov and 
Leningrad fronts. He was wounded twice and contused. He has 
written poetry since his military time, mainly lyrics. But they 
have never been published anywhere. 
  During the postwar period he was a commander of a company, 
battalion, and regiment and held various staff positions. After 
graduating from the Military Academy of the General Staff, he 
commanded a division, army corps, and army and held posts of 
first deputy commander of the Far East Military District and 
commander of the Central Group of Forces. He commanded the 
Central Asian Military District from 1980 and the Far East 
Military District from 1984. From 1987 he was chief of the Main 
Directorate of Personnel and deputy minister of defense of the 
USSR. He was minister of defense of the USSR from May 1987. 
  Everywhere he has served he has usually left for work at 
0600 
hours. 
  According to People's Deputy of Russia Urazhtsev: "Quite a 
few strong candidates sought the post of minister of defense, 
but it was Yazov who was selected... Dmitriy Timofeyevich has 
ties with Gorbachev back from working in Stavropol... Yazov at 
that time was commander of a motorized rifle corps and was part 
of the CPSU kray committee party bureau. He never `stuck out' 
and voted the way Mikhail Sergeyevich [Gorbachev] needed him to. 
Their families were friends. Mikhail Sergeyevich felt that 
Sokolov was the `wrong' man. Sokolov was being promoted by the 
previous party apparatus, with whom Gorbachev got into a 
skirmish. And Mathias Rust's landing on Red Square provided an 
opportunity to replace Sokolov with his good friend." 
  Yazov always adhered to a `harsh' policy. 
  Thus, back in December 1990, he made a joint statement with 
the leadership of the KGB and Ministry of Internal Affairs, 
which stated that in the event of attacks on military camps, 
guards would use weapons "without firing warning shots," and the 
Army in all the republics will keep garrisons "where it is 
considered necessary." 
  After meeting with Gorbachev at that time, he demanded that 
he put an end to the emerging nationalism and extremism. 
  He always believed that the Army should interfere in 
politics. Therefore, on 17 June 1991, together with Minister of 
Internal Affairs Boris Pugo and KGB Chairman Vladimir Kryuchkov, 
at a closed portion of a meeting of the USSR Supreme Soviet he 
stated the need to impose an emergency situation in order to 
stop the collapse of the country. 
  Not receiving the consent of the Supreme Soviet, on 18 
August 
he joined the GKChP. 
  On 21 August, after the return of the members of the GKChP 
from Foros from M.S. Gorbachev, he was arrested and sent 
initially to a special facility and then to the Matrosskaya 
Tishina prison. 
  However, even the "democrats" noted how "strange" Yazov 
looked among the putsch organizers. Thus, Aleksandr Yakovlev 
said: "I was surprised and insulted at the same time by the fact 
that Yazov was there." Academician Stanislav Shatalin, who was 
on the President's Council together with Dmitriy Timofeyevich 
[Yazov] and the KGB chairman, exclaimed: "Well, Kryuchkov is a 
Judas, everyone has known that for a long time, but how did the 
old man [Yazov] get into this clique?" 
  Yazov himself admits to betraying the president, but not the 
country or the motherland. One year later, by decision of Ye.K. 
Lisov, head of the investigative group, the charges of "high 
treason" were dropped. 
  He was a member of the CPSU from 1944, a candidate member of 
the CPSU Central Committee from 1981, and a member of the CPSU 
Central Committee from 1987. In June 1987, he was elected 
candidate member of the CPSU Central Committee Politburo and was 
a member of the CPSU Central Committee Politburo. 
  He is married to Emma Yevgenyevna. The romantic story of 
their acquaintance began in December 1959: They met on a train 
from Alma-Ata to Moscow listening to the train radio. They both 
had their own families at that time. The talked and parted. 
Sixteen years later, Dmitriy Timofeyevich searched for Emma 
Yevgenyevna. By that time both were unmarried. They have been 
together ever since. Both are "terrible theatergoers." The "plat 
du jour" at home is Siberian meat dumplings. 
  When Yazov was arrested, Emma Yevgenyevna was left alone, 
ill 
(she was in recovery for 56 days after an automobile accident on 
19 May 1991), without an apartment, and without a pension. Their 
property was inventoried at several thousand rubles. 
<H5>  Sergey Fedorovich Akhromeyev (Deceased) </H5>
  He was born on 5 May 1923 in the village of Vindrey, 
Torbeyevskiy Rayon, Mordovian ASSR, to a peasant family. He was 
left without a father at the age of 6 years, the victim of 
dispossession of the kulaks. He grew up on the streets of 
Moscow, leading a half-starved existence. 
  He joined the Army in 1940. He completed one course at the 
Higher Naval School imeni M.V. Frunze in 1941. He graduated from 
the Astrakhan Infantry School in 1942, the Higher Officers' 
School of Self-Propelled Artillery of the Armored and Mechanized 
Troops of the Red Army in 1945, and the Military Academy of the 
General Staff in 1967. During the Great Patriotic War, he 
participated in the fighting for Leningrad in July-December 1941 
as part of the combined rifle battalion of cadets. He was 
contused, wounded, and frostbitten several times. It was only 
thanks to the obstinacy of an old physician that they he did not 
amputate his leg. 
  He then studied at a military school and after graduation, 
from October 1942 to February 1943, he commanded a rifle platoon 
and then was adjutant in a rifle battalion, assistant chief of 
staff of a regiment, and adjutant of a tank brigade motorized 
rifle battalion. From July 1944 he commanded an assault rifle 
battalion from a self-propelled artillery brigade. During the 
war he participated in combat operations in the Leningrad, 
Stalingrad, Southern, and Fourth Ukrainian fronts. 
  After the war ended, from June 1945 he was deputy commander 
and then commander of a tank battalion. 
  From July 1953 to August 1955 he was commander of a tank 
regiment. 
  From December 1957 he was deputy commander of a motorized 
rifle division. From December 1960 he was commander of a tank 
division in the Belorusssian Military District. From April 1964 
he was commander of a training tank division. 
  After graduating from the Military Academy of the General 
Staff, he was chief of staff, first deputy commander of the Far 
East Military District. He was chief of a directorate and deputy 
chief of staff of the General Staff 1974-1979. From February 
1979 he was first deputy chief of the General Staff. In 1983, he 
was conferred the rank of Marshal of the Soviet Union and on 7 
May 1983 the title Hero of the Soviet Union. From September 1984 
to December 1988 he was chief of the General Staff, first deputy 
minister of defense of the USSR. Then he was transferred to the 
group of general inspectors and adviser to M.S. Gorbachev as 
chairman of the USSR Supreme Soviet and then as president of the 
USSR. 
  He was a CPSU member from 1943. In 1981, he was elected 
candidate member of the CPSU Central Committee at the 26th CPSU 
Congress and from 1983 was a member of the CPSU Central 
Committee. 
  He was elected deputy of the USSR Supreme Soviet (11th 
Convocation, 1984) and people's deputy of the USSR (1989). 
  He was awarded four orders of Lenin and other awards. He is 
a 
holder of the Lenin Prize (1981). 
  In the opinion of those who knew the marshal well, he was a 
soldier through and through. Sergey Fedorovich said this about 
himself: "I always have my own opinion, but I always follow 
orders." 
  As a political figure and as a person, Akhromeyev 
accumulated 
in himself the tragedy of his generation, confident in the 
righteousness of the cause to which they devoted their life and 
defending and protecting that which it was impossible to 
protect... And like the majority of people of his generation, 
during the years of perestroyka he found himself at a 
crossroads. One day you could hear him say: "We must forget that 
we are `reds' and `whites'. It is time to remember that we are 
all Russian people." Another day he would say: "I have taken the 
oath to the socialist fatherland and will that is exactly whom I 
will serve." 
  They say the same statements about the marshal's political 
biases in one of his last and few journalistic works, a book: 
"...The old is well forgotten." He penned these retorts in his 
own hand at the last minute on the page proofs of the book. 
"During the most recent days it was discovered that A.N. 
Yakovlev, a former member of the CPSU Central Committee 
Politburo and current member of the President's Council, is also 
unfriendly towards generals and admirals. After all, he was the 
one who directed the work of the mass media in 1987-1988. After 
all, this is the way the wind blows..." 
  Here is another retort not in the book: "They are trying to 
discredit both rank-and-file communists and prominent leaders. 
Now there are furious attacks on the union government and its 
head, Nikolay Ivanovich Ryzhkov, a principled and important 
worker taking the stand for a unified federative fatherland. I 
think our task is to defend the honest name of N.I. Ryzhkov and 
protect him." 
  On 24 August 1991, Akhromeyev was discovered dead in his 
office. The official version is suicide. He was buried in the 
Troyekurovskiy Cemetery in Moscow. His grave was subjected to 
looting twice, his uniform and plaster casts of awards stolen.

<F P=106> [Article: "Financial Problems in the Spotlight"] </F>
  [Text] On 28 April Russian Federation First Deputy Minister 
of Defense Andrey Kokoshin spoke at a training conference of 
executive of the financial and economic services of the RF Armed 
Forces. 
  Elaborating on the positions stated by General of the Army 
Pavel Grachev, the defense minister, in a speech the day before, 
Andrey Kokoshin noted that today the role of budget and 
financing organizations and of economic services of the armed 
forces has risen noticeably. 
  A maximally careful attitude toward every ruble provided by 
the state at the expense of the Russian taxpayer is important as 
never before. Vigorous activity by specialists on financial and 
economic problems in regard to setting the prices of products 
and services used by the armed forces has enormous significance 
today. A constant effort is required to optimize the structure 
of expenditures on maintaining the armed forces, on purchases of 
military equipment, and on scientific research and experimental 
design work. There are many examples here of such successful 
work, as was discussed during the conference, Andrey Kokoshin 
said. 
  In the opinion of the first deputy defense minister, far 
from 
everything possible has been done so far in the armed forces and 
in the Ministry of Defense. The latest information processing 
equipment and methods are being introduced too slowly. The 
forces of inertia still prevail in decisions of commanders of 
all ranks and executives of financial bodies of the Ministry of 
Defense, and many are slow in adapting to the new conditions. 
  A commission to effectively develop proposals for 
determining 
the priority directions of financial support to the vital 
activities of the armed forces, created by an order of the 
Ministry of Defense, is operating in the Ministry of Defense 
under the chairmanship of Andrey Kokoshin. The membership of 
this commission includes the chief of General Staff, deputy 
defense ministers, and the chiefs of a number of main 
directorates, including Colonel-General Vasiliy Vorobyev, chief 
of the Main Directorate of Military Budget and Financing. 
  Andrey Kokoshin illuminated the general status of the 
Russian 
economy. In his speech he noted the keen interest the army has 
in stabilization of the country's economy and its sociopolitical 
situation. Successful progress in military reform is, in the 
words of the first deputy minister, problematic in the absence 
of a stable economy, and of adequate solutions to the problems 
of financing the armed forces and enterprises filling defense 
orders. A very complex situation is developing here today, 
carrying the danger of a social explosion in a number of cases. 
  Andrey Kokoshin singled out the nonpayment problem as one of 
the most acute and immediate of the Russian economy. Unless it 
is solved, the objective of halting the decline in industry and 
the decrease in the income side of the federal budget, in which 
the armed forces are keenly interested, cannot be reached. The 
problem of nonpayment cannot be solved by a single thrust: 
Planned, purposeful work is required. At the same time measures 
of an emergency nature are also needed. One of them, upon which 
the first deputy defense minister insists, is immediate 
repayment of the state's debts pertaining to military and 
civilian products manufactured on the basis of state orders, and 
to services based on state orders. Kokoshin estimates the amount 
of such a one-time injection through state clients at 5-6 
trillion rubles. 
  Tight control over passage of budget resources along the 
entire chain is also necessary today; financial bodies of the 
Ministry of Defense have an important role to play in this 
control.

  FROM THE EDITOR: A protocol decision signed by Chairman 
of the Council of the Heads of Governments of the CIS and 
Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation Viktor 
Chernomyrdin discusses the need "for drafting proposals on the 
procedure for using the above-named documents, and for 
submitting them for examination to the next meeting of the 
Council of the Heads of Governments of the CIS." It should be 
added to this that time is of essence, since after all, this has 
to do with elderly and, as a rule, ailing people. We will hope 
that there will be no problems in the procedure of using the 
documents, while on the other hand, the Agreement itself also 
provides wide room for initiative, and for loving assistance to 
our veterans, no matter where in the former Union they may find 
themselves today.

<F P=106> [Report by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent Sergey Knyazkov </F>
under the rubric "Events and Commentary": "Russian Troops Will 
Leave Latvia by 31 August 1994"] 
  [Text] Agreement on 
this matter was reached during the first official visit to the 
Russian Federation by Guntis Ulmanis, president of the Republic 
of Latvia. 
  I would remind you that initially the primarily working 
visit 
by Guntis Ulmanis was planned for 22 April. It was planned 
during the visit for the presidents of the two states to ratify 
a treaty and three agreements previously reached on the 
withdrawal of the troops and social protection for military 
pensioners. A 5 September order from the President of the 
Russian Federation on the establishment of Russian military 
bases within the CIS countries and the Republic of Latvia, 
however, (for "technical" errors for which Latvia apologized), 
provided the excuse for national radicals in the Latvian Sejm to 
postpone the visit by Ulmanis to Moscow and to remove from the 
package of accords the agreements on social protection for 
military pensioners. And the visit by the leader of the Baltic 
republic did not become a reality until 30 April, following 
coordination of a protocol on a previously initialed agreement 
on social protection for Russian military pensioners residing in 
Latvia. The protocol defines the obligations of the sides to 
establish social conditions which would promote the voluntary 
resettlement of military pensioners and their families from 
Latvia. 
  The main document signed by the presidents of the two 
countries in the Kremlin is a treaty on the terms, the schedule 
and the procedure for withdrawing the armed forces of the 
Russian Federation from the territory of Latvia and their legal 
status during the period of withdrawal, an inseparable part of 
which are the Agreement on the Legal Status of the Skrunda Radar 
Station During the Period of Its Temporary Operation and 
Dismantling, an agreement between the governments on social 
protection for military personnel of the armed forces of the 
Russian Federation, the Border Troops and their families 
temporarily residing within the territory of Latvia and their 
complete withdrawal, as well as an Agreement on Protection for 
Military Pensioners of the Russian Federation and Their Families 
Residing on the territory of the Republic of Latvia. 
  The treaty setting the withdrawal of Russian troops from 
Latvia for 31 August 1994, which includes 15 articles, 
underscores the fact that "the complete withdrawal of the armed 
forces of the Russian Federation embraces all persons belonging 
to the armed forces of the Russian Federation, their families 
and real property." The document states that "the withdrawal of 
individual subunits of the armed forces of the Russian 
Federation and the vacation and transfer of facilities are being 
conducted on schedule." 
  The treaty is subject to ratification by the parliaments of 
both states. Its interim application will begin the day the 
ratification certifications are exchanged. 
  Boris Yeltsin has called the visit by Guntis Ulmanis, 
president of the Republic of Latvia, "historic." He announced 
following the signing ceremony for the Russian-Latvian documents 
that "they were worked out with the complete agreement of the 
two sides." In the talks the Russian head of state directed 
special attention to the accord reached by the presidents of the 
two countries and the fact that "Russian Federation Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin will make a visit to Riga," during 
which Russian-Latvian economic cooperation will be expanded 
considerably. 
  Assessing the package of documents signed during the talks, 
Guntis Ulmanis noted that he regards them "as an integral whole, 
as a sad necessity bequeathed to us by history."

<F P=106> [Article by Irina Savvateyeva: "Yeltsin's Man"] </F>
  [Text] Oleg Ivanovich Lobov, to criticism and exposure of 
whom many brilliant pages of Russian journalism have been 
devoted, is a dramatic figure in the Russian political arena. 
  As often happens with people, his shortcomings have become 
an 
extension of his merits. The main ones evidently being his 
creative and selfless involvement with the matter assigned him 
and his directness and ability to remain loyal, whether to 
people or to ideas.... 
  Born in Kiev in 1937, Lobov has always been proud that his 
family comes from an old cossack tribe and is mentioned in 
"Quiet Flows the Don" and that his uncle, an inhabitant of 
Veshenskaya village, once admitted Mikhail Sholokhov to the 
party. 
  The fate and career of Oleg Lobov himself were determined by 
a meeting with Boris Yeltsin. It happened in Sverdlovsk in 
1971, where Lobov had then been working for 11 years after 
graduating from the Rostov railroad engineers institute. Oleg 
Ivanovich was the main engineer at a large institute with the 
lengthy title "UralpromstroyNIIproyekt" and was a candidate of 
technical sciences. And he looked like a "promising worker" to 
Yeltsin, who at that time headed the Sverdlovsk party oblast 
committee [obkom] construction department. Boris Nikolayevich 
offered the 34-year-old Lobov the post of his deputy although at 
that time the latter had served virtually no time at all in the 
party. In 1972 Oleg Ivanovich joined the party obkom. It was a 
brilliant launchpad. 
  Since then he has retained his irreproachable loyalty to his 
boss. So that if anyone is to be given the title "Yeltsin's 
man" then Oleg Ivanovich Lobov is obviously the first. Yeltsin 
himself who, according to eyewitnesses' accounts, is 
hypersensitive to any kind of betrayal, intrigue, and plotting, 
has frequently stressed that he sees in Lobov not only a 
pragmatist and a strong economic leader but also a man he 
trusts. A man who could not stab him in the back. 
  From 1972 through to this day Lobov and Yeltsin have been 
walking through life arm in arm: Yeltsin became obkom 
secretary, Lobov became chief of the construction department and 
then chief of the country's biggest construction organization, 
"Glavstreduralstroy;" Yeltsin became first secretary, Lobov 
became secretary for construction and later chairman of the 
Sverdlovsk Oblast Soviet executive committee.... 
  Probably the years spent in Sverdlovsk were the best time in 
Oleg Ivanovich Lobov's life. As they liked to say in the old 
days, they were glorious pages in his labor career which he is 
obviously not ashamed to mention to this day. At least he has 
left his mark in Sverdlovsk. 
  He was indeed a "strong economic leader" of the Soviet era. 
Actually, I do not know whether he was a "pragmatist." Perhaps 
rather he was a romantic, a man of enthusiasms. 
  What is in 1993 the offensive nickname of "chicken and egg" 
leader invented by journalists in the era of the big battle 
against Lobov as minister of the economy was in the second half 
of the eighties for Lobov, as chairman of the oblast soviet 
executive committee, simply an honorary title. And a deserved 
one. To this day people in Sverdlovsk, or Yekaterinburg, 
remember that under Lobov there were eggs and chickens and milk 
too. They say that in his office there was a huge map of the 
oblast showing "the dynamics of the increase in poultry and milk 
production" in various rayons and the oblast soviet executive 
committee chairman unswervingly kept track of these dynamics. 
  But Oleg Ivanovich's main hobbyhorse is undoubtedly 
construction. They say he was a good construction worker. He 
knew his job backwards and had passed through every level of 
"professional growth." When he was in Moscow, as an important 
man, he recalled with pride and seemingly a certain nostalgia: 
"Cultural and sports complexes were constructed for the first 
time in the country on the basis of my sketches." The first 
such complex was constructed in a village, which was remarkable 
at the time. It had everything: a pool, a volleyball pitch, 
football, amateur artistic activities, and even baths. What is 
curious is that th is complex is still used for its purpose: 
People go there to wash.... 
  As chairman of the oblast soviet executive committee Lobov 
came out with what for the time was a quite bold initiative: 
Giving city dwellers the right to buy houses in the 
countryside. Now young people will merely shrug -- so what? 
But only seven or eight years ago this decision by the 
Sverdlovsk people alarmed Moscow. A special CPSU Central 
Committee commission arrived to investigate and closely "studied 
the question" and eventually kindly agreed it should be 
supported. A special CPSU Central Committee decree was 
published, after which Lobov embarked on the construction of 
cottages. An experimental settlement was installed near 
Sverdlovsk consisting of houses with every comfort and with 
auxiliary premises which, they say, were beautifully executed. 
To this day the entire local elite lives there. 
  It is indicative that Lobov was eager to repeat this 
successful experiment and he began to speak enthusiastically of 
a further 38 settlements. But like the majority of reforming 
ideas in the era of socialism, this one was overtaken by an 
inevitable fate: It was implemented in a strictly limited 
number of examples. Or to be more precise in just one case. 
  At the same time youth housing complex construction reached 
impressive scales in Sverdlovsk and considerable credit went to 
Lobov here. Or rather to Yeltsin and Lobov. In general all 
Oleg Ivanovich's progressive initiatives saw the light largely 
thanks to the fact that he had Yeltsin's support. Often the 
initiative itself came from Yeltsin. 
  Recalling today Oleg Ivanovich's activity in Sverdlovsk one 
cannot fail to mention the best supermarket in the oblast, the 
idea for which came from the executive committee chairman; the 
modernization of old Urals plants; the swift installation of gas 
compressor stations; the brick plants which, although he did not 
manage to install them in every rayon, as he wished, he 
nonetheless managed to construct in some quantity; and, pardon 
me for mentioning them, the excellent Sverdlovsk toilets. 
Incidentally, all of Lobov lies in the story of the toilets. 
  At one time he had traveled to Mexico or Italy where he had 
familiarized himself with the production of these necessary 
items. After which he returned home and called in the director 
of a ceramics plant and gave him a real dressing down for 
producing poor-quality toilets. Local inhabitants assert that 
from then to this day they have made good toilets.... 
  So was Lobov a reformer? Probably there is no one answer to 
that question. One thing is perhaps undoubted and that is that 
this man was very sensitive to... how to put it more precisely, 
to the requirements of the time, perhaps to the market 
situation? Obviously both are correct. 
  They say that in the days of classic party leadership Lobov 
was a real party boss -- an inaccessible demigod. When the era 
of wide-scale democracy began Oleg Ivanovich became a very big 
democrat. When there was the cooperative boom Lobov 
enthusiastically supported the "shoots of the new." And when 
Moscow began to criticize the cooperatives' get-rich-quick 
members Oleg Ivanovich immediately restructured himself. 
  I do not want to make mischief here. That was how the party 
raised people. Be prepared! Always prepared! Today you have 
been sent to build youth housing complexes and cooperatives, 
tomorrow to bury money at the bottom of irrigation channels. 
You must! And loyal soldiers of the kind that Oleg Ivanovich 
Lobov undoubtedly is will put all their efforts into organizing 
the digging. They will set up an optimum work schedule, 
organize hot lunches for the workers, and where necessary even 
take hold of a spade themselves.... 
  In 1987 on instructions from Yeltsin, who was already 
working 
in Moscow at the time, Lobov became deputy chairman of the 
Russian COuncil of Ministers. They say he was viewed with great 
sympathy there. It was a time of general discord, a time of a 
disorderly work style. And in this situation, when emergency, 
anticrisis decisions frequently had to be taken, Lobov was not 
equal to the task. 
  Moreover, in that government he almost looked like the most 
zealous reformer. At least to my journalist colleagues working 
at the time Lobov seemed the most progressive man in the 
government: He spoke more than anyone about the market, he 
supported youth housing complexes and in general everything new 
and progressive. For instance, he preached what was then a 
terrible heresy: Specialists should be sent to Germany to buy 
housing construction plants and then a "mass cottage industry" 
should be set up in Russia with the aid of these plants. In 
general Lobov's press conferences at which journalists were 
spoken to in human language were an event at the time, in the 
era of universal secrecy. 
  Oleg Ivanovich looked good in 1989-1991 in Armenia, where he 
was sent immediately after the earthquake as leader of the 
restoration work staff. After a while be became second 
secretary of the Armenian Communist Party Central Committee. 
  And in April 1991 at Yeltsin's initiative Lobov was 
appointed 
first deputy chairman of the Russian Council of Ministers. 
  His short stay -- scarcely more than six months -- in that 
post was marked by the stormy events of August. During which, 
eyewitnesses assert, Oleg Ivanovich behaved with dignity. It is 
universally known that he was assigned leadership of the 
"reserve" government in exile. 
  But when the time came for balanced rational work to reform 
the economy Oleg Lobov felt uncomfortable. In the fall of 1991, 
when Silayev had just been dismissed and Gaydar had not yet been 
appointed, he was left in charge of the economy. And imagine: 
Everything was collapsing, disintegrating, ties were breaking 
down, enterprises were coming to a standstill, but Lobov was 
discussing at a government session the question of... 
procurements of conifer branches to feed livestock. Observers 
believe that it was then that he failed -- like the Swede at 
Poltava [reference to defeat of King Charles XII of Sweden by 
Peter the Great in the battle of Poltava]. 
  Yeltsin obviously understood this. When Gaydar's team 
appeared on the horizon and the question of a change of course 
arose, there was no place in the government for Oleg Ivanovich. 
He himself explained the situation like this: "New people have 
come who want to work in a new way, I do not want to make them 
nervous with my presence." But to all appearances if anyone was 
nervous then it was primarily Oleg Lobov himself, whom the young 
reformers obviously did not want to take on as a mentor. 
Concealed hurt could be heard in the words uttered after 
Gaydar's men had been dropped: "What was the Gaydar team's 
mistake? They should have relied on experienced cadres and then 
the young men's energy would have had a reliable cover." 
  But that is highly doubtful. When Lobov returned from the 
council of experts which he had headed while Gaydar was the top 
man in the government and joined the cabinet of ministers now 
headed by Chernomyrdin, he became virtually the number one enemy 
of liberal market reforms. 
  Oleg Lobov, first deputy premier and minister of the 
economy, 
became widely known to the public concerned for his 
norm-creating activity. And primarily as the author of two 
impressive works: the draft president's edict "on the Russian 
Federation Ministry of the Economy" (May 1993) and the 
analytical memorandum "on the economic situation in the country" 
(August 1993). The imposing and threatening nature of these 
works contains all Oleg Lobov's cossack nature. When the sabers 
are unsheathed the Russian Ministry of the Economy will become 
"the leading central organ of federal executive power." Lobov 
eagerly arrogates to his department many functions of the State 
Committee for the Administration of State Property, the Ministry 
of Finance, the central Bank, the Ministry of Foreign Economic 
Relations, and other departments. His instructions are 
compulsory for all regional authorities.... His first deputies 
are equal to ministers "in terms of remuneration conditions and 
material and consumer and medical services...." In all Lobov 
tried to arrogate to himself in the heat of his lawmaking at 
least half of all the economic and sociocultural powers which 
the law on the Council of Ministers assigns to the government. 
  The program which Oleg Ivanovich was eager to implement with 
these powers was distinguished by the drastic intensification of 
state regulation of the economy. The tax system was to be 
reviewed: The state was to be given the opportunity not only to 
lay claim to taxes but also to the revenue of enterprises with a 
share of state property. Privatization was also to be reviewed: 
There was to be a reduction from 80 percent to 30 percent in the 
proportion of state and municipal property handed over in 
exchange for privatization vouchers.... 
  Oleg Ivanovich defended these ideas of his as selflessly and 
enthusiastically as he had once defended the ideas of youth 
housing complexes, cottage construction, and brick plants. The 
press pulled him to pieces, turning Lobov into a simply odious 
figure. It is said that when Oleg Ivanovich yet again tried 
with unfeigned enthusiasm to preach his ideas at government 
session, a rumble went round the auditorium. Even Mr. 
Zaveryukha looked quite sane compared to Lobov. Eventually in 
September 1993 Oleg Lobov was honorably removed from the 
economy: He was appointed secretary of the Russian Security 
Council. 
  In considering this inglorious and dramatic page in Oleg 
Ivanovich Lobov's history you can make several hypotheses. 
Experts believe that the drastic increase in the activity of 
"Yeltsin's man" could only have been sanctioned by the 
president. Thus Yeltsin was sounding out the possibility of 
retreating from the reforms after the Russian Supreme Soviet had 
voiced its lack of confidence in Gaydar in December 1992 and 
removed him from the management of the economy. Lobov's 
resignation in September 1993 was a concession to the 
"monetarists" fighting him not for life but to the death, when 
the president needed their support again in the late summer and 
early fall. When the idea of constitutional reform ripened, 
when all public opinion polls showed unequivocally that if the 
president were to dissolve parliament then the people would not 
lift a finger. 
  In addition virtually the entire government at the time was 
interested in Lobov's resignation. Fedorov and Chubays because 
of the obvious contradiction in views of economic policy. The 
premier and his henchmen because of apparatus considerations: 
Chernomyrdin had absolutely no need for the close presence of a 
man laying claim to a considerable proportion of the powers of 
the premier himself. 
  But I would not present Oleg Lobov as a kind of unfortunate 
victim of the political struggle. His rise and fall in 1993 
were ultimately by no means the consequence of the president's 
political games or the premier's bureaucratic intriguing 
(although there undoubtedly were games and intriguing). Rather 
they were the natural outcome of the next stage in the country's 
historical development. A stage at which managers like Oleg 
Lobov were quite unable to hold commanding heights in the 
economy. 
  One newspaper wrote at the time: "Oleg Lobov has the image 
and personal qualities of a typical representative of the former 
party and economic nomenklatura and whatever he does, however he 
tries to look like a 'market man,' his style and manner will 
remain those of an inveterate representative of the 
administrative-edict system. And nothing can be done about that. 
The man will not be able to change his skin in his maturity." 
  Today Oleg Lobov holds the "honorable" post of Security 
Council secretary. This work is hardly to his liking. He 
himself has repeatedly stressed and seemingly quite sincerely: 
I am not a politician, I am an economic manager. And now, on 
the anti-Chubays wave raised by Yuriy Luzhkov, Lobov continues 
to defend his views of privatization. But the Security Council 
is in no haste to study the economy and, people in the know say, 
are quietly grumbling about their new boss. 
  What next? 
  Lobov will not break through to power like Yuriy Skokov. 
Because he does not know how. During his entire time in leading 
posts Oleg Ivanovich has not cobbled together any "support 
group": He simply did not engage in it. There are no lobby 
structures behind him. No "initiative group" of interested 
political "chess players" will gamble on him because what kind 
of a chess game is it when everyone can clearly see on hundred 
moves ahead: Lobov is Yeltsin's man. And in general playing 
political chess is not in the nature of this heir of the Don 
cossacks. 
  Experts believe that if there is a military coup tomorrow (I 
stress -- this is a purely hypothetical suggestion, there are no 
real grounds for it, and it does not lay the slightest claim to 
the "number three story) and if Yeltsin were to go abroad, he 
would leave the country not to Chernomyrdin but to Lobov. The 
former, a pragmatic man, who has always had his personal 
interests in sight, will find a common language with the 
putschists and will make compromises. The latter will shoot it 
out to the last but will not surrender Yeltsin. 
  And the experts also say that if Chernomyrdin drives the 
country into hyperinflation and Yeltsin decides to take full 
economic power into his own hands -- he will put Lobov in the 
government in order to neutralize it but always to have it to 
hand and to feel calm about it. 
  God forbid we live to see such options....

<F P=106> [Article by Anatoliy Dokuchayev: "The Russian Army: Footnote </F>
to Assessments and Conclusions"] 
  [Text] The Creation of the Russian Armed Forces began 
on May 7, 1992 
<H5>  Military Review </H5>
  Judging from the many press articles, the Russian Army is 
today the focus of attention of experts and analysts both 
Russian and foreign. Their assessments strongly diverge. Some 
believe that the Russian Armed Forces pose a threat to the 
security of some neighboring states, while others conclude that 
the Russian military is today incapable of performing its 
mission of protecting the Fatherland. There are many opinions, 
but only one truth. What is it then? 
  Before that, a word about one assessment, that of the 
President. He believes that the Russian Armed Forces are 
presently combat-ready and as a whole are accomplishing their 
assigned missions. That is what it says in the presidential 
Message to the Federal Assembly. 
  But now, let us distance ourselves for a time from the 
official assessment and conclusions of various independent and 
dependent experts and analysts, and let us try to see, through 
the prism of factual material, what baggage the Russian Army has 
carried with it to its two-year anniversary. Here then are the 
facts. 
  In the Russian Army, basic reliance is placed on the 
Strategic Nuclear Forces (SYaS), which deter an aggressor from 
unleashing large-scale wars against Russia, and no less 
importantly, allow us to reorganize the General-Purpose Forces. 
Undoubtedly one can speak of existing difficulties encountered 
in the Russian SYaS. In the Strategic Rocket Forces (RVSN), for 
example, today they are doing the difficult job of withdrawing 
missile units from the territories of Belarus and Kazakhstan. 
But there is no reason to doubt the combat capacity of the 
Russian SYaS and their readiness to perform the mission assigned 
to them. Incidentally, dozens of journalists who were invited to 
the ceremony assigning three missile regiments, armed with the 
mobile RS-12M (Topol) missile systems, to the RVSN were 
convinced of this just recently. 
  The General-Purpose Forces have also been transformed in 
these two years. Today, in the military lexicon it is 
increasingly rare to hear regrets being voiced about the fact 
that the best troops, the troops of the border districts of 
yesterday's still-united power have been left in the near 
abroad. And this is primarily because the Russian western 
districts, the Northern Caucasus, Moscow and Leningrad 
districts, are being qualitatively transformed. 
  And one other thing about the new quality of the 
General-Purpose Forces: The principle of mobile defense, which 
was made the basis for creation of the troop groupings (it 
presupposes the availability of small but adequately strong 
forces ready for operational use wherever there is a real threat 
to Russian security) has acquired tangible outlines. The active 
creation of Mobile Forces, as a new inter-service 
operational-strategic formation of the Russian Army, has begun. 
  Reform year 1994. In order to create qualitatively new 
Armed Forces which meet the demands of the present 
military-political situation in the world and their tendencies 
of development, and [correspond to] the real degree of military 
danger to Russia, in 1994 the main tasks will be: 

  -  continuation of the development of troop (force) groupings 
and infrastructure on the territory of the Russian 
Federation 
  -  conclusion of the withdrawal of troops (forces) to 
the territory of Russia 
  -  creation of Mobile Forces 
  -  conduct of 
research to justify the structure, composition and numerical 
strength of the Armed Forces for the period after 
1995 
  -  development of a concept of development of the RF Armed 
Forces from 1996 to the year 2000 and in the future up to the 
year 2005. 


    Another fact. Despite the costs incurred by the start of the 
development of the Armed Forces and the grave economic situation 
of the country, questions of combat readiness and operational 
and mobilization training were resolved with rare persistence 
and consistency. In 1993, according to official statements, the 
Russian Army moved to a new system of combat readiness. After 
this came a chain of major exercises and training sessions at 
the strategic level. These were conducted by the Minister of 
Defense and his deputies. To name just a few: the command-staff 
exercises "Zapad," "Tsenter," and "Vostok," the strategic 
training sessions to repel an aerospace attack, and in command 
and control of the SYaS and the Armed Forces as a whole. Around 
100 operational exercises and training sessions were conducted 
under the leadership of the CINCs of the Armed Services and the 
commanders of military districts and fleets. Operational and 
mobilization training were directed toward assimilation of the 
new system of combat readiness and the newly developed 
operational plans of the troops and naval forces. 
  Reform Year 1994. The most important task is 
maintaining units and tactical formations in combat readiness 
and combat capability at a level ensuring the protection of the 
state under any conditions, and accomplishment of the tasks 
defined by the Basic Provisions of Military Doctrine. 
  In the four months of 1994, the plans for training of troops 
and naval forces were basically accomplished. Two command-staff 
training sessions were held at the strategic level, more than 
ten command-staff training sessions at the operational-strategic 
level, and the regional command-staff exercises "Baykal" and 
"Severo-Zapad" were held. 
  Before the end of the training year, plans are to conduct 
one 
training session in command and control of the Strategic Nuclear 
Forces, and a number of front command-staff exercises and the 
operational-rear exercise "Zapad." 
  These exercises help prevent a reduction in the level of 
combat readiness, promote proficiency of the troops and naval 
forces and coordination of the command and control elements and 
troops withdrawn to Russian territory to new garrison points. 
  The Russian Army is demonstrating its combat capacity not 
only in exercises. Its units and tactical formations are 
successfully accomplishing peacekeeping functions in accordance 
with the international obligations of our country. Two separate 
Russian battalions are helping to keep the peace in Yugoslavia. 
Units of the 201st Motorized Rifle Division, garrisoned in 
Tajikistan, are participating with the Collective Peacekeeping 
Forces in guarding and defending the Tajik-Afghan border and the 
most important economic installations; in patrolling, escorting 
columns with humanitarian cargoes, and acting as a guarantor of 
peace and security in the region. There are peacekeeping efforts 
of Russian subunits in Pridnestrovye, South Ossetia, and 
Abkhazia. A total of more than 16 thousand service members have 
been put into action in the "hot spots." 
  These examples are just a fraction of the components that go 
into the combat capacity of the Russian Army and the degree of 
work that has been done in two years to reform the units and 
tactical formations inherited from the USSR Armed Forces. Let me 
focus the attention of the reader on this point. Today there is 
a lot of talk about the great manpower shortage of subunits and 
units, which affects their combat capability. Today this is 
problem number one. But paradoxical as it may seem, it is being 
resolved. The manning of the subunits has increased in two 
years, and is currently at around the 65% level. And this 
while 
the existing legislation allows the drafting of scarcely more 
than 20% of conscripts. 
  This breakthrough became possible because reliance was put 
in 
time on a mixed manning system, by contract and conscription. At 
present there are more than 160 thousand professionals in 
uniform. 
  Reform Year 1994: The draft remains the basis of 
manning. However, around 80% of young men have legal 
grounds 
for exemption or deferment from conscription (in other states 
they are no more than 20-30% of conscripts). For this 
reason, 
there are high hopes in the program for manning the army and 
navy with contract service members. 
  In 1994, 150 thousand professionals will be selected, 
of them 14 thousand women. 
  In speaking of the Russian Army today, one must say that its 
development and the course of military reform as a whole are 
associated with many difficulties which are objective in nature. 
Thus, the creation of troop groupings is directly linked to the 
laborious task of withdrawing units and tactical formations to 
the territory of Russia. (In 1993, for example, more than 100 
thousand service members were withdrawn, more than 5 thousand 
pieces of armored equipment and artillery systems, and around 
700 combat planes and helicopters). The withdrawal of units and 
formations requires their accommodation and creation of new 
elements of the infrastructure. What is the result? Despite the 
fact that the withdrawal of troops is being implemented 
according to plan, in accordance with the schedules that were 
devised, it is significantly outstripping the rate of [troop] 
accommodation. While in 1992 there were 98 thousand service 
families lacking apartments, today there are more than 120 
thousand. These figures cannot be heard without pain. Not only 
are apartments in short supply, but also the corresponding 
elements of the infrastructure, academic, material and technical 
facilities, and much else. 
  The leadership of the Armed Forces aims to prevent a 
critical 
military-technical and technological lag behind the developed 
states of the world in the main areas of development of military 
equipment. Despite this fact, because of the cut in the military 
budget, the purchases of the latest weapon models have been 
reduced. Here, it is not irrelevant to point out that, as was 
noted at a press conference by the Defense Minister, General of 
the Army Pavel Grachev, today the Russian Army allows itself 
only those expenses without which it cannot get along, and which 
are associated with supporting the activity of the troops and 
personnel. There have been substantial changes in the structure 
of the military budget, and its tendency toward reorientation in 
the direction of the social sphere is clearly evident. 
  Reorientation of the military budget is not a tribute to 
fashion, but is a forced measure associated with tight 
financing--especially since it is necessary to accomplish a 
truly state-level task, safeguarding the prestige of serving in 
the Armed Forces. As you know, our Army has always drawn its 
strength from its people. Approaches toward accomplishing this 
task today are defined, and consist in an able combination of 
legislative means, financial and material incentives, and 
propaganda and educational measures. While the approaches have 
been determined, the main work lies ahead. 
  Problems, difficulties, problems. There are many of them. 
But 
for all that, it seems to me that the Russian Army has arrived 
at its second anniversary as an army which is gathering combat 
might, an army capable of accomplishing its mission of defending 
the Russian state.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Dudnik: "The Army Cannot Be Outside </F>
Politics. At Any Rate During a Time of Social Crisis"] 
  [Text] Over the last two years the Army has played a 
crucial role in Russian history on two occasions. And on both 
occasions experts made the same mistake -- they avoided public 
analysis and assessment of what happened. In August 1991, 
intoxicated by victory, as it were. And in October 1993, 
supposedly scared of it. But were they victories? It is 
impossible to understand the Army's role in society's crisis 
development without answering this question. 
<H5>  Prologue </H5>
  Over the last seven or eight years there has been a change 
in 
the nature of our society's development: From normal political 
evolution we ended up -- via a phase of virtually normal 
political struggle -- with overt confrontation and even, here 
and there, civil war. And the definite stance espoused by the 
Army has matched every phase. 
  Initially (until February-March 1989) the Army remained 
outwardly neutral and monolithic, although this was only an 
appearance. It continued, as it were, to reflect the interests 
of all society. In actual fact this was a period where conflict 
phenomena covertly developed and accumulated within it. 
  In February 1988 then premier Nikolay Ryzhkov was forced to 
accept the existence of vertical stratification within the Armed 
Forces. Thus, intra-Army problems and flaws found themselves 
the center of public attention. And that fall the civilian 
press raised the problems of military reform. In effect this 
marked the beginning of a fight for the Army between society and 
the authorities. 
  The tragedy in Tbilisi occurred 9 April 1989: The official 
authorities in confrontation with the people furtively used the 
Army. And then came Vilnius, Baku, Sumgait, and Dushanbe and 
the Airborne Troops' "potato maneuvers...." There were signs 
all around that the authorities were endeavoring to embarrass 
the Army and place society and it on different sides of the 
barricades (and barricades were already a fact in society). 
  A military "formation demonstration" took place on Moscow's 
Manege Square 23 February 1990. An "Appeal to the People" was 
adopted at the bidding of the Main Military-Political 
Directorate of the USSR Armed Forces, containing the following 
words: "A resolute 'no' to attempts to slander the Army and 
depict it as a force opposing the people." But a month later 
the authorities themselves overtly pitted the Army against the 
people: The Army was brought out with its hardware to surround 
the Kremlin 28 March in front of a 500,000-strong people's 
demonstration. 
  From that moment on controversy began in the mass media 
regarding the possibility of a military coup. In response the 
ruling top brass accused the mass media of inflammatory attempts 
to demoralize the Army. 
  This was the atmosphere in the country by August 1991. The 
Soviet authorities attempted 19-21 August to rout the radical 
civilian opposition by overtly relying on the Army. The Army, 
however, sabotaged the orders that it was given by the 
authorities, giving the outward appearance of keeping neutral. 
But even if you believe that the Army just found itself outside 
politics, as it were, that too was a bold political choice on 
its part. And tantamount to its joining the democratic camp. 
This choice brought about the Russian reformers' victory. 
<H5>  En Route to October </H5>
  The truth, however, was that the crisis in society had not 
been overcome. What is more, it escalated still further and 
increasingly took hold of the Army. Following the breakup of 
the USSR the latter too began to spontaneously break up. This 
was accompanied by a quite uncontrollable, if urgently disguised 
process that saw Army involvement in regional armed conflicts. 
And spring 1992 marked the beginning of a virtually undisguised 
tussle over the Army between the Supreme Soviet and the 
executive. 
  Certain events over the next 18-24 months were crucial for 
the moral and professional state and the subsequent position of 
the Soviet Army (and it is the Soviet Army that we are talking 
about, since virtually all its generic features are to a 
considerable extent retained). 
  First its legal recognition as Russia's Army. In effect this 
was the enactment of the choice that it had already made in 
August 1991. Then came vigorous steps on the part of the 
president to rehabilitate the Army morally and ethically and to 
boost servicemen's social status and improve their material 
position. 
  Early in March 1993 President Yeltsin had a meeting in 
camera 
with supreme command personnel. It is now clear from B. 
Yeltsin's memoirs that they discussed the Army's future position 
in a situation of growing political crisis. 
  In the April referendum the Army's choice was not 
proclaimed, 
but it nevertheless became known that 72 percent of the military 
backed the president's policy. That enabled Boris Yeltsin to 
say shortly afterward: The Army is the guarantor of state 
stability. In effect this indicated the place and role played by 
the Armed Forces in the nationwide conflict. 
  However, this was shortly countered by an idea that appeared 
out of nowhere -- "the Army is outside politics." The 
cultivation of this idea within the Army almost played a fatal 
role during the overt confrontation between the Communist-Soviet 
political system and the executive's post-totalitarian regime 
that began 21 September [1993]. 
  I think that in essence this was the antithesis of the 
recent 
past, which espoused the unqualified ideological principle that 
the Army has no internal functions even though everyone knew 
that this was a lie. The "Red-Soviet" Army was systematically 
used to ensure the internal stability of the Communist regime. 
  This hypocrisy and deception could not last long. It was 
bound to come to an end. And that happened in October. 
<H5>  A Victory? </H5>
  Everything that happened during October is horrifying, 
speaking in ordinary human terms. But in the harsh language 
found in a review of events, the scale of what happened and the 
number of casualties enable these events to be ranked as a 
low-intensity, local armed conflict. And the damage done during 
it can be regarded as acceptable. That is the case, ridiculous 
as it may sound. 
  However, all this should and could have been prevented, even 
in conditions where the idea of the Army's role in maintaining 
internal state stability had not been formalized de jure. But 
during the most critical hours the leadership of the Armed 
Forces played a waiting game. Even later on it did not make use 
of the full scale of degrees of using force in a civil conflict. 
And that scale is broad, with many subidivisions. It includes 
making an unambigous advance statement of position; threatening 
the threat [as published] of force; directly threatening the use 
of force; making a show of intent; using limited components of 
force for effect, etc -- this is what the range of measures is 
like. 
  But in order to feel confident about using this range of 
measures, the Army leadership should have had a clear 
ideological principle prior to the events of October: The Army 
cannot be outside politics, and at critical moments the Army 
should be under one-man command and obey the constitutional 
commander in chief. The Army leadership did not have this clear 
ideological principle, and therefore at the critical moment 
immediately switched to the scenario involving tanks and 
shooting. 
  Needless to say, force was certainly used to provide the 
requisite defense of the state system. But in a very clumsy 
manner, and after the Army leadership had not had dialogue with 
society for a very long time and had shown dogged reluctance to 
present any arguments other than those that were last-minute and 
extreme in their intensity. 
  Needless to say, force of argument (eschewing the latter 
argument up to a certain point) is the only thing that can and 
should keep the social situation under control in the long term. 
However, at times of political crisis either arguments are 
lacking or they fail to work. And people behind a crisis tend 
to be deliberately unwilling to hear and see them. That is what 
happened in September and October 1993. 
  But even if society wants to evolve in its chosen direction, 
the authorities should at least keep control of the situation. 
It is in these cases that the argument of force replaces the 
force of argument: In Moscow 3-4 October 1993 it was not merely 
a political victory and temporary civil stabilization that was 
achieved by military means. Civil war was averted, and that 
could have been followed by global armed conflict. 
  People claim that in October the Army could with an equal 
degree of probability have ended up on any side depending on the 
command. 
  In conditions whereby the Army is in a state of unstable 
political equilibrium and its position depends on the personal 
choice made by its sole commander, who has the right to give it 
orders (in this case, Pavel Grachev), this might have happened. 
But only in theory. In practice everything was determined by 
the alignment of forces and interests in society and the fact 
that the "White House inmates" had been utterly discredited 
morally and politically. In this context its choice was 
preordained. This was the culmination of the Army's choice in 
August 1991. 
  It did not use force against its own people then. Now it 
used force to defend the people's fundamental interests. To put 
it in extreme terms, it was a question of preventing global 
civil war. 
<H5>  A Defeat? </H5>
  Victory was not followed by civil peace. Everything that 
divided people when they were killing one another has not only 
remained in society but has worsened the situation still further. 
  Having secured victory for the politicians, the Army 
suffered 
a "defeat." It did not succeed in being the arbiter in the 
civil dispute and the guarantor of state stability. It fell 
hostage to the winning side. 
  Nor has the potential threat to the authorities posed by 
this 
Army been removed. On the one hand, it has become conscious of 
its own indisputable strength and in this connection its own 
exclusivity in this state system. On the other, the following 
question has not been removed: What will the Army do if the 
authorities it supports prove unviable in civil organizational 
development? Whereas 10 tanks settled everything in October, 
another 10 (or perhaps more) could turn up if only their 
commander is sure that there is an individual who will be able 
to make better use of the fruits of his labors than the people 
in power at the moment. There are still enough forces 
interested in these same tanks but with different commanders and 
people. 
  The 12 December elections not only confirmed this, but at 
the 
same time demonstrated the true sympathies of the post-October 
Army. 
  The Defense Ministry and the Central Electoral Commission 
kept the results of the Army's voting secret. However, the 
president admitted that a third of the Army voted for 
Zhirinovskiy. 
  The results of the 12 December 1993 voting do not merely 
reflect the profound crisis in which the current Army finds 
itself. They represent defeat for the democratic choice that it 
made in August 1991. Its current choice may quite possibly be 
the prologue to the general defeat of democracy in Russia. 
<H5>  The Last Bastion of the Soviets </H5>
  Appealing to his compatriots the day after the Soviet armed 
putsch was put down, the Russian president promised the people 
"full military reform." Instead of that, a month later he 
produced military doctrine. 
  The military doctrine, written by gung ho Afghan generals, 
not only made no reference to the term "military reform" but 
contained none of the key formulas -- civilian control of the 
defense sphere, a civilian defense ministry, an open, 
structurally-improved defense budget, and a professional army. 
  To make up for that it harbored the possibility of a fresh 
wave of economic militarization and Russia's transformation into 
a military police state. Let us recall just two episodes. 
  A month after the Security Council adopted the military 
doctrine the president made a peacemaking trip to the North 
Caucasus. During this trip Pavel Grachev issued the following 
tough statement: If it is necessary to use the Army to pacify 
the region, he, the defense minister, would do so. And a month 
later, this January, in response to the detention in Latvia of 
two generals, without authorization the commander of the 
Northwest Group of Forces put the divisions under his command on 
combat alert. And the Airborne Troops did the same. 
  Thus the ruling top brass are wilfully sending draftees to 
die outside the Fatherland in breach of Russian laws and are 
opening the way for the legal use of mercenary troops and the 
semilegal transfer of armored vehicles, heavy weapons, and 
munitions to the warring countries of the former USSR. In 
return they have gotten local civil wars. 
  Nor is military reform working out. Are some of the current 
generals contemplating further sabotaging reforms? With their 
complete power, they have all the means at their disposal on 
which the Supreme Soviet relied as it was losing power. The 
temptation is great. They have presidents available. The 
appropriate entry is there in the doctrine. 
  The ruling state elite cannot be unaware of all this. 
  It will not prove possible to keep the Army in its present 
state for long. It is also impossible to radically reform it, 
since the authorities have handed the business of transforming 
the Army over to the military elite themselves. The ruling top 
brass will not permit full-scale military reform because that 
would spell the end of their absolute power. Yet the military 
elite cannot now be replaced. That would automatically mean 
blaming it for the Army's involvement in the Moscow conflict. 
That would not really be right; what is more, it would be 
simply very dangerous. 
  Consequently we are "condemned" to a certain pause in Army 
reform. It should be followed by a scene-change, most likely a 
multiple change, which will also clear the stage for the next 
historical act.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Chuprin under the "Reporting" rubric: </F>
"PVO Reveals Secrets"; first paragraph is ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI 
introduction] 
  [Text] The underground casemates of the Moscow Military 
District's PVO [air defense] command center are reminiscent of a 
skillfully wound wire. Endless stairways and secluded corners 
unexpectedly terminate in enormous rooms, where pilot lights and 
instruments flicker in mysterious darkness. Then there are more 
stairways, passageways, and heavy, massive doors. 
  "Our command center began operating on 30 November 1981," 
said Lieutenant General P. Kuznetsov, chief of staff of the MO 
[Moscow District] PVO. "It cost the government at that time 74 
million rubles." 
  We headed for the combat control room - the holy of holies 
of 
the command center. The plotting boards, charts, and maps 
illuminated in the darkness could at any time supply the 
military personnel with literally all the data. 
  A monitor screen displayed a weather report pertaining to 
military airfields. For example, it was shown that at Bologoye 
there were a haze, calm, humidity of 95 percent, and visibility 
of 300 meters. P. Kuznetsov gave the command for a report on the 
air situation on the northern borders of Russia. There was an 
immediate change in the size of the map, which showed in large 
scale the Leningrad Oblast area, with two aircraft flying from 
Scandinavia in that direction. 
  While we watched the moving electronic spots, an air defense 
crew located somewhere near Vyborg had already taken up its 
combat stations. But what was the story? The new instructions 
forbid knocking down foreign air liners and sports craft that 
violate Russia's air space. However, the brigade staff command 
post operations officer has the authority to give the command to 
destroy a military "pirate." He is not required to obtain 
permission from the state's top persons to do this. 
  "Many people do not believe that in this economically 
difficult time we are able to maintain a high state of combat 
readiness," said Colonel General A. Kornukov, district 
commander. "But that really is so. Eighty percent of our troops 
received the good or excellent evaluation in last year's combat 
preparation rating. In the concluding exercises, more than 100 
aerial targets entered our zone at various altitudes and speeds, 
and all were "destroyed." The men are provided with uniforms, 
footwear, and food rations. Our military pilots--the only ones 
in Russia--were able to put in 100 percent of the time called 
for in the training programs. Ninety-five percent of the air 
defense regiments are armed with the new S-300 missiles." 
  Indeed, the PVO troops cannot be said to be a stepchild of 
the government. This is easily seen by looking at the Moscow 
District. The staff command post in which we were located, 
although the main one, is definitely not the only one in the 
district. Under extreme conditions, any one of the five reserve 
command posts can take on the function of troop command and 
control. 
  It is true that, in the opinion of military specialists, 
there is no chance whatsoever that the above situation will 
obtain. The fortification secrets of underground structures are 
such that the command post is reliably protected against all 
types of weapons of mass destruction. Even in the case--God 
forbid!--an enemy's nuclear bomb would score a direct hit on the 
site, this would not harm a single hair on the heads of the 
officers and generals as they perform the 24-hour watch. The 
combat control room, automatic warning system computing 
facility, and the communications center are capable of 10 days 
more in automatic operation. The bunker's reinforced concrete 
walls are filled with metal shells mounted on special cables and 
shock absorbers. These constructions prevent soil displacement 
even in case of a substantial explosion. 
  Military persons would not be surprised if told that it 
would 
not be a bad idea to have this kind of stronghold within the 
population's civil defense system. You and I know that potatoes 
for plant dining halls have long been stored in puny bomb 
shelters. They are much cheaper for enterprise workers in the 
fall than in spring when purchased in stores. 
  Well, the above is incidental to the story. What kind of 
service are PVO men performing now, and which traditions are 
they observing and promoting? The MO "lost" 100 large units last 
year. However, this is in no way a tragedy. Troop reformation is 
to continue, and it seems that it is impossible to ignore the 
Suvorov instruction "skill, not numbers" by hiding behind thick 
walls of a bastion. 
  Nonetheless, it cannot be said that hanging over the heads 
of 
district units and subunits is a mortal danger of mass 
discharges into the reserves, something which is frequently 
stated in newspapers. Rumors of elimination of the "defensive 
rings" around Moscow are grossly exaggerated, according to the 
military authorities. 
  The chief slogan used by Russian airborne troops is "no one 
other than we." For missilemen, this is "who if not we." This is 
how the PVO generals feel, referring to the military action 
experience in Iraq, where the Americans' successful air 
offensive was decisive in securing victory for them. 
  The Moscow District is capable of launching missiles against 
500 targets at the same time. It would be foolish, even 
criminal, to dissolve this kind of army branch, considering that 
only a single cruise missile reaching its target would be 
capable of inflicting upon the national economy a severe lesson. 
Also, the MO is watching over 1.3 million square kilometers of 
Russia, eight nuclear power stations, and about 140 
installations considered to be special. 
  The above supertasks compel missilemen to keep their powder 
dry. Formation of a professional army is still something for the 
future. And filling the manpower needs by voluntary recruitment 
only leaves much to be desired. 
  In a word, summer is drawing near, and with it the PVO men's 
new evaluation launchings against practice targets. This is 
something for which they are ready at all hours of the day and 
night at Anino. But what about other missile and radar stations 
distributed over an enormous area? One can only hope that only 
training alerts will be sounded there.

<F P=106> [Article by Captain Vladimir Mokhov: "Airborne Landing in </F>
Volga Region: New Service Addresses"] 
  [Text] Until recently the residents of this rayon center in 
Saratov Oblast never saw a group of troops larger than five 
officers from the local military commissariat. Now an entire 
airborne regiment has entered the city. 
  It is basically made up of officers and warrant officers of 
an airborne training center transferred to the Lvov area. 
Following the breakup of the armed forces of the USSR, they 
decided they wanted to serve in Russia. The Airborne Troops 
arrived in the Volga region practically with only their 
suitcases. And a desire to establish the same kind of training 
center there. They wrote a letter to that effect to the minister 
of defense and the commander of the Airborne Troops. Their 
voices were heard. The date 16 October 1992 can be considered to 
be the birth date of a new training center for Russia's Airborne 
Troops. 
  They did not have to begin from scratch. In the first place, 
the backbone of the regiment--the battalion and company 
commanders and administrative personnel--remained the same. In 
the second place, the city, rayon and oblast leadership 
immediately established business contacts. The matters of 
deploying the regiment, allocating land plots, the construction 
of the materials and equipment base, and so forth, were resolved 
without a hitch. 
  The military post is gradually acquiring its regular shape. 
It is still necessary, however, to build and equip a training 
ground 40 kilometers from the post and to restore the former 
basis for the reclamation battalion, which has become 
practically unusable. According to the most modest estimates, 
this will require more than a billion rubles. 
  There is the same kind of problem with housing. For now the 
officers' families are scattered throughout the city. It is not 
such a problem to rent an apartment at acceptable rent in the 
rayon center, to be sure. At the end of last year many of them 
celebrated housewarmings in the first, 100-apartment building 
built for the Airborne Troops. And construction rates should not 
decrease this year. According to Colonel Valeriy Shevchuk, the 
unit commander, the command element of the Volga Military 
District is providing considerable assistance along with the 
city authorities. 
  And what about the regiment's main purpose, the training of 
specialists for the Airborne Troops? Right now only the 
permanent staff is engaging in planned combat training. The 
proper equipment and materials base is lacking for training 
cadets. The most immediate prospect is for the end of 1994. The 
Airborne Troops plan by that time to establish the essential 
conditions for deploying one of the training battalions, 
conducting the first recruitment and setting about the planned 
training of specialists. If there are no problems with the 
financing, this mission should be fulfilled. 
  The regiment is trying not lose its professional skills. The 
officers, warrant officers and contract specialists (most of 
whom are local residents) have completed the annual program of 
parachute drops. And so, the light-blue Airborne beret has 
apparently been firmly established in the interior of this small 
city near the Volga.

<F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Kholodov: "Admiral Chernavin's </F>
`Submarines': Russia Has No Submarine Fleet?"] 
  [Text] The editorial office of MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS has a 
memorandum prepared in 1992 by Russian Military 
Counterintelligence and signed by Nikolay Golushko, former chief 
of the Federal Counterintelligence Service. Stamped "Top 
Secret", it unequivocally admits that Russia's submarine fleet 
is not combat effective: 
  "The noise level of nuclear-powered submarines in the 
USSR Navy is 20-30 times higher than those of the Americans, and 
the effectiveness of domestic sonar equipment is more than 25 
times as inferior. Due to these reasons, the U.S. Navy has 
achieved a capability of detecting Soviet nuclear-powered 
submarines with a probability of 0.95 and is able to monitor 
more than 75 percent of the area of strategically important 
areas of the world oceans. The USSR KGB has repeatedly (Nos 
3/8/2458-79 and 3/6/2166-88) informed the levels of authority 
and the Main Military Procuracy about this situation in the 
field of nuclear-powered submarine shipbuilding, but no positive 
changes followed." 
  In the 1960's, the Americans began reducing the noise level 
of their submarines, sacrificing everything. In order to make 
nuclear-powered submarines invulnerable, we began increasing the 
speed and depth of their submerging: We strengthened the hull in 
order to withstand an enemy torpedo strike, as if making an 
ironclad instead of a submarine. 
  "Events of recent years show that having achieved 
strategic superiority, the U.S. Navy is intensifying it despite 
our country's real technical and material capabilities to 
eliminate it. In this situation, in the opinion of a wide range 
of experts, the main responsibility falls on the 
military-industrial complex, the Ministry of the Shipbuilding 
Industry, and also the leadership of the Navy, who in the late 
1970's and early 1980's gave the leadership of the country and 
the USSR Ministry of Defense a false presentation of ways to 
achieve acoustics equality of third-generation domestic 
nuclear-powered submarines with nuclear-powered submarines of 
the U.S. Navy just by replacing auxiliary mechanisms without 
changing their architecture and design as a whole. The actual 
causes of the high noise level of Soviet nuclear-powered 
submarines were ignored." 
  Military counterintelligence worked in vain. This memorandum 
was not useful to anyone. In an interview with KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, 
the commander in chief of the Navy recently stated that "a 
laying-down of the lead ship of an advanced nuclear-powered 
attack submarine took place in Severodvinsk." Experts are 
skeptical about its "advanced nature," maintaining that it is 
only another Sierra-class nuclear-powered submarine, of which 
more than enough have already been built. 
  Construction of advanced nuclear-powered submarines having 
no 
prospects is a classic example of actions by the military 
industrial lobby. In the absence of competition, this lobby is 
virtually all-powerful--any criticism is quickly neutralized. 
You see, it involves money--and big money, and awards for 
creating an allegedly silent new submarine. The 
Sevmashpredpriyatiye Production Association received priority 
financing--such a nuclear-powered submarine will cost taxpayers 
the sum of about 1 trillion rubles. 
  That same memorandum talks about an attempt by an 
"opposition" group of scientists to make a number of changes in 
the strategy of building nuclear-powered submarines. 
  "These proposals were supported by submariners of the 
Northern and Pacific fleets, scientists, and designers and 
confirmed by interdepartmental tests and tactical exercises 
between 1982 and 1986. The experience amassed was analyzed by 
the departments concerned and in 1985 approved by the Navy VTS 
and recommended for introduction into operation. At the same 
time, it should be noted that the commander in chief of the 
Navy, V.N. Chernavin, reacting negatively to these proposals for 
reasons known only to him, by Directive No. 0026 of 28 March 
1987 delayed commissioning... At the same time, the proposals 
were actively supported by Fleet Admiral I.N. Smirnov, who from 
1982 to 1986 personally supervised all work and testing." 
  The commander in chief of the Navy at that time, Admiral 
Chernavin, cut off all the oxygen to new proposals, probably 
because otherwise he would have had to explain the stubborn 
ignoring of the facts since 1974! And the more of these facts 
there were, the higher the classification stamp on the documents. 
  "Competent experts note that all the conclusions of the 
Navy, industry, and science, made in response to appeals to the 
levels of authority by Academician Aleksandrov, Fleet Admiral 
Yegorov (former chief of the Main Staff of the Navy--Author), 
and Captain 1st Rank Kolton during the period 1988-1990, as a 
rule, are flagrantly distorted, and the favorable results of 
research and studies made during the period 1982-1986 are often 
falsified and basically aimed at confirming the earlier unsound 
decision made by Navy Commander in Chief Chernavin, outlined in 
Directive No. 0026-87." 
  For some reason, we began to get the opinion that the 
military-industrial complex was almost the national pride of 
Russia. Meanwhile, the military-industrial complex was infected 
by the same mutation as the entire economy. It is dangerous to 
build illusions--the quality of our nuclear-powered submarines 
is no better than the quality of our automobiles. 
  "The state of affairs with the noise level of domestic 
nuclear-powered submarines is made worse by the lack of an 
effective enemy submarine detection system. In the field of 
sonar equipment, the U.S. Navy surpasses the USSR Navy 
considerably, which has resulted in enemy nuclear-powered 
submarines having the capability of delivering a strike against 
Soviet submarines and remaining undetected as a result of the 
low specifications and performance characteristics of our sonar 
complexes. 
  "The U.S. Navy's submarines detect Soviet submarines at 
distances exceeding the operating range of domestic sonar 
systems by 120-140 km. The sonar systems of surface ships of the 
U.S. Navy are also significantly superior in operating range to 
similar Soviet models. The enemy is 7-12 years ahead of us in 
sonar systems used by naval aviation and 20 years ahead in 
implementing individual technical designs." 
  An analysis of collisions between Russian and foreign 
submarines WITHIN THE RUSSIAN MARITIME ZONE indicates that this 
memorandum is close to objectivity. Our submarines make so much 
noise that they do not even hear the "tail" behind them. 
  In the Barents Sea on 11 February 1992, at the moment of 
surfacing for a scheduled communications session, a Russian 
Sierra-class submarine collided with a massive body, which 
turned out to be the USS Baton Rouge nuclear-powered submarine 
of the U.S. Navy. Our commander, like he was supposed to 
according to known corresponding instructions, evaded from the 
unknown target to a safe depth. 
  There have been a total of 11 collisions. As a rule, they 
occurred several minutes after a sudden change in heading or 
submerged depth by the "deaf" Soviet nuclear-powered submarine. 
For some time now, Russian submariners have been directed not to 
make sudden turns to avoid possible collisions with 
nuclear-powered submarines. 
  "The seriousness of the matter lies not only in the 
fact that the Ministry of the Shipbuilding Industry is removing 
the urgency of the problem of struggling for acoustics 
superiority of our submarines. It is disorienting the levels of 
authority, reporting the approximate equality of the noise level 
of our third- and fourth-generation nuclear-powered submarines 
being built and being designed with U.S. Navy nuclear-powered 
submarines, and thereby is misleading them about the actual 
combat capabilities of our maritime strategic nuclear 
system." 
  The Americans, apparently, already have the noise profiles 
of 
all our nuclear-powered submarines, and observations in the 
combat training zones have enabled them to record noises 
corresponding to bringing Soviet nuclear-powered submarines to a 
missile-launch readiness. 
  Of course, no one plans to fight the Americans. However, 
what 
sense does it make to "forge" nuclear-powered submarines no one 
needs and on which citizens of Russia will perform duty no one 
needs?

<F P=106> [Interview with Captain 1st Rank Albert Ivanovich </F>
Khraptovich, former commander of a nuclear-powered 
missile-carrying submarine, by Vladimir Voronov: "The Admiral's 
`Paper' Truth"] 
  [Text] In the article "Paper Nautiluses" (STOLITSA, 
No 45, 1993), Captain 1st Rank Ilya Kolton asserted: The Russian 
strategic submarine fleet is not combat effective--the potential 
adversary tracks literally every one of our ships. The whole 
point is that our domestic submarines make too much noise. 
  Fleet Admiral Vladimir Chernavin, former commander in 
chief of the USSR Navy, did not agree with this, which he 
reported in PRAVDA ("Paper Nautiluses in the Sea of Life," 9 
February 1994), calling our article a "monstrous lie." The 
arguments of STOLITSA were not to the admiral's liking also 
because the author of the magazine article was "an 
engineer-mechanic--nothing more, but who had assumed the role of 
a strategist-analyst." 
  Well, today we give the floor to a person whom even 
former Commander in Chief Chernavin would not dare to accuse of 
lacking professionalism or being ignorant of strategic problems. 
Albert Khraptovich is a captain 1st rank of the reserve, 
commanded a nuclear-powered missile-carrying submarine for 11 
years, and is the holder of many state awards. 
<H5>  Who Needed "Atrina"? </H5>
  [Voronov] Albert Ivanovich, Fleet Admiral Chernavin tells 
about the super-secret fleet operation of 1987 under the code 
name "Atrina". At that time a group of nuclear-powered 
submarines seemed to have successfully broken away from NATO 
antisubmarine forces. Does it turn out that the assertions of 
Captain 1st Rank Kolton were far from reality? 
  [Khraptovich] Let us first try to understand, why did 
Admiral 
Chernavin conduct Operation Atrina in general? 
  "We had to teach a little lesson to the potential 
adversary, who had gotten a swelled head, and show that, when 
necessary, we can become illusive `avengers', that is, operate 
in a sufficiently concealed manner to deliver a retaliatory 
strike..." 
  So, from the very beginning everything was conceived for 
show? The submarine fleet should be "illusive" without such 
operations. But here it was--"when necessary!" 
  The retired admiral even said that such a large-scale and 
devastating action was needed, in general, only by him--his 
personal "international prestige" depended on its success. 
Someone naive could even believe that combat effectiveness 
concerns Chernavin! 
  So, it is only a desire to establish oneself! Instead of 
normal work--to organize a rush job and report. 
  [Voronov] But according to Chernavin, they were successful. 
  [Khraptovich] The victory was only in the reports; in 
practice, everything was different. It is even apparent from the 
ex-commander in chief's article that the NATO forces had the 
capability to detect virtually all our submarines easily. An 
"illuminated" submarine can be considered destroyed. Do I have 
to explain how effective a Navy is whose submarine forces are 
being constantly monitored by a potential adversary? But instead 
of trying to correct the situation, the admiral conducts a 
special operation; he says, on such ships we sometimes get away 
from you. Well, that is simply nonsense! And all this in order 
to "teach" the opponent one time. What is the cost to the budget 
for such a dashing move? 
  The admiral also does not try to hide the fact that neither 
he himself nor the Navy were even minimally prepared for 
Operation Atrina. Preparation took a lot of time--ships had to 
be brought to the proper degree of technical readiness. For the 
first time in the Navy's history, in the admiral's words, joint 
training of commanders of submarines and aircraft was 
conducted--an entire division of naval aviation was used in the 
operation. There also was no experience of a simultaneous 
long-range cruise by five nuclear-powered submarines 
immediately. How did he plan to fight? 
  After all, if there indeed was a serious desire to 
fundamentally change the strategy and approach the problem of 
undetectability of the submarine fleet in a new way, why whip 
everyone into a fever, why such massiveness and haste? 
  The Americans noted the departure of the division of 
submarines, but paid no special attention to it. They are going, 
they said, and we know where and why. Yes, in the event of 
combat operations, they would have eliminated our ships back 
when they were departing base! 
<H5>  Maritime "Cat-and-Mouse" </H5>
  It seemed that we had broken away. Success! Victory! In the 
words of Chernavin, three squadrons of antisubmarine warfare 
[ASW] aircraft, six nuclear-powered submarines, and three 
hunter-killer groups from the U.S. and British navies were 
thrown into the search for the detachment that had 
disappeared... What power! But any professional will tell you 
that actually these are more than modest forces for searching 
for give nuclear-powered submarines at sea. So what? Without 
exerting any special effort, the Americans soon detected the 
detachment of our ships. Perhaps Admiral Chernavin himself is 
not fully aware how badly he let the cat out of the bag? After 
all, no one forced him to say this: "They tracked Captain 1st 
Rank Shevchenko's detachment almost the entire return route and 
did not stop working until the Norwegian Sea..." 
  You see, this is a total catastrophe, a failure! It can be 
considered that five crews and five ships were already listed 
among the casualties. The detected submarine was a dead 
submarine. In essence, the mission facing the detachment was 
thwarted. Even if only one submarine is "illuminated," the 
causes of the failure and the specific parties responsible are 
carefully investigated and analyzed in any Navy in such a case. 
Here the Americans did not simply detect the whole detachment, 
they practiced methods of tracking and attack as much as they 
wanted. And this most serious defeat of ours is passed off 
almost as an outstanding achievement! 
<H5>  Towards the Fondest "Star" </H5>
  Then something happens that is unprecedented in any normal 
navy, but traditional in ours: An extravagant report to the 
"very top," a downpour of orders, medals, ranks, expensive 
gifts... Incredible? The submariners themselves who carried out 
Chernavin's order, of course, are not at all to blame. With the 
equipment they had, the armament and acoustics available, and 
with the noise level which Captain 1st Rank Kolton justly wrote 
about, detection of the submarines by a potential adversary was 
simply a foregone conclusion. Admiral Chernavin knows this 
perfectly well, too. Incidentally, he considers one of the main 
achievements of the cruise to be the fact that everyone returned 
to base "without any human losses or serious damage." We 
submariners know how much "minor" damage there what and what its 
cost was. So, the seamen received their awards deservedly, and 
their leaders... 
  I think Chernavin himself would very much like to add the 
fond words "of the Soviet Union" to the rank "fleet admiral." 
<H5>  Confidentially--to the Whole World </H5>
  If Operation Atrina actually would have been a serious 
operation to practice or test new methods of deploying 
submarines in areas of possible combat operations, it would have 
still remained in strictest secrecy to this day! The admiral 
would not have dared to even mention it in PRAVDA or any other 
paper. This was a cheap game on the public. Just one fact: In 
order to "break away" from the NATO ships that were "stuck" to 
them, Chernavin authorized the submarine commanders to use even 
sonar countermeasures equipment. But, you see, this is 
categorically forbidden, since it gives away to the potential 
adversary their specifications and performance characteristics 
and combat capabilities. This can only be done in actual combat. 
Chernavin, it turns out, declassified that which should remain 
classified right up until the first round is fired! And even 
this did not help... 
  All such activities of comrade Chernavin are from the known 
series of measures for show, like building the largest 
missile-carrying submarine in the world. Enormous amounts of 
money have been spent and for nothing--it is virtually 
impossible to hide such a submarine; it will easily be 
destroyed. Or take the epic for constructing a nuclear-powered 
aircraft-carrying cruiser. The whole country, overexerting 
itself, is building it. Later it turns out that it will be 
unable to defend itself, not mention inflicting battle damage on 
the enemy! There were no docking platforms or power support for 
the gigantic monstrosities. They rusted and rotted, and a 
considerable amount of money is also needed to utilize them. 
There was no money left for housing for the officer and warrant 
officer families. 
  The words of the former Navy leader are blasphemy to a real 
seaman: "We also restored our reputation in the eyes of 
the potential adversary". (It turns out, the commander in 
chief was interested not in combat effectiveness but in 
"reputation"). "When all is said and done, we only 
achieved equality with you, NATO admirals, in the number of lost 
nuclear-powered submarines," the admiral joyously informs 
us. How can he flaunt this?! After all, Chernavin is still 
"cunning"--by that time we had already "overtaken" our opponents 
in losses, using the admiral's terminology. 
  [Voronov] Is Chernavin personally to blame for such a 
deplorable state of the submarine fleet? 
  [Khraptovich] According to his colleagues, he was a pretty 
good ship and task force commander. But as soon as he became 
commander of the Northern Fleet, it was as if someone had taken 
his place. Therefore, I would not begin to assert that the 
entire problem is in the system--it, they say, pulverized and 
subordinated anything to itself. Much also depends on the 
person. For example, such admirals as G. Yegorov, N. Amelko, R. 
Golosov, and E. Baltin did not forgo their conscience, trying to 
do all that was dependent upon them, even during those years. 
  I had occasion to run into Admiral Chernavin face to face, 
including in the office of the USSR minister of defense. This 
was in 1988, when a series of serious accidents had forced 
Gorbachev to question the status of the Navy. But the commander 
in chief, more concerned about his personal situation, 
completely denied that there were any shortcomings in his 
department and convinced Marshal Yazov that everything was in 
order in the Navy. 
  But you see, the ones who criticize Chernavin himself and 
talk about the condition of the Navy are the professional 
submariners. And they only want to create a special commission 
made up of independent experts to finally tell the truth about 
our naval forces. Do we need security or the illusion of it? 
Only uninformed citizens of our own country can be deceived by 
myths. The potential "adversary," like our own seamen, know 
everything. 
  Okay, we will wait until the next Tsushima incident... 
  From the editor. To be honest, we did not at all plan 
to open up a naval debate on the pages of our magazine. But the 
point is that it is impossible for people independent of the 
military-industrial lobby to express themselves on the pages of 
"their" military journals and newspapers. Moreover, as it seems 
to us, this is not so much a military problem as it is a problem 
of security of the society and the state.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel General Vladimir Churanov, chief of </F>
the rear services of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, 
by Petr Altunin on behalf of the readers of KRASNAYA ZVEZDA: 
"Problems Arise Every Day"] 
  [Text] The rear services 
play a paramount role in ensuring the vital activities of the 
troops and forces of the navy. This is understandable, for a 
soldier must be provided with shoes and clothing and given a 
full meal three times a day and tanks and aircraft will not move 
without fuel.... And it is not surprising that the lion's share 
of letters to the editor's office involve questions of rear 
services and the everyday needs of service personnel. After 
grouping the most important of them, we asked Col. Gen. Vladimir 
Churanov to respond to them. 
  [Altunin] Vladimir Timofeyevich, about a year ago the 
newspapers were writing about some changes in the rear services 
of the armed forces. What has been done? 
  [Churanov] Reforms are under way in accordance with the plan 
and stages of the development of the armed forces. But I want to 
emphasize that reforms in the rear are not a goal in themselves 
and especially are not aimed at demolishing the things of value 
that have been created--I am not afraid to say it--from the days 
to Peter to our own time. 
  In the course of the year experiment in converting to a 
territorial system in support of the troops that is being 
carried out in the Moscow Military District, we were once again 
convinced of its prospects. Consideration of the special 
features of the stationing of troops and the economic 
possibilities of the region make it possible to optimize 
administrative-economic, transportation, information, and other 
ties. And accordingly, under the conditions of the 
decentralization of the supply process on the scale of the 
country, we will be able, in the first place, not "to lose" 
stability and autonomy in the support of the troops and, 
secondly, to organize and strengthen interaction with local 
authorities and, the main thing, with suppliers. In any case, we 
will be able to buy perishable food products and seasonable 
produce at relatively low prices, which is especially important 
at this time. 
  As in any innovation, there are difficulties here. I would 
say that there is still much that needs to be smoothed out and 
made more logical. For this reason, we are expanding the base of 
the experiment and planning to carry it out in other regions of 
Russia this year. 
  Recently, as a member of a commission under the leadership 
of 
the minister of defense, I had the occasion to work in 
Kaliningrad Special Defense Area. Under the conditions of its 
remoteness, precisely the territorial principle was made the 
basis of the material support of the troops and forces of the 
navy. 
  Still another problem that one must pay attention to is the 
financing of the needs of the rear. In 1993, only 56 percent of 
these needs were met. Of course in the end they got by but at 
what a price! The reduction of the consumption of fuel and the 
extension of the time for the wearing of items of clothing went, 
as they say, to the extreme limits allowed. The only thing that 
they did not cut back was the food for the soldiers. One cannot 
save on this. 
  In closely analyzing the existing system for the financing 
of 
the needs of the rear from the center to the military unit, we 
come to the conclusion that it must be changed. After all, we 
have such rigid expenditure items--food, clothing, material 
supplies, and fuel--essentially not subject to adjustment that 
the money for these needs ought not to be in some common pot 
somewhere but rather must come to us in special allocations. We 
do not yet have this. 
  [Altunin] Our mail includes many letters from aviators. 
Planned flights were continually being disrupted because of a 
shortage of kerosene and various lubricating oils. What will 
happen this year? 
  [Churanov] I have already touched on this question. It may 
be 
that they feel the shortage of fuel more acutely in aviation 
than elsewhere but unfortunately the picture is similar in other 
branches of the armed forces as well--in the navy, for example. 
Again, we are seeing the effects of our direct dependence upon 
the situation in the country's fuel and energy system. Judging 
by everything, this situation will not change this year either. 
  What should be done here? There is just one answer, save 
wherever we can. We are also seeking other ways. We will soon 
begin to produce some kinds of oils and lubricants independently 
using our own capacities. A scientific research institute of the 
Ministry of Defense and industry are carrying out work to select 
critical oils. 
  [Altunin] "In the enlisted mess, they often serve canned 
products instead of fresh meat and there is a shortage of other 
items. What is the explanation for this?" write our readers, 
soldiers in compulsory service in the Siberian Military District. 
  [Churanov] That is a very important question and I would say 
that it is fundamental for us. After all, the food for the 
personnel largely determines not only the physical but also the 
psychological state of the soldiers. The main task here remains 
the same: The soldier's table must have a full complement of 
products corresponding to the established norms. 
  What is the reason for this situation? Unfortunately, it 
lies 
in the country's reduced food potential. Last year the cost of 
the daily ration for the military as a whole increased from 140 
to 1,200 rubles [R] and, as I have already said, the financing 
is limited. In the first three months of the year, we received 
less than half of the money needed for the purchase of food. We 
are borrowing with incredible assurances. We must recognize that 
our past reserves are still helping us out. We eat them and then 
we replenish them. 
  The high duties recently introduced on the importation of 
foodstuffs have practically not affected us so far (imports are 
insignificant for us) but if they go into effect and extend to 
the countries of the near abroad, then we will doubtless feel 
their pressure, especially in the procurement period. 
  The overwhelming majority of specialists in the food service 
are persistently assimilating market mechanisms and are striving 
to buy products more cheaply and to expand and diversify the 
assortment of dishes being prepared. Much is being done in this 
direction in the garrisons of Moscow, Siberian, Leningrad, and 
other military districts, where the preparation of two second 
dishes has already become the norm at enlisted mess halls. 
  But it is not so everywhere. Checks are revealing cases of 
pilferage of products from warehouses and instances where the 
norm does not reach the individual soldier as it should. 
Decisive measures are being taken in such cases, even to the 
point of prosecuting those who are guilty. 
  [Altunin] And this is from a letter by reserve officers who 
formerly worked in the rear services: "We see on television that 
agricultural equipment has broken down at many farms and is not 
prepared for the sowing season. What is happening at our 
military sovkhozes?" 
  [Churanov] There can be only one answer to this question: 
Under difficult economic conditions, military sovkhozes and the 
subsidiary plots of military units act to some extent as the 
guarantor of stable production of agricultural output for the 
needs of the army and navy. 
  Overall, things are getting better for them. As of 1 March, 
70 percent of the tractors had been repaired for the spring 
sowing, most other farm equipment had been made ready for the 
sowing campaign, and the necessary quantity of seed material had 
been procured.... 
  [Altunin] "New uniform. We in our unit see it primarily on 
television and in the newspapers. When will it be issued to us?" 
asks Warrant Officer [praporshchik] S. Gusev (Ural Military 
District). 
  [Churanov] In accordance with the previously affirmed plan, 
the full conversion of the service personnel of the Armed Forces 
of the Russian Federation to the new uniform is taking place in 
stages and is supposed to be concluded by the end of 1995. But 
those same disruptions in the financing of the rear services may 
also put into doubt the reality of this deadline. Thus, only a 
little more than half of the money needed for procurement of the 
new military clothing was allocated in 1993. 
  Enterprises of light industry that have traditionally worked 
for us are in a critical situation. Because of our nonpayment, 
their inventories are piling up, they stand idle, they are 
failing to pay wages to workers, and some of them are closing. 
  Of course, the clothing service is not idle and all possible 
measures are being taken to correct the situation. In our 
reciprocal accounts, we are forced to select the most necessary 
items: striped undershirts, camouflage, new model shoes, and the 
like, without which the service simply cannot function today, 
and to "borrow" sheets and pillowcases, for example, from our 
warehouses. First of all, as provided for by order of the 
minister of defense, we are now supplying service personnel in 
the Moscow and St. Petersburg garrisons, graduates of military 
schools and academies, soldiers at garrisons where staffs of 
military districts and fleets are located, and other military 
units taking into account the peculiarities and specific nature 
of their military service. 
  [Altunin] "It was reported in the newspapers that in 
military 
trade, as a check revealed, there are many serious shortcomings 
of various kinds. What specifically is happening there? What 
measures are being taken?" This is the question of Captain S. 
Bogachev from St. Petersburg. 
  [Churanov] Yes, recently there have indeed been less than 
flattering articles in the press about the work of military 
trade but from them one cannot draw the conclusion that there is 
nothing but crime there. After all, military trade is not just 
stores and warehouses. Its system includes more than 18,000 
enterprises of various kinds located throughout the territory of 
Russia and beyond its borders and, finally, about 100,000 
employees, the overwhelming majority of whom are working 
conscientiously despite the difficulties that are worsening 
every day--a shortage of working capital and rising prices. 
  And as a result, the commodity turnover last year amounted 
to 
more than R600 billion, seven times what it was the previous 
year. Military trade contributed about R25 billion to the state 
budget. 
  Overall, the agencies of military trade and its system are 
continuing to improve. The organizational staff structure is 
changing, parallel links and superfluous administrative agencies 
are being eliminated, wholesale-retail associations are being 
established, and domestic trade enterprises are being included 
in the territorial system of rear services. 
  A new normative-legal base is being developed, with the 
adoption of which, in particular the "Statute on Military 
Trade," it will be possible to eliminate contraditions with 
existing legislation and to fulfill the corresponding statutes 
of the Law of the Russian Federation "On the Status of Service 
Personnel." 
  I do not deny that the leadership of the rear services as 
well as local people have a lot of grievances against the work 
of military trade. And it is no secret that there are also 
people there with dirty hands and there is cheating and 
miscounting. Complaints about this are not ignored. 
  The miscalculations made in 1991-92 continue to be 
eliminated, especially in external trade. Contracts made with 
insolvent firms by former managers of military trade at 
different levels are being canceled and the invested money is 
being returned to the account of the Main Trade Directorate of 
the Ministry of Defense. Criminal suits have been brought 
against liable persons who permitted unjustifiable trade deals.

<F P=106> [Article by Major General Vyacheslav Omelchenko, current </F>
member of the Academy for Transport and chief of the Military 
Transport Institute, under "Interests of Russia" rubric: "A Knot 
of Transport Problems: Will the State Program Untie It?"] 
  [Text] On 8 February, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA published the 
article by Col. Yu. Kirsanov, "New Routes, Old Problems," that 
touched on the problem of the combining of defense and transport 
strategies. It evoked a vigorous response from specialists. 
Today we continue the conversation. 
  Now that our economy is being reformed and the armed forces 
are being structurally reorganized and cut back, it is very 
important not to permit a lowering of the country's defensive 
potential. How can this be accomplished? Back in the middle of 
the last century, military minister I. Mordvinov expressed the 
idea that if necessary the army can be reduced without harm if 
in so doing transport is used for the rapid movement of troops 
to the "threatened borders" of the Russian state. 
  In our time as well, transport communications fulfill not 
only economic functions but also military-strategic functions. 
It is for this reason, in my view, that the program "Transport 
Russia" now being developed is so important. The developers 
performed an in-depth analysis of the actual state of the 
country's transportation network. Here, for example, is what 
railroad transportation looks like, which accounts for 52 
percent of conveyances. The overall length of our railroads is 
less than one-fourth that of those in the United States and the 
density of the network is one-seventh of what they have. But the 
freight traffic is almost 10 times that of the United States. 
  The traffic on the West Siberian, South Urals, East 
Siberian, 
and Transbaikal railroads is especially intense. In the European 
part, major changes in the directions of freight flows may arise 
in the direction center-south. Of the four main lines that serve 
it, three cross the territory of Ukraine in their southern part. 
For this reason, the concentration of freight flows may shift in 
the direction of Moscow-Michurinsk-Liski-Rostov. This will 
require much work to increase the throughput and carrying 
capacity of this line or to establish a new main line with a 
terminal in Mineralnyye Vody. In the direction Kuznetsk 
Basin-Urals, freight is moved along the Main, Middle, and 
Southern Siberian routes. The last two mostly cross the 
territory of Kazakhstan. There there can be a shift in freight 
flows toward the Main Siberian Route. And this will also require 
additional strengthening. 
  The high intensity of traffic leads to early deterioration 
of 
the railroads. In 1992, speed was limited on 12,000 km of 
railroads. This is equivalent to a railroad like the Moscow 
Railroad working at half capacity. The situation may worsen. 
More than 18 percent of the cross ties and a significant part of 
the rails have finished their service life. Their share is 
especially high on the main lines that were built long ago. For 
example, 21 percent of the accidents and malfunctions registered 
on all railroads can be attributed to the October Railroad, the 
first railroad in Russia, which accounts for 12 percent of the 
total length of the country's steel lines. 
  One must also consider the factor that Russian railroads 
have 
tens of thousands of bridges, tunnels, and other artificial 
structures with a total length of 2,262.6 km. About 10 percent 
of them have defects but are in use. There is traffic across 
bridges built under the standards of 1884-1896, which have been 
in service for a time that is twice the norm. A further 
strengthening of the spans of such bridges is no longer 
possible. They must be replaced with new bridges. But this is an 
extraordinarily complex and costly measure, especially when it 
is a matter of bridges across such rivers as the Volga, Don, 
Oka, Kama, Ob, Yenisey, Zeya, and Amur. Last year the number of 
prolonged restrictions of speed doubled because of the 
unsatisfactory state of artificial structures. 
  And there are many such slow-acting "mines" on the 
railroads. 
They include, for example, the defective road beds in the 
eastern areas of Russia in connection with a warming of the 
climate. On the Transbaikal Railroad alone, 75 percent of the 
earthen base of the road was laid on permafrost. As a result of 
the constantly increasing number of deformations, expenditures 
for the repair of the railroad have now increased by a factor of 
almost seven. If measures are not taken, the Transbaikal 
Railroad may become impassable. Overall for all kinds of 
transport, the depletion of production capital amounts to 38 
percent. 
  This is by no means a complete listing of the problems with 
our transport. But it indicates rather clearly that under these 
conditions it is very difficult for transport to satisfy the 
needs of the armed forces with respect to military conveyances. 
There is a widespread opinion that in the existing situation the 
mobility of units and combined units may be increased by taking 
the course of the priority development of military transport 
aviation. But one should not exaggerate the possibilities of 
this aviation, for above all it must provide for the landing of 
assault forces, accomplish the most urgent troop maneuvers, 
deliver weapons and other freight, and evacuate the wounded. 
  The share of railroad transport in military conveyances 
remains high. Under today's conditions as well, it is seen as 
one of the most important forms of transportation that is most 
suitable and convenient for large-scale movements of troops and 
cargo, especially when it is a matter of heavy and bulky weapons 
and equipment. There are also other advantages inherent only in 
rail transport: For example, the rapid rehabilitation of the 
roads, the low degree of dependence on weather conditions, and 
the preservation of the relative integrity and accordingly 
combat capability of units and subunits during the time of their 
transport by rail. All of this puts rail transport into first 
place in military transport movements. Naturally this does not 
diminish the role of other kinds of transport in the realization 
of the requirements of military doctrine. All of these problems 
are now the focus of attention of the scientists of the Military 
Transport Institute, who in their research work closely with 
other higher institutes of transport learning in the country. 
  In this respect, what prospects flow from the program 
"Transport Russia"? It is intended to overcome crisis phenomena 
and to guarantee steady work for the railroads in 1994-1997 and 
to achieve a world level of transport by 2005. Overall, the 
program shows the prospects for the formation of a transport 
network and the coordinated development of every kind of 
transport and the management of the transportation system. The 
subprograms "Transport Space" and "Transport Technology" 
constructed under the branch principle also make it possible to 
forecast the military strategic possibilities of new and rebuilt 
main lines and from this position to put demands on the 
established transport network and produced industrial goods. 
Unfortunately, however, overall defensive functions are not 
purposefully incorporated into the program. 
  It is forecast that by 1997 the volume of freight moved in 
the trailroad network will decrease by 25 percent and no 
increase in its density is foreseen before about 2000. On the 
contrary, it is planned to write off up to 20,000 km of lines 
that have completed their service life. It appears that under 
these conditions the question of the elimination of unprofitable 
sections, leading to a reduction of the length of railroads, 
must be coordinated with the country's military leadership. A 
similar precedent arose in the United States at the beginning of 
the 1980's. When there were plans there for the closing and 
dismantling of several railroad lines, the leadership of the 
armed forces came out against this and took control of the 
network of the militarily most important railroads, proving 
their strategic necessity. 
  There is still another problem. It is proposed beginning in 
2000 to carry out preparatory work in the building of high-speed 
railroad lines. In world practice, this concept is realized 
through the reconstruction of existing lines (this is basically 
the course taken by the United States and other countries with a 
dense network of railroads) or through new construction. My 
opinion is that for defensive purposes it is expedient for us to 
take the second course. 
  And now about the economic-mathematic model for the 
functioning of our transport. It was worked out with an 
orientation toward the transportation system of the United 
States and forces a redistribution of investments in favor of an 
increase in conveyances by motor vehicles, which does not take 
into account our special circumstances in Russia. The model also 
does not consider expenditures for the realization of defense 
demands on transport. 
  The primary reason for the indicated shortcomings is the 
fact 
that the developers of the program "Transport Russia," having 
taken the initiative in such an important matter, did not 
involve specialists in military transport services in this joint 
work, above all the service for military transport 
communications that ensures the representation of the Armed 
Forces of the Russian Federation in rail, sea, river, and air 
transport and that is empowered to raise military-technical 
demands on the development of these kinds of transportation. In 
our opinion, the existing draft of the program requires detailed 
study by military specialists together with interested transport 
agencies. Only after this can it be presented to the government 
for consideration. 
  In the development of the defense aspect of the program, one 
certainly cannot discard such a purely Russian peculiarity of 
ours in which troops actively participate in the resolution of 
national economic tasks. Every year motor vehicle units carry 
out large volumes of agricultural conveyances and road building 
units work intensively to build roads in the Nonchernozem lands. 
The railroad troops are performing an especially large volume of 
work. Despite being at less than full strength and despite 
interruptions in financing and supply, they are continuing to 
build and reconstruct railroad lines of different purposes. In 
so doing, naturally, the troops are primarily being involved in 
the building of transport facilities of paramount significance 
for defense. The troops also play a major role in the 
elimination of the consequences of accidents and disasters. That 
is, the entire military transport structure is being fully 
loaded with work and in peacetime, accordingly, it is a great 
omission to fail to consider the role of the military in the 
country's transportation strategy. 
  It may be that it even makes sense to include an independent 
subprogram in the comprehensive program "Transport Russia." We 
will conditionally call it "Military Transport" and it would 
reflect defense requirements and ways to carry them out.

<F P=106> [Interview with Fund for the Social Protection of Servicemen </F>
President Reserve Major Erast Aleksandrovich Galumov by an 
unidentified KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent: "Our Principle--An 
Equal Partnership: Fund for the Social Protection of 
Servicemen"] 
  [Text] There are currently many funds for the social 
protection of servicemen. Yes and not all of them are of any 
real benefit; many have given way to commerce... 
  But concern about military people essentially forms the 
basis of the development and consolidation as a market structure 
of the fund that is located in the capital's Smolenskaya-Sennaya 
Ploshchad [Square]. But then again, the Fund for the Social 
Protection of Servicemen President Reserve Major Erast 
Aleksandrovich Galumov will discuss this in more detail. 
  Erast Aleksandrovich Galumov is a reserve major who was 
born in 1958. He is a Tbilisi native. He graduated from Tbilisi 
Higher Artillery Command School in 1979. He served in 
TransBaykal and was released into the reserve due to reductions 
in 1990. He is a businessman. 
  [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] Erast Aleksandrovich, the ritual question 
is: Is the fund--also a technique for earning money? 
  [Galumov] That is not the main thing. You can earn--more and 
more rapidly--by not founding a fund for social protection. 
Moreover, the fund's founders do not have that urgent need--all 
of them are successful businessmen. 
  Something else is essential. An enormous group of highly 
qualified, disciplined, experienced people are leaving the 
army's ranks. Some do not know where to go in the civilian 
sector, others want to start their own businesses but do not 
have start-up capital, and still others need organizational and 
legal assistance... They can find all of that at our fund. 
  Recently, several junior officers, who will be released into 
the reserve in the near future, visited my office. They have a 
productive idea that permits them to develop a quite profitable 
business but they have neither the money nor the experience of 
"going into business". We are subsidizing them and we are 
carrying out, speaking military language, organizational and 
legal support at no charge, without requiring any dividends 
whatsoever... 
  [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] Altruism? Is there a place for that in our 
market? 
  [Galumov] The issue is not altruism. We know that an 
enterprise that the fund can help to stand on its feet will 
certainly begin to cooperate with it. This is not our first day 
in the market and we have at our disposal commercial experience, 
a data bank, ties in the world of finance (we are co-founders of 
the Moscow City Bank), and a network of partners throughout the 
country... And therefore, as partners, very promising. 
  [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] What are the primary directions of the 
fund's activities? 
  [Galumov] They are varied. There is a broad spectrum of 
legal 
services. We are engaged in job placement. During the past year, 
we helped people find work--in accordance with the skills and 
requests of the very people who have been released into the 
reserve--approximately 2,000 people. And the data base continues 
to be augmented by enterprises' requests for reserve officers 
whose cadre value is already universally recognized in our labor 
market. 
  Investments occupy a large place in our plans. The 
preference 
is for regional investment programs. For example, right now we 
are developing an investment program at a defense plant jointly 
with the Russian Academy of Sciences. Incidentally, the regional 
direction of our investment programs helps us to create locally, 
figuratively speaking, "cadre subunits" that can immediately be 
deployed and ensure rapid realization of larger programs in the 
regions if necessary. 
  We are aggressively participating in purely scientific 
projects. And major scientific institutions willingly cooperate 
with us. Because we are uniting people who have gone through the 
army school--those who, due to their professionalism, discipline 
and ability to work under the most complex conditions, are worth 
so much right now. 
  [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] But what socially oriented programs have 
you already managed to carry out and what's in the plans? 
  [Galumov] In our view, philanthropy must have a precise 
address. For example, we assumed responsibility for distinctive 
pension support for some veterans of war and disabled people who 
have lost the ability to work. We pay 50,000-500,000 rubles per 
month in addition to the state pension of each one depending on 
the specific situation. For the time being, we are allocating R5 
million per month for this purpose. We recently conducted a 
discharge sale at military hospitals at reduced prices. (We sold 
goods at prices that were much lower than the purchase prices)... 
  What's in the plans? Let's put it this way: Let our 
philanthropic acts become pleasant surprises for everyone. 
  [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] Erast Aleksandrovich, just how active in 
the sphere of entrepreneurship are those reserve officers whom 
you have helped? 
  [Galumov] They are active and this equally applies to Great 
Patriotic War veterans' social organizations and to junior 
"reservists". For example, branches of the fund in Vladivostok, 
Khabarovsk, Chita, Bratsk, and Novosibirsk, that are led by 
recent cadre officers, are operating with a high return and more 
than 20 major commercial programs are in the stage of 
realization today. 
  And, in general, I must tell you that our fund acts, and 
let's hope, will act henceforth as a center of gravity for 
former servicemen. We are our own people: Until recently we ate 
from the same pot, we lived according to the same regulations 
and according to the same code. We are loyal to it even today, 
officer's honor. So we understand and trust each other. And 
perhaps there is no other path--we need to jointly, shoulder to 
shoulder, resolve all problems. Moreover, how many former 
military personnel (currently entrepreneurs, frankly speaking), 
are flailing around in our market, not knowing where to find a 
place for themselves and becoming easy targets for any criminal. 
We need to unite; we will be stronger and more confident. This 
will be required; for the purpose of this unification, the fund 
is prepared to offer in principle an equal partnership for 
everything at its disposal: information support, the accumulated 
experience of entrepreneurship, ties, and resources... 
  The address of the Fund for the Social Protection of 
Servicemen is: Building 6, No 30, Smolenskaya-Sennaya Ploshchad, 
Moscow. Contact telephone -- 241-21-71.

<F P=106> [Article by Petr Altunin: "While the Future of the </F>
Countryside is Being Debated, 100 Military Sovkhozes are 
Planting Grain"] 
  [Text] Passions are boiling on parliamentary podiums and in 
the press: What road is our agriculture to travel? The one thing 
that's clear now is that the reforms carried out in this area 
have not produced results. In comparison with 1992, in 1993 the 
area devoted to cereal crops "slimmed" by 4 percent, that 
devoted to potatoes decreased by 17 percent, and that for 
vegetables decreased by 21 percent. Experts predict that this 
year there will be not more that 85-90 million tons in the 
granaries, which is significantly less that in recent years. The 
numbers of farm animals and birds declined dramatically due to 
the shortage of feed. 
  How in this situation is food being supplied to the armed 
forces? To put it briefly, the servicemen are receiving their 
full allotment. The fact that the structure of the food 
assortment often changes, with some products being replaced by 
others, is another matter. 
  "Commanders and rear services have to display maximum 
shrewdness to buy cheaper in one place and to ask for credit yet 
another time in some other place, thus balancing the food 
situation," said Lieutenant-General Vyacheslav Savinov, chief of 
the Central Food Directorate of the Russian Federation Ministry 
of Defense. "It is becoming increasingly more evident today that 
the military budget is not going to grow any in the immediate 
future. This means we have to count on our own strengths to a 
considerable degree. What strengths are these? You can't send 
soldiers out into the fields--there aren't enough of them for 
the combat subunits. Our hopes lie with the military sovkhozes. 
They must become one of the guaranteed sources of food support 
to the army and navy." 
  What is their position today? The army's is favorable on the 
whole. Today, its pennants fly over as many as 100 
sovkhozes--more than the 67 that survived the USSR's 
disintegration, and there are another dozen waiting in the 
wings. What is attracting them to the army? Order. Given the 
imperfect legislation and the continuing verbal battles "at the 
top" on the fate of the kolkhoz peasantry, villages and towns 
suffering the effects of privatization are floating downstream 
with no idea of how to get to shore. 
  In the meantime, rural laborers believe that the army could 
help with equipment and fuel, set up social, cultural and 
personal services, and take food products in trade. This is the 
way new sovkhozes came to the Moscow Military District and to 
the missile and aerospace forces. And the Northern Fleet, which 
possesses four livestock sovkhozes that had recently been 
feeling an acute shortage of feed, stretched its arm all the way 
out to Volgograd Oblast and took in eight steppe sovkhozes and 
one in Kursk Oblast (that one, by the way, even has its own 
name--Krasnaya Zvezda) under its flag of St. Andrew. 
  The defense ministry also concerned itself with the legal 
basis. By a government decision, military sovkhozes were 
proclaimed to be federal property, and not subject to 
privatization. This year in addition to other farms of the 
country, they are being granted preferential loans. 
  There is of course a limiting factor affecting the desire to 
take as many farms as possible under the wing of the armed 
forces--money. During recent zonal conferences of directors of 
army agricultural enterprises organized by the armed forces rear 
services, the idea circulated that rather than focusing on the 
quantity of sovkhozes, we need to transform the presently 
existing farms into highly profitable ones. 
  What needs to be done for this today? The most practical 
problems, which have generally been around forever, have be to 
solved. Ones like scientifically substantiated crop rotation, 
sensible fertilization of the soil, rational selection of plants 
and animals, protection of the harvest from pests, and so on. 
For this, we need to awaken the sense of ownership in each 
person, teach him to keep track of every ruble spent and of the 
return enjoyed from it, and provide good wages. It is precisely 
because of this approach to the work that good results are being 
enjoyed at the Yubileynyy, Novaya Lyada and Podlesnyy farms 
(Moscow Military District) where, for example, last year's 
potato harvest was 108, 140 and 107 centners per hectare. And 
Military Sovkhoz No 14 is regularly producing 4.71 kg of milk 
from every forage-fed cow. 
  Auxiliary farms contribute strong support to the 
"foundation" 
of military sovkhozes. Last year they produced 8,000 tonnes of 
meat, 8,500 tonnes of milk, 9.6 million eggs, and over 22,000 
tons of potatoes and vegetables. There are even units able to 
provide meat and other food products for themselves half a year 
or more into the future--for example those commanded by 
Lieutenant Colonels Aleksandr Makarov and Aleksandr Babarykin 
and Lieutenant Colonel Leonid Vaskin. 
  Recently, of course, an alarming trend has appeared: Some 
auxiliary farms have started surrendering. There are objective 
reasons for this: The army is undergoing reorganization, 
personnel strength is decreasing, and then there's that same old 
problem--feed. The military sovkhozes could provide considerable 
assistance to their "lesser brothers." This is already being 
done in many of the districts. 
  And of course, you can't get anything done without order and 
executive discipline. Another obstacle today is the "outside 
criminal"--racketeers are making their way into the military 
sovkhozes: Brandishing weapons, in Saratov Oblast they meet 
loaded vehicles demanding tribute, and Chechens are raiding 
pastures of Prokhladnyy Sovkhoz (Kabardino-Balkaria), where they 
hogtie the herdsmen and rustle the livestock. One would think 
that the army could come to the aid of its breadwinners. 
  One hundred military sovkhozes, plus 34 special dairies, and 
3,456 auxiliary farms. They work 370,000 hectares of farmland, 
and maintain 98,000 head of cattle, 200,000 pigs, 137,000 sheep 
and 864,000 birds. 
  It this a little, or a lot? The food products that have been 
produced are enough to supply the armed forces for 2.1 months 
with meat, 4 months with eggs, 2 months with potatoes and 
vegetables, and an entire year with milk. If these indicators 
are increased by 1.5-2 times in the immediate future, this will 
certainly be impressive support additional to the food supplied 
to the armed forces on the basis of state orders. 
  Spring is at its peak, and it was late this year at that. 
This is why the schedule of field work is extremely tight. Every 
day, every hour of daylight is precious to us. Laborers of the 
military agricultural enterprises all understand this well. 
There is the immutable truth, after all, that a year's supply of 
food hinges on a single spring day.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Maryukha and Grigoriy Nesmyanovich: </F>
"Black Sea Fleet True to the Oath Once Taken: That Is What the 
Military Council of the Black Sea Fleet Said About Its Position 
on the Incident in Odessa"] 
  [Text] "The unpunished actions of the Ukrainian special 
forces in Odessa took place with the connivance of the Ukrainian 
Naval Forces under Vice-Admiral Bezkorovaynyy," according to a 
statement of the military council of the Black Sea Fleet to the 
presidents of Russia and Ukraine. But Chairman of the State Duma 
Ivan Rybkin is certain that forces striving to disrupt the 
pending meeting of the heads of state of the CIS were interested 
in this incident. Russia, in turn, is therefore striving to 
minimize the political aspect of the actions of the Ukrainian 
special forces. 
  But such a striving cannot be seen on the Ukrainian side. On 
the contrary, the commanding officer of the forces of Odessa 
Military District has already assigned a new commander, Capt. 
1st Rank V. Marchenko, to the division that has been renamed 1st 
Brigade of ships for the protection of the water area. Ukrainian 
press services are disseminating statements to the effect that 
the former commander of the division, Capt. 1st Rank Oleg 
Feoktistov, has been hospitalized with the diagnosis of "acute 
alcoholic poisoning" and not a word about the handcuffs that 
apparently also "poisoned" the Russian officer. There is also no 
mention of the fact that the Russian seamen were given an 
ultimatum: either swear allegiance to Ukraine or be expelled 
beyond the boundaries of the republic. According to available 
information, only two officers of the division agreed to change 
flags. 
  One really ought to have forgotten this incident for the 
sake 
of peace and agreement between the two neighboring Slavic 
states. But one should have looked into the causes and sought to 
find the guilty parties. The Ukrainian side is resisting this, 
however. The authorities in Kiev forced Adm. Feliks Gromov, 
commander in chief of the Naval Forces of the Russian 
Federation, to change the originally planned route of his trip 
to settle the conflict, forbidding him to visit Odessa. 
Yesterday the commander in chief and the special ambassador 
Yuriy Dubinin arrived in Sevastopol to discuss the situation 
with Adm. Eduard Baltin, commanding officer of the Black Sea 
Fleet. 
  There is still more alarming information from the south of 
Ukraine. Sources close to the staff of the Ukrainian Naval 
Forces report that an action similar to the one is Odessa is 
being prepared in Izmail with respect to a brigade of river 
vessels, the personnel of which have declared a resolute protest 
in connection with the provocation in Odessa. The special forces 
of the Bolgrad Airborne Brigade that "distinguished themselves" 
in the assault of the division of ships mothballed in Odessa 
have already been put in a state of combat readiness....

Combat Operations: the Seamen of the Black Sea Fleet Warn: `The 
Ukrainian Side Will Lose, Although There Will Be No Victors'"] 
  [Text] The situation developing with respect to the Black 
Sea Fleet was more and more reminiscent of an undeclared war 
last week. Ukrainian fighters patrolling the skies over 
Sevastopol with their full combat load. Attempts to pursue and 
seize the hydrographic ship "Cheleken" that were like a scene 
from a pirate adventure novel. And the prohibition by the 
Ukrainian Ministry of Defense against ships of the Black Sea 
Fleet entering the ports of Odessa, Kherson, Nikolayev, and 
Izmail out of fear that a "Russian landing force" would come 
ashore there.... 
  Early morning. With the first rays of the sun rising over 
Sevastopol, the guard ships "Ladnyy" and "Pytlivyy" raise anchor 
and go to sea. They will execute a routine training mission to 
search for and "destroy" a submarine of a hypothetical enemy. 
But on the ships, as usual, is a full load of munitions that are 
by no means for training. 
  In response to the question of whether there is a chance 
that 
in the course of the exercises the "Ladnyy" and "Pytlivyy" might 
encounter ships of the Ukrainian Naval Forces, we were given the 
answer: "In principle there is; they do not tell us about their 
plans. The command ship `Slavutich' of the Ukrainian Naval 
Forces may be somewhere around here right now. If we do 
encounter it, then nothing will really happen, for we are 
civilized people. Although it will all depend upon the actions 
of the Ukrainian side. Recently, during the performance of a 
training mission to destroy air targets, a fighter of the 
Ukrainian Air Defense Forces constantly circled over the 
`Pytlivyy.' It left for its base only after the air defense 
system of the guard ship fired missiles at training targets. In 
general, the pilot could not fail to understand that such games 
do not lead to anything good." 
  Something else that happened in Odessa could have ended 
badly. The seizure of subunits of the Black Sea Fleet by 
Ukrainian military formations evoked an extremely painful 
reaction in the Fleet. At a meeting of officers of the Black Sea 
Fleet in Sevastopol, warship commanders did not hide the fact 
that in the event of new provocations they are prepared to carry 
out any order of the Fleet commander, including the use of 
combat weapons against ships of the Ukrainian Naval Forces. At 
the same time, the position of Ukraine itself does nothing to 
lessen tension. "There was no incident in Odessa," Vice-Adm. 
Vladimir Bezkorovaynyy, commanding officer of the Ukrainian 
Naval Forces, continues to insist. "There was a gross violation 
of the constitution and laws of Ukraine by individual officials 
of the Black Sea Fleet." The actions of the Ukrainian side 
correspond to these assessments. The situation remains tense in 
Izmail, where a brigade of river craft of the Black Sea Fleet is 
stationed. Ukraine is still trying unilaterally to subordinate 
this part of the Fleet to itself, despite the fact that 
immediately after the events in Odessa officers from Izmail 
issued an official warning to the leadership of the Ukrainian 
Naval Forces that "if something similar is undertaken with 
respect to our unit and our family members, then we will act in 
accordance with the law and military regulations, even to the 
point of using weapons." 
  The recent bosom friends, who knew each other even in school 
and went to the Fleet together as green lieutenants, are 
beginning to see each other as enemies. They were separated by 
oaths. Most of them swore allegiance to the former Black Sea 
Fleet back in the time of the Soviet Union. A few have sworn a 
new oath of allegiance to Ukraine. "We will not go on board an 
enemy ship," declared Capt. 2nd Rank Aleksandr Petrov when it 
was proposed that he and other members of the Black Sea Fleet 
who refused to swear allegiance to Ukraine go on board the 
"Slavutich." The members of the Black Sea Fleet are even trying 
to do everything they can to send their sons, who because of 
their registration in Sevastopol are considered to be citizens 
of Ukraine and accordingly are supposed to serve in the 
Ukrainian Armed Forces, to serve in the Russian Army. 
  "Delay in the negotiations on the problem of the Black Sea 
Fleet may lead to the most unpredictable conflicts," the 
officers of the Black Sea Fleet warn officially. "This conflict 
(deliberately planned) is pushing us toward counteractions. At 
the same time, one should keep in mind that Ukraine will 
inevitably be the losing side." By the way, the sailors of the 
Black Sea Fleet themselves recognize that if, God forbid, they 
are unable to avoid such a conflict, then it will simply be 
ridiculous to speak of someone winning."

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Knyazkov and Vasiliy Fatigarov: "Skrunda: </F>
The Supersecret Facility of World Renown"; "Garrison Life"] 
  [Text] At one time the radar station located in the 
small Latvian post of Skrunda was considered a supersecret 
facility. Today, thanks to the ups and downs of Russian-Latvian 
negotiations, its renown is all but scandalous. But it has 
already been decided that the radar station will operate for 
another 4 years, and 18 months will be devoted to disassembly of 
the equipment. But behind the "technical aspect of the 
question," the high contracting sides have somehow entirely 
forgotten about the Skrunda garrison, the service members who to 
this day regularly go to work at the radar. 
  The unit commander, Lt-Col Aleksandr Nikitin, met us at the 
staff building. He looked exhausted. They night before a piece 
of equipment had gone down, and he had to rush all over the 
place so that everything would be normal by morning. You see, 
despite the political situation, the radar "garrison" continues 
to perform its assigned mission. Alert duty is pulled daily by 4 
crews on 12-hour shifts. 
  Before, serving at Skrunda was considered a privilege, 
mainly 
because of the comfortable geographic location of the garrison, 
the availability of housing, and convenient transportation to 
major cities. And topflight specialists served here. Even today 
practically 90 percent of personnel have an academic education. 
  Meanwhile, once at inter-government negotiations, seeking to 
"demilitarize" the facility, Latvia asked Russia to replace the 
military specialists who maintained the radar with civilian 
ones. But later Latvia was to learn that this proposal was 
unrealistic. Specialists of this type are trained only in 
military VUZ [military institutes of higher learning], but even 
after graduation it takes at least two years before a young 
officer is allowed on alert duty. Even then, as the unit 
commander explained, at first he has the skills only for a few 
operations. But specialists such as Lt-Cols Viktor Mikhaylov, 
Leonid Zhukov, Valentin Churkin, Pyotr Samorodov, and Majors 
Pyotr Palamarchuk and Viktor Dedoriv can tell even from the 
behavior of the apparatus where they should look for or even 
where they should expect a defect. They're the ones who keep it 
all going. 
  Incidentally, in the period of breakup of the Union, many 
specialists from the station went into the armies of the newly 
formed sovereign states, mainly Ukraine. Thus it turned out that 
the unit was manned by about 60-70 percent with men from that 
republic. This is explained quite easily by the fact that radar 
specialists were trained at Kharkov and Zhitomir. "Some of them 
didn't care for the Ukrainian Army, and tried to return," Lt-Col 
Aleksandr Nikitin recalled, "but the command figures that for 
these people there is no turning back." 
  Now only the most reliable remain to work at the facility. 
And besides alert duty, they still have to protect the military 
camp, an territory of 42 hectares. Even the wives and children 
of the officers have joined the ranks, so to speak. This was 
forced largely by the absence of replacements of compulsory 
service troops for two years. 
  We spoke with two nice women in military uniform, the 
Ryzhikovs, mother and daughter. The officer's wife, Larisa 
Sergeyevna, is a PFC, and works as an expediter at the 
communications center, while her daughter Larisa is a private 
and radio telegraph operator. They like the service. "We feel a 
real army kinship!" In addition, the unit command has tried not 
only to resolve problems involving the training of female 
specialists, but also to maximally settle day-to-day problems. 
We were told by the unit psychologist, Lt-Col Sergey Pakhomov, 
"There is a kindergarten, grade school, club, music school, and 
the children's Russian folk ensemble "Kuderyshki" operating in 
the garrison." 
  In each of the 10 residential buildings for officers, small, 
cozy food stores have opened their doors. A joint 
Russian-Latvian enterprise created on the basis of the military 
store provides the wares. But then, the freshest dairy products 
can also be purchased at the garrison KPP [traffic regulating 
point] from residents of local villages. 
  It is too bad that we did not manage to see our 
interlocutors 
at their combat posts. On orders from Moscow, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA 
journalists were not allowed near the operating radar 
"Dnestr-M." But we did visit the new one, the "Daryal." It is a 
sad sight, an abandoned, first-class military facility. It is 
hard to realize that life will not pulse after all in the heart 
of this mighty, nearly hundred-meter high building. And how much 
manpower and resources are still needed to disassemble it all! 
  "We missed our chance to come to an agreement on the fate of 
the radar" the officers escorting us said with one voice. "The 
decision about mothballing and disassembly should have been made 
in 1991-1992, when there were contract organizations and 
builders here." 
  Well, that's life. It remains only to repeat that the 
outmoded station "Dnestr-M" in Skrunda will keep working for 
another 4 years, and then the entire Commonwealth of Independent 
States, Russia included, will be without the means of detecting 
attacking missiles on this flank. It is possible to restore the 
former degree of protection only by spending new, enormous sums. 
But you know, it all might have been different if we had shown 
political far-sightedness back then.

Ministry of Defense of Ukraine: "The Problems of the Armed 
Forces -- The Unvarnished Truth Presented at the Meeting of the 
Chiefs of the Main Directorates of the Ministry of Defense with 
Journalists"] 
  [Text] Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata, chief of the 
General Staff of the Armed Forces and first deputy minister of 
defense of Ukraine, opened the meeting by stressing that the 
conversation would be frank. Indeed, there has long been a need 
for such a meeting of the chiefs of the leading directorates of 
the military establishment with the representatives of the 
country's mass media. Questions arise every day concerning some 
aspect or another of the activity of the Armed Forces. 
Unfortunately, lacking reliable information, journalists often 
publish reports on the military in newspapers or in radio and 
television broadcasts that are not completely accurate. 
  "And when we hear our work being judged unfairly, this 
upsets 
us and dampens our enthusiasm," stated Col. Gen. A. Lopata in 
his opening remarks. He then added: "We have invited you here so 
that we can give candid answers to any questions you may have; 
so that you are not forced to guess at things on your own. We 
want the people of Ukraine to have the true, unvarnished, but 
also undistorted facts about what is happening in our Ukrainian 
Army." 
  Let me begin by saying that the meeting was a success. But, 
judge for yourselves. 
  The first thing that interested the journalists was whether 
there were any problems this year with the conscription of 
youths into the Armed Forces of Ukraine. 
  The chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of 
Ukraine 
admitted that there were some problems: 
  "But you need to understand what is causing these problems. 
The current conscription pool in Ukraine is extremely large. 
More than 800,000 youths are eligible to be drafted into our 
army. But existing legislation, which provides for granting 
deferments from the draft to many categories of young people, 
leaves us with only 12 percent of the total figure. 
Unfortunately, this is not enough. 
  "This was what forced us to resort to an unauthorized 
measure--to review the decision of the Supreme Council that the 
term of service be one and one-half years and move to increase 
it to two years. We were compelled to take this step in order to 
maintain the combat readiness of the Armed Forces of Ukraine at 
the necessary level. That is why those conscripted in the spring 
of 1992 are only now being discharged into the reserves." 
  Col. Gen. Anatoliy Lopata then reminded those present of the 
directive issued by President Yuriy Meshkov of the Republic of 
Crimea demanding that the peninsula's youths be conscripted only 
into units that are stationed in the autonomous republic. The 
president of Ukraine issued a decree abolishing this directive 
as one that violates the laws of Ukraine. As a result, 
conscription in the Republic of Crimea is now proceeding in 
normal fashion and in accordance with Ukrainian laws. Crimeans 
will serve on the whole territory of Ukraine. 
  Maj. Gen. Valeriy Venher, chief of the Main Organizational 
and Mobilization Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed 
Forces of Ukraine, amplified on the answer of the chief of the 
General Staff: 
  "Currently, the draft is proceeding according to plan. So 
far, the plan has not been frustrated in any way. I expect that 
we shall fulfill the conscription plan. 
  "The process of discharging those who have completed their 
term of service into the reserves is also under way. By 3 May of 
this year, the last soldier drafted in the spring of 1992 will 
have been discharged from the Armed Forces." 
  The journalists addressed their next question to Col. Gen. 
Hryhoriy Mikhaylichenko, deputy minister of defense for rear 
services and chief of Rear Services of the Armed Forces of 
Ukraine: 
  "As we know, the former Kiev Military District included five 
military state farms, which helped to relieve the people of the 
problem of feeding the army. How do things stand today with the 
army's agricultural enterprises?" 
  Col. Gen. H. Mikhaylichenko: 
  "The Armed Forces, like the whole Ukrainian people, have 
many 
social problems. As things stood on 1 April, the Ministry of 
Defense had received from the government only 43 percent of the 
funds appropriated in the budget for the maintenance of military 
personnel. 
  "In spite of this, we are making every effort to ensure that 
military personnel are fed properly. Thus, officers, warrant 
officers, and reenlisted servicemen receive food rations. Term 
servicemen are also provided with standard rations. The 
military's state farms help to solve these problems in today's 
difficult circumstances. There are currently twenty farms that 
belong to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Actually, twenty-one, 
because a few days ago, a collective farm in the town of Brody 
in Lviv Oblast joined our ranks. Its members requested 
unanimously to be transferred under the jurisdiction of the 
Ministry of Defense. 
  "What percentage of goods do the military's state farms 
supply? They provide the army with enough meat for 70 days, milk 
for virtually the whole year (345 days), eggs for 122 days (at 
four eggs per week for each term serviceman), oil for 173 days, 
potatoes and vegetables for 22 days. Obviously, this 
significantly reduces the problem of providing the troops with 
food products. 
  "We are currently building an enterprise to process 
agricultural production in partnership with a foreign firm. This 
enterprise will fully process meat, leather, milk, and grain 
crops. This will significantly improve our ability to provision 
military personnel." 
  The chief of Rear Services of the Armed Forces of Ukraine 
assured the journalists attending the meeting and asked them to 
reassure the parents of military personnel, especially term 
servicemen, in their reports that no matter how difficult things 
may be, there will be no irregularities in the normal feeding, 
medical care, and material provisioning of personnel. 
  Volodymyr Chykalik, the military commentator of VECHIRNIY 
KYYIV, passed on to Col. Gen. H. Mikhaylichenko a question that 
had been addressed to his newspaper by the personnel of the 
missile cruiser Ukrayina, which is undergoing repairs in 
Mykolayiv: Why do Ukrainian sailors have to pay the Black Sea 
Fleet for their medical treatment? 
  Hryhoriy Mykolayovych was well informed about this problem: 
  "This matter will be settled. We will definitely reach an 
agreement with the command of the Black Sea Fleet. It is 
inconceivable that military personnel should have to pay for 
their medical care. By the way, our medical facilities provide 
Black Sea Fleet personnel with free medical treatment." 
  The next question posed by the journalists concerned the 
introduction of a new uniform. They wanted to know whether the 
deadline for switching to the new uniform, which had been set in 
a recent presidential decree, would be kept. 
  Col. Gen. H. Mikhaylichenko: 
  "The new military uniform for the Armed Forces of Ukraine 
has 
been designed and is being introduced. During the first half of 
this year, uniforms will be sewn for generals and the officer 
corps at military institutes and schools and for top personnel 
at the Ministry of Defense, the military districts, and the 
different corps. Uniforms for everybody else will be sewn in 
1995. 
  "The necessary cloth has already been issued to the 
districts 
and they have begun to implement the president's decree. But a 
shortage of funds has slowed this process. 
  "We have taken a number of steps to make the uniforms of 
military school cadets more attractive. These uniforms will be 
very similar to those worn by officers. In addition, on 1 
September, students will be issued camouflage uniforms. Term 
servicemen will wear laced army boots instead of high boots 
[kyrzovi], jackets of coat-quality cloth instead of greatcoats, 
and the uncomfortable parade-dress single-breasted jacket will 
be replaced by an elegant, youthful jacket. Funds are a problem, 
but we are getting things done. 
  "The uniforms are the subject of a great deal of talk. 
Especially, should there be fur caps or not, and why do generals 
need leather coats? It would be interesting to hear the opinion 
of the chief of rear services on this subject." 
  "The leather coats have been introduced as a representative 
item. They are not included in the standard issue. The generals 
order these coats at their own expense. In my opinion, it is a 
good thing for the minister of defense and other generals when 
they travel abroad to represent our country in such high-quality 
uniforms. This adds to Ukraine's prestige." 
  Col. Gen. Anatoliy Lopata noted that very many Ukrainians 
have leather clothing and no one criticizes them for this, 
whereas there was immediate criticism of the army. He added: 
  "In the past, every general in the Soviet Army had the right 
to buy a full, better-quality field uniform and a better-quality 
rain cloak at his own expense. For some reason, no one seemed to 
notice this then." 
  Col. Gen. H. Mikhaylichenko: 
  "Apropos the fur caps. Such caps were part of traditional 
Ukrainian attire and were worn by the Cossacks. Abolishing them 
caused concern even outside the military. Many civilians 
appealed to the Ministry of Defense to restore the fur caps as 
part of the uniform for generals and colonels. There were also 
countless requests regarding this from more junior officers. 
Like the braid worn by generals, the fur caps serve as kind of 
incentive. Young officers inherently yearn to acquire these 
symbols of rank. That is precisely why the commission approved 
them as part of the new uniform." 
  From problems pertaining to rear services, the journalists 
moved on to purely military issues. Especially those that 
concern armaments. Lt. Gen. Lev Hnatenko, chief of the Armaments 
Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, held his own in a battle 
of sorts. 
  Lyubov Yanyuk, the newspaper UKRAYINA MOLODA: 
  "If you please, a few words about the progress of nuclear 
disarmament." 
  "We are adhering to the schedule for dismantling the nuclear 
warheads that was agreed upon. Despite the fact that there is 
some deviation on the part of Russia, which is not adhering to 
the schedule for delivering heat-generating assemblies to 
Ukrainian nuclear electric power stations. This issue is 
currently being decided at the government level. It will be 
settled in the very near future." 
  Marat Pohoryelov, Ukrainian Radio: 
  "What is our strategy for our own armaments? What will we do 
when the weapons we have become obsolete?" 
  Lt. Gen. L. Hnatenko: 
  "I am not revealing any secrets when I tell you that it is 
very expensive to manufacture weapons. No country, with the 
exception of the former USSR and the U.S., makes its own weapons 
from start to finish. The situation in the USSR was such that no 
one republic could manufacture weapons independently. In other 
words, Ukraine does not have a single assembly plant, although 
approximately 25 percent of different components of various 
weapons are manufactured here. 
  "We conducted a study of all types of weapons and assessed 
the situation. This served as the basis for working out a state 
program of weapons development up to the year 2000 and a 
long-term program up to the year 2010. 
  "Right now we are trying to set up weapons production at a 
maximum number of facilities. This question has been partially 
resolved. The Ukrainian T-80 tank is being successfully produced 
in Kharkiv, Ukrainian shipyards are building military ships; the 
best military transport airplane, the AN-70, has been built in 
Kiev; radar systems are being developed, as well as a Ukrainian 
satellite, which will be launched very soon. But, as everywhere, 
there are many problems. 
  "There is only one solution. In order to maintain the combat 
readiness of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, we must modernize our 
armaments by making use of the facilities of our repair 
enterprises. Such projects exist, but their implementation will 
depend on the availability of financing. 
  "So far, we have financed only 24.3 percent of the 
scientific-research and research-design projects that need to be 
done and and bought only 8.8 percent of the weapons and spare 
parts that we require. We are trying to obtain the rest from 
extrabudgetary sources--by selling old weaponry and equipment 
that has done its job to the national economy. But this does not 
bring in enough money to allow us to execute our plan." 
  The journalists were also interested in how things stand 
with 
the transfer of officers and warrant officers home from abroad. 
Lt. Gen. Hryhoriy Dyachuk, chief of the Main Directorate for 
Personnel [Cadres] of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, gave a 
detailed answer: 
  "More than 26,000 officers and warrant officers have already 
returned to Ukraine. This process is continuing. Earlier reports 
put the figure of servicemen who want to return to Ukraine at 
some 140,000. But this figure was inaccurate. According to the 
data that I have, only another 10,000 officers and warrant 
officers, who submitted requests for transfers, have not yet 
returned. 
  "There is indeed a circumstance that complicates this 
process. Under Article 2 of the Law of Ukraine `On Ukrainian 
Citizenship,' we can avoid bureaucratic red tape in transferring 
personnel who filed a request to serve in the Armed Forces of 
Ukraine before 1 October 1992. Later, the Cabinet of Ministers 
came to our assistance and extended this deadline to 1 October 
1993. And now? The Supreme Council and the president have to 
extend this deadline once again." 
  Unsurprisingly, among the questions that were of interest to 
journalists was one concerning the construction of housing for 
military personnel. Col. Gen. A. Lopata, the chief of the 
General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and first deputy 
minister of defense, described how this problem is being solved. 
  Anatoliy Vasylyovych noted that this is probably the most 
difficult problem facing the military. There are close to 80,000 
military personnel without housing in our army. A shortage of 
funds is making this problem difficult to solve. Earlier, 28,000 
apartments were built every year; now only 20 percent of this 
number is being built. 
  Col. Gen. Lopata stressed that 19.98 trillion karbovantsi 
are 
needed to carry out the housing construction program. The amount 
appropriated for the Ministry of Defense is only 1.4 trillion, 
or 17.2 percent of sum it needs. 
  Col. Gen. H. Mikhaylichenko described how the Ministry of 
Defense plans to solve this financial problem. He said that this 
matter was discussed at a meeting with Deputy Prime Minister 
Valeriy Shmarov. In addition, the minister of defense will 
report on the state of financing in the Armed Forces and on 
providing them with fuel and lubricants at a meeting of the 
Presidium of the Cabinet of Ministers on 18 April. Also, General 
of the Army Vitaliy Radetskyy has made a request for 
interest-free credit to pay off debts. This credit will be 
granted soon. 
  The journalists were also interested in military education, 
its future and its problems. Maj. Gen. Viktor Hudym gave the 
attending journalists a relatively detailed report: 
  "On the whole, the system of military education created in 
Ukraine is progressive. It is designed to provide the Armed 
Forces with officer cadres, but many mistakes were made when it 
was set up. 
  "Taking into account my own concept of military education, I 
believe that we should not have copied the system in existence 
in Western countries, including in the United States. The 
standard of officer training in the former Soviet Union was 
high--a fact that even Western experts acknowledge. All that 
needed to be done was to incorporate in it the latest 
attainments in the field of science and to assure that the 
diplomas were convertible. Instead, the creation of a new 
system, the creation of new educational institutions within its 
framework and the elimination of existing schools resulted in 
the loss of valuable professorial and teaching personnel and the 
destruction of the invaluable material and technical base of 
many higher educational institutions. 
  "Decisions were made without proper justification to 
dismantle costly permanently installed equipment and to move it 
to other locations. Some of this equipment never reached its new 
destination. Not all of the equipment that did arrive has been 
put into working order. 
  "Schools that we still need today were closed. Thus, the 
only 
general military school, which was located in Kiev, was closed. 
In Odessa, they began training specialists for the Land Forces 
without sufficient preparation. A decision was made to close the 
Zhytomyr Higher Radar School of the Air Defense Forces--the only 
such school in the former Soviet Union, which trained 
specialists for the space forces. But no provision has been made 
for training these specialists elsewhere. The Kharkiv Higher 
Command Tank School was eliminated. The training of these 
specialists has been assigned to the Kiev Tank and Technical 
School, which used to train deputy weapons commanders and not 
commanders of tank platoons. This school lacks the proper field 
training base and many other things that Kharkiv had. Now the 
Kharkiv base has been handed over to the National Guard, the 
border troops, and others. Meanwhile, we are already feeling an 
acute need of commanders of tank subunits. 
  "In addition, the change to a six-year course of study means 
that there will be no officers graduating in some specialties in 
1997 and 1998. Particularly, those in specialties that were not 
previously trained by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. 
  "It is necessary to amend certain government decisions, 
revoke the corresponding decree of the Cabinet of Ministers, and 
solve other problems jointly with the Main Directorate for 
Personnel. 
  "We have no facilities at which to train psychologists, 
professors, and instructors. A decision was adopted to establish 
the Institute for the umanities in Kiev. In principle, this 
institution has already been created. What still needs to be 
decided is the question of site and material base. 
  "The next question that must be resolved immediately is how 
to disburden the Odessa and Kiev land forces institutes. The 
meeting of the Military College of the Ministry of Defense on 22 
April will be devoted to the problems of military education. I 
believe that most important issues will be settled at this 
meeting." 
  ...The meeting came to an end, but the journalists still had 
many questions in their notebooks. Col. Gen. Anatoliy Lopata 
assured us that we would get answers to these questions in 
future briefings. And there will be plenty of them inasmuch as 
such meetings are very productive both for the journalists and 
for the military.

<F P=106> [Report by Grigoriy Nesmyanovich: "The Fleet Is Not Just </F>
Being Divided; It is Actually Growing"] 
  [Text] In Kiev they are continuing to comment on the 
results of the Russian-Ukrainian talks on the Black Sea 
Fleet. 
  At a briefing in the Ministry of Internal Affairs Col-Gen 
Ivan Bizhan, deputy minister of defense of Ukraine, said that 
the Russian delegation had not been prepared to resolve the 
issues to be discussed. It proposed an unacceptable option 
whereby the Russian portion of the Black Sea Fleet would be 
deployed at bases in the Crimea and the Ukrainian share would be 
outside the Crimea. Furthermore, I. Bizhan noted, it could only 
be a matter of the brief presence of Russian seamen and ships 
within Ukraine. With respect to Sevastopol, the possibility has 
not been ruled out of temporary joint basing of the Russian and 
the Ukrainian parts only in different bays. Major disagreement 
also arose in approaches to resolution of the problem of the 
coastal infrastructure. 
  As of 20 April the number of ships in the Black Sea Fleet 
was 
833. Of these 164 belonged to Ukraine, 669 to Russia. It was 
planned for Russia to pay for 31.7 percent of the ships, which 
were to go to Ukraine under the treaty. 
  In general, representatives of the Ukrainian Navy have long 
advanced the idea that the combat strength of the Fleet is a 
myth. The fact is stressed that the average age of the ships is 
15-20 years. In recent years funds have not been allocated for 
their maintenance. If this continues, the Fleet will "go to the 
bottom" on its own by the year 2000. Ukraine's Navy, however, 
which commemorated the second anniversary of its founding in 
April, continues to be replenished with modern ships. And not so 
few of them--the administrative ship Slavuch, the patrol vessel 
Getman Sagaydachnyy, the airfoil landing ship Donetsk. The 
missile cruiser Ukraina will join them in the future. The crews 
of the patrol vessel Getman Bayda-Vinevetskiy, the small ASW 
ships Lutsk, Ternopol, Lvov, Zaporozhskaya Sech... are being 
completed and completely manned. And so, rumors of a premature 
end of the Fleet may turn out to be greatly exaggerated.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Kolinko: "Former Minister's Legacy"] </F>
  [Text] Kiev--A portrait of former Defense Minister 
Konstantin Morozov, a principal candidate for the office of 
president of Ukraine, has been published in the nationalist 
UKRAINSKAYA GAZETA. The ex-minister has been demonstrating an 
enviable political assertiveness as of late. He is sharply 
criticizing the present Ukrainian leaders. In a book that has 
just appeared, for example, he ruthlessly shows the hypocrisy of 
the president of Ukraine, publishing details, carefully 
concealed by the Ukrainian side, of the Massandra negotiations 
between Yeltsin and Kravchuk. The ex-minister's critical attacks 
are being given credence, it would seem. But is there anything 
positive and creative in his political experience permitting a 
moral claim to the presidency? 
  ...Major General Konstantin Morozov, commander of the 17th 
Air Army, was appointed minister of defense after the August 
putsch of 1991, when he appeared to be virtually the sole 
commander in Ukraine who supported the idea of the creation of 
independent armed forces. In fact, Leonid Kravchuk had no choice 
in this appointment. The main role at that time was performed 
not by military professionalism and breadth of outlook but 
political orientation and trustworthiness. 
  Virtually the sole achievement of developed socialism in the 
USSR were the armed forces. Ukraine had the best part of them, 
both organizationally and technically. So that in the creation 
of its own armed forces there was no need to perfect or 
modernize anything. It was sufficient to preserve what had been 
acquired, changing merely the system of the chain of command. 
  But the minister of defense went his own way. He began the 
organizational development of the armed forces with the 
ideologization of the army. Ukraine had decided that the 
soldier's main weapon was his selfless patriotism. A so-called 
sociopsychological service of the armed forces was formed. 
Whereas previously political officers had coached the career 
personnel in the postulates of the classics of Marxism-Leninism, 
they now began with the same zeal to inculcate the ideas of 
Ukrainian sovereignty. A campaign to eradicate from people's 
memory the heroic pages of the history of the Soviet Army was 
mounted. The straightforward implantation of the traditions of 
the Ukrainian Insurgent Army and the ideology of Petlyura, 
Bandera, and Mukhevich began in place of this. Konstantin 
Morozov appointed to the position of leader of the 
sociopsychological service Vladimir Mulyavu, who had in two 
years made dizzying career progress from sergeant of the reserve 
to major general in the field. 
  This patriotization turned out as might have been expected: 
nihilism, increased desertion, and the flourishing of hazing. 
  Konstantin Morozov removed from the leadership of the 
Ministry of Defense the best professionals--for, more often than 
not, the simple reason that against their background the 
professional level of the minister himself seemed quite insipid. 
Thus General Sobkov, chief of the Main Staff, General Oleynik, 
deputy minister for armament, and General Ignatenko, deputy 
minister for personnel, quit their posts. 
  An idea that has as yet no counterpart in the armed forces 
of 
other countries, on the other hand, was realized: unification of 
the navy and the air defense forces. It was in this way 
confirmed that in military matters Ukraine would be going its 
own, original way. 
  Considerable losses were sustained by military research and 
military education thanks to the activity of the newly fledged 
General Yuriy Prokofyev, who was appointed chief of the Ministry 
of Defense Directorate of Education. Of the 34 academies and 
schools, he retained only nine military training institutions, 
having eliminated, for example, the Kiev Combined-Arms Command 
Military School, one of the best in the former USSR, and having 
destroyed during the reorganization the unique equipment of a 
number of training centers. 
  ...Mariya Cherednichenko, an inhabitant of the Onufriyevka 
community of Kirovograd Oblast, believes that army commanders 
made her son a criminal. After having been drafted into the 
army, the young man ended up in a strategic aviation unit not 
far from Kiev. The Busol association, which uses military 
aircraft for commercial transportation, operates at the 
long-range bomber unit base, apparently. The stores for housing 
arms and military equipment were stuffed with footwear, 
clothing, perfumery, home electronics, sugar, butter--goods 
which practical fellows from the Caucasus were ferrying on 
military aircraft on commercial routes known only to them. At 
night the soldiers would be roused at the command of toughs in 
leather jackets to load up another aircraft. 
  Guarding the storehouse with the commercial odds and ends, 
Mariya Cherednichenko's son was unable to withstand the 
temptation, stole, was caught, and was committed to trial. "I am 
not excusing him," his grief-stricken mother says. "But I did 
not send him to the army for him to guard the property of 
profiteers and mafiosi who had built a thieves' nest in an 
operational military unit...." 
  In Konstantin Morozov's years at the helm of power the army 
become a huge proving ground for economic activity. 
  Inasmuch as in the former Soviet Union Ukraine had, as a 
consequence of its geographical location, been the key component 
in a possible conflict between the countries of NATO and the 
Warsaw Pact, the republic was literally larded with the most 
modern military equipment and represented a principal arsenal of 
the USSR. Aside from this, an immense quantity of military 
equipment and munitions had been concentrated here in recent 
years in connection with the withdrawal of Soviet forces from 
the Warsaw Pact countries and Germany. With Ukraine's 
proclamation of independence, all this material wealth became 
its property. 
  And, simultaneously, a base for criminal business. 
  As Grigoriy Olmechenko, colonel of the Security Service and 
people's deputy of Ukraine, believes, a substantial part of the 
$12-16 billion which annually ends up in overseas banks in the 
personal accounts of a few hundred citizens of Ukraine is the 
result of commercial deals involving military hardware and 
equipment. 
  Theft and economic crime have affected all army strata: from 
the privates through the generals. The crime list abounds in 
reports of the sale by soldiers of grenades, automatic weapons, 
pistols, and grenade launchers stolen from military stroes. The 
level of the "commercial activity" of the officers is somewhat 
different: the sale for cash of trucks, tractors, bulldozers, 
equipment, gasoline, and building materials which have allegedly 
been written off. 
  As far as the generals are concerned, the horizons of 
activity are far wider here. 
  In accordance with an order of Konstantin Morozov, a 
Commercial Center for the sale of military equipment and weapons 
was formed more than two years ago under the auspices of the 
Ministry of Defense. The monies earned were to have been 
channeled into the construction of housing for the servicemen 
(several tens of thousands of officer's families are without 
apartments in Ukraine today). 
  But it was ascertained right from the start of the center's 
activity that even the highly modest monies which it was earning 
were being channeled mainly into the replenishment of accounts 
in various banks, foreign banks included, for the purchase of 
prestige automobiles for the generals. The Commercial Center was 
created, incidentally, in defiance of legislation of Ukraine, 
was not a legal entity, and was not, therefore, licensed for the 
activity in which it was engaged. The deputy prosecutor general 
wrote to Konstantin Morozov about this 18 months ago. He did not 
receive a response to his message, and he himself was retired 
shortly after. 
  The Commercial Center, meanwhile, was involved in very 
curious actions. Such as, for example, the deal involving the 
sale of 13 warships, including the Leningrad, Provornyy, and 
Komsomolets Ukrainy ASW ships, the Dmitriy Galkin tender, and 
several patrol craft for a total of... just R35.1 million! In 
experts' opinion, this is tens of times less than their true 
worth. At least, as was ascertained subsequently, the 
Ukraina-AKHTIAR joint-stock partnership, which acted as the 
middleman, made some R129 million for just two ships from these 
13. 
  At approximately the same time the Commercial Center sold 
various authorities eight military bases and three individual 
buildings and did so in such a way, what is more, that the 
Ministry of Defense of Ukraine was caused a loss of more than 
R110 million. 
  Such transactions followed one after the other. Information 
to the effect that approximately 80 tanks were sold abroad last 
year and that the proceeds constituted only $375,000 filtered 
into the Ukrainian press. 
  And although the Commercial Center was ultimately disbanded, 
the public never heard of any of its leaders being punished. 
  Although, no. There was one such instance, but in accordance 
with the well-known rule of "rewarding the nonparticipants, 
punishing the innocent." This happened when 23 Tu-16 long-range 
bombers were written off at a military unit located in Lvov 
Oblast. The Commercial Center concluded a recycling contract at 
that time not with the state-run Ukrtvortsvetmet, as required by 
law, but with the Asper (Kiev) small enterprise. The value of 
the 23 bombers being written off was put at 1.2 million 
Ukrainian karbovantsy. According to the commodity-exchange rate, 
however, a tonne of such scrap metal has a value of not less 
than $1,000. The agreement was signed by the leaders of the 
Commercial Center with the blessing of Lieutenant General G. 
Zhivitsa, deputy chief of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine 
Main Staff. When, following the intervention of the Security 
Service of Ukraine, however, this deal was canceled, the person 
punished was... Major Gubanov, the commander of the military 
unit at which the Tu-16 bombers had been based. A person who had 
had nothing to do with the deal concluded in Kiev. 
  General Vladimir Tolubko, leader of the "hawks" in the 
Ukrainian parliament, who has insistently demanded the 
preservation of nuclear weapons in Ukraine, has prospered and 
continues to prosper. Appointed 18 months ago the leader of the 
Kharkov Military University, he has shown himself there to be 
primarily a magnificent businessman. And it is not only a 
question of his apartment-dacha epic, which was successful, but 
which raised a considerable clamor. The general has conducted a 
number of large-scale commercial transactions: He has sold for a 
pittance practically new trucks in the guise of ones that had 
been written off and leased to commercial entities premises of 
the military university with an area of more than 3,000 square 
meters (what price a military secret here!). And the university 
understands full well why tens of millions of karbovantsy have 
been transferred to the Dobrodiy Commercial Bank: The general 
himself is a cofounder of this bank. I have absolutely no reason 
to believe that the former minister was involved in this 
malfeasance or that he is in the least way mixed up in dirty 
machinations. But what use is a leader who cannot bring if only 
elementary order to bear in the area entrusted to him?

"Half of the Soldiers and Sergeants in Belorussia Are Being 
Discharged into the Reserve"] 
  [Text] This spring, for the first time servicemen in 
compulsory term of service from two call-ups--the spring and 
fall of 1992--will be discharged into the reserve immediately 
from the Belorussian Army. The Ministry of Defense believes that 
this may seriously affect the combat readiness of the Armed 
Forces of the Republic of Belorussia--after all, half of the 
soldiers and sergeants are to leave over the course of two 
months. Things will also be difficult this spring for the 
republic's military commissariats--the call-up plan has been 
increased considerably, while the number of draftees has 
remained essentially as before.

<F P=106> [Interview with Janis Adamsons by Ieva Stale: "Border Guards </F>
Have New Commander"] 
  [Text] On Thursday, Defense Minister V. Pavlovskis signed 
an order appointing Command Captain Janis Adamsons, the present 
Deputy Commander of the Naval Forces to the position of Border 
Guards Brigade Commander. Thus, control of the land borders will 
be overseen by a navy man. In this connection, "Labrit" is 
offering a brief short-order interview with the new Border 
Guards Brigade Commander. 
  [Stale] Did you agree to this position willingly? 
  [Adamsons] I am an officer, and in the army it is assumed 
that the orders of a higher ranking officer are to be followed, 
regardless of whether they concern changing over to another post 
or retirement. I was satisfied with my present post and also 
with the work I had contributed in forming the Naval Forces. The 
actual offer to become the Border Guards Brigade Commander was 
unexpected, although I am a professional coast guard. 
  [Stale] How did you become a coast guard by profession? 
  [Adamsons] I studied at the Russian Naval War School. For 13 
years, I served in the Far East in various leadership positions 
as a coast guard. I was last stationed in Russia at the Coast 
Guard Training Center in Nahodka, where I served as deputy head 
of the training center. 
  [Stale] In your opinion, what is the weakest point in the 
present overland border protection plan? 
  [Adamsons] I will be able to answer this question one month 
from now, after I have familiarized myself with all overland 
border problems. I guarantee that the information will be 
available to the press. 
  [Stale] What are the main activity objectives of the new 
Border Guards Brigade Commander? 
  [Adamsons] To strengthen overland border control, protection 
and defense, involving the participation of those people who are 
serving in the Border Guard at present. The main objective is to 
organize regular cooperation among the state institutions 
involved with border control -- the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs, National Guard, Customs. Until now, while serving in 
the Naval Forces, there was good cooperation among these 
institutions. I hope the situation continues.

<F P=106> [Article by Kirill Petrov: "Talks in Bishkek Started"; </F>
"Accompanied by Battles in Nagorno-Karabakh"] 
  [Text] We have already gotten used to the fact that the 
news from the Karabakh conflict zone is contradictory. The 
present spring campaign is no exception. 
  According to the press service of the Defense Ministry of 
Azerbaijan, Armenian armed formations are attacking in the 
Tertery and Agdam axes using artillery and armor. The same 
source asserts that the Armenians lost 50 soldiers and one tank 
in the offensive. 
  But the press service of the NKR [Nagorno-Karabakh Republic] 
Army staff reports essentially the opposite: The Azerbaijan Army 
is trying to push an advance in the northeastern sector of the 
front, but Karabakh subunits are holding up its attack. Both 
sides are suffering losses. 
  One thing is clear: The front line is hardly changing. The 
May burst of activity in the Karabakh front was no more than the 
backdrop to the next talks, which began on May 4 in Bishkek, for 
a peaceful settlement of the Karabakh problem. Participating in 
them, according to the RIA, are a Russian delegation headed by 
the chairman of the Council of the Inter-Parliamentary Assembly 
of the CIS [Commonwealth of Independent States] and Chairman of 
the Federation Council, Vladimir Shumeyko, and delegations from 
Kirghizia and the Aland Islands (Finland). 
  Vladimir Shumeyko pointed out the impermissibility of 
military actions between CIS countries and called on all 
politicians and military of the Commonwealth, upon whom the 
solution to the problem depends, to join the peace initiatives. 
  The Azerbaijan side considers the actions of Armenia on the 
territory of Nagorno-Karabakh to be military aggression and 
demands their immediate cessation. Speaking on May 4, the deputy 
chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan, Afiyandin Jalilov 
stated that as a result of combat actions more than 20% 
of the 
territory of Azerbaijan was occupied by Armenian armed 
formations, more than a million people had become refugees, more 
than 4 thousand persons were hostages, and around 700 populated 
areas lay in ruins. "In the long-standing conflict that has 
proliferated into war, both peoples are suffering, the Azeris 
and the Armenians," stressed Jalilov. He stated that he expects 
the signing of an immediate cease-fire agreement from the 
Bishkek meeting. The head of the Armenian delegation, Chairman 
of the Supreme Soviet Babken Ararktsyan stated that Armenia 
welcomes any peace initiatives directed toward cessation of the 
conflict, but is against fruitless declarations that do not take 
the real interests of the sides into account. 
  Representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh decided to air their 
opinions behind closed doors. 
  I believe it to be symptomatic that it was on May 4 that the 
President of Azerbaijan, Gaydar Aliyev, affixed his signature to 
the NATO "Partnership for Peace" program in Brussels. 
  Something else is symptomatic as well. By all appearances, a 
noisy trial is coming to a head in Baku. The former Defense 
Minister of Azerbaijan Rakhim Gaziyev is accused of surrendering 
Sochi in May of 1992. According to the Procurator General of the 
Republic, Ali Omarov, Gaziyev will be charged under three 
articles of the Criminal Code of Azerbaijan and may be 
imprisoned for 6 to 8 years. Remember that at one time 
ex-president Ayaz Mutalibov was accused of losing Khodzhala. 
  The fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh appears to have faded into 
the background, while both in Baku and in Yerevan they are much 
more interested in the political games surrounding it.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "Official Chronicle" column: </F>
"Augmenting the National Army--A Matter of Primary Importance"] 
  [Text] On 13 May in the Republic of Armenia there was a 
conference devoted to questions of organizing the spring 
recruitment. Participating in it were state ministers, 
ministers, Defense Ministry and Internal Affairs Ministry 
workers, managers from the procuracy, military commissars, 
chairmen of ispolkoms [executive committees] of the Yerevan city 
and rayon councils, and also through conference 
calls--representatives of ispolkoms of city and oblast councils 
of the republic. 
  Opening the conference, Prime Minister Grant Bagratyan 
emphasized the importance of the recruitment in the matter of 
reinforcement of the national army and defense of the country 
under the conditions of the continuing conflict in the region. 
The prime minister noted the need for both extensive explanatory 
work and the creation of a certain military-patriotic atmosphere 
by the mass media, on the one hand, and, on the other, a refusal 
to put up with draft dodgers and deserters and the application 
of punitive measures against them within the framework of 
existing legislation. In this connection Grant Bagratyan 
reported that by a government decree the republic procuracy was 
asked to file criminal cases in keeping with the established 
procedure against citizens who evade the draft and to take 
measures to return to Armenia draftees who are outside the 
republic. The corresponding instructions were also given to the 
ministries and departments. 
  Mr. Bagratyan also emphasized the need to ensure fairness 
and 
openness in the matter of conducting the draft and expressed the 
hope that, as a result of the hard work, the draft would go 
successfully. 
  State Minister Vazgen Sarkisyan talked about the problem of 
conducting the draft, introduced the members of the regional 
coordination commission, and addressed the tasks facing each 
rayon. The state minister condemned the bad system that exists 
whereby through fair means or foul every soldier is transferred 
to the military unit of their native region. The draft will be 
conducted according to a nonregional principle, he said, and 
nobody will serve in his own rayon. The state minister denied 
rumors that 18-year-old draftees would be sent to the border 
regions of combat activities and called them absurd. Describing 
the draft as a task of not simply republic but of national 
significance, Vazgen Sarkisyan emphasized the importance of 
universal support for this work, noting that it would be 
desirable for deputies of the Supreme Council and parties and 
public organizations to participate in it. The state minister 
said that work was being done in this area and there had been 
appreciable results. 
  A number of other issues related to the draft were also 
discussed at the conference.

<F P=106> [SNARK report: "Measures Made Stricter"] </F>
  [Text] Measures against individuals evading the draft into 
active military service are becoming stricter in Armenia. 
According to a government decree signed a couple of days ago, 
from now on citizens of draft age will be allowed to leave the 
republic only with the appropriate note on their military 
identification card. 
  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been instructed to 
submit 
proposals concerning the procedure for returning draft dodgers 
from other states. 
  At the same time certain economic sanctions and restrictions 
on draft dodgers and their families are being considered. 
  Additionally, the state minister for questions of defense, 
Vazgen Sarkisyan, speaking at a government conference, 
categorically denied the assertion that draftees would be sent 
immediately to the front lines, calling such rumors "absurd."

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Larin: "There are 360 Russians in the </F>
Camps of Azerbaijan Refugees"] 
  [Text] At the invitation of the Russian community of 
Azerbaijan, deputies of the State Duma Sergey Baburin, Ivan 
Anichkin, Sergey Glotov and Anatoliy Greshnevikov visited the 
Azerbaijan Republic from April 22 to 25. 
  The Russian parliament members met with the President of 
Azerbaijan Gaydar Aliyev and other high-ranking officials of the 
republic. 
  Members of the Russian parliament visited the camps of 
Azerbaijan refuges from the regions of Azerbaijan that had been 
occupied by Armenian armed formations. 
  As of today, Armenia has occupied around 20% of the 
territory of the Azerbaijan Republic (including 7 regions 
outside the borders of Nagorno-Karabakh proper: Agdam, Fizulin, 
Lachin, Kelbajar, Jebrail, Kubatlin, and Zangelan). According to 
official data of the Azerbaijan side, more than 700 populated 
areas of Azerbaijan have been captured, and the majority of them 
burned and looted. The area of the territories occupied by the 
Armenian armed formations at present amounts to more than 17 
thousand square kilometers. The advance of the Armenian 
expeditionary corps continues, including active attempts to "cut 
through" Tertery-Barda (Azerbaijan populated areas) and capture 
the Tbilisi-Baku route. 
  The problem of refugees and forced emigrants, whose numbers 
at present exceed 1 million (every seventh resident of 
Azerbaijan), including 200 thousand refugee Azeris from Armenia, 
is growing urgent. They are being accommodated in tent camps set 
up by the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Turkish Republic, and 
Arab charitable associations. As of today, 360 of the refugees 
are Russian. Iran has undertaken to maintain 100 thousand 
refugees and conducting a propaganda campaign about it. 
  The tent camps are in the steppe regions of Azerbaijan, 
where 
extremely high temperatures will set in within 1 to 1.5 months 
and may result in deaths, particular of children. 
  The deputies note that after the hasty withdrawal of Russian 
troops, and the virtual break in economic and cultural ties of 
the Russian Federation with the Azerbaijan Republic, trust in 
Russia on the part of the populace of Azerbaijan, including the 
Russians, is steadily falling. In the opinion of the parliament 
members, the region of vital Russian interests has gone without 
due attention from the leadership of the Russian Federation and 
the public, and this cannot continue. 
  They demand investigations into the statements of citizens 
of 
Azerbaijan that fighters are being recruited for the Armenian 
armed formations on the territory of the Stavropol and Krasnodar 
krays and the Rostov oblast of the Russian Federation. 
  Among the proposals of the members of the State Duma are: 
immediate provision of material, financial and other assistance 
(including the creation of a "cultural corridor") to the Russian 
community in Azerbaijan, intensificaton of peace-making efforts 
in the conflict zone, immediate withdrawal of Armenian troops 
from occupied territories, creation of a Consultative Council 
for Nagorno-Karabakh made up of representatives of sides with an 
interest in a peaceful settlement, and provision of effective 
assistance to refugees and forced emigrants from occupied 
regions of Azerbaijan, including the establishment and 
furnishing of a Russian tent camp, and delivery of medicines.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant Shakir Tair-ogly Salimov, deputy </F>
military commissar of the Kyapyazskiy Rayon Military 
Commissariat, by correspondent I. Guseynov; place and date not 
given: "...Answer to Your Conscience...."] 
  [Text] Azerbaijan is experiencing difficult times. 
Today it is very important for all the people, each resident of 
the republic, whether he be at the front or in the rear, to 
clearly understand the extreme nature of the situation, to be 
maximally mobilized, and to find his place in the sacred cause 
of defense of the Motherland. 
  The front and the rear are linked by a common destiny, 
a common task. The military commissariat of Kyapyazskiy Rayon of 
Ganje arranges its activity on this basis. This is the subject 
of the discussion between our correspondent and the deputy 
military commissar of the Kyapyazskiy Rayon Military 
Commissariat, Lieutenant Colonel Shakir Tair-ogly Salimov. 
  [Guseynov] How long have you been working in the military 
commissariat? 
  [Salimov] I have been here since November of last year. I 
was 
assigned here after I sustained a serious injury in battle for 
liberation of our native land from the Armenian scumbags. After 
graduating from the Novosibirsk Higher Military-Political School 
with a desire to join the airborne troops, I served in Germany 
and the Transbaykal and Siberian military districts. At the 
beginning of 1991 when the Armenian aggression was increasing I 
decided that my place was at the front, where the fate of my 
Motherland and my people was being decided. When I took the 
military oath I swore to be faithful to my Motherland until the 
end of my days. This oath and, above all, the sense of civic 
duty to my Motherland and family, who raised me and got me on my 
feet, forced me to return to Azerbaijan. I have been severely 
wounded in battle three times. The last time I lost a leg and 
that, one might say, put me out of commission for good and made 
it impossible for me to fight. And so I ended up here. If I had 
my way I would go back to the front today, to my comrades in 
arms. 
  [Guseynov] The regular draft into the National Army has 
ended. How did it go in your rayon? 
  [Salimov] Extremely badly. To be truthful, the mobilization 
we are conducting cannot stand up under any criticism. As a 
military person I must emphasize that today, when Azerbaijan is 
being subjected to aggression from our neighboring republic, the 
question of universal mobilization acquires primary 
significance. The whole problem is that when executing the order 
on mobilization in the majority of cases the edicts of the 
president of the republic and the Cabinet of Ministers are 
distorted. I am not saying this just to hear myself talk. After 
all, there are edicts to the effect that individuals who are the 
sole breadwinners for their parents are not subject to being 
drafted into the army, or a person whose brother is fighting at 
the front, or if one of his brothers has died at the front, and 
others are exempt from the draft. Why do we refuse to carry them 
out? 
  Understandably, a draft order, like all other military 
orders, is subject to strict obedience without discussion. But 
not at the expense of only sons. And how many of these chaps 
have already died and how many are fighting at the front today?! 
  [Guseynov] Comrade lieutenant colonel, it seems that only 
sons are a sore spot in your work. 
  [Salimov] Imagine that a worker of the law enforcement 
organs, say, in the precinct brings a young person of draft age 
to the military commissariat, knowing ahead of time that this is 
the only son of his parents, and he says nothing about it. By 
the time we sent him to the military unit his parents come with 
a paper from the housing operations section saying that he is 
their only son. But their son has already received his orders, 
he has entered the service, and now only an order from the 
Ministry of Defense can release him from further service. 
  [Guseynov] Shakir Mulladim, can it be that nobody other than 
only sons respond to the draft in the military commissariat of 
which you are in charge? 
  [Salimov] I think there are many draftees who are 
conscientious chaps who really understand their civic duty to 
the Motherland which is in danger. We have no problems with 
them. But there are also those who deliberately evade the draft 
and do not show up at the induction facility. And where should 
we look for them, and in general, is it the job of the military 
commissariat to look for people like this? And then "chaps" who 
are forced into the army exhibit cowardice at the front. 
  [Guseynov] Do you think that strengthening discipline is 
task 
number one in the army today? 
  [Salimov] Undoubtedly. At this time there is no task more 
important than that one. Without iron discipline the army is 
nothing but a wandering band of gypsies, but even there, 
incidentally, people obey the law. It is hard to admit it, but 
our army does not have enough discipline today. Otherwise, there 
would be no cases of desertion and absence without leave from 
the military unit. Have you never seen young men in military 
uniforms roaming around the city and in public places? Well, 
many of them are absent without leave from their million 
subdivisions. And I think that these cowards who have fled from 
the battlefield deserve the most severe punishment. 
  [Guseynov] Are there cases of desertion in your rayon, and 
what measures are being taken against such people? 
  [Salimov] I do not deny that we have had cases of desertion 
and absence without leave from the combat unit by certain of our 
draftees. But we are not authorized to take any measures against 
them. This falls within the jurisdiction of the military 
procuracy, which must hold all deserters strictly accountable. 
  [Guseynov] In your opinion, is there a solution to the 
problem? 
  [Salimov] Of course, there is nothing on this earth that 
cannot be corrected. Today every citizen of the republic must 
clearly understand that there is a war going on in our land; the 
Armenian aggressors want to take away part of our territory and 
they are encroaching on our sovereignty and independence. 
Finally, all of us must understand that today at the front and 
in the rear there is one common task--to drive the Armenian 
occupiers out of our native land. And all of our interests must 
be subordinate to this task. In the localities we must step up 
propaganda and agitation work; in the schools and VUZ's [higher 
educational institutions] we must improve military-patriotic 
work with youth, the level of which, unfortunately, leaves 
something to be desired. In the streets, squares, and public 
places it is a rare event to see patriotic posters and appeals 
for defense of the Motherland. And in the army itself we must 
overcome the existing psychology of complacency and 
insubordination to officers and junior commanders. Sometimes 
even a little bit of gratitude shown to a fighting man before 
formation cheers him up, raises his fighting spirit, and calls 
him to victory. It is very important to understand this. 
Finally, and this is the main thing, the actual time has come 
when we must answer to our conscience as to precisely what we 
have done for the front, for victory.

<F P=106> [Article by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA Correspondent Valentin Rudenko, </F>
Santiago-Moscow, under the rubric: "Russian Arms": "On the Sales 
Crossroads: A Chance Has Appeared for the Aircraft Builders in 
the Markets of Latin America--But Time Will Tell If They Will Be 
Able To Take Advantage of It"] 
  [Text] Our correspondent has already stated in his 
reports from Santiago that the Russian exposition was the 
largest and most representative at the FIDAE-94 International 
Aerospace Show that occurred at the end of March 1994 in the 
Republic of Chile. As for military aviation--the MiG-29, Su-27 
and Su-30MK fighter aircraft--there simply weren't any 
competitors for them there. Everyone recognized that. 
  But today, a month after the conclusion of FIDAE-94, we 
would like to talk a bit not so much about the triumph of 
Russian aviation as much as about the results and the lessons of 
the airshows. 
  Russia had never previously participated in airshows in 
Latin 
America. And although they say that you can't expect perfection 
on the first try, that folk wisdom was not confirmed in this 
case. If you assess the results of our participation in FIDAE-94 
on the whole then, as Russian Official Delegation Head Air Force 
Commander-in-Chief Colonel-General of Aviation Petr Deynekin 
noted, this was a real breakthrough in the skies of Latin 
America which must provide an impetus to the broad development 
of military-technical cooperation not only with Chile but also 
with other countries of this region. Previously, as is well 
known, we maintained contacts on the military line here only 
with Peru, Nicaragua and Cuba. 
  The majority of FIDAE-94's Russian participants acted under 
the aegis of the recently formed "Rosvooruzheniye" [Russian 
Arms] State Company. But there were also those firms that 
independently displayed their products and latest technologies. 
Among them was Moscow Aviation Production Association (MAPO). 
  Two years ago, this association obtained the right to 
independently, naturally under state monitoring, conduct 
negotiations and sign contracts on the subject of deliveries on 
the world market of one of the world's best light frontal 
aviation fighter aircraft--the MiG-29. 
  As at previous airshows, the MAPO delegation consisted of 
not 
only association specialists but also representatives of MiG 
ANPK [Aircraft Scientific Production Combine] imeni A.I. 
Mikoyan, and also of the primary enterprises-subcontractors, 
suppliers of radar gunsights, avionics, onboard weapons, and 
other systems. According to "Vympel" GosMKB [State 
Machinebuilding Design Bureau] Chief Designer Gennadiy 
Sokolovskiy, Ryazan Instrument Plant Head Designer Yuriy 
Zelenyuk, the heads of other firms, and MAPO partners, this is a 
very proper approach. When there are developers, manufacturers 
and component suppliers on one team, then you can conduct 
substantive negotiations not only on the delivery of the fighter 
aircraft themselves but also on their possible modernization, 
providing maintenance, supplying spare parts, and other issues 
already during the course of the airshow. 
  The Chilean airshow, although the largest in Latin America, 
still is regional in nature in contrast to Le Bourget or 
Farnborough. The displays consist of, first and foremost, what 
can actually be sold in the countries of this region. It's 
possible that some people will not agree with me, but we also 
underestimated this factor. For example, many experts think that 
the simultaneous participation of the MiG-29, Su-27 and Su-30MK 
in this airshow was hardly advisable. 
  Yes, our fighter aircraft were a sensation in the Chilean 
skies. Yes, their journalists christened FIDAE-94 a "show of 
stars". But we did not fly 17,000 kilometers to conduct aerial 
performances, but to offer our combat aircraft for sale. For 
those people who know very well the aircraft market situation, 
the financial capabilities of the Latin American countries, and 
the specific features of their military doctrine, it was already 
clear in Moscow that it is practically impossible to sell MiG's 
or Su's here. Therefore, we needed to determine which of the 
aircraft had a greater chance to penetrate the Latin American 
market and to assign a priority to it. 
  First of all, this would substantially reduce our 
expenditures for participation at the exhibition and, second, it 
would permit us to concentrate the attention of potential buyers 
on one object of sale. 
  For many foreign experts, the models of weapons and 
technologies displayed by Russia at FIDAE-94 became a real 
revelation. They did not find out about them from the 
advertising brochures or catalogs that were disseminated on the 
eve of the exhibition, but at the airshow. 
  Advertising costs money. And quite a bit of money. But we 
need to resort to these expenditures if we seriously intend to 
present ourselves on the international market. Moscow Aviation 
Production Association has learned this truth well. A small MAPO 
delegation, which settled all of the organizational issues, 
visited Chile several months prior to the airshow and met with 
the leadership of the ministry of defense, the Chilean Air 
Force, FIDAE, and conducted a series of press conferences. As a 
result, more than a dozen articles, which discussed the 
enterprise and MiG-29 fighter aircraft, were published in the 
local press already prior to the airshow's opening. 
  It would be unjust to not say kind words here directed at 
"Menkh" Publishing Group and specifically its Moscow Bureau, 
which assumed responsibility for the information support mission 
for the airshow's Russian participants. We received xerox copies 
of the most interesting articles from the central and Moscow 
newspapers on a daily basis. A series of articles on our weapons 
that were displayed at this exhibition were published on the 
pages of the magazines published by "Menkh". 
  Arms sales are a delicate matter with a mass of nuances, 
including in a political context. Even if there is a marvelous 
aircraft or helicopter, that still does not mean that they will 
mandatorily manage to sell it. Although the arms business is 
considered to be one of the most ancient businesses, we still 
have not properly mastered it. 
  And yet, do we have a chance to conquer the Latin American 
aircraft markets? Or were the hundreds of thousands of dollars 
spent by Russia for participation in FIDAE-94 cast to the wind? 
  At the present time, there are 123 combat aircraft in the 
Chilean Air Force inventory. These are primarily F-5, A-36, 
A-37, FGA-71 Hunter, and Mirage-50 fighter and fighter-bomber 
aircraft. Approximately half of them were accepted into the 
inventory in 1967 and 1975-76 and the remainder in 1982. Today, 
the question is being urgently raised on the replacement of 
obsolete aircraft with more modern aircraft. A special program 
has been developed on this score. 
  The Chilean Government intends to purchase approximately 
18-20 "second hand" aircraft to replace the old Hunter fighter 
aircraft. The Republic of South Africa, Israel, England, France 
and Belgium are competing for this contract. Unfortunately, 
Russia is not on this list. However, a majority of experts admit 
that our fighter aircraft made a very favorable impression on 
the Latin Americans. 
  According to the statement of FIDAE President General Estey, 
who completed a more than one hour flight in a MiG-29 with 
Mikoyan Chief Pilot Roman Taskayev, this "aircraft permitted him 
to do things which he had never previously experienced". Chilean 
Air Force Commander-in-Chief General Vega, who flew with Sukhoy 
Test Pilot Igor Votintsev in a Su-30MK fighter-interceptor, also 
provided a flattering assessment. But, despite such favorable 
comments, our chances to win the already existing order are not 
great. 
  At the same time, we should not forget that in the future 
the 
Chileans plan to replace a second squadron of Pantera (former 
Mirage) combat aircraft. And here Russian fighter aircraft can 
already pose serious competition to the Swedish Gripen aircraft 
that are competing for that order. 
  "If preference is given to our fighter, we are prepared to 
equip the MiG-29's accepted into the West with navigation 
equipment so that expenditures for the replacement of the ground 
system are minimal, and to ensure in the entire range of 
aircraft operation guaranteed maintenance, at the level of world 
standards, and the supply of spare parts," said MAPO General 
Director Vladimir Kuzmin. 
  During the course of the airshow, the Moscow Aviation 
Production Association delegation visited ENAER national 
aviation enterprise that is the foundation of Chile's aviation 
industry. This enterprise specializes in the production of the 
Chilean Air Force fleet and, in the event of the purchase of 
Russian fighter aircraft, we could develop a technical center 
based upon it for the maintenance of our aircraft which would be 
supplied not only to Chile but also to other Latin American 
countries. According to the assessment of MAPO Head Engineer 
Viktor Puzanov, there are all of the conditions for that here. 
  As for Western countries' combat aircraft, the reports from 
the airshow have already noted that it was very, very modestly 
displayed at FIDAE-94, primarily obsolete models of aircraft 
that are in the inventories of the Chilean and Peruvian air 
forces. For example, the United States in general decided not to 
demonstrate its combat aircraft here. Why? There are the most 
varied opinions on this score. Some assert that there simply 
isn't a need to do that because they already know American 
aircraft well here. According to others, this is linked with the 
strict position of the U.S. Congress that still maintains Chile 
on a "black list" of states to which the export of American 
military equipment is prohibited. We also had the opportunity to 
hear this version: The absence of American aircraft--this is a 
punishment for the Chileans for the invitation of Russian 
aircraft to FIDAE-94. 
  But, be that as it may, one thing is certain: The United 
States has had an impact on the world combat aircraft market and 
will have a very large impact in the foreseeable future. 
  But then again, there are no grounds to disparage our 
possibilities to conquer aircraft markets. Many experts think 
that the Latin American countries would like to do business with 
us and not with the Americans. The FIDAE-94 Airshow convincingly 
confirmed that. I had an opportunity to see the sparkle in the 
eyes of the generals of the air forces of Chile, Venezuela, 
Argentina, Brazil and Peru when they shared their impressions 
from the flights being conducted by our fighter aircraft. 
Without words, it was clear that they liked our aircraft. 
  Negotiations were being conducted from morning to night in 
the chalet of "Rosvooruzheniye" State Company, MAPO, and 
"Aviaeksport" V/O [Foreign Trade Association]. And although no 
serious contracts whatsoever were concluded directly at the 
exhibition, it is of course early to make hasty conclusions with 
regard to its commercial results. We sowed the seeds which must 
mandatorily produce sprouts. And we need to considerately tend 
it in order for a harvest to appear. It's possible that this 
will take years. 
  In short, with the conclusion of the exhibition, work on the 
promotion of our aircraft in the Latin American market has not 
been completed but has just begun. FIDAE-94 provided Russian 
aircraft builders a chance and it would be a sin not to take 
advantage of it.

<F P=106> [Interview with Security Council Interdepartmental </F>
Commission for Defense Industry Scientific-Technical Issues 
Chairman Mikhail Dmitriyevich Maley by DELOVOY MIR Correspondent 
Galina Sidorova and Candidate of Philosophical Sciences Irina 
Filatova of the Russian Academy of Sciences and Ministry of 
Labor Employment Problems Institute, under the rubric: 
"Opinion": "Mikhail Maley: We Need Firm, Comprehensible Rule"] 
  [Text] The interview of famous Russian Entrepreneur 
and "Rossiyskoye zoloto" [Russian Gold] AK Board Chairman Mark 
Masarskiy was published in the analytical attachment of DELOVOY 
MIR No 71. Continuing the theme "Russia From the Present to the 
Future", today we offer for the attention of our readers a 
conversation with a representative of the state 
structure--Security Council Interdepartmental Commission for 
Defense Industry Scientific-Technical Issues Chairman Mikhail 
Dmitriyevich Maley. 
  [DELOVOY MIR] The president and the government constantly 
talk about the market course of our economy. Indeed, in the 
process they in no way designate the nature of the impending 
order. First, they attempt to apply to Russia the caftan of the 
most successfully managed model, for example, the Swedish model, 
then they assert that Russia has its own, third, path of 
development. Mikhail Dmitriyevich, what do you think in this 
regard? 
  [Maley] I am a scientist and I know precisely: There are 
never any extremes in the material world. The Gauss curved 
distribution, which shows that extreme points are striving 
toward zero, is always operating. The primary sum of the 
processes and selections lies in the center. 
  The objective development of events has placed us on that 
middle path that lies between the extreme points--socialism and 
capitalism. You can call it a third path but this is not 
specifically a Russian third path. Since there isn't pure 
capitalism or pure socialism, society always moves along the 
center, there, where the amplitude of the curve is maximum. But 
you can call that path a third path only in the sense that each 
country has its own specific features of development. In Russia, 
they will be specifically Russian. 
<H8>  An Experiment With a Deviation </H8>
  [Maley] Right now experimental progress is occurring with 
fluctuations and deviations. I would call this the broken curve 
of progress. But its vector has still been designated: We are 
moving toward a society that will be a symbiosis of the ideal 
models of capitalism and socialism and, I would like to hope, 
the best of their parts. 
  [DELOVOY MIR] Maybe the middle toward which we are moving is 
also the happy medium, but there have been painfully many 
fluctuations and deviations. Is there that staff on which we 
could reliably lean and still reach the goal? 
  [Maley] I think that any society, and ours in particular, 
cannot live in a space without an ideological orientation. There 
must be national goals and tasks that are naturally varied in 
significance. The main thing for Russia today is to return to 
the position of a great world power, not a military, but a great 
economic world power. In order to attain that, we must set a 
goal: To exceed the potential of the former USSR by at least a 
factor of two on a reduced territory. 
  A mass of subgoals result from this. Among others, this can 
be, for example, the following--for all great chess players to 
come from Russia, like before -- from the USSR. A subgoal 
results from that--to produce so many chess boards and men that 
they can be purchased in the smallest village and that they will 
be cheap. 
  We could assign the task--to continuously participate in the 
construction of a transcontinental automobile highway that runs 
across all of Russia, Alaska and America. This is a realistic 
project. 
  That is, I want to say that we must task society with 
gigantic tasks. People must see the goal toward which they are 
moving at each actual moment. 
  [DELOVOY MIR] For some politicians, yes and simply citizens, 
the global goal is to re-establish the Soviet Union. In your 
view, is that realistic? 
  [Maley] I remember the Soviet Union and I don't like what 
happened to it. But that is an objective reality and we will 
hardly find the resources to return the USSR to its former state. 
  In general, a world process of disintegration is occurring. 
From my point of view, it has an objective foundation under it 
and we cannot restrain it with any sort of subjective wishes. 
Even such a rich state as Belgium was divided and Canada is 
being divided... 
  As for Russia's position and prestige, I am nearly convinced 
that I will be able to freely drive throughout all of the land 
with a Russian passport and I will be able to travel even better 
with the ruble than with the dollar. I personally believe that 
the ruble will become stronger than the dollar for an entire 
series of circumstances. Right now the Americans will overexert 
themselves with policing the world and God has relieved us of 
that obligation. We will be involved with ourselves. 
  [DELOVOY MIR] Certainly time itself. The redistribution of 
property has engendered such problems which Russian previously 
had not encountered. 
  [Maley] The primary portion of the people have been removed 
from the redistribution of property and monitoring it. 
Therefore, society has become highly stratified. This is 
unpleasant and dangerous for all of us. If there are more than a 
definite share of indigent people in the country, society will 
mandatorily be hurt. 
<H8>  We Cannot Be Rich Among the Unfortunate </H8>
  [Maley] This American saying in a free translation--"Live 
and 
let live"--signifies the need to maintain a definite structure 
of society. The state not only does not monitor but it is also 
not even involved with the overall regulation of this process. 
Therefore, on the one hand, if the number of capitalists 
increases in Russia, on the other hand, there is an increased 
number of lumpen, and we cannot avoid social upheavals. 
  Society will be destabilized each time there is a definite 
number of people near the center of gravity. And "lumpenization" 
is occurring at an increased rate right now. This is associated 
with the government's social policy and with the objective state 
of the economy. 
  While beginning reform, Gaydar struck all of society. I am 
not condemning him for that. Everything was done in a Russian 
manner, in a revolutionary manner. He saved us about seven years 
of revolution but, unfortunately, he couldn't put the pieces 
back together. 
  [DELOVOY MIR] Although he was granted that opportunity. 
  [Maley] If we return to practice, he who destroys never 
builds. He simply organically cannot build, another psychology 
is needed. Therefore, the attempt to make Gaydar the creator 
from Gaydar the destroyer turned out to be a failure. 
  [DELOVOY MIR] What do you think, why is neither Gaydar's 
government nor the one that follows it managing to deal with 
inflation? 
  [Maley] In the mechanism for the regulation of prices, 
benefits, the correlation of income and expenditure and the 
budget sphere, inflation strengthens the government's position 
since it places enterprises and citizens in increasing 
dependence. A more or less comprehensible economic situation 
will come with financial stabilization and, in this situation, 
the subjects of the economy--enterprises, entrepreneurs and 
individuals--will begin to acquire increasing significance and 
the government's positions will begin to weaken. That is my 
point of view. 
  Where there are no comprehensible economic laws that operate 
objectively, political laws and the laws of coercion operate. 
And since political power is in the hands of the bureaucrats, 
isn't it a paradox that inflation is advantageous for the 
government so that it can be more significant and more powerful 
than in a normal situation. 
  [DELOVOY MIR] Maybe that is the reason why the government is 
not completely following the process of decentralizing the 
management of the economy? 
  [Maley] All conversations on the liberalization of the 
economy are only conversations for now. As before, all resources 
are drawn into Moscow and all authorizing normative acts emanate 
from here. The Moscow bureaucrats determine how much veterinary 
vaccine to produce, whom to authorize to haul edged or unedged 
board, how many trees to cut down and how many stumps to leave 
in the forest somewhere in Arkhangelsk Oblast. 
  Unfortunately, to a certain extent the current regime has 
repeated--and in an even worse variant at that--the last Soviet 
regime. The current government is building a market economy, 
say, with its right hand and is tightening the noose on Russia's 
throat with its left hand, and more cleanly than the Soviet 
regime. So, there are uprisings locally, nonpayment of debts and 
taxes and the appearance of "Urals republics". 
  Right now it would be appropriate to recall the golden age 
of 
the Khrushchev period when the well-known freedom of regional 
economic policy was permitted. Salvation is in this, this will 
help bring the country out of the crisis. 
  [DELOVOY MIR] And how do you regard the institution of 
presidential power in Russia? 
  [Maley] In general, I am inclined toward the presidential 
form of rule, toward the concentration of power at one point, 
and toward single centralized [yedinotsentrovyy] management of 
the economy. Because a parliamentary republic signifies two 
centers of real power and, consequently, a confrontation between 
them and the opportunity for violators of the law to maneuver 
between the two centers. But it is difficult to maneuver near 
one center. 
  As for the president, Yeltsin is implementing a moderately 
authoritarian regime of rule and, while he is in power, I think 
the regime will remain precisely that. 
  [DELOVOY MIR] How much has this regime been optimized for 
today's subjects of economic life? 
  [Maley] The subjects of economic life need firm, 
comprehensible rule. Therefore, if we theoretically discuss the 
best conditions for Russia's emergence from the economic crisis 
then, in my view, we would need enlightened authoritarian rule. 
Not high-handed, but the strict authoritarian rule of an 
intelligent person or group of people who would be alongside him. 
  World practice indicates that a concentration of power 
occurs 
under conditions of very powerful crises, beginning with a great 
economic crisis, the events in Chile and in Germany during 
Adenauer's time. Under conditions of liberalism and many voices, 
a regime emerges which we had from 1990 through 1993. Events are 
out of control and the simple man is suffering as a result. 
<H8>  A Second Source of Hard Currency </H8>
  [DELOVOY MIR] Mikhail Dmitriyevich, you represent the 
military industrial complex and naturally the question arises: 
What role do the defense industry leaders assign to the military 
industrial complex in the future Russia? 
  [Maley] The military industrial complex will not have a 
future outside of the market. In the process, we recognize that 
the current defense industry's capacity is excessive for Russia. 
Approximately one fourth of this capacity is sufficient for 
Russia in order to totally supply the army's needs. 
  But if we resort to that enormous reduction, then 
75% of 
those working at the complex's enterprises will find themselves 
in the grist of the transition period. We don't want to release 
that enormous number of people, all the more so that there is 
work for them. 
  The Russian defense industry occupies one of the leading 
places based upon the product produced, especially based upon 
those items that were quite recently top secret or were in 
stockpiles of semifinished products. That is, our workers and 
specialists are capable of producing a competitive product that 
is being bought and sold on world markets. And right now we 
would not like to transfer our jobs to the United States, France 
or Germany or to cede further sales markets for our arms. 
  Utilizing Russian Federation legislation, the Constitution 
and presidential edicts, we hope to preserve our position in 
world markets, to strengthen it and to progress further, while 
utilizing the terminology and arguments that the United States 
and the NATO countries previously used against us. That is, we 
will demand equal rights with all of the remaining 
arms-exporting countries. 
  Of course, this will not be simple. In order to work for 
export, we will have to heavily restructure. After the petroleum 
complex, the military industrial complex can become a second 
source of hard currency for the state. Its annual potential is 
$8-12 billion cash and $6-7 billion are adequate for the 
complex's total self-sufficiency and therefore it will be able 
to annually transfer $2-4 million to the treasury. 
  At the same time, the military industrial complex continues 
to arm its army. We are giving it super new equipment and we are 
selling new equipment. The Russian Army will always outstrip 
other armies in the quality of arms and in the required quantity 
and at no charge--at the expense of foreign ministries of 
defense. 
  [DELOVOY MIR] You said that the military industrial complex 
will have to be heavily restructured. What do you have in mind? 
  [Maley] The development of market structures. We have been 
involved with that for the last two years and today we can talk 
about specific results. By way of illustration, the Military 
Industrial Complex Business Center is already operating. This is 
a quasi-governmental organization. Its mission is to weed out 
Western businessmen who come to us with $15 dollars in their 
pockets in order to make money from us, but then again the 
Business Center must track our business people who either export 
capital or promise to resolve any problems on behalf of the 
president and who immediately sell 10 tonnes of uranium. 
  Further, we are creating the Military Industrial Bank. In 
capacity, this is the lead bank of the military industrial 
complex financial company and it will be second after the 
Central Bank in the capabilities of the financial system. 
  There is one other structure--the Russian Military 
Industrial 
Insurance Company. It will assume responsibility for insuring 
everything that concerns the complex. 
  The fourth structure is an information structure. There are 
11 very powerful economic information institutes in our country. 
They have preserved all of the communications systems and 
essentially right now monitor the situation in the entire 
defense and nuclear industry. We want to unite all of these 
institutes into one information ring and, as an information 
system, to orient it not only toward servicing the military 
industrial complex but the entire Russian Federation economy. 
  I want to stress: We are creating neither a financial nor an 
economic autarky. We are simply uniting the complex's capacity 
and capabilities in an open form. These are open type structures. 
<H8>  The "Tiger" of the Next Decade </H8>
  [DELOVOY MIR] But are there problems? 
  [Maley] Of course there are. The last has remained, in 1994, 
during which we cannot accept junior specialists into 
enterprises and institutes. In general, this is the last year 
when our society can permit itself to not accept young people 
into economic and technical VUZs [higher educational 
institutions]. But later the already irreversible break will 
begin -- the break of scientific schools and concepts. For the 
military industrial complex, this signifies the loss of the 
intellectual level that previously existed. Therefore, we want 
to begin independent progress. We will agitate young people to 
go to technical institutes, to raise stipends; in short, to 
prepare the augmentation of educated people whom we need in the 
scientific-technical portion of the military industrial complex. 
  [DELOVOY MIR] Unfortunately, not all sectors will be able to 
begin independent progress and to train specialists for 
themselves, like the military industrial complex will. And in 
general, we cannot count on anyone, except the state, in the 
sphere of humanitarian education. 
  [Maley] If we want to take advantage of material and 
spiritual blessings, we need to outstrip others in the nation's 
general education level. A more educated nation and a more 
educated state always has advantages because they are capable of 
more rapidly organizing, anticipating the development of events, 
and technologically defining others. They will always be more 
wealthy. And material wealth always gives us the capability to 
develop the spiritual sphere. And here the process is on hand: 
The wealthy get rich in all regards, the poor get poor in all 
regards. Education--that is the key which unfortunately many 
people in the Russian government do not understand. And we will 
begin to degenerate if statewide measures directed at the 
support of education are not taken by the end of 1994. 
  [DELOVOY MIR] I wouldn't like to end the conversation on 
that 
sad note. Russia really has many problems. And maybe there are 
even more clearly seen from the side than from within. I would 
be interested in knowing, what does the West predict for us, 
while looking from the side? 
  [Maley] Isn't it paradoxical, but they assess Russia's 
opportunities more optimistically than we ourselves do. For 
example, the biggest American capitalists who belong to the 
so-called "Rapid" Group think. Of all of the economic "tigers", 
Russia is the "tiger" of the next ten years. They predict an 
appreciable emergence from the economic crisis in four years. 
  What is curious is that this prediction coincides with the 
assessments that many of our experts provide but are 
self-conscious about publishing. In the background of the 
existing situation, our bright future is being perceived for now 
as something remote.

<F P=106> [Article by Defense Enterprise Assistance League </F>
President A. Shulunov: "Conversion: New Approaches"] 
  [Text] According to the experts, 7-10 years and 
approximately $150 billion and purposeful management of this 
process by the government were needed for the current 
conversion. Actually, 117 billion rubles (in 1992 prices) were 
allocated for conversion during the last two years. The matter 
is also being complicated by the absence of precise prospects in 
the sphere of production of defense products and any plans for 
the production of needed civilian products, the mechanism for 
financing conversion and the appropriate normative documents. 
  In fairness, I must note that the foundation of conversion 
was laid in 1989 already within the framework of the USSR. The 
increase of the volumes of production of complex appliances and 
consumer goods in 1993 is largely not only the consequence of 
the initiative of the labor collectives of converted enterprises 
but also of the stockpile of unfinished products created based 
upon the plans for 1989-1990. Furthermore, approximately 1,000 
conversion programs, including 14 federal programs like 
"Vozrozhdeniye rossiyskogo flota" [Rebirth of the Russian Navy], 
"Razvitiye grazhdanskoy aviatsionnoy tekhniki" [Development of 
Civilian Aircraft] and "Razrabotki i proizvodstva novykh vidov 
meditsinskoy tekhniki" [Development and Production of New Types 
of Medical Equipment], were fundamentally produced, have 
undergone an examination by experts and have partially begun to 
be realized during the last two years. A number of regional 
conversion programs have been developed and are being 
implemented in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Udmurtiya, and in 
Sverdlovsk and Rostov Oblasts. 
  Three are quite a few positive examples of financing and the 
realization of some conversion programs by the state, domestic 
and foreign commercial structures and banks, but there are many 
more shortcomings. Perhaps the most substantial is the 
inadequate level and discontinuity of financing. In 1994, they 
planned to allocate approximately R4.4 trillion to complete work 
begun on 1992 programs and on programs that were approved by the 
RF Government in 1993. However, a total of R900 billion remained 
in the 1994 draft federal budget. Not a single federal targeted 
conversion program was financed normally. 
  Furthermore, the incorrect scheme for financing conversion 
projects under which both the customer and the executor, as a 
rule, act as one person of the converted enterprise and 
financing of conversion projects is carried out through 
commercial banks without the required monitoring is a 
fundamental error. Parallelism in the development of a new 
conversion product that is not needed by anyone is a consequence 
of this scheme. For example, 12 plants simultaneously set up the 
production of oil-producing bellcranks. Up to 70-80 percent of 
conversion resources didn't reach converted enterprises or were 
placed at their disposal at the end of the year. Essentially, 
conversion credits went for the formation and consolidation of 
commercial banks. 
  In our opinion, conversion money must be allocated only to 
the customer of the civilian product (to those customers 
involved with transportation, gas, oil, and agriculture), who 
themselves select conversion program executors on a competitive 
basis. Under this variant of financing, the customer is capable 
of finding additional resources if he is interested in carrying 
out his project. 
  For example, today the RF Ministry of Fuel and Energy 
annually spends up to $7 billion on the purchase of spare parts 
and new equipment for petroleum extraction and transportation of 
energy resources. The enormous production capacity of the 
missile builders, aircraft builders and engine builders that has 
been freed up is standing idle or is producing "frying pans". 
The slogan about hard currency replacement technologies has been 
proclaimed in state conversion programs but it practically 
doesn't work for the time being. 
  We have not been able to completely utilize the already 
created production capacity for the production of civilian 
products due to the serious financial situation of converted 
enterprises, the reduction of consumer solvency, and the 
systematic delay and reduction of the amount of state resources 
being allocated to the defense complex. But under these extreme 
conditions, the defense industry is increasing the output of 
civilian products by 1.5-2% per year. And the main issue 
remains--financing conversion and effective utilization of 
limited resources. 
  In our opinion, the state is obligated to assume 
responsibility for retooling defense enterprises to develop 
import replacement production; to introduce effective energy and 
resource-conserving equipment and technologies; to transfer 
dual-use technologies to the civilian sector of the economy that 
were previously developed in the military industrial complex; to 
develop export opportunities for converted enterprises; and, to 
render support to those defense enterprises whose conversion 
programs are not part of federal programs but are effective and 
directed at saturating the market with goods. 
  But regional conversion programs must pursue the goal of 
offering the opportunity to combine freed-up incomplete 
scientific production capacity to the region's enterprises of 
various sectors of industry and to integrate them in 
sufficiently long technological chains for the production of an 
end product. Therefore, regional management (through financing 
of conversion) of the process of the formation of new 
cooperative production ties between converted enterprises and 
also civilian sector enterprises can turn out to be an important 
factor for increasing the operating effectiveness of Russian 
industry. 
  Conversion cannot be successful without the state's 
substantial support. But the experience of recent years attests 
that super-preferential credits indiscriminately allocated to 
everyone provokes enterprises to knowingly submit unrealistic 
conversion projects. 
  We think that the enterprise conversion projects must have 
serious technical-economic substantiation, undergo an 
examination by experts and be financed on a competitive basis. 
Commercial banks can be involved in the dissemination of 
conversion credits only under the following conditions: 
Prevention of the diversion of allocated resources for 
commercial credits to third parties; precise determination of 
the time periods for the completion of documents associated with 
obtaining credits; strict sanctions with regard to commercial 
banks for the violation of credit granting terms; and, Russian 
Central Bank monitoring of the activities of commercial banks 
that are financing conversion projects. 
  We need to intensively utilize the finances of various stock 
companies and banks and attract foreign capital for the 
successful resolution of conversion problems under stingy state 
financing. Foreign investments of not only the MVF 
[International Monetary Fund] and EBRR [European Reconstruction 
and Development Bank], but also of companies that are interested 
in our products and scientific-technical achievements could 
render enormous assistance in the implementation of conversion. 
However, the absence of guarantees and the instability of the 
legislative and tax base is restraining foreign investors. 
  Many managers of regions and major enterprises have 
understood that without the creation of outside-budget 
conversion assistance funds [several words unreadable] which is 
the most rational form for the accumulation of resources 
designated to finance conversion at the regional level is the 
creation of the appropriate--oblast, kray, republic--conversion 
assistance fund. Its income portion must be formed through 
deductions from the local budget, payments of interested 
commercial structures of any form of property, and payments of 
founders. We can also recommend to the local authorities such 
steps as the allocation of raw materials to provide guarantees 
to foreign investors, the transfer of the primary funds of 
enterprises to leasing, and the direction of resources from the 
privatization of defense enterprises for their conversion. State 
support of these funds could be carried out by granting them 
various types of tax and other financial benefits. And, in my 
opinion, we need to develop and approve a typical charter of a 
regional conversion assistance fund on the governmental level in 
order to move this work off of dead center. 
  It is also advisable to grant conversion credits to 
enterprises under the deposit of property with the completion of 
the appropriate documents stipulated by tax legislation or 
through the obligations of insurance companies. The Russian 
Ministry of the Economy has developed and approved the 
appropriate statute.

  [Text] On 29 April General of the Army Pavel Grachev, the 
Russian Federation defense minister, met with South Korean 
Defense Minister Lee Ben Teh, who was in our country on an 
official visit. This was the first by the head of South Korea's 
military department in Russia. Besides the problems of further 
development of bilateral ties in the military area, discussion 
of the problems of security of the Asia-Pacific region, and 
chiefly that of nuclear weapons proliferation on the Korean 
peninsula, occupied an important place in the talks. The Russian 
defense minister expressed concern over the possibility of North 
Korea's abrogation of the Nuclear Weapons Nonproliferation 
Treaty. On his part, the Korean defense minister emphasized that 
the world community's task is to prevent worsening of the 
situation on the Korean Peninsula. 
  Pavel Grachev turned his counterpart's attention to the idea 
of creating a system of collective security in Asia. And this 
idea was accepted with interest. As a result of the negotiations 
the defense ministers of the two countries signed the 
Declaration on Military Cooperation and the Memorandum of 
Understanding Between the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense 
and the South Korean Ministry of National Defense on Military 
Contacts.

"Can an `Alien' Become a Cossack?: Russia Creating Military-Type 
Settlements on Land Bordering Finland and Estonia"] 
  [Text] "The call-up for the Cossack troops which we have 
been awaiting for some time has begun." These were the words 
spoken by Ataman Boris Almazov of the Northwestern Cossack 
District as he commented on the decision made by the leadership 
of Russia's Border Troops relative to granting Cossacks three 
border control points on land bordering Finland and Estonia, for 
which they must recruit the manpower. Under quotas set by the 
Northwestern Border District, the Cossack association Nevskaya 
Stanitsa and the Northwestern Cossack District are to supply 30 
conscripts to each of three border control points, with one each 
near Vyborg, in Karelia, and in Pskov Oblast. The general idea 
is that Cossacks are to be recruited in three call-ups to render 
the three control points all-Cossack in nature. 
  Mr. Almazov also said that it is assumed that, after 
completing their term as conscripts, most of the Cossacks will 
stay on at the control points by taking up contract service. "A 
criterion we applied in selecting the control points was 
availability of land which can in the future be transferred to 
the Cossacks so they can conduct their own economy. In the case 
of the Pskov Oblast border control point, for example, land is 
available, and everything is ready for Cossacks to settle at the 
new border," said Boris Almazov to SEGODNYA's correspondent. It 
is thought that, starting with the next call-up, Cossacks 
assigned to serve at the border will undergo--in addition to 
basic training-- special training to be administered in Cossack 
associations located in Saint Petersburg. 
  The Nevskaya Stanitsa and Cossack circle are already 
preparing for a ceremonial send-off to the border, with this to 
include a mandatory prayer service and parting speeches by 
atamans. However, with the problem of the border troop 
leadership resolved, the atamans ran into an unexpected 
obstacle: It came to light that there were only 80 men 
requesting assignment to Mr. Almazov's 90 billets, with 30 of 
them conscripts and 50 contract servicemen. The Cossack ataman 
remarked that although the present call-up is being carried out 
in haste, it would otherwise still be difficult to recruit even 
this small number of men wishing to serve at the border. 
  In addition, representative of the RF Northwestern Border 
Troop District commander Sergey Dugalev, who has doubts about 
the possibility of realizing the idea of purely Cossack border 
control points, said that the military commissariat has so far 
received only 13 requests for the Cossack billets. On top of 
that, Mr. Dugalev is not sure that young Cossacks will wish to 
settle in a new area and remain on duty on a contract basis even 
after they complete 18 months of service: "There is always the 
possibility that the Cossacks will not remain in border duty 
service after being granted land." 
  Nonetheless, Cossack atamans are full of optimism, stating 
that they are in favor of assigning to the new generation an 
elderly man who would live in the same barracks as the inductees 
and pass on to the young men "the Cossack traditions and 
spiritual values." The Cossacks, attempting to resolve the 
manpower shortage problem, decided to "expand the ranks." 
Nevskaya Stanitsa Campaign Ataman and Russian Army Lieutenant 
Colonel Dmitriy Simyakin explained: "We decided to make an 
exception, starting this year, by enlisting for Cossack service 
youths of non-Cossack origin instead of Cossacks by blood." 
  Northwestern Cossack District Ataman Boris Almazov, 
commenting on the above decision, remarked that "Cossacks at the 
present time constitute the sole Russian national movement that 
has a national, non-extremist orientation," and that not all 
ethic origins may have representatives as new members of the 
Cossack society. "We will not accept ancient enemies of 
Orthodoxy," stated the Cossack leader of the Russian Northwest, 
who is forming detachments for duty at the border control points. 
  Boris Almazov, characterizing the recent incident occurring 
on the Russian-Estonian border in which violators killed one man 
and wounded two others as a "real border conflict," stated that 
the border should be closed, and the ones best able to handle 
that are the Cossacks. This, especially considering the fact 
that there are cadres who have completed their "trial period," 
in that in the Fedorovka Stanitsa, which is included in the 
Nevskaya Stanitsa, most members have done some fighting on the 
side of the Bosnian Serbs. 
  Incidentally, the above holds true only in case the "best 
cadres" are not employed elsewhere: According to the statement 
made by Nevskaya Stanitsa Campaign Ataman Mr. Simyakin, if NATO 
does not discontinue bombing Serbian positions, and if Russia, 
"does not as in 1914 set out to help her brotherly Serbs," 
Russia's Northwestern Cossacks will once again undertake sending 
volunteers to the Bosnian fronts. Then our border apparently 
will have to wait.

<F P=106> [Interview with Major General Gennadiy Zaytsev, Alpha </F>
antiterrorist unit chief, by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent 
Vladimir Berezko; place and date not given; under the rubric 
"Combating Terrorism": "Major General Gennadiy Zaytsev: Alpha Is 
Manned Only by Intellectuals"] 
  [Text] From the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA file: 
  Gennadiy Nikolayevich Zaytsev, born 1934. Graduated from the 
USSR KGB Higher School. From 1977 to 1988, and 1992 to the 
present--chief of the special group "A" [Alpha]. For courage and 
bravery in neutralizing especially dangerous criminals, awarded 
the title Hero of the Soviet Union. Major general. 
  Married. Son is a captain in the Federal Counterintelligence 
Service. 
  [Berezko] Gennadiy Nikolayevich, this is a special year for 
Alpha--it will celebrate its first "adult" jubilee. How did it 
all start back then, 20 years ago? 
  [Zaytsev] In the early 1970's terrorism in its most 
dangerous 
forms--hostage-taking, aircraft hijacking--began to occur in our 
country, too. For instance, in 1973 at Vnukovo Airport four 
armed criminals seized a Yak-40 aircraft with passengers on 
board. KGB and MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] personnel in a 
combined effort freed the hostages and neutralized the 
criminals. Despite a successful final outcome, the operation was 
tense because nobody had any special training in localizing such 
situations. 
  Taking this and other circumstances into account, a decision 
was made to set up within the KGB system a special antiterrorist 
unit. By the way, a little later an analogous unit was also set 
up in the GDR, also called "A." 
  ...At the time the unit had no more than 30 members. Within 
two months the unit was completely manned and training began. 
The first chief of the special unit was Hero of the Soviet Union 
Major Vitaliy Bubenin, who was the commander of this group until 
April 1977. 
  [Berezko] How many years did it take before the first 
operation? And how many of them has the unit conducted 
altogether? 
  [Zaytsev] It is my deep conviction, based on practical 
experience, that at least five years of intensive training is 
needed for the unit to exist not merely on paper but to get its 
personnel to the point of being able to act professionally and 
competently in any situation. Over this period people must 
become not just professionals in antiterrorism but also "adjust" 
psychologically. 
  The group conducted its first combat operation on 28 March 
1979 at the U.S. Embassy. What happened is that the embassy's 
second secretary Pringle met and brought into the embassy's 
consular section a stranger, who then threatened to activate an 
explosive device if the Americans did not take him in a 
diplomatic car to Sheremetyevo airport and arrange for him to 
fly abroad. And although overall the operation was 
successful--the terrorist, Yuriy Vlasenko, was neutralized and 
there were no casualties--I must say that even then not 
everything went smoothly... 
  Altogether, the group has conducted several dozen 
operations. 
  [Berezko] Which one is the most memorable for you? 
  [Zaytsev] The one I remember most was the operation in 
Mineralnyye Vody in 1988, since the lives and well-being of 
children were at stake. As you may recall, Yakshiyants' gang 
took 31 schoolchildren and a teacher hostage. This was already 
the second such instance in our practice. The first time, 
children were taken hostage in December 1981 in the city of 
Sarapula in the Udmurt ASSR [Autonomous Soviet Socialist 
Republic]. In that case, however, the hostages were 
tenth-graders, while in Mineralnyye Vody the children were 10-12 
years old. 
  All through the night and the first half of the day I had to 
conduct intensive negotiations with the bandits over the radio, 
trying to reduce their aggressiveness and in the end get them to 
release the hostages. After the negotiations, only the Il-76 
crew remained in the hands of the bandits... 
  I want to take this opportunity to mention the exceptional 
bravery and courage of military helicopter pilots Colonel 
Valentin Padalkin and Major Vladimir Stepanov, and the Air Force 
commander in chief, Lieutenant General (Aviation) Vladimir 
Mikhaylov, who just recently helped to free children taken 
hostage in Rostov. 
  [Berezko] Gennadiy Nikolayevich, as I gather, a certain 
"diplomacy" in bulletproof vests is practically inevitable in 
combat operation, is it not so? 
  [Zaytsev] The main purpose of such "diplomacy" is to reduce 
terrorists' aggressiveness, to avert violence against hostages. 
There are special tactics for conducting such negotiations, and 
the operative who "converses" with the criminals must possess 
extensive operational and life experience, "feel" the criminal, 
and be a psychologist to a certain extent, in order to "massage" 
the situation into the overall design. 
  [Berezko] But the special unit does not always limit itself 
to persuasion... 
  [Zaytsev] We have a very broad and quite effective range of 
means that allow us to take control of the situation. For 
instance, special grenades. There are also special weapons that 
have been designed to our specifications and are used only by 
the special unit. Frankly, however, I would prefer not to be too 
open in these matters. The point is that when we talk about 
this, we unwittingly arm potential terrorists with information 
that can be used against us. By the way, at the time Yakshiyants 
said straight out that before taking the hostages they had 
studied attentively all the literature on special unit 
operations in our country and abroad and even reviewed all 
available documentary footage. 
  [Berezko] Is there division by combat specialization within 
the group? 
  [Zaytsev] Each member of the special unit must be completely 
proficient in using standard-issue weapons: the Makarov handgun 
and submachine gun... There also is specialization: snipers, 
combat swimmers, explosives experts who can remove any obstacle 
with a jeweler's precision, radio specialists, and many others. 
  For instance, combat swimmers were utilized in 1978 in Cuba 
during the World Youth and Students festival. The Cubans 
officially requested help in protecting the ships Gruziya and 
Leonid Sobinov, where the Soviet delegation lived. Our personnel 
went on "underwater duty" together with members of the Navy's 
special team. Combat swimmers also are used in the protection of 
highest officials. 
  [Berezko] How do you "forge" the operatives' skills? 
  [Zaytsev] Through training, which is conducted daily. All 
the 
methodology we use is our own, but we also take into account the 
useful experience of others. 
  "Our" hand-to-hand combat includes the most effective 
elements of all known one-on-one combat and pursues one single 
goal--to enable the operative to fight an armed criminal in a 
situation of limited space. The methodology of marksmanship 
training also has been made to "fit" the unit's tasks. Our 
operatives go through mandatory training in tanks and paratroop 
training. In the final analysis, the entire program of 
professional training is aimed at developing in the operative 
the preparedness to take mortal risks for the sake of saving 
other people's lives. 
  Once every quarter the group undergoes testing by a 
specially 
developed system, which provides an objective picture of the 
operative's abilities. 
  [Berezko] Have there been instances of people failing the 
tests? 
  [Zaytsev] If a group member demonstrates a substantially 
lower performance level, especially in tactical and special 
disciplines, and does not draw the appropriate conclusion, 
dismissal is inevitable. But I want to emphasize that this is an 
extremely rare case. The main principle of combat training in 
the unit is "self-education," in which the operative on his own 
keeps himself in the shape needed to carry out the tasks. 
  [Berezko] Gennadiy Nikolayevich, it is impossible to foresee 
where and when the next hostage situation may occur. Is this 
circumstance taken into account in training? 
  [Zaytsev] We try to "play out" during training all possible 
hostage scenarios: in an aircraft, building, bus, open space, 
and so on. As to unexpectedness, we are in constant readiness 
for it. Each of our operatives has a personal call 
receiver--multitone--through which he can be reached. The time 
frame between receiving the call and the point where the 
operatives are fully equipped and on the way to the airport is 
no more than 1.5-two hours. One unit in the group is constantly 
on combat-ready duty, which in almost 20 years has never been 
suspended even for a minute. 
  [Berezko] The selection criteria for Alpha must be very 
tough. 
  [Zaytsev] Yes, the selection process is indeed strict. Only 
a 
military serviceman fit to serve in the Airborne Troops, between 
25 and 28 years old--an adult mind with the strength of 
youth--may be accepted into the antiterrorist unit. Our main 
"suppliers" are the Ryazan Higher Paratroop Command School, the 
Moscow Higher General Troops Command School, and two Border 
Troops military institutes. 
  First a candidate is checked with respect to physical 
fitness. Handgun marksmanship is a mandatory test. In some 
aspects, the requirements for the candidate exceed the norms of 
category III in sports, and in marksmanship--category II. At the 
same time, I want to say that it is much more preferable for the 
unit to have a candidate with a range of category II 
achievements in different sports than a distinguished master of 
sports in, for instance, classic wrestling. 
  And the most important part. More than 70 percent of our 
people have a higher education. A special unit operative should 
be not a mere fighting machine, but an intellectual capable of 
independent thinking, forecasting, and making decisions on the 
basis of analysis. The candidate's intellectual abilities are 
tested through in-depth study of his personality, tests, 
meetings, and conversations with the mandatory participation of 
a psychologist. If a candidate has a quarrelsome personality, 
there is no place for him in the unit. Each operative must be 
100-percent confident in his colleagues. More than his own life 
will depend on it. 
  [Berezko] You said that the maximum age for serving in the 
special unit is 40. By civilian standards, these are young 
people... 
  [Zaytsev] Our former members get offers to work for various 
state and commercial structures. In addition, the Association of 
Antiterrorist Unit Veterans has been set up and is functioning; 
it is headed by Sergey Goncharov, who is a now a member of the 
Moscow City Duma. The association's main task is to help the 
operative find his place in society after discharge. 
  [Berezko] Gennadiy Nikolayevich, unlike our economy, 
terrorism is currently on the rise. How do you see the prospects 
of combating this "plague of the twentieth century"? 
  [Zaytsev] These days we can only fight runaway terrorism if 
the state sets up a well-designed system for combating this 
evil, with the command of antiterrorist activities being 
concentrated in a single National Center. Also, we have to 
remember that terrorism does not recognize borders and we need 
to set up coordination and interaction with foreign special 
services, including those in the near abroad.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Manushkin: "They Pledge Their Hearts </F>
to `Polet'..."] 
  [Text] Earlier it was forbidden even to mention this 
enterprise in the press. The Omsk Polet Production Association, 
participating in creating the rocket-space shield of the 
country, was off limits for the press. Upon the ending of the 
cold war, with the warming of the international climate, the 
entire world learned about the association. 
  From the "K3" dossier. The enterprise was established in 
1941 
on the basis of aircraft plants evacuated from Moscow and the 
Moscow region. In a few months the workers had to master 
standard production of the Tu-2 dive bomber. Over the course of 
2 1/2 years 3405 Tu-2, Yak-7 and Yak-9 military aircraft were 
constructed. During the postwar period the production of the 
Il-28 jet bomber was organized and 758 aircraft were produced. 
  The association also has priority in producing the world's 
first jet passenger aircraft, the Tu-104, of which 58 were 
constructed. 
  Beginning in the 1960's, under conditions of the strictest 
secrecy, Polet workers made "items" for use in space. It has to 
its credit more than forty international cooperation programs 
within the framework of the Intercosmos and COSPAS-SARSAT 
organizations. The two-stage Cosmos liquid-fuel booster, still 
constructed at the association, has put hundreds of Russian and 
international satellites into orbit. The Polet Association also 
has priority in constructing Energiya assemblies and engines. 
  The twenty thousand workers of the NPO Polet, like the 
entire 
country, are now experiencing tough times. The enterprise has 
found itself in a very tight "vice" as a result of conversion, 
which was not fully thought through, the collapse of economic 
relationships among the former union republics and a shortage of 
financial resources. But here they not only do not complain of 
difficulties and problems, but also are searching for ways out 
of the crisis. The most important thing, in the opinion of the 
leadership of the association, headed by Valentin Zaytsev, its 
general director, is to preserve the scientific production 
potential of the Polet aerospace corporation and its unique 
production. The association is breaking its way through to the 
world aerospace market and is concluding contracts with many 
foreign organizations. In order to maintain a high production 
level, to conserve the skeleton of the design bureau and the 
entire work force, it was necessary, to be sure, also to engage 
in the organization of "incidental" production: automatic lines 
for the food and petroleum industry, machine building, medical 
equipment and instruments, washing machines and other household 
appliances. 
  To be sure, not everything has withstood the hard times. 
Some 
of the people for different reasons have left the work force. 
But most of the people have remained. Over the course of 50 or 
more years of its existence entire generations have grown up and 
a definite structure of social arrangements and amenities has 
taken shape. In short, although it is now difficult for many, 
one must go on. After all, the hearts of these people are 
attached to the Polet Association; many have passed their entire 
life here. The people believe that the Polet Association has a 
future.

<F P=106> [Article with no byline: "Russia's New Space Capital"] </F>
  [Text] Before the year 2000, Plesetsk (in Arkhangelsk 
Oblast), where no heavy-lift launchers or manned spacecraft have 
ever lifted off, could become the cosmodrome from which all 
types of domestic space systems are launched. That's according 
to the chief of the Main Center for Testing and Use of Space 
Systems (the Plesetsk Cosmodrome), Maj. Gen. Anatoliy 
Ovchinnikov. 
  The official date of birth of Plesetsk -- initially a 
defense 
facility where the R-7 intercontinental missiles stood in combat 
readiness and were aimed at the United States and were, during 
the Caribbean crisis, on red alert -- is 1957, when the wave 
with the first landing force arrived there. In 1964, the 
decision was made to re-orient the missile complexes of Plesetsk 
to the peaceful purposes associated with space. 
  Today, from the nine launch pads of the northern spaceport, 
four types of launchers lift off (the Soyuz, the Molniya, the 
Tsiklon, and the Kosmos), and they place in orbit nine types of 
science- or national-economy-related satellites (the Bion, the 
Resurs, the Foton, the Molniya, the Meteor, the Okean, the 
Musson, the AUOS, and the Nadezhda). Military satellites are 
also launched from Plesetsk. Over Plesetsk's nearly 30 years of 
history, two accidents have occurred (in 1973 and 1980), taking 
nine and 51 human lives. 
  Because of the indecision between Russia and Kazakhstan on 
the question of the fate of the Baykonur cosmodrome, the role of 
Plesetsk has recently begun to grow. Even if Baykonur is leased 
from Kazakhstan, Russia will still need a base for launching 
heavy-lift vehicles and manned spacecraft. That is especially 
important for performing the Russian-American program 
Mir-Shuttle and the international project for the creation of 
the orbital station Alpha. 
  In the opinion of Anatoliy Ovchinnikov, Plesetsk is best 
suited for solving those problems. True, the location of the 
cosmodrome -- far from the equator, which requires more power to 
put some space vehicles into orbit -- does present something of 
a problem, but one that can be solved. But the Arkhangelsk taiga 
and tundra -- a sparsely populated area -- is convenient as an 
area into which spent rocket stages can fall. In addition, 
radiation field effects are minimal here, which is important for 
the integrity of biological experiments. 
  In Plesetsk, the cosmodrome chief says, there wouldn't be 
any 
need to perform new construction -- some of the facilities would 
just have to be reoutfitted, and the living area would have to 
be renovated. That would take about 5 billion rubles at 1992 
prices, three of which has been promised by the President of 
Russia. But the biggest problem for Plesetsk, in the words of 
Anatoliy Ovchinnikov, is the lack of specialists and the 
assembly of launch-support teams. In fact, the drain of 
personnel has virtually come to a halt, and many of those 
serving at Baykonur now are getting ready to move to Plesetsk.

<F P=106> [Article by Semen Ivanov and Veronika Romanenkova, ITAR-TASS </F>
correspondents: "There Will Be a Cosmodrome in the Taiga"] 
  [Text] By the year 2000 Russia will have still another 
cosmodrome in the Far East, designated by the interim name 
"Vostochnyy," in the neighborhood of Svobodnyy. In contrast to 
Plesetsk, from the new cosmodrome it will be possible to launch 
boosters of the heavy Proton class, but they will be 
ecologically clean variants. This was stated in an interview to 
an ITAR-TASS correspondent by Colonel-General Vladimir Ivanov, 
commander of the Russian military space forces. 
  The end of the "cold war" and the disarmament which is now 
taking place has brought to the brink of extinction the once 
most powerful type of armed forces, the Strategic Rocket Forces, 
which this year marks its 35th anniversary. Under the conditions 
of the agreement on the reduction of strategic offensive weapons 
(START II) signed by the presidents of Russia and the United 
States at Sochi on 3 January 1993, the two great powers are 
continuing the disarmament process, thereby reducing the 
confrontation to a lower level. 
  Under the agreement, before the year 2003 all surface 
intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) in Russia will be 
liquidated, including the heavy RS-20 (SS-18), in the United 
States also called the Satan, which beyond the ocean had caused 
the greatest anxiety. As a result of implementation of these 
agreements among the seven types of ICBMs only one type will 
remain in Russia -- the RS-12M (SS-25), both mobile and 
stationary. The first missiles to be destroyed will be those 
developed and constructed at an earlier time -- the RS-16 
(SS-11), RS-12 (SS-13) and RS-16 (SS-17). In order not to leave 
the impression that there is a unilateral disarmament of Russia, 
it also must be noted that American ICBMs also will be destroyed 
or reoutfitted. 
  By the beginning of 21st century some of the 20 Russian 
regions of deployment of the offensive missile complexes of the 
Strategic Rocket Forces now in existence will cease to be. These 
will include first of all the Vershet (Perm Oblast), Drovyanaya 
and Yasnaya (Chita Oblast), Kostroma, Krasnoyarsk and Svobodnyy 
(Amur Oblast) regions. 
  Until recently Svobodnyy remained the most eastern region of 
deployment. The armament there consisted of the RS-10 ICBM, 
aimed at the United States. This single-warhead 17-m missile 
with a launching weight of more than 50 tons carried a nuclear 
charge of 1.1 megaton, which is 50 times greater than the power 
of the bomb dropped at Hiroshima by the United States in 1945. 
  So it happened that a wise government decision to reoutfit a 
defense facility at Plesetsk into a space facility was made 
almost 30 years ago -- in 1964. Now, after all the years have 
passed, a similar decision has been made with respect to 
reductions of the rocket division at Svobodnyy, which was going 
under the knife. As a result, the Svobodnyy facility will be 
retained, but it will play a different role -- as the Main 
Center for Testing and Use of Space Equipment (TsIPKS). 
  A little more than two weeks remain to the meeting of the 
presidents of Russia and Kazakhstan, planned for the end of 
March, which in many respects can and must be important. Because 
the documents signed as a result of this meeting -- especially 
with respect to the Baykonur cosmodrome (contract and 
agreement), as well as with respect to military-technical 
cooperation, should determine the future relations of the two 
countries in these fields up to the beginning of the 21st 
century. 
  The interests of the defense capability and safety of Russia 
cannot and must not in any way be made dependent on the policy 
of another state, even if it is a friendly state which is part 
of the CIS. Precisely this has dictated the striving of Russia 
to have its own cosmodrome; Svobodnyy was selected as the final 
location (initially three possible variants were examined). A 
well-built residential city of rocket forces, a hospital and 
other infrastructure facilities costing several hundreds of 
millions of rubles, which now, it seems, is to receive a "second 
wind," are already here and the rocket forces, performing their 
military duties, will launch boosters and spacecraft into space. 
  It is proposed that two launch facilities for heavy boosters 
of the Proton type, but new, ecologically clean variants, will 
be constructed in the neighborhood of Svobodnyy. 
  Unfortunately, the short-sighted position of the Russian 
Space Agency (RSA), not fully taking the interests of Russia 
into account, precluded the participation of Plesetsk in 
implementing the project for constructing the Alpha 
international orbital station. This position scarcely can be 
justified by the "youth" of the RSA, recently marking its second 
anniversary. After all, the governmental males standing at the 
"space helm" have gone through the real "Momovskaya school" 
(Ministry of General Machine Building [MOM]). Nevertheless, the 
Alpha project approved by them is completely oriented on 
Baykonur. But under the conditions of nonfinalization of the 
negotiations with Kazakhstan with respect to Baykonur, 
complicated by the on-again off-again approach of that 
independent state, the international project will be 
considerably more difficult to implement from the purely 
political point of view. 
  Therefore, in order for Russia to carry out an independent 
space policy and to ensure guaranteed access to space Russia has 
been forced, using the existing infrastructure, to proceed to 
the reoutfitting and construction of a new cosmodrome in the Far 
East where more than three thousand rocket troops now serve.

<F P=106> [Article by Boris Ostroumov, deputy director of the Russian </F>
Space Agency: "...Not Assistants, But Partners"] 
  [Text] We're fighting for survival. This year, despite all 
the ukases and decrees signed, we've received only one percent 
of the money promised from the budget. Had we not found 
additional financing from abroad, we would have ceased our 
operations long ago. That is why the draft of the agreement is, 
in fact, beneficial to us. Yes, the amount of money allocated to 
us by NASA seems insignificant. But that's all the American 
space agency could afford from its budget. And yet, that's 
certainly not the only source for attracting hard currency. All 
the rest of the revenues will be decided on at the level of the 
manufacturers themselves. That means direct ties and agreements 
between, say, the Boeing firm and NPO Energiya, or between 
Rockwell and the Yuzhnoye Design Bureau. Each individual 
assembly, rescue craft, spacesuit, and so forth -- for all that 
there are tenders, income, contracts. With that, we agreed from 
the very beginning that the price of an item would be based on 
the value of a norm-hour of work of the engineer and the 
manufacturer in American terms. And there are already three such 
contracts. 
  Yes, we are conducting negotiations that are not very 
simple. 
The complexity of our position stems from the fact that we 
entered that stage when the initial draft of the agreement was 
already worked out. 
  What is fundamental is the station's name itself. We are 
insisting that the station have international status. The 
Americans prefer to call it an American station, with 
participation by foreign partners. We haven't forgotten for a 
minute that the most crucial work has fallen our way -- the 
creation of a space infrastructure. That represents a solid 
contribution in terms of power engineering, life-support-system 
work, and the organization of freight flow. All that, based on 
the totals for each period of operation of the station, should 
be assessed by a joint council. And each contribution is 
evaluated in money terms, and the jointly acquired information 
divided up on the basis of that. 
  Moreover, we will work to see to it that Russia gets the 
right not only to work independently on its autonomous module, 
but also to use all the station's equipment for its work. We 
have signed an intellectual property agreement that stipulates 
that information acquired jointly also belongs to all the 
countries that have taken part in acquiring it. 
  And the fears of the loss of the Flight Control Center and 
the Cosmonaut Training Center are unfounded. As we know, not 
only have Russian cosmonauts gone through training in the United 
States, but vice-versa. And it would also be impossible to close 
the Flight Control Center: it's a huge science center that's 
linked to more than just a station. 
  The alternative of creating a station with ESA is also 
unrealistic. The Europeans, no less than the Americans, operate 
on the principle of "money up front." Russia can't enter ESA, 
because we don't have the money for the entry share. 
  The orbit chosen for the station is based on the technical 
capabilities of the shuttles, but that doesn't mean that the 
United States is in a more advantageous position than we are, 
because they prefer to perform studies of the ground with 
satellites. 
  It's my hope that the agreement draft under discussion, 
after 
being signed by the President of Russia, will attach particular 
significance to the fulfillment of the obligations made in 
connection with it.

<F P=106> [Article by Veronika Romanenkova and Semen Ivanov: "`Mirnyy' </F>
[Peaceful] in Actuality Wants To Be Such and Does Not Forever 
Want To Be a Backup"] 
  [Text] The launch of the latest space vehicle from the 
Plesetsk cosmodrome took place in the early morning, but lights 
burned in many windows of houses in Mirnyy city, the Plesetsk 
"capital": people awaited the launch. Although launches of space 
rockets long have been commonplace for the local inhabitants, in 
every case excitement prevails. 
  In a city with a population of 50 000 it is the military 
personnel, sometimes risking their lives, who constitute the 
"backbone." Two major accidents have occurred here, in 1973 and 
1980. Nine died in the first case and more than 50 in the second. 
  The official date of founding of Plesetsk, initially a 
defense base whose R-7 intercontinental missiles were aimed at 
the United States, is set at 15 July 1957. In 1964 a decision 
was made to reoutfit and reorient the Plesetsk rocket facilities. 
  Today four types of boosters (Soyuz, Molniya, Tsiklon, 
Cosmos) are launched from the northern spaceport and nine types 
of satellites are put into orbit for scientific and economic 
purposes: Bion, Resurs, Foton, Molniya, Meteor, Okean, Musson, 
AUOS, Nadezhda. Military satellites also are launched from here. 
  Launches at Plesetsk take place from nine launch complexes 
scattered over the Arkhangelsk taiga. Rails, along which rockets 
with satellites are transported from the hangars of the 
repair-test facilities, extend to the launch pads. The launch 
pad for the Tsiklon-3 booster, for example, prior to the arrival 
of a rocket is an extremely modest concreted surface with a 
rise. However, when a rocket is brought up an erector rises from 
the ground surface and this is used in bringing the rocket into 
a vertical position. After several minutes it occupies its 
initial position. 
  The most dangerous stage in preparing rockets for launch is 
their fueling. The fuel used is ultratoxic asymmetric dimethyl 
hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide. Specialists fill the tanks of 
their stages while wearing gas masks and special protective 
suits because this is a fuel which if it gets on the skin 
threatens very severe burns. The quantity of fuel for each type 
of rocket is different, but in any case it is more than 100 tons. 
  The soldiers of the military space forces have several 
prelaunch traditions. The commander never scolds his 
subordinates at the launch pad. If any irregularity is 
discovered, it is rectified under exceptionally calm conditions. 
On the other hand, after the launch a "flight debriefing" is 
carried out. Prior to each launch of any booster the last person 
to leave the launch pad is the commander, the head of the 
military unit, thereby taking all responsibility on himself. 
  At the present time Plesetsk is the busiest spaceport in the 
world: almost 70% of all Russian satellites are launched 
from 
here and for the time being it is the only cosmodrome in the 
Russian Federation. In contrast to Baykonur, heavy boosters of 
the Proton type, carrying space vehicles into distant space and 
into stationary orbits, as well as manned ships, are not 
launched from here. 
  In addition, the project for constructing the Alpha 
international orbital station, as well as the further 
implementation of the Russian- American Mir-Shuttle program, are 
oriented on launches of boosters solely from Baykonur (territory 
of a "third" country, Kazakhstan). 
  However, Major General Anatoliy Ovchinnikov, chief of the 
Main Center for Tests and Use of Space Equipment, feels that his 
facility is best suited for the solution of these problems. The 
territorial location of the cosmodrome, far from the equator, 
which requires a greater power for the launch of some space 
vehicles into orbit, gives rise to some problem which, to be 
sure, is solvable. On the other hand, precisely the Arkhangelsk 
taiga and tundra -- a poorly populated terrain -- are convenient 
for regions of falling of spent rocket stages. In addition, here 
there is a minimum effect from the radiation field, which is 
important for the purity of scientific biological experiments. 
  At Plesetsk, asserts the head of the cosmodrome, there is no 
need to undertake new construction, only to complete some 
structures and to carry out reconstruction of the "habitat." The 
buildup will require about five billion rubles in 1992 prices, 
three billion of which have been promised by the president of 
Russia. For the time being even the reception of guests is an 
enormous problem. Although several buildings are called hotels, 
to adapt to existence in them is extremely tough: the paint is 
peeling from the walls and the ceilings in places threaten to 
come down on your head; they are scarcely heated, so that in 
winter it is necessary to sleep in one's outer clothing and hot 
water also is not to be had. 
  According to the "native inhabitants" of Mirnyy, they do not 
live much better. By no means do all of them have apartments, 
they live in common quarters where conditions are even worse 
than in the hotels. The same conditions apply with respect to 
heat and hot water. 
  As stated by Anatoliy Ovchinnikov, many of the personnel, 
especially from the Ukraine, have virtually disappeared from 
Plesetsk, whereas many of those serving at Baykonur, where 
things are getting worse, are striving to resettle in the north. 
And nevertheless there are insufficient personnel for the full 
staffing of military units: highly qualified specialists receive 
the same pay as the remaining military personnel, plus a 
differential for serving in the north which is "eaten up" by the 
higher prices in the stores. 
  There also are many difficulties with the development of 
space equipment. For example, only a few specialists who 
assemble solar cells for space vehicles have remained in Russia. 
This very intricate manual work requires not only high 
professionalism, but also infinite patience: from platelets 
measuring only a few millimeters it is necessary to "glue 
together" a panel of solar cells whose area is several square 
meters. 
  Despite all these difficulties, by investing considerable 
sums in Plesetsk, according to Anatoliy Ovchinnikov, by the year 
2000 it could be made ready for launches of heavy boosters and 
manned ships. However, according to the calculations of 
specialists of the military space forces, it would be more 
efficient to spend this money on constructing a new cosmodrome 
in the Far East. At Plesetsk, evidently, only the launch pads 
for intermediate-class boosters of the Zenit type will be 
completed and at the future eastern cosmodrome by the beginning 
of the 21st century there will be two launch facilities for 
boosters of the Proton type, but in a more modern variant which 
is ecologically clean.

<F P=106> [Comments by Vladimir Polevanov, governor of Amur Oblast, to </F>
Nikolay Beliy, special correspondent for ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, 
dateline Amur Oblast: "Will There Be a Cosmodrome on the Amur?;" 
first paragraph is source introduction] 
  [Text] The large national project for the 
construction of a new Russian cosmodrome on the Amur could 
wither in the "coordination" stage. Commenting at the request of 
the ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent on the possibility of the 
construction of a new domestic cosmodrome between the Amur and 
Zeya rivers, the governor of the Amur Oblast, Vladimir 
Polevanov, had no idea, it seems, what effect his affirmative 
response would engender. 
  The issue centers on the creation of a unique testing ground 
from which heavy-lift launchers such as Proton, Zenit, and even 
Energiya would be able to place in orbit virtually any space 
vehicle. Whether the far reaches of Russia will become the space 
"New Vasyuks" is a question that, more than anything else, 
depends on money. 
  But the position of the leadership of the oblast is 
pragmatic 
and therefore, on the outside only, appears immovable. The 
project -- if, of course, it is carried out -- will bring into 
the weak economy of the Amur region large capital investment, 
will create new jobs, and will raise the prestige of a poor far 
eastern province. The opposition has its own radically opposite 
point of view: the idea is bad, and the site itself won't hold 
up to criticism. 
  You'll recall how three years ago, in this same place, in 
the 
Amur region, a project almost as large and of an international 
nature was successfully frozen. At that time, when the first 
administration of the Amur Oblast was still in office, the plan 
called for throwing up an automobile/train bridge across the 
border-running Amur, near Blagoveshchensk. Now the third 
administration is in office. But everything is still the way the 
dacha holders across whose plots the transcontinental highway 
was to be built decided long ago it would be. The bridge isn't 
being built, even though there is even a special decree of the 
Government of Russia to have it done. Won't the new project, 
which also has an international significance -- China and Japan 
have already shown their interest in it -- meet the same fate? 
  Before it even came about, the project divided scientists, 
specialists, and residents of the region into two camps. The 
opponents of the Russian Baykonur are facing an entire social 
committee created to protect the future cosmodrome. Newspapers 
boldly manipulating the "public vote" are drawing horrible 
scenes of massive catastrophe. The far easterners are predicting 
a global apocalypse: the stages from the spacecraft that are 
launched will start falling on the heads of the Amur residents, 
and the jarring of the soil will cause earthquakes, which will 
cause the Zeya Hydroelectric Station reservoir to fill up to the 
brim, and the water will break the dam, and every living thing 
for hundreds of kilometers around will perish. 
  But the local residents are responding calmly to the gloomy 
predictions, and no one is running out of the places where the 
construction is supposed to be. Just the opposite -- people are 
declaring their readiness to work on Russia's future launch 
complex. A purely economic factor is at work: getting permanent, 
high-paying work and joining the ranks of contractors for a 
project that has state-level status means resolving the issue of 
one's own well-being, not to mention survival. Judging from 
everything, that's how the situation was sized up by the group 
that makes up the Amurstroyproyekt joint-stock company, one of 
the first to proffer its services to the military. 
  Why the military? The fact is that the new Russian 
cosmodrome 
is expected to be built in places in which, until only recently, 
the military were the main dramatis personae. The missile units, 
closed to journalists and concentrated in the forests and knolls 
near the Amur section of the Trans-Siberian Railroad, all went 
under the name of Svobodnyy-18. Not far from Svododnyy were the 
"articles" with nuclear entrails. Missiles without warheads 
were, the military say, launched from the silos there on a 
regular basis, and nobody had a problem with that, because, they 
say, nobody knew about it. 
  Thanks for the disclosure, especially since it comes from 
someone who should know. From, for example, the strategic 
missile forces division commander, Maj.-Gen. Aleksandr 
Vinidiktov. In doling out information to the press, he told 
about how, today already, they -- the military -- are literally 
being assaulted with requests that they employ machine operators 
from nearby settlements. They're taking many of them. 
  The residents themselves of the town of Svobodnyy-18 are 
divided about the possible transfer to the aegis of the 
military-space department. Most of the officers, who often work 
without pay, are for it. Space to them is not just some abstract 
world -- it's a means of achieving strictly earthbound goals. 
The facility, my conversation partner assured me, presents no 
serious danger. the nuclear weapons that used to be in the 
military units (those missiles have been removed from the 
military's possession) represented a much greater threat to the 
entire region. 
  But the issue of the construction of a far eastern 
cosmodrome 
is not yet settled. Having studied the circumstances, 
specialists have acknowledged that Svobodnyy-18 is one of the 
best places in Russia to build a space launch complex. In fact, 
it won't even be a cosmodrome, but rather the main center for 
testing and adapting space systems. Again, that's if it ends up 
there. One thing is certain and indisputable: there won't be any 
nuclear testing in that center. 
  Despite the encouraging last phrase of the professional 
missileman, the decision won't be an easy one for Moscow or 
Blagoveshchensk to make. Local patriots suggest that the Russian 
Baykonur be built wherever is best, but not on the Amur. Of 
course, one can't tackle such a grandiose project, one that is 
capable of attracting the attention of the world community, 
without performing in-depth analysis, above all ecological 
analysis. But what's also indisputable is the fact that the fate 
of a facility that is strategically important for this power 
can't be decided by a simple vote. By the way, in America, they 
built a cosmodrome in a resort state, Florida, on the basis both 
of national interests and local interests. But this issue, I 
repeat, is a state issue and isn't to be resolved as if it were 
otherwise. In fact, we're not Florida.

"Press Button for Launching!"] 
  [Text] "... 4, 3, 2, 1... launch!" -- such were the 
approximate words of German Titov, cosmonaut No 2, president of 
the Kosmos-Zemlya joint-stock company (AO) on the morning of 12 
April -- "lifting into the air" the Buran orbital ship with 48 
passengers aboard. It goes without saying that the space shuttle 
chassis does not rise a millimeter above its site on the Pushkin 
Embankment in the Gorkiy Central Park of Culture and Rest. The 
unique attraction is being opened on Cosmonautics Day. By means 
of monitors and computers it creates the total illusion of 
spaceflight. 
  A complex operation preceded the appearance of the 
supersecret space technology at the center of Moscow. In fact it 
was transported on a special barge along the Moscow River from 
the NPO Molniya and the Tushino Machine Building plant; it was 
even necessary to lower the water level in the river by 20 cm 
for this purpose in order for the multiton monster to be able to 
pass under all the bridge spans. 
  This Buran has not been in space. It is one of the more than 
10 ships constructed by Molniya and intended for surface tests. 
It had successfully passed these tests. Specialists say that if 
engines were mounted on it and it underwent certain 
modifications it would be able to make a spaceflight. But, as is 
well known, the highly touted project was put on the shelf. And 
our Buran would not live on if it were not from dreamers at the 
AO Kosmos-Zemlya. 
  They found a place for attractions and leased from the 
Central Park of Culture and Rest a half-hectare of land for a 
term of 20 years and outfitted a site for the ship. Then it was 
delivered to the site and now "preflight" work is at its height. 
  "The tourist `space voyage' is to last for two hours," says 
Semen Lvov, general director of the AO. "The participants on the 
journey will occupy seats in the comfortable passenger cabin of 
the orbital ship. Then they will be familiarized with the 
structure of the Buran and the conditions under which it 
performs flight, learn about safety rules, will be able to 
participate in flight control and assist the crew in warding off 
a meteor attack. For some time they will experience a state of 
weightlessness and then the illusion of flight will be 
absolutely complete." 
  The ship has "entered" a circumterrestrial orbit. Now it is 
time for a snack. Everyone is offered a dinner of real space 
food. The menu consists of more than 100 dishes prepared at the 
Institute of Nutrition for Space Technology for real cosmonauts. 
All the foods are tasty, nutritious and ecologically pure. 
  "We will require 300 servings per day," continues Semen 
Lvov. 
"This is virtually a year's production for the institute. 
Accordingly our attraction, it might be said, will save it from 
bankruptcy and will prevent unemployment. 
  "Circus actors have been invited to fill the `jobs' of crew 
members and in the course of the `play' their role will change. 
They even will be extraterrestrial beings. The stewards and 
stewardesses are now being recruited and trained. Incidentally, 
the company is inviting young people and girls to participate in 
the competition. Attractive and high-paying work in `space' 
awaits the winners." 
  "The Buran passengers will receive personal tickets the same 
as plane passengers. In addition, they will receive special 
certificates as spaceflight participants. It goes without saying 
that this is nothing more than a pleasing souvenir, but 
nevertheless..." 
  "The `flight' will cost an average of 29.50 dollars (in 
current rubles). The relatively high price for the most part is 
attributable to the expensiveness of the food products. The cost 
of the tickets varies, depending on the time of the flight 
(evening flights are more costly), on the makeup of the 
passengers (any sum may be charged for rich tourist groups). 
Plans call for complementary `flights' -- for orphaned children, 
for veterans of the Afghan war, etc." 
  "Advertisements of different Russian and foreign firms are 
being placed on the Buran fuselage, on the chassis panels, on 
the lighting towers and showcase displays. Even now the 
director's office has received more than a few applications for 
the placement of advertisements. The site of the attraction is 
clearly visible from the Moscow River embankments and from the 
Crimean Bridge, along which passes one of the heavily travelled 
city routes -- the Sadovoye Ring. Between May and October 
recreational ships pass up and down the river; one of the 
wharves is situated on the grounds of the attraction. By 
agreement with the leading tourist agencies the attraction will 
be included in all tourist excursions. Incidentally, it is 
planned that tickets for the `space flight' will be sold at all 
airports in the world from which flights to Moscow are made." 
  "The cost of 1 square meter of advertisement on the fuselage 
for six months is 3500 dollars or their equivalent in current 
rubles. The cost is less for the chassis panels, lighting towers 
and display showcases." 
  "We do not intend to transform the Buran into a messy 
billboard," declared Yuriy Klebanov, the AO senior manager. "The 
advertisement will be moderate, of excellent quality and taste. 
If the number of applications exceeds the possibility for 
placement of advertisements we will hold a competition for 
advertisers. We wish that the spaceship -- one of the highest 
attainments in world space technology -- will become a favorite 
attraction for thousands of people."

<F P=106> [Article by Veronika Romanenkova and Semen Ivanov: "There Is </F>
an Alternative to Baykonur. Get to Work, Comrades!"] 
  [Text] According to the calculations of specialists, only 
two years are needed for beginning launches of light boosters 
from the new Russian cosmodrome Svobodnyy. And although a 
special decree of the government on its establishment and a 
directive of the president of the Russian Federation on the 
designation of Aleksandr Vinidiktov as the head of the Main 
Center for Tests and Use of Space Equipment is expected in the 
immediate future, the Military-Space Forces are already in 
action. 
  The end of the cold war brought to the brink of extinction 
the one-time most powerful branch of the armed forces: the 
Strategic Rocket Forces. Under the conditions of the agreement 
on reduction of strategic aggressive arms (START II) the two 
powers are continuing the process of mutual disarmament, thus 
reducing the confrontation to a lower level. According to the 
agreement, up to the year 2003 in Russia, in particular, surface 
intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) of six types will be 
destroyed, including the heavy RS-20 (SS-18 in the American 
classification) which caused the greatest worry beyond the 
ocean. This 30-m "cigar" was the most powerful missile in the 
world and not without reason in the United States was nicknamed 
the "Satan." With a launch weight of more than 200 tons it 
carried 10 individually guided nuclear warheads (the power of 
each of which was equal to 11 of the atomic bombs dropped on 
Hiroshima) and it could transport 8.8 tons for a distance of 11 
thousand kilometers. The latest American 10-warhead Peacekeeper 
ICBM with a launching weight of 88 tons could deliver only 3.95 
tons for this same distance. 
  As a result of implementation of Start II, only one kind of 
ICBM will remain in Russia -- the solid-fuel RS-12M (SS-25) -- 
both in the now-existing mobile variant, and in the permanently 
based variant to be developed. This creation of Votkinsk machine 
builders (Udmurtia) has no standard-produced analogues in world 
rocket building. 
  The first to be destroyed will be rockets developed and 
constructed at earlier times: RS-10 (SS-11), RS-12 (SS-13) and 
RS-16 (SS-17). In addition, those ICBM which are constructed 
outside Russia, in the Ukraine, will be removed from the 
armament of the Strategic Rocket Forces: these are the RS-20 and 
the RS-22 (SS-24). American ICBM also will be destroyed (the 
Peacekeeper, known in our country as the MKh) or will be rebuilt 
into single-warhead missiles (Minuteman 3). 
  By the beginning of the 21st century some of the 20 Russian 
regions of deployment of combat rocket complexes of the 
Strategic Rocket Forces will cease to exist. 
  Until recently Svobodnyy-18 remained the most easterly 
region 
of deployment. The armament there consisted of 60 RS-10 ICBM 
aimed at targets of the probable enemy. It so happened that a 
similar decision on the reoutfitting of the defense facility at 
Plesetsk into a space facility was made almost 30 years ago. Now 
the same decision has been made with respect to the rocket 
division at Svobodnyy-18. 
  It is very simple to blow up the tens of silos outfitted 
with 
unique equipment, which, however, had already been partially 
done at Svobodnyy-18. But the defense capability of Russia and 
its guaranteed access to space would remain in question due to 
the unresolved status of Baykonur and the possibility that the 
Kazakh side will advance ever-newer leasing conditions. 
Accordingly, the former military facility will be preserved, but 
it will play a different role, as the Main Center for Tests and 
Use of Space Equipment, as part of the Russian Military Space 
Forces. 
  As planned by the Military Space Forces, the Svobodnyy 
cosmodrome in the initial stage will consist of two launch pads. 
After two years, in 1996, light space boosters of the Rokot type 
will be launched directly from the former silos. They also were 
constructed on the basis of RS-18 (SS- 19) combat missiles and 
already have been twice launched from Baykonur. Later three 
additional silos will be allocated to the Rokot. 
  But the principal task of Svobodnyy will be the launching of 
heavy boosters, for which two additional launch facilities will 
be constructed. Now the NPO Energiya, Khrunichev Scientific 
Production Center and the Makeyev Design Bureau at Miass 
(Chelyabinsk Oblast) are developing projects for a new 
generation of heavy two-stage boosters to be called the 
Angara-24. 
  Among the requirements imposed on the future rocket the most 
important is ecological cleanness. As the fuel for it 
specialists most likely will use nontoxic components -- liquid 
oxygen and hydrogen, as well as kerosene. The first stage and 
the nose cowling will fall to the ground. In the future the 
first stage will become multiply reusable and will make a 
gliding descent to the launch site. The second stage will be put 
into a reference orbit by command and will burn up in the 
atmosphere. 
  The deployment region of the rocket division occupied 
several 
tens of square kilometers in Amur Oblast. With the reoutfitting 
of the facility the area will be reduced in size and lands will 
be returned to the oblast. Svobodnyy-18 -- the "capital" of the 
cosmodrome and the former military city -- is located 
approximately 200 km from Blagoveshchensk. 
  As stated by Vladimir Polevanov, doctor of geological and 
mineralogical sciences, administrative chief of Amur Oblast, 
clear sunny weather prevails here 300 days a year. In winter, in 
January, there are only several days when the temperature drops 
to -30 degrees. Even melons and grapes grow here in summer. Amur 
Oblast is a far-outlying province of Russia. 
  The head of the oblast is convinced that with the appearance 
of the new cosmodrome the region will "boom"; not only state 
investments will come here under the federal program for 
construction of the spaceport, but money will begin to be 
invested for development of the infrastructure, industry and 
commerce. In addition, due to the cosmodrome the oblast will 
receive new technologies and jobs, will receive profits from 
possible commercial launches and information from satellites 
launched at Svobodnyy will help in exploring regions where 
minerals may be present. 
  Most of the local population for the time being is against 
the plans of the Military Space Forces and the oblast 
administration. The people feel that launches of space rockets 
are more dangerous than the nuclear warheads positioned here 
earlier. Here an unprecedented flourishing of the environmental 
movement also is noted, despite the fact that the future 
builders of the spaceport vow to preserve the ecological purity 
of the region. 
  The Russian Space Agency (RSA) also is wishy-washy about the 
new idea. The opinion prevails at the agency that the project is 
unrealistic because Russia does not have the funds. It is true 
that the disapproval of the RSA may be related to the desire 
that the Military Space Forces not "retreat" from Baykonur, 
where they fully support all launches. 
  So that the words of Colonel-General Vladimir Ivanov, 
commander of the Military Space Forces, that Svobodnyy is "not a 
retreat, but on the contrary, an active advance," have a dual 
meaning. On the one hand, this is a base for the development of 
Russian unmanned cosmonautics. On the other hand, it represents 
a strengthening of the position of the Military Space Forces in 
its relations with Kazakhstan (in the event of the next 
unrealistic demands which it advances with respect to Baykonur) 
and in its relations with the Russian Space Agency, which will 
be forced to play second fiddle at Svobodnyy if it becomes the 
sole possible place for implementing manned programs.

<F P=106> [Article by Oleg Falichev: "Russia Is Staying at Baykonur"] </F>
  [Text] So the prediction by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA about the 
outcome of the Russian-Kazakh negotiations was virtually 
completely right. And apparently it was because the logic of 
life itself -- especially the life of the recent difficult years 
-- prompted the two republics to search for a solution in a more 
intimate integration and strengthening of friendly ties. 
  Perhaps one of the most important document signed by 
Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Nursultan Nazarbayev was the Treaty 
on Broadening Further the Cooperation and Integration Between 
Russia and Kazakhstan. Specifically, it lays the foundation for 
cooperation in areas such as economics, culture, and law. Also 
extremely important are the Agreement of Strategic Nuclear 
Storage Facilities Temporarily Located in Kazakhstan, the Treaty 
on Military Cooperation, the Memorandum on the Basic Principles 
for the Resolution of Issues Associated With the Civil and Legal 
Status of Citizens of Kazakhstan Living in the Russian 
Federation and of Citizens of Russia Living in Kazakhstan. In 
all, more than 30 documents were signed. 
  As we also expected, some problems arose in connection with 
the resolution of the issue of the fate of the Baykonur 
Cosmodrome. But there, much was done by those working on the 
joint agreement during the preparatory period of the delegation. 
And although the last word was still with the presidents, the 
changes they inserted into the agreements on the status and 
conditions of use of Baykonur and the city of Leninsk turned out 
to be insignificant. The cosmodrome, under development for many 
years during the time of the Soviet Union and from which the 
first launch was made, on 4 October 1957 -- as well as from 
which the first cosmonaut, Yuriy Gagarin, lifted off, on 12 
April 1961 -- remained under lease to Russia. 
  The term of the lease is 20 years, with an extension of 10 
years. The Russian side maintained its position on Russian 
citizens -- military servicemen of the Military Space Forces of 
the Russian Federation -- staying at the cosmodrome and 
servicing it. The lease price: $115 million a year. The director 
of the Russian Space Agency, Yuriy Koptev, had this to say about 
that: the Russian-Kazakh agreements reached in Moscow 
acknowledge Russian jurisdiction over the cosmodrome. That means 
that the Russian citizens and military servicemen will live 
under Russian law. 
  With the Baykonur lease, we emphasize once again, both sides 
win, the citizens of both republics win. As for the people in 
shoulder boards, who, by the nature of their activity, are used 
to following strict regulations and clear laws, these agreements 
-- including the Treaty on Military Cooperation -- are 
particularly important to them. And what they say is that the 
period of uncertainty in Russian-Kazakh relations is behind us. 
That, like it or not, all of us have to swim together to the new 
shore under the rubric of "cooperation." That the popular wisdom 
that say that one old friend is better than two new ones is 
right.

<F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Ivanov, experimental engineer for rocket </F>
and space hardware: "Explosion on the Pad"; first paragraph is 
source introduction] 
  [Text] That explosion at Plesetsk took dozens of 
lives. The living and dead participants in the unsuccessful 
launch were pronounced guilty. Today, almost 15 years later, we 
can look at the situation differently... 
  On 18 March 1980, on launch pad No. 4 of the Plesetsk 
Cosmodrome, during the preparations for the launch of a Meteor 
launch vehicle, an explosion took place. Fifty-one people died, 
and several dozen were injured. The launch vehicle and the 
spacecraft and some of the ground equipment were destroyed. The 
launch structure and the launch pad required major repairs. 
  Immediately after the accident was reported, a State 
Commission was set up, headed by the deputy chairman of the USSR 
Council of Ministers, L. V. Smirnov. In the span of two months, 
the commission came up with several versions of the possible 
causes of what took place and set up several experiments to 
check them. But the objectiveness of the commission's conclusion 
couldn't help but be influenced by the large measure of 
potential responsibility that the various officials would have 
for such a grave occurrence or by the departmental interests and 
service ties of the experts. 
  The results of the commission's work were laid out in 
several 
dozen volumes. The lead volume contained the commission's 
report, in which the cause of the accident was pronounced to be 
the improper, unsanctioned actions of the servicing crew 
(specifically, of Pfc Velikoredchanin) in stopping a leak of 
liquid oxygen with an irregular method. Pronounced indirectly at 
fault for the occurrence were the leaders of the servicing crew, 
who were responsible for the correctness of the designs adopted, 
the adherence to the necessary discipline in conducting the 
operations, and the technical training of the personnel. 
  The investigations came to an end, the orders were issued, 
those remaining had to go on living and working. But besides the 
sense of unfairness that attached to the punishments, there was 
alarm at the fact that the true causes of the accident had not 
been fully unearthed and that they would happen again, no matter 
how carefully a program of measures to avert them was drawn up. 
On 23 July 1981, an emergency situation occurred again, during 
the preparations for launch of a Soyuz launcher on pad No. 1 of 
the Plesetsk Cosmodrome. 
  Upon the completion of the fueling with hydrogen peroxide, 
the crew reported serious heatup of the filter housing in the 
ground pipeline, which indicated that the component was breaking 
down inside. It managed to stop further progress of the process, 
which could become explosive at any moment, by immediately 
draining the peroxide from the pipeline. When the filter was 
examined, it was found that solder had melted, which could have 
happened only at temperatures of several hundred degrees. In 
light of the fact that concentrated hydrogen peroxide tends to 
explode at temperatures above 90 degrees, one gets an idea of 
all the danger that arose with the situation, danger that not 
only the experience of the leaders and the level of training of 
the crew helped to counter, but also a good amount of luck. 
  Studies of the filter showed that the soldering by the 
manufacturing plant had been done not with pure tin, which is 
neutral to hydrogen peroxide, but with a tin-lead solder, which 
became a catalyst for the breakdown. After that, it was 
established that the use of that very solder had been ordered in 
the design documentation. As it turned out, when the 
documentation was corrected, not long before the accident in 
1980, the type of solder was "simply" mixed up in the KB General 
Machine Building (the head developer of the launch system). 
  This became clear to specialists: the unusual catalyst had 
been found, the chain of evidence of the correctness of the 
"lower" version was completed, and the groundlessness of the 
"upper" version became even more apparent. The intentions of the 
critics of the official conclusion were very firm. But to prove 
with documentation that the rocket in the accident had been 
assembled with a filter that was substandard is impossible 
today. The most pointed accusations were made in the clay of 
collective irresponsibility. All that, based on the presumption 
of innocence, did not make it possible to regard the cause of 
the accident as proven in a judicially strict manner, no matter 
how obvious it was to specialists. One way or other, further 
investigation ceased. The decision adopted by the command was 
diplomatic: the penalties imposed were lifted, but not taken off 
the record, and those punished were not acquitted of all 
charges, but were pronounced to be "now free of the earlier 
noted shortcomings." 
  So what can we give today as the final assessment of the 
causes and effects of the tragedy of 18 March 1980? 
  What we now know is fully sufficient for the absolute and 
final acquittal of the living and the dead who 14 years ago were 
accused in haste and unfairly. Their fate is largely typical, 
however paradoxical and hard that may sound. During the postwar 
years at the testing grounds and cosmodromes of Kapustin Yar, 
Baykonur, and Plesetsk, interdepartmental commissions 
investigated several hundred unforeseen occurrences without loss 
of life, and in only a handful conclusions was the cause 
pronounced to be error on the part of the servicing crews. In 
those instances accompanied by loss of life, however, it was the 
servicing crew -- those who died, as a rule -- that was, with 
few exceptions, pronounced guilty. The temptation to use the 
dead, who couldn't respond, as the chief offenders was too 
great. The effect of such an approach was reflected in the 
results of the investigations of many other accidents, and the 
"convenient" decisions not only soiled the memory of the dead, 
but also maimed the living. 
  Restoring the truth is necessary, and perhaps it should be 
done quickly, while those who took part in the events are still 
alive and before all the materials classified "Keep 
Indefinitely" have been destroyed.

<F P=106> [Article by Boris Ostroumov, RSA deputy general director, </F>
and Igor Barmin, general designer, General Machine Building 
Design Bureau: "What Will the New Cosmodrome Be Like: `Costly as 
a Diamond' or Very Necessary?"; the first paragraph is an 
introduction] 
  [Text] The report on the establishment of still another 
cosmodrome in the Far East by the year 2000 was received with 
mixed feelings by space branch specialists. But will these 
disputes lead to the appearance of still another spaceport? We 
asked leading branch specialists to express themselves on this 
matter. 
  Boris Ostroumov, deputy general director of the Russian 
Space 
Agency. 
  The ITAR-TASS communication carried reproaches directed 
toward our agency to the effect that the project for the Alpha 
international orbital station which we approved is completely 
oriented on Baykonur and that under the prevailing conditions 
this is complicating its implementation. "Accordingly, for 
Russia to carry out an independent space policy and ensure 
guaranteed access to space Russia has been forced...to proceed 
to the reoutfitting and construction of a new cosmodrome." 
  First of all, I wish to be more precise and once again 
remind: the project for the Alpha international space station 
has not been finally adopted by all the partners and is being 
prepared for signature only with great difficulties. Many points 
are being refined and the interests of Russia are lagging 
behind. We are even trying not to use the very name Alpha.. 
  The fact that the project is oriented on Baykonur is 
entirely 
natural: today it is the sole operational gateway into space 
with a well-developed infrastructure. For example, the 
assembly-test facilities constructed for the Buran are outfitted 
with the most modern apparatus. Baykonur ensures launches of 
space vehicles into the necessary orbital inclinations. While we 
are not losing hopes for success in negotiations with the 
Americans, we have had to exercise still more wisdom and 
restraint in the dialogue with Kazakhstan. The results of 
negotiations indicate that despite the efforts of many 
short-sighted politicians there can be no falling out between 
our peoples. 
  The establishment of a new cosmodrome in the Far East is an 
expensive idea. I have already mentioned before that "each stone 
there will be more expensive than a diamond." In Russia today 
there are no funds even for ordinary bricks and blocks. The 
remoteness of the new cosmodrome from manufacturing plants also 
will transform it into too expensive a facility. 
  In my opinion, today, when preparations are being made for 
ratification of the documents signed with Kazakhstan, to raise a 
discussion about an "alternative" variant means to drive a wedge 
between the covenanting parties. 
  Igor Barmin, general designer of the General Machine 
Building 
Design Bureau. 
  The problem of establishing a cosmodrome in the eastern part 
of the country has a multisided character. Without question, 
Russia must have its low-latitude cosmodrome not only for 
implementing space programs, but also for solving problems of 
defense importance. The choice of a place for the construction 
of a new spaceport also has its pluses and minuses. It is 
fortunate that the construction will not be carried out in a 
barren place but at the base of a military unit already having a 
quite well-developed infrastructure. Unfortunately, the 
fulfillment by Russia of its obligations for disarmament has the 
result that much is experiencing an arbitrary fate. The choice 
of the place also is fortunate with respect to the allocated 
falling zones. 
  A shortcoming is the great expenditures related to the 
remoteness from scientific research institutes, design bureaus 
and manufacturing plants. However, in my opinion it is incorrect 
to consider the construction of a new cosmodrome as an 
alternative variant to the Baykonur cosmodrome. 
  The project for the new cosmodrome can be fully examined 
only 
when its tasks have been clearly set forth and the programs for 
whose solution it will be intended have been defined. 
  Only after serious and thorough working through of all these 
questions can a decision be made about the stages in its 
development and the time when it will be established.

<F P=106> [Article by S. Tsekhmistrenko, under the rubric "The World </F>
Over the Week": "Space Passions in Nonintegrated Expanses"; 
first paragraph in italic is from poem by Chingiz Aytmatov, 
"Stormy Flag Stop (And the Day Lasts Longer Than a Century)"] 
  [Text] 
  And again the trains were running from the east to the 
west and from the west to the east... 
  And off to both sides of the railroad in those parts 
were all the desert expanses that had been untouched since time 
immemorial -- the Sary-Ozeks, the Midlands of the yellow 
steppes. 
  There was not even any mention of the Sary-Ozek-1 
cosmodrome back then. Maybe it was only being drawn in the plans 
of the future creators of space flight. 
  But the trains still kept running from the east to the 
west and from the west to the east... 
  Forgotten in the endless Kazakhstan countryside, the "stormy 
flag stop" of our day is Tyuratam (that -- from the name of the 
closest railroad station -- is what the Russian military are 
used to telling everyone is the name of the well known Baykonur 
cosmodrome), which has, unexpectedly for most of our 
contemporaries, found its way to the epicenter of the serious 
passions that have flared up in recent months between Russia and 
Kazakhstan. Who could have imagined that the Kazakhs at the end 
of the 20th century would want to trade their customary steeds 
and camels for places in space vehicles. But the cunning 
intrigue that has surrounded Baykonur was topped recently with a 
no less cunning decision. 
  Nursultan Nazarbayev could easily be considered the creator 
and main persona of the intrigue. The bargaining with Moscow on 
Baykonur he conducted unhurriedly, having begun it when 
Kazakhstan announced its independence -- on 31 August 1991. That 
day, a delayed-action mine was laid: the cosmodrome, the city of 
Leninsk, and all the movable and immovable property in the city 
were declared to be the property of Kazakhstan. That moment 
could have signaled the end of the cosmodrome -- not wanting to 
invest any money at all in Baykonur (since everything would go 
to Kazakhstan anyway), Moscow nearly lost interest in it. But 
Moscow had a change of mind in time, after it apparently saw 
that carving out an alternative route to the stars would be 
fairly difficult in the coming years. And national pride played 
a role, too: why was it, specifically, that we had to give up 
what had been built by forces of the "new historical community 
-- the soviet people," where the Kazakhs are just a part of the 
whole? 
  Such thoughts came to Nazarbayev's mind much earlier than 
they did to Yeltsin's mind -- as early as 1992. That was when he 
first got the idea to create an international consortium at 
Baykonur. To put it simpler, lure Uncle Sam to those virgin 
expanses. The idea was then buried -- because Uncle Sam already 
has a cosmodrome in Florida and wasn't very sanguine about 
pouring dollars into the Kazakhstan sand. Replacing that idea 
was the lease -- that was what Alma-Ata proposed that Moscow do 
with Baykonur last December. And Alma-Ata asked what seemed a 
very modest sum -- $40 billion a year, which later changed to $7 
billion, and later yet was halved to $3.5 billion. Andrey 
Kozyrev, who had prepared the Russian-Kazakh summit, centered 
his dialogue with Alma-Ata in February on the last figure. The 
dialogue was reminiscent of the joke from bazaar life: "How much 
are the flowers?" "Twenty thousand each." "Why so expensive?" "I 
need money bad." 
  In order to force Moscow to be more compliant, Nazarbayev 
prepared for it an almost Christmas surprise. Even two. Early in 
the year, rumors were circulated on a consortium, and the rumors 
were confirmed by the January visit to Kazakhstan of a 
delegation from America's NASA. The aeronauts [sic] signed an 
agreement with Alma-Ata about nothing less than the conduct of 
joint observations of outer space and of space-vehicle fragments 
that could be hazardous to orbital facilities (you can imagine 
the face of the commander-in-chief of the military space forces 
of Russia, Ivanov, when he got the news that Russian fragments 
would be studied by foreign uncles!). And Nazarbayev, who was in 
Kiev about that time, reached an agreement on some sort of joint 
space program with Leonid Kravchuk. Negotiations were held on 
the deployment at the cosmodrome of some sort of "international 
space forces" hardly under the aegis of the UN, in which the 
Russians certainly wouldn't have the role of first violin. Those 
steps were viewed by Moscow with poorly masked irritation -- it 
wasn't about to share Baykonur with anybody. 
  Many years will have to pass before it becomes clear to what 
extent Nazarbayev's actions were calculated and to what extent 
they were a bluff. Certainly, aeronauts on the banks of the 
Dnieper couldn't even imagine themselves sipping fat through 
tubes one fine day aboard a spacecraft flying the 
yellow-and-blue flag. In actuality, there's enough money today 
to get to, maybe, the middle of that great river. The reaction 
across the ocean was much more interesting. Initially there, 
they sort of bit on the idea of a consortium -- the talks 
reached an apogee during Nazarbayev's visit to Washington. But 
then they rather rapidly came to nothing. Especially when people 
in the United States began talking about the unsuitability of 
Baykonur and its infrastructure for Western space hardware, not 
to mention the Western hardware specialists. 
  But Nursultan Abishevich achieved his goal: by the time of 
the start of the Russian-Kazakh summit, Moscow was ready to 
agree to a number of Alma-Ata's conditions regarding Baykonur. 
For example, the term of the lease (20 years, instead of the 30 
that Moscow had asked for). Or the lease payment being in hard 
currency (Moscow initially suggested payment in rubles, but the 
Kazakhs were too sophisticated to go for that). But those things 
didn't involve what was most important. And no one should be 
confused by Alma-Ata's consent -- too fast, at first glance -- 
to the amount for the lease, a paltry $115 million in all, 
which, in addition, is to be paid on a compensatory basis and in 
the context of mutual settlements between the two countries. I 
dare say that Baykonur, from the beginning, was regarded by 
Nazarbayev as a splinter in the country's side, as something 
that had to be removed at any price, but not without saving 
face. The splinter is now removed, and the face is glowing with 
profound, full satisfaction. 
  Having solved the problem of the splinter, Nazarbayev, stung 
by the political battles, has now immersed himself in a more 
customary element, advancing the idea of creating a new Union -- 
this one, Eurasian -- across the broad expanses of the former 
USSR. Declaring that the "euphoria of sovereignty" is now a 
thing of the past, Nazarbayev has concluded that the successful 
development of the ex-Soviet peoples is possible only on the 
road to consolidation in a new union -- a union with one 
parliament, one economic and defense policy, one border, and one 
currency. 
  Curiously enough, in fighting for the well-being of the 
peoples, the president of Kazakhstan allowed that now all of 
them are worthy of joining in on the new integration ecstasy. 
"Less equal" were those who, to this day, pay tribute to the god 
of war, Mars (the Armenians, the Georgians, the Tajiks, and the 
Azerbaijanis). The rest, according to Nursultan Abishevich's 
logic, will become members of some sort of "elitist club" that 
doesn't care about what's happening outside its walls. He was 
quiet about who would be in control of the club. One can only 
guess that the leader of Kazakhstan would give himself one of 
the leading roles in the EAU [Eurasian Union]. And in fact, it's 
true that Nazarbayev has long sat in the backyard of the CIS, 
and how can it be forgotten that they didn't call him to 
Belovezhskaya Pushcha? 
  Only the lazy ones in Russia didn't take up Nazarbayev's 
idea, and everyone is trying to palm it off as his own (the 
first to do that have been those who have designs in the future 
on the biggest, most comfortable office in the Kremlin). The 
first to respond was Vladimir Shumeyko, who interpreted 
Nazarbayev's initiative in his own way: a new union could be 
created, in his opinion, on the basis of already existing 
institutions of the CIS, including (clearly) the 
Interparliamentary Assembly, which is headed by Shumeyko. And 
his friend and rival, Sergey Shakhray, even intends to publish 
on behalf of the PRES [not further expanded] in the next few 
days a draft of a treaty on a confederative union, the basis for 
which will be the "same idea that President Nazarbayev has, but 
written in legal language." In that, apparently, Shakhray has 
garnered much more experience than Nazarbayev has. 
  The only one who has maintained a wise silence is the one 
who 
was the first to hear the idea of a Eurasian Union, Boris 
Yeltsin. And judging from everything, the Kazakhstan leader was 
a bit discouraged by the reaction of the Russian president -- or 
more precisely, by the absence of a reaction (it's no accident 
that, as he left Moscow, he kept saying that he wasn't joking 
and that his idea wasn't anything earth-shaking at all). The 
silence of the proprietor of the Kremlin lasted indecently long 
-- until Thursday, when, through his press-secretary Kostikov, 
Yeltsin uttered that he "showed a guarded interest" in the 
creation of an EAU. The morals to the story here could be two: 
"The cobbler should stick to his last" and "Don't eye someone 
else's bread." Anyway, we'll keep going and we'll see.

<F P=106> [Article by Leonard Nikishin, under the rubric "Crisis of </F>
Genre": "Russia Has Given the Astro-Vehicle to America;" first 
paragraph is source introduction] 
  [Text] A third of a century separates us from 12 
April 1961, when the first space flight was performed. Over that 
span of time, the world has changed in a way no one could have 
known, and space operations, with their broad scope, have lost 
their romantic aura and are being viewed today from pragmatic 
standpoints. But they won't have to answer to that criterion 
forever. 
  Twenty-five years ago, the steps taken by Armstrong and 
Aldrin on the Moon destroyed the propaganda myth about our 
preeminence in space, and since a similar Soviet program (highly 
secret) had crumbled completely, our leaders had to quickly save 
face with something else. The helping hand turned out to be 
excellent: an orbital station, an "outpost for man in the 
Universe." 
  They rivetted it together hastily, as we say. At that time, 
in the early '70s, the design bureau of Academician Vladimir 
Chelomey was slowly developing the Almaz manned station for 
military purposes (which ultimately was of no use to the 
military). The drawings for the structure of the living quarters 
had already been done. In Sergey Korolev's design bureau, those 
quarters were quickly filled with gear from the Soyuz 
spacecraft, and the Salyut-1 station was practically ready. 
Brezhnev, with obvious relief, announced that we were 
"travelling a different path, one that is step-by-step and 
focused," in the exploration of space. 
  The Americans had achieved the political objective of 
recovering the country's prestige, and with the end of the 
Apollo flights, they no longer thought about the Moon. But our 
fixation on orbital stations lasted decades. There was no 
particular mystery about it: here it turned out to be possible 
to have a propaganda gain, demonstrate the "power of socialism," 
strengthen "international friendship" in orbit, etc. Serving 
that aim were, primarily, the Salyuts, which followed one after 
the other, and, later, the Mir station. Of course, their 
numerous crews also performed scientific and technical research. 
The cosmonauts conducted observations of Earth and photographed 
it, they experimented with the production of new materials and 
biopreparations in microgravity, and space medicine garnered 
experience. In no way do I wish to cast aspersions on that 
research -- but it's important to note here that the results of 
that research turned out not to be commensurate with the immense 
amount of spending for the development and operation of the 
orbital stations. In addition, virtually nothing was later used 
by the national economy. 
  It was Yuriy Andropov, after he became general secretary, 
who 
raised the question, "Why are they up there circling around?" At 
his behest, the creation of a special commission got under way; 
but the general secretary died soon after, and with him the 
things he initiated. Then, during the years of perestroyka, 
Yegor Ligachev got interested in the same thing, but he was soon 
distracted by more important matters. 
  That's how orbital stations came to last to this day. The 
cosmonauts go aloft, stay in orbit, come down, and receive their 
stars in the established manner. And although the political gain 
today is -- let's put it this way -- minimal, the democratic 
authorities haven't set out to change anything here. Foreigners 
have worked successfully on the stations -- some for free, some 
for money that, for them, by and large, is insubstantial. 
  But the main thing is this: today, as it was two decades 
ago, 
everybody is busy. NPO Energiya, the Khrunichev Plant, the 
Progress Plant, the Center for Cosmonaut Training, the numerous 
medical professionals keeping track of the health of the 
celestial travellers, the space-forces officers, and -- as the 
last general secretary said -- so forth, and so forth. 
  That huge infrastructure operates at virtually the same tilt 
as in the days of the "great space victories," and it gets by on 
virtually just as much. And you won't find anybody who can 
explain clearly why this is being done. Oleg Baklanov, it's 
true, shared his uncommon thoughts on the pages of the newspaper 
DEN about the "karmic striving of Russia to the stars." 
  But in general, the golden days of the pioneers of space 
have 
already passed. And no matter how favorably inclined those in 
authority are toward it, they can no longer provide that endless 
flow of money. Buran, along with Energiya, had to be mothballed. 
They haven't managed to replace the ageing Mir with the Mir-2. 
And to tell the truth, the manned space flights were quietly 
winding down naturally. But something happened that broke the 
course of events. 
  The program for developing an orbital station in the United 
States has been in existence for 10 years, but its has never 
gotten off the drawing board. In a country with a flourishing 
economy, the state did not consider it possible to force 
expensive operations with fuzzy goals. Congress was stingy, and 
that's not surprising, in light of the strong criticism from the 
public. In fact, it's hard to consent to spending billions on 
something that is, as the NEW YORK TIMES put it, merely 
"adventures, and nothing more." 
  And here is where the Americans didn't so much luck out, as 
luck out incredibly. Russia showed up with its "karma." 
  An agreement was signed at the governmental level on the 
creation of the Alpha international orbital station with Russian 
participation. In fact, its proprietor will be the United 
States, which is giving Russia $400 million between 1994 and 
1997 for its contribution to the effort. 
  So what would seem to be so bad about that? International 
cooperation in the performance of such complex, expensive 
projects is a sacred matter. The question is, To what extent 
will we be participating, and how much will we be compensated 
for it? 
  The first stage of the creation of Alpha involves the 
development of the large fuel/energy unit and the living unit 
(base unit and service unit). And, of course, the transport 
systems. Russia is doing all that -- the Americans are limited 
to small units with science gear (and their expenses are cut by 
up to $2 billion a year). They are not rushing with their living 
module, leaving its development for after the year 2000. 
  And that's all for $400 million. By comparison, the 
Khrunichev Plant has concluded several contracts for launches of 
satellites atop the Proton rocket. The contracts are worth $600 
million. The annual cost of leasing Baykonur from Kazakhstan is 
about $150 million. "We're getting out of a tough spot today," 
Yuriy Koptev, director of the Russian Space Agency, blurted out, 
"and for three kopecks we're selling what it took decades to 
produce." 
  It's hard to blame the Americans -- why would they pass up 
an 
intellectual product that is incredibly inexpensive and swims 
right into their hands? But the question is, Why are we doing 
it? After all, the development, manufacture, launch, station 
flight control, and station supply -- all that goes far beyond 
the bounds of what is, in this case, the insignificant sum of 
$400 million. Everything can be explained simply: it's as hard 
to get extensions of that work in the context of a national 
program as it is easy to get money from the government for an 
international program. Just don't violate the agreements. It's 
strange that Prime Minister Chernomyrdin didn't see any of that 
when he was signing such an important document in the United 
States or when he was making substantial concessions to the 
Americans by restricting the transfer of cryogenic rocket-motor 
technologies to India. 
  The beginning of the operation of Alpha will be preceded by 
extensive operations by the Americans on the existing Russian 
orbital station Mir. American research equipment and gear is 
being installed on the Priroda and Spektr modules. Thus, the 
time will soon come when the station will be operated in the 
interests of the Americans. They will spend a total of nearly 
two years on Mir, and the cost of that will also come in at 
about $400 million; strictly speaking, that money will probably 
also go for support of those flights. 
  In general, the Mir station and all the designs adopted in 
the course of its development are of great interest to the 
Americans. In actuality, they are now completely revising it. 
The developers of the station's onboard systems were sent 
questionnaires containing 50-70 items. That unique transfer of 
know-how was indirectly stipulated in the contract, although in 
another place in the document, it said that the Mir station and 
the Space Shuttle (which nobody intends to acquaint us with) are 
national systems. 
  It's not hard to understand the interest displayed by the 
other side for our space technologies. In this country, there 
was a golden rain in that area; but in the United States, after 
the end of the Apollo program, there was never adequate 
government financing, private investment couldn't cover 
everything, and the best personnel, unlike with us, were 
certainly not concentrated in the space sector. 
  The interaction between the two sides is unique. All the 
joint documents, protocols, etc., are prepared by the Americans 
and signed in English only. At the same time, according to 
employees at the Russian Space Agency and NPO Energiya, the same 
small group of specialists went on the working visits to the 
United States, and they firmly attached themselves to those 
trips. Certainly not all of them speak or read English, and not 
all of the technical questions are within their competence. But 
they sign everything. 
  The scope of the work is large. The Alpha station in the 
final version is an entire space "settlement" with a set of 
national modules, although modestness here, as they say, would 
only be decorative. But the Americans are no longer arguing -- 
they have removed the main burden from themselves. 
  But we're still operating with the same spending mechanism. 
One wonders when reading the decree of the Council of Ministers 
of the Russian Federation titled "On State Support and Supply of 
Space Operations in the Russian Federation." It's as if written 
right from the decrees of the Central Committee and the Council 
of Ministers of the '70s, except that they were classified. 
Support, permit, allocate, disseminate... The last word pertains 
to all sorts of privileges -- the Russian Space Agency, of 
course, did not forget itself. There's even a markup for the tax 
"for classification" (it is still there, it seems). Not 15 
percent, as before, but 20. 
  It is felt that the impending, substantial budget spending 
does not scare our "marketeers," who, in concerns about space 
matters, have suddenly become (to the joy of the intellectual 
opposition) "state-men." But for which state?

<F P=106> [Article by Valeriy Baberdin: "Space Recluses"; the first </F>
paragraph is an introduction] 
  [Text] Eight female test subjects have consented to a 
unique experiment: for 120 days they are to be exposed to 
hypokinetic conditions. In this way a long-term flight in an 
orbital complex will be simulated. 
  When I dropped by one of the hospitals in the Moscow area 
where the experiment is being carried out (its doctors asked not 
to be named), in my mind's eye I already had visualized a very 
smart picture -- a group portrait on the first page of the 
newspaper, the smiling charming faces of young women. But it was 
not to be so. They point-blank refused to pose for us. 
  And this was understandable. We had dropped by without 
warning, like a bolt out of the blue, and moreover, at what for 
them was the end of a very hard work day. The fact is that the 
experiment itself for the time being is still ahead and at the 
present time the subjects are undergoing so-called background 
(like prelaunch) medical examinations -- one had been spun 
around on a centrifuge today, one had been on a bicycle 
ergometer, another had been on the orthopedic table. Plus 
prophylactic examinations, analyses and consultations with 
specialists. 
  "When all these analyses, and consultations with specialists 
are over we'll lie down and then you can come and there will be 
time to talk and take pictures, the girls assured us. Indeed, 
this is training for an experiment and it is being organized 
by specialists of the Institute of Biomedical Problems and is 
proceeding as for a real space launch. And there is no less 
excitement. For one her teeth were bad and treatment was 
necessary." 
  Another problem: to preclude contact with outsiders (God 
forbid that an infection be brought in, then the entire 1 1/2 
years of work would be lost). The scientific director of the 
work, Boris Morukov, candidate of medical sciences, only 
recently was one of the standbys for the space physician Valeriy 
Polyakov. These investigations were nothing new for Boris. 
Something like this was done, but with males. 
  "The experiment is necessary for the future flight of Yelena 
Kondakova, who in the autumn is being sent to the Mir for a 
half-year," comments Morukov. "A woman in space is nothing new. 
There have been 20 in the United States alone. But our flight 
will be long term. It is necessary to take into account all the 
intricacies of the female body, female physiology." 
  The candidates for the tests were selected carefully, from 
all of Russia. The call was already sent out early last year. 
The competition was announced by television, by radio and in the 
press. The requirements were quite rigorous, with respect to 
medical requirements the same as for cosmonauts. Here are the 
names of the subjects: Olga Semenova, Sveta Retsina, Tatyana 
Turboyevskaya, Zhenya Chelnokova, Elena Berdyyeva, Zoya 
Zhiyentayeva, Galina Kirillova, Natasha Chidikova. 
  Among them there are specialists of the Biomedical Problems 
Institute and athlete trainers and a construction technician and 
an economist. The experimental conditions are not easy. All 120 
days (!) in a row they are to lie there without getting up in a 
position with the head lower than the legs (it is necessary to 
ensure an intensified blood flow to the head, as in a state of 
weightlessness). The prophylactic tools used against hypokinesia 
are the same as on a space station: treadmill and bicycle 
ergometer. It will be necessary to employ these trainers in the 
same horizontal position. 
  I listen to what the physicians on duty are saying and look 
at the very complex equipment which will be used in the 
experiment and I am involuntarily filled with respect for the 
volunteer space recluses. Good luck to you, courageous subjects 
with great patience!

<F P=106> [Article by Valeriy Baberdin: "The `Siriuses': We Were in </F>
Orbit With You"; the first paragraph is an introduction] 
  [Text] We already have reported that the "Siriuses," 
Vasiliy Tsibliyev and Aleksandr Serebrov, the cosmonauts 
recently returning from the Mir orbital complex, were guests in 
our editorial offices. They were accompanied by the crew's 
physician, Vladimir Krivolapov. They all participated in a 
regular creative editorial office meeting. They told of the 
problems of manned cosmonautics and shared their impressions 
about the flight. We bring the record of this conversation to 
the attention of our readers. 
  V. B.: Your orbital expedition has ended. Not 
counting the accident occurring during the last minutes of the 
flight (KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has told in considerable detail about 
the collision in one of its publications), in general the watch 
went off normally. But surely you remembered something most 
clearly of all? 
  V. Ts.: There is much which can be said about the 
flight. Especially for me, being in space for the first time. 
That from above the Earth looks exceptionally beautiful is 
something about which you have heard more than once. No 
photographic, motion picture or video survey can convey all the 
colors which are there. Leonov and Dzhanibekov in their drawings 
attempted to use paints in conveying the colors of space, also 
in vain. It is not by chance that the favorite pursuit of all 
who have been in orbit has been visual and instrumental 
observation. 
  The northern and southern lights and noctilucent clouds are 
amazing when viewed from space. Although there is the 
superstition: if you see them, expect bad luck. In actuality, so 
it happened. Prior to the tragic October events in Moscow strong 
northern and southern lights were observed and there were many 
noctilucent clouds. Yes, and a full moon to boot. "The very time 
for the activation of schizophrenia," joked Serebrov at that 
time. And he hit the nail on the head. Information was 
transmitted on the state of the Earth's atmosphere, formation of 
cyclones and different kinds of vortices: typhoons and 
snowstorms. 
  V. B.: That is something not reported in any 
newspaper. The unfavorable days with respect to magnetic storms 
are listed. But is information on natural catastrophes in the 
making not far more important for people? 
  V. Ts.: Unquestionably. And if you set yourself a 
goal, it is easily attained. From above it can be seen clearly 
when different kinds of troubles are beginning to brew in the 
atmosphere. In America, for example, when we discovered that a 
hurricane was in the formation stage, the Earth was warned by 
amateur radio (on the Mir there is a special antenna and 
equipment for this purpose). Two days later they confirmed to us 
that hurricanes in actuality were observed in the mentioned 
regions. 
  On Sakhalin it could be seen that vortical movements were 
developing. And in the Black Sea not far from Novorossiysk it 
was noted that a waterspout was forming. The information was 
transmitted to the locals. "Thank you, fellows," was heard in 
response, "but everything is like normal, things will be OK." 
But after a day... Unfortunately, there is no such service today 
which could collect all this information, analyze it, warn the 
population in time and take other necessary measures. 
  V. B.: Tell about the condition of the orbital 
complex. After all, it has now been in service for eight years. 
  V. Ts.: Yes, a very respectable age. And an 
ever-increasing amount of time is being spent on preventive 
maintenance and replacing assemblies whose useful life has 
elapsed. To be sure, the body of the station also is wearing 
out. A whole series of experiments was devoted to a study of its 
condition, including emergence into open space. For Serebrov it 
became the tenth, a record. The work also was given the name 
"Panorama." We carefully inspected the entire station skin and 
used a video camera in scanning its individual components. 
  It could be seen that the station has been well peppered by 
meteorites. Fortunately, there have been no through 
penetrations, but there are indentations, there are very many 
pits on the glass in the ports and elements of solar cells have 
been cut through. 
  With respect to preventive maintenance within the station, 
the work there has no limit. It's pretty sick to fly into orbit 
for glory, for an award; on the station you have got plenty to 
do. You have to get in there with the head and the hands. You 
have to work as a mechanic -- with nuts, bolts and connecting 
pieces. Whereas under the schedule we were to go to bed at 2300 
hours, in reality we laid down at 0100, or 0200, or 0300... It 
was necessary to think out things which were not covered in any 
shipboard instructions. For example, we were able to repair a 
spacesuit for emergence into open space and it had cost many, 
many millions of rubles. 
  But all that is but half the trouble. The most important 
thing now is that there is no money and the necessary equipment 
and instruments are lacking. The cargo ships arrive not fully 
loaded. First one thing could not be delivered, then another. 
The food aboard the station came to be in short supply. Not 
without reason did we slim down quite a bit during the 
expedition. Earlier there were milk products in abundance -- 
then there was a problem. And remember, in space calcium is 
intensively excreted from the body. 
  V. B.: Is it possible that they could no longer 
find milk for the cosmonauts? 
  V. Ts.: Not just that. It turned out that boxes 
with canned meats on the Progress were empty or were packed with 
something else. If society is already sick, the sickness affects 
all aspects of its life. 
  V. B.: And nevertheless, when they asked you to 
remain in space for additional time you willingly agreed? 
  V. Ts.: It would be dishonest to say that it was 
entirely willingly. We simply appraised the situation and 
understood that there was no other recourse. Initially the 
program was to last for 147 days. It was assumed that it was 
necessary to remain in orbit for two or three weeks more. But it 
turned out to be two months. To be sure, psychological stress 
was involved and it had to be dealt with. And there was nothing 
which could be done about it. 
  V. B.: Speak frankly, during this time did you not 
become bored with one another? Did it not get on your nerves to 
be together in a restricted space? 
  V. Ts.: I tell you frankly and with complete 
responsibility that we had no such problems. And, indeed, there 
was no time to quarrel. Serebrov worked in one module and I in 
another. But we rushed to the table at dinner time like we were 
starving. On the other hand, we periodically made the effort to 
see one another. 
  The fact is that on the station in the space behind panels 
there are places where you can creep (under weightlessness 
conditions this is far easier to do), but from which you cannot 
extricate yourself without help. In addition, there are spaces 
not ventilated by fans. You get distracted by your work and 
carbon dioxide is released from your body, forming a stable 
spherical envelope around you. A person without realizing it 
first becomes intoxicated and then is poisoned by the gas and 
falls asleep. 
  V. B.: We've been talking about food, but tell us, 
for holidays did they not deliver an alcoholic beverage in tubes 
into orbit? 
  V. Ts.: Only if you tried to have it delivered. 
  V. B.: Did you try? 
  V. Ts.: And why does that interest you? 
  V. B.: Boris Serebrov. In your time you and 
Aleksandr Viktorenko were the first to test the SPK, the "space 
motorcycle," in action as a means for cosmonaut movement in open 
space. Since that time it's been forgotten. What happened to it? 
  A. S.: In general in a normal state it is placed 
in the locking chamber in a dismantled form. The machine is 
excellent, but there is no fuel -- a special compressed gas -- 
for it. When I arrived for training in the cosmonaut detachment, 
once again I tried out in the trainer to see if I had lost skill 
in controlling the "motorcycle." The exercise was not one of the 
easiest: with a weight of 50 kg on a hook, fly around the 
station. It turned out, quite the opposite, that my skill had 
improved. 
  Immediately I began to try to organize emergence with it 
into 
open space, a flight around the station. Indeed, using the SPK 
it would have been quite easy to perform well all the work under 
the "Panorama" program. Enter any zone, take photographs. Yes, 
and the Americans, I am sure, would be interested in it. 
  But here again the dealing has begun. Whose motorcycle is 
it? 
On the one hand, does it belong to the NPO Energiya, General 
Yuriy Semenov, or does it belong to the NPO Zvezda, Gay Severin? 
Each has its ambitions, its plans. Superposed on this is a 
struggle to save weight; it is necessary to carry along two 
gas-filled cylinders. Then it was found that someone had 
forgotten to order batteries... 
  V. B.: Tell us, during flight on the station were 
you not annoyed by UFOs? 
  A. S.: This time they caused no concern. But when 
Viktorenko and I tested the "motorcycle" in open space I recall 
that a healthy chunk of metal floated between us. Without 
identification marks. I understood that it was a UFO. 
  V. B.: Is it possible that there is so much trash 
in space? 
  A. S.: Far more than I would like. Even here 
mankind has laid its hand. But if all is thought through, even 
this problem can be solved, and quite simply. 
  V. Ts.: We were greatly annoyed not by UFO, but by 
identified objects -- meteor showers. The fact is that in the 
first half of August there was a strong stream of meteorites. On 
the 12th of the month it was maximum, emanating from the 
constellation Perseus. During this period the Americans even 
postponed the flight of the next Shuttle. We organized an 
around-the-clock watch on the station. Serebrov and I actually 
did not sleep these days and observed the stream. Naturally, in 
the shadow, from which bursts are clearly visible. 
  This was an unpleasant picture. Especially when bolides (the 
largest meteorites) burst into the atmosphere. Their combustion 
time was 2.5-3.5 seconds, followed by an explosion. A total of 
more than 240 meteorites were counted. Those are the ones which 
could be seen. Later we learned that on the Earth the search and 
rescue service had been brought into full combat readiness. 
Helicopters and aircraft stood ready along the entire flight 
trajectory in the territory of Russia in the event of our forced 
emergency descent from orbit. 
  V. K.: They told us that several hours after 
returning to the surface, when your aircraft made a landing in 
your native Chkalov, without anyone's assistance you quite 
buoyantly descended the stairs. Then, after several days, you 
looked fresh at the traditional press conference. Giving an 
impression as if there had been no flight? 
  V. Ts.: This is more a question for the 
physicians. I will only tell you that preventive measures are 
important. We have acquired enormous experience in their 
organization during prolonged flights. It was acquired by blood 
and sweat. Physical training is the most important. We engaged 
in physical training twice a day for an hour, other than for 
days off and holidays. Plus special biomedical measures directly 
before descent from orbit. 
  V. B.: And if a cosmonaut becomes ill on the 
station? Let's say with appendicitis or a bad tooth. What can be 
done in such a case? 
  V. Ts.: A question precisely for our physician, 
Vladimir Krivolapov. Incidentally, journalists for some reason 
do not write about them, the crew physicians. But they are like 
our nurses. 
  From the very first day of preparation for flight as part of 
a crew they are responsible for our health. Prior to the launch 
and after landing the crew's physician is the principal 
intermediary for all our encounters and work with specialists. 
  V. K.: (crew physician). Treatment aboard a 
station is always a problem. To be sure, first of all we lay our 
hopes on the successful diagnosis and prediction of the 
condition of the cosmonaut's body. But after a half-year, and 
especially a year, anything can happen. At one time it was 
proposed that all spaceflight candidates have their appendix 
removed. But the other internal organs remain. The teeth are a 
very vulnerable place in man. It also is better that there be no 
teeth. I'm not joking -- just that has been suggested, for 
example, with respect to cosmonauts flying to Mars. 
  With respect to the watch crew on the Mir, here we are 
counting more on the crew's capacity for keeping in good health. 
However, there was a case when because of this the flight was 
interrupted, when the sickness was treated in orbit: physicians 
advised the crew from the Flight Control Center. Fortunately, 
there have been few such cases. 
  V. Ts.: But traumas, especially microtraumas, are 
easy to experience in orbit. In a state of weightlessness you do 
not feel weight. It's all the same if you lift a 10- or 200-kg 
part. But mass and inertia remain. Push a little too hard and 
you get pressed against a sharp edge. The force, indeed, under 
the law of mechanics is equal to the mass multiplied by velocity 
squared, divided by 2. We joked: it's good that it's divided by 
half, or it could kill you. Yes, they teach you to give yourself 
first aid and to give it to a colleague, but there's no 
substitute for a physician. I think that in the future a 
physician should mandatorily be a crew member. 
  V. B.: In orbit you perform an enormous amount of 
work, but down below, on the Earth, in the meanwhile, everything 
is collapsing. Here they shoot and kill and industry tumbles 
down before one's eyes. How do you perceive this psychologically 
in space? Does it not dishearten you? 
  A. S.: It's impossible to lump everything 
together. We have our work, our professional duty. Duty to 
ourselves, to those who work in the space industry, and finally, 
to Russia. And we strove to perform this work as well as 
possible, since after us there are others to come. 
  Yes, we were frankly indignant about what was going on in 
the 
country, but we were not disheartened. Each must be occupied 
with his own task. Ours was space technology, not politics. 
There is a good American saying. If you are driving an 
automobile with the left hand on the steering wheel and with the 
right embracing a girl, you do both of these poorly. 
  In our day, when it is impossible to foresee the morrow, 
when 
you cannot depend on the train or plane schedule for the next 
day, in the space branch we plan events many years ahead and 
they are carried off with the greatest accuracy. And this is 
noteworthy. I am sure that the country will extricate itself 
from its crisis. Russia always has been rich with Lomonosovs and 
Kulibins. It is only necessary to move on from political 
squabbling to business, with our hands and minds making specific 
things useful to all.

  [Abstract] In the 1970's and 1980's, the Main Directorate 
for Geodesy and Cartography set out to revamp the state geodesic 
network. That task has been helped considerably by satellite 
geodesy, which, over the past 25 years, has involved three main 
areas: the development and observation of passive satellites 
such as Pageos, Lageos, and Etalon; the development and 
observation of satellites such as Geo-IK; and the use of 
satellite navigation systems such as GLONASS and GPS. This paper 
examines the results of the use of the domestic Geo-IK 
satellites, which were used in 1977, 1985, and 1990 to ascertain 
the geodesic parameters of the Earth, i.e., the main 
astronomical and geodesic constants; the characteristics of the 
coordinate base; and planetary models of normal and anomalous 
gravitational fields of the Earth and local gravitational-field 
characteristics. The Geo-IK has been used in efforts to make the 
GLONASS- and GPS-system coordinates compatible. NPO Applied 
Mechanics is developing the new Geo-IK-2, whose capabilities 
will include accuracies to centimeters rather than meters.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Yaropolov, doctor of technical </F>
sciences, under main headline of "Space Ark. Who's At the 
Helm?": "Of the Competitors, We're the Assistants..."; first 
paragraph is source introduction before Yaropolov's piece] 
  [Text] The negotiations between Russia and the United 
States on cooperation in space may wind up with a decision to 
create a joint orbital space station. That aim evokes differing 
assessments from specialists. 
  The capabilities and infrastructure of the domestic space 
sector could be destroyed if Russia accepts NASA's proposal with 
regard to an international space station project. The 
development of the Alpha station, mainly with U.S. equipment and 
in cooperation with Europe, Japan, and Canada, could reduce us 
-- with two modules and a transport craft -- to a "second-string 
player." But it is Russia who is creating a space infrastructure 
for the United States, and that 3-3.5 years earlier than they 
had planned to do it on their own. But their attempts, which 
have cost them almost $10 billion, have not been successful. 
  The future station, built and serviced with the American 
space shuttles, can fly with an orbital inclination of 57, 
and maybe even 51. Consequently, it will not fly over all 
of Russia, as had been planned for our Mir-2 station. Recall 
that Mir-2 was supposed to lift off in 1997, to an orbit of 
65, which would make it possible to continue remote sensing 
of the ground. The Alpha enables survey of no more than 5 
percent of our country. 
  The United States will have the opportunity to use the 
orbital complex in its entirety. But no one knows yet whether 
Russian cosmonauts will get to operate the Alpha at all. The 
fact is that all the know-how with regard to the development of 
the orbital station has been valued at $800 million. Even though 
Russia herself invested tens of billions of rubles in that 
technology at a time when the ruble and the dollar were almost 
equivalent. 
  But since the whole station will go for roughly $40 billion 
and will be operated by the project participants on a percentage 
basis, according to how much was contributed, Russia's operating 
time will be no more than 10 days a year. When you recall that 
we have obligations to France in the manned program, then it's 
not clear at all for whom or for what purpose we will be 
creating Alpha. 
  Besides, Russian industry will lose vitally important 
orders. 
And the unique Cosmonaut Training Center in Zvezdnyy Gorodok 
will become virtually unnecessary -- the crews will start 
training in the States. And the Flight Control Center, with all 
its expensive equipment and highly skilled specialists, will 
lose its significance.

  [Abstract] Satellite geodesy holds decisive advantages over 
other forms of geodesy, e.g., coordinates can be transmitted 
thousands of kilometers very rapidly, and gravitational-field 
parameters can be ascertained with a relatively small number of 
ground stations. The accuracy of satellite measurements 
increased dramatically with the use of satellite altimetry. The 
Geo-IK satellite is the centerpiece of Russia's space-based 
geodesy program. It flies in a circular orbit with inclinations 
of 74 and 83, with its longitudinal axis aimed at the 
center of the Earth. The service life of the satellite is less 
than a year, and one or two are always aloft. The satellite is 
equipped with a radio altimeter, an electronic interrogator 
system relay, a timing and signalling system, and laser corner 
reflectors. The next-generation Geo-IK-2 is under development. 
The Kosmos-192, a navigation satellite launched in 1967, was 
followed in 1979 by the Tsikada system. The successful use of 
low-orbit satellite navigation systems by maritime consumers has 
attracted attention to satellite navigation. A system that could 
be used by aviation, maritime vessels, ground-transportation 
systems, and spacecraft, however, would enable the user to 
ascertain three spatial coordinates instantaneously, velocity 
vector, and accurate time without an interrogator. The GLONASS 
high-orbital navigation system, consisting of 12 satellites in 
two orbital planes is serving well, but efforts are under way to 
make it and the GPS system compatible.

  [Abstract] The Geo-IK satellites represent an important 
stage in the development of Russia's program for studying the 
Earth's gravitational field. They have been used to create 
planetary models in the form of harmonic coefficients of 
geopotential and in the form of a system of point masses. The 
harmonic coefficients of the GPZ-90 model (i.e., Earth's 
Gravitational Field for 1990) were determined with long-range 
radio, laser, and doppler measurements from ground stations; 
radio-altimeter measurements by Geo-IK; and measurement 
information from the ground complex for controlling the GLONASS 
navigation system; and average gravity anomalies for a 5 x 
5 frame. The result was the GPZ.200 model, which enables 
determination of geoidal rise to with an rms error of about 1.5 
m. References 3: 2 Russian, 1 Western.

  [Abstract] In recent years, a great deal of progress has 
been made in the development and refinement of new means and 
methods of space geodesy, one task of which involves the 
precision study of the fine structure of the geopotential over 
the World Ocean. Today, the primary method of performing that 
task is satellite altimetry. This paper examines the principal 
approaches to determining gravitational-field characteristics -- 
i.e., geoidal rise and gravity anomalies over the water bodies 
of the World Ocean -- and the results obtained with Geo-IK 
satellite altimetry information collected over the past five 
years. The main type of baseline data derives from some 18 
million radio altimetry measurements. Two models are used to 
compute geoidal rise and gravity anomalies from those 
measurements: lunar-solar tides and maritime topographic 
surface. Geoidal-rise and gravity-anomaly catalogs based on 
Geos-3 and Seasat data were used to check and analyze the 
results, as were gravimetric maps of the northeastern Pacific 
and the Sea of Okhotsk. Also used for that purpose were class IV 
maritime gravimetric surveys of the central Atlantic and average 
1 x 1 gravity-anomaly values for the entire surface of 
the Earth. The measurements were processed in five stages: 
computation of geoidal rise; regional adjustment of altimeter 
tracks; processing of adjusted geoidal rises; global adjustment 
of geoidal rise; and computation of gravity anomalies from the 
geoidal rises. The gravity-anomaly catalog produced is among the 
most precise such catalogs published today for anomalies over 
the World Ocean. References 7: 5 Russian, 2 Western.

  [Abstract] Samples with a porous, light-absorbing, 
inorganic coating based on low-vacuum condensates of aluminum 
were studied for the effects of a yearlong exposure to open 
space on the Mir station. A before-and-after study of the 
thermal radiation and spectral optical characteristics was 
performed with the FM-59, TRM-I, SF-26, and IKS-29 instruments 
with attachments for recording the mirror and diffuse components 
of reflection in the visible and IR ranges. Structural studies 
were done with optical and electron microscopy and low-angle 
x-ray scattering. For coatings that were 3 m or more thick 
and were applied to both sides of a substrate, electron 
microscopy revealed that large, lengthwise pores about 1 m 
wide were essentially intact after the yearlong exposure. The 
pores in the samples with fine coatings applied to only one side 
of a substrate, however, underwent structural changes in which 
the submicropores coalesced. Those coatings produced conditions 
favorable to processes controlled by surface diffusion. Exposure 
to open space raised the levels of reflection for the one-sided, 
thin coatings, and a substantial dimensional effect associated 
with coating thickness was observed on the radiation and thermal 
stability for the thin coatings. In general, diffusional changes 
in the substructure of the aluminum condensates were the primary 
source of degradation of the optical properties of the thin 
coatings. No appreciable changes were observed in the morphology 
of surface relief or optical characteristics in the thicker 
coatings. Figures 3, references 10 (Russian).

<F P=106> [Article by Boris Konovalov: "Golden Mirrors Will Help in </F>
Seeing the Youth of the Universe"] 
  [Text] One of the principal achievements in cosmonautics 
was the birth of exoatmospheric astronomy. During the forty 
years of the space era this very ancient science has received 
more new information than during all the preceding centuries of 
development. The new Spectrum-X- Gamma Astronomy Project 
promises the world community the largest and most modern 
automatic exoatmospheric observatory for studying those 
radiations in the universe which cannot reach the surface due to 
the planetary atmospheric envelope. Today this project looks so 
attractive that 15 countries with the most different levels of 
scientific development -- from the United States to Turkey -- 
are participating in its implementation. 
  In order for it to be understood how important this 
exoatmospheric observatory will be for the world, we will state 
that such countries as Denmark, Finland and Israel are 
contributing to the instruments of the satellite to be developed 
sums relative to their gross national product which are 
comparable to those which Russia allocated for the entire space 
research program in 1993. 
  The total cost of the project for the Western participants 
alone is more than 150 million dollars. The satellite itself is 
being designed and fabricated in the well-known "space berth" of 
the NPO Lavochkin. The Space Research Institute, Russian Academy 
of Sciences, is in charge of coordination of all the work and 
its general scientific oversight. 
  The "heart" of the new exoatmospheric observatory is two 
X-ray telescopes -- JET-X and SODART. The combined European 
(including Russia) JET-X telescope has the highest "keenness of 
vision" today. The SODART, a joint creation of Russia, Denmark 
and the United States, is a still larger instrument, 11 meters 
in length. It collects far more X-radiation and will make it 
possible to carry out more detailed research than was possible 
before. Working in tandem, these two telescopes will make it 
possible to make a new, highly important breakthrough in X-ray 
astronomy. 
  Better modern technologies were used in constructing these 
telescopes. Russia surprised the group of creators of the 
exoatmospheric observatory with the mechanical components and 
housing of the JET-X telescope. Its 5-m "tube," like the entire 
mechanical system, was supplied by the Central Scientific 
Research Institute for Special Machine Building in the Moscow 
area. The housing was made of carbon plastic, which is very 
light and strong and which virtually does not change its shape 
in a wide temperature range, which is very important for 
accuracy in the focusing of radiation. The British, for example, 
did not believe that such a large housing of carbon plastic 
could be made sufficiently reliable. But after rigorous and 
completely thorough tests carried out in the famed 
Rutherford-Appleton laboratory doubts were replaced by delighted 
comments. 
  X-rays are attractive to researchers because the entire 
universe is transparent for them. They go right through it. But 
at the same time this also gives rise to serious difficulties. 
It is very difficult to fabricate focusing systems similar to 
ordinary optical mirrors. Although theoretically this also 
seemed possible. 
  It was found that X-ray radiation is beautifully reflected 
by 
mirrors covered by very thin (several layers of atoms) gold 
films. So that X-ray telescopes will be "golden" in the literal 
sense of the word. The SODARt will have 124 square meters of 
golden mirrors, fitted one into the other. But the gold itself 
was only one-tenth of a percent of the cost of fabricating these 
mirrors and bringing them up to the required quality. 
  The best modern technologies and materials were used for the 
observatory in order to obtain new information on the universe. 
One of the principal mysteries of the sky is quasars, already 
discovered in the 1960's, which emit like 100 trillion suns and 
"blink" with a characteristic period of about one month and 
whose size is comparable to that of our solar system. Thousands 
of quasars have already been studied. Most of them are at the 
edge of the universe observable by terrestrial instruments, that 
is, we see objects which are tens of times younger than the star 
world surrounding us. The X-ray telescopes of the new 
observatory can glance still farther and see the "birthplace" of 
the universe and register the birth of galaxies and quasars. 
  Today it is necessary to understand how these compact and 
powerful energy sources were formed and why in the past they 
were much larger. Indeed, now in the neighborhoods closest to us 
they have died out, like the dinosaurs, and have been 
transformed into "black holes," not sending any radiation 
outward. But since theoretically "black holes" cannot be 
destroyed, this means that these invisible objects should exist 
somewhere around us, concentrating in themselves a considerable 
part of the mass of the universe. Scientists must detect these 
"graveyards of black holes." In theory this is possible from the 
curvature of rays passing near such an invisible object and this 
is one of the tasks of modern science. 
  "The Spectrum-X-Gamma Project will be the first national 
Russian orbital observatory," I was told by Academician Rashid 
Syunyayev, scientific director of the project. "Every specialist 
in any scientific institution in Russia will be able to send in 
an application for research to be carried out and if the project 
committee deems it interesting, at no cost it will be allocated 
observation time from the Russian quota. Such a specialist has 
one obligation: the results must be processed and published 
within a year." 
  We will note still another feature of the project. After 
three years of flight the Russian observation quota will be 
opened for American scientists. But not without cost. For this 
NASA even prior to the launch must deliver to the Space Research 
Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, a system for archival 
storage of data received from the satellite. It will be supplied 
with optical storage disks, robots and high-capacity computers 
giving rapid access to information for hundreds of users. It 
must be said that the archives must be organized extremely 
complexly. After all, approximately 8 gigabits of information 
will be received daily from the satellite, or to put in ordinary 
terms, about a million pages of text. 
  As was noted, the project should begin in late 1995. Russian 
space science is still retaining its very strong potential and 
if it is reasonable to use it, even with minimum support of the 
Russian government, it will be capable of carrying out 
first-class scientific projects attractive to the entire world 
community.

<F P=106> [Article by Veronika Romanenkova: "Orientation on the Sun. </F>
The `KoronaS-I' Station Looks Steadily at the Star"] 
  [Text] An automatic universal station with orientation on 
the sun, the "KoronaS-I," was launched on the morning of 2 March 
from the Plesetsk cosmodrome by means of a Tsiklon booster. The 
implementation of the international project "KoronaS" (Complex 
Orbital Circumterrestrial Observations of Solar Activity), 
initiated yesterday, will make it possible to obtain new data on 
the star closest to the Earth. The sun is not only an energy 
source vitally important for earthlings, but also is the object 
responsible for magnetic storms causing malfunctions of 
equipment and even its complete breakdown. 
  The space vehicle will carry 12 sets of instruments, four of 
which exceed the world quality level. These include the Russian 
Terek telescope, the Defos, intended for research on global 
solar oscillations, the SKL for research on solar cosmic rays 
and the Sors solar microwave spectrometer. 
  The booster and vehicle were fabricated in the Ukraine. 
Poland, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, France, the 
United States and Germany also participated in the project. 
  The participation of these countries in the project is 
attributable to the fact that Russia already for many years has 
studied the sun and has attained good results. But recently 
there has not been enough money to go around. And it has been 
advantageous for other countries to join with the USSR, saving 
considerable sums and entering the ranks of leaders in the solar 
research field. 
  The automatic orbital station, being situated alongside the 
sun, will make measurements whose implementation from the Earth 
is impossible. With its assistance it will be possible to make a 
more detailed study of the sun's internal structure, to 
investigate the phenomena transpiring on this star, and to 
ascertain the reason for the "escape" of jets of matter from the 
sun. 
  The guaranteed lifetime of the KoronaS-I is a year, but 
Professor Viktor Orayevskiy, doctor of physical and mathematical 
sciences, scientific director of the project, director of the 
Institute of Terrestrial Magnetism, Ionosphere and Radio Wave 
Propagation (IZMIR), Russian Academy of Sciences, hopes that the 
satellite will operate for six or seven years, to the next solar 
activity peak. The "KoronaS-I" will operate in a so-called 
quasisolar synchronous orbit. This means that for approximately 
25 days the satellite will not "set" in the Earth's shadow but 
will "look" at the sun. Then a drift of the orbit will occur, 
the space vehicle will enter the shadow and after some time will 
return to its place.

"Space Archeology"] 
  [Text] Wars pass, archives burn, witnesses of events and 
their participants die, officials lose papers and the Earth's 
rulers change. And all that comes to be forgotten... 
  In any human activity, as soon as some unseen threshold is 
crossed, there is a need for a historical study of what has 
occurred as a result of one's own work. This is probably the 
threshold separating childhood from adulthood, when things have 
already accumulated in the past about which there is a need to 
ponder deeply. 
  If this version is correct, the space field became an adult 
in the 1980's. For twenty years before this everyone launched 
all kinds of objects. These launches were concealed from other 
parties. Some satellites exploded. Others were lost. And now all 
kinds of unknown objects are flying there above us... As a 
result a new science has been born and it can be called space 
archeology. Unfortunately, it is not concerned with traces of 
mysterious arrivals from the outside, but with our own objects. 
  When the first artificial earth satellite was launched it 
was 
known only approximately how it would fly. Right up to the end 
they were not sure that it would fly at all. The accuracy of 
observation of the satellite, to be sure, was still low. 
  But then telescopes appeared which were capable of tracking 
objects moving rapidly through the sky. It was far more 
difficult to determine exactly what was flying there. Any 
satellite in the strongest telescope is visible as a point -- 
more or less bright. And from the changes in this brightness an 
effort is made to determine what it looks like. Up to the middle 
of the 1970's it was possible only to distinguish a sphere from 
a cylinder and a cylinder from a plane. An entire institute in 
Great Britain, breaking its head over this problem, deemed a 
more detailed solution to be unattainable. 
  But in 1981 the young Russian scientists A. Bagrov and M. 
Smirnov, working in the geodynamics section, Astronomical 
Council, USSR Academy of Sciences (now the INASAN), appeared on 
the scene. They were able to cut the Gordian knot: they began... 
to detect the sun's flashes. The fact of the matter is that the 
parts of the satellite send quite conspicuous blinks earthward. 
And by observing them it is possible to visualize from what 
parts this satellite consists. 
  When observing one ordinary satellite a very strange leaping 
blink was discovered. As if someone sent a flash from a hand 
mirror and it oscillated slightly. An ordinary satellite cannot 
produce such a picture. But it was announced as being 
specifically an ordinary communication satellite. But the blinks 
betrayed its secret: it was a scanning television system which 
shifted its "eye" to the right and left and accordingly the 
satellite oscillated and the sun flash jumped. The enemy was 
thereby exposed. 
  Another problem. A satellite is launched. We attempt to 
communicate with it, but no luck. There it is -- it can be seen 
clearly, even with the naked eye. But it is silent. It is very 
possible that it is talking, but not to us. That is, its antenna 
is not turned in the right direction. Or the solar cells 
remained undeployed, for some reason or another could not be 
opened. And again the detection of the flashes makes it possible 
to ascertain the truth. Then it is possible to send a correcting 
signal from the Flight Control Center and the satellite will do 
that which it is told to do and everything will be in order. 
  What good are the blinks from a satellite? They can be seen 
clearly. When the light spot shines in the eye, the brightness 
of the object may increase a thousandfold. You can't hide that. 
Incidentally, if you saw in the sky that a moving star suddenly 
appeared, and then disappeared, you know: this is not a flying 
saucer, this is a simple sun flash. From a satellite. 
  In the late 1980's we learned to identify satellites even 
without the blinks. Using a computer. The author of these lines 
also was engaged in this work. 
  No method is a panacea. A satellite can be camouflaged. The 
very same M. Smirnov mentioned a combination of celestial bodies 
which it is difficult to identify. Visualize a small satellite 
to which a large, several times larger satellite, an inflated 
balloon, is coupled by a short tether. As much as you look at 
such a formation, as many calculations are made on computers, 
only the balloon can be distinguished. 
  But let's return to space archeology. It is necessary to 
determine the configuration not only of working satellites, but 
also the remnants of old ones. Some are continuing their orbital 
flight in the form of a grouping of individual parts. Others 
have exploded. And still others, crippled with time, fly on 
intact. And there are so many of them that sometimes it is 
difficult to observe the stars. The blinking of the fragments 
interferes. 
  A new term has appeared: space trash. We already have 
succeeded there, in space, in cluttering the place up. Some 
regions of near space are becoming dangerous for a large object, 
such as an orbital station. The velocity of a station is 7 km/s, 
but toward them move tiny fragments, sharp as nails, also moving 
at 7 km/s, a total of 14 km/s (for a bullet -- 800 m/s). No skin 
will hold up under that. 
  And how many different flying objects of all types are there 
in space? About 5 thousand intact vehicles alone. There are 15 
thousand large pieces measuring more than 10 cm. There are more 
than 100 thousand pieces of an intermediate size (1-10 cm). And 
there are about a million small ones (1-10 mm). Intact vehicles 
are listed in catalogues and they are observed. It would be good 
to observe both the large and the intermediate fragments, but 
for the time being neither we nor the Americans have money for 
that. 
  Now these fragments are flying in small groups. There are, 
for example, even permanent groups over India and Ecuador. And 
if we know the shapes of these fragments we can determine how 
the pressure of sunlight acts on them and where the pieces will 
move in the future. M. Smirnov and his colleague A. Mikshin have 
encouraging words with respect to this problem: with time all 
these groups will break up, being uniformly distributed in all 
of near space, and then will fall to the surface. So that we can 
boldly clutter up the heavens in the future as well. It is true 
that with time it will be necessary for there to be a break in 
flights for some 30 thousand years, but on the other hand then 
everything will be cleaned up. And over the course of these 30 
thousand years space archeology will flourish.

<F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Borisov: "The Hypersonic Heart of </F>
`Orel': Will the Space Planes Take Off?"] 
  [Text] According to foreign estimates, by the year 2000, 
the annual volume of the world space market will be about $400 
billion. And commercial, economic, and science-related tasks are 
clearly on the rise, while purely military jobs are being cut 
back. 
  At present, all the space vehicles operating to meet the 
ground's needs -- satellites, stations, modules -- are being 
placed in orbit by expendable launch vehicles developed 30-40 
years ago -- the Soyuz, the Kosmos, and the Proton. Plans are 
also calling for their use in handling the tasks associated with 
the Federal Space Program for the period up to 2000-2005. 
  But what's next? The development of new launch systems 
requires 10-15 years. So the question has to be answered today. 
If another five years or so goes by, the gap between us and our 
competitors will become insurmountable. 
  So, based on worldwide statistics, the cost of using 
expendable launchers to place 1 kg of payload into a low Earth 
orbit 200 km high is $8,000-$10,000. The principal expenses are 
associated with the loss of the launch vehicle structure and 
with the use of expensive launch complexes that are serviced by 
a multitude of technicians. Moreover, the situation with the 
environment is becoming more acute, with the ground and space 
being polluted by the remnants of launch vehicles and 
unrecoverable space vehicles. And if the traffic between ground 
and space grows even more (in the world today, it's growing 5-7 
percent a year), all those problems will snowball, requiring, 
among other things, a further buildup of the industrial 
production of expendable rockets. 
  There is only one way out -- develop and build reusable 
space 
transportation systems for the purpose of cutting the cost of 
transporting cargoes by 5- to 10-fold and eliminating virtually 
all the drawbacks associated with expendable rockets. 
  The scientific-research and experiment work, Orel, which was 
begun in 1993 by the Russian Space Agency, is devoted to that 
very problem. In 1995, the report on the Orel must formulate the 
principal areas of development of Russian space transport. 
  A significant place in the Orel operations is held by 
engines. Of course, as test pilots used to say, even a toilet 
could fly if you put a motor on it. The head organizations for 
"motors" in the Orel project are the Central Institute of 
Aviation Engine Building (TsIAM) and the Scientific Research 
Institute of Thermal Processes. 
  TsIAM is studying what is perhaps the most "avant garde" of 
all of today's versions of space cabs. There, they are 
developing prototypes of engines for aerospace planes -- 
vehicles that take off from an airstrip and ascend into space, 
using only atmospheric oxygen as the jet-engine oxidizer during 
their flight in the atmosphere, just as nonspace planes do. But 
the gas in the combustion chamber of such engines moves at 
supersonic speeds --four to five times faster than the speed of 
sound. And there's no turbocompressor that compresses that air 
-- it shoots directly into the combustion chamber from the air 
intake. Hence the name of these engines -- hypersonic ramjet, or 
scramjet. 
  In providing considerably better performance at high speeds 
of flight -- speeds that are 6-16 times greater than the speed 
of sound -- the scramjets also have their drawbacks: more 
precisely, they create certain problems for the designers. In 
order for a scramjet to start working, the airplane must first 
be accelerated by traditional turbocompressor or rocket engines, 
and, upon leaving the atmosphere, it must again switch engines 
-- to rocket engines that do not need outside air. 
  Thus, an aerospace plane requires the use of a combined 
propulsion system that employs all of the best and the advanced 
in aviation-and rocket-engine-building. By comparison with an 
expendable launch vehicle, an aerospace plane lifting the same 
payload mass will have one-third to one-half the launch mass and 
will be able to take off and land at any time and at any place 
on the globe and will be able to enter orbit with any 
inclination. 
  Russia in the early part of the next century will witness 
the 
take off of its Tu-2000 -- a distant cousin of the supersonic 
Tu-144, a single-stage experimental aerospace plane, and a 
"pioneer" in the field of hypersonic aerospace transport. 
  TsIAM and 14 co-implementer/organizations are performing 
simultaneous design operations and tests of prototypes of 
engines -- stand tests and flight tests. Near Moscow right now, 
in Turayev, renovation is about to be completed on the largest 
test stand in Europe for studying scramjets. New structural 
materials and software are being developed and put on line. 
Flight tests got under way in 1991. 
  It was a long road to the world's first flight of a scramjet 
vehicle -- about 15 years. And the fact that the event finally 
took place is to the great credit of the officials and 
scientists at TsIAM and their colleagues from the experimental 
design bureau and the testing services. 
  At one of the rocket testing grounds in the vicinity of Lake 
Balkhash, the Kholod hypersonic flying laboratory -- a fairly 
small axisymmetric scramjet with its own control system and 
hydrogen tank -- was mounted the top of an Angara S-200 
antiaircraft rocket. As the rocket gained the necessary speed -- 
three to five times the speed of sound -- it switched-on the 
engine, which initially operated with a subsonic stream in the 
combustion chamber and then switched to the scramjet mode. In 
the second set of tests in November 1992, the engine operated 
with the gas in the combustion chamber flowing at a supersonic 
speed for 15 of 37 seconds of functioning. 
  Foreign specialists displayed a lively interest in the 
Balkhash tests. "The Russians are roughly two years ahead of the 
United States in the development of the scramjet," declared 
American expert David Bebb late last year. The French firms that 
joined the consortium HYPERSPACE paid 1 million French francs 
(nearly $180,000) for the right to participate in the second set 
of flight tests in 1992 -- in order to study the results that 
were produced. Using Russia's experience, Aerospatiale, 
Dassault, SEP, Onera, and Snekma are counting on saving 
considerably on the flight-related debugging of future vehicles. 
  And the fact is that in the context of the Orel program, the 
TsIAM people, together with the designers and producers, are 
ready to launch, by 1998, the winged flying laboratory IGLA 
(Russian abbreviation for "hypersonic research vehicle"), which 
will be capable of flying at a speed that is 14 times greater 
than the speed of sound. The building of such a hypersonic 
flying laboratory is expected to make use of a decommissioned 
ballistic missile and involved total spending over a five-year 
period of about 40 billion rubles, at the prices for the first 
quarter of this year. By comparison, when the Americans allocate 
$60 million this year for their X-30, that is generally 
considered simply a civilized form of closing the program. 
  International cooperation is a special issue. The Chinese 
and 
the Germans, the Americans and the French -- all of them want to 
fly "the Russian way." To test promising systems on the unique 
Turayev stands. To get data from the flight experiments. But the 
most important thing still is to deal with the "domestic" 
problems involving future space launchers and high-level 
technologies. To get our bearings with the wings of Orel.

  [Text] The general trend in the improvement of space 
vehicles is evident--to create aerospace systems which use more 
economical winged flying vehicles for putting into space 
payloads on the order of 5 tons. 
  Among the more promising projects for multipurpose, reusable 
aerospace planes--MAKS "VTB+OS," "Interim-Khotol," and "Khotol 
M,"--those which have the best chances for realization are the 
ones which answer the set of requirements for a more complete 
fulfillment of power-engineering specifications. 
  The projects for aerospace planes envision the use of liquid 
hydrogen as fuel, and this substantially limits the 
possibilities of their use for a number of reasons, but 
particularly because of their low parameters of reliability and 
safety. The general lack of experience in operating aerospace 
systems on liquid hydrogen fuel casts doubt on the axiomatic 
assertions about the high priority of the systems. The technical 
director and supporter of the use of hydrogen fuel naturally can 
boldly construct the simplest fuel tank in the world, and one 
which is also the most complicated in its aerodynamic aspect and 
technical utilization. But imagine to yourself the psychological 
state of the crew of a MAKS or an AN-225-"Interim-Khotol" system 
which is carrying on board a "hydrogen bomb," ready to explode 
with the slightest leak in the tank of liquid hydrogen. It is a 
known fact that in the case of mixture with air, detonation 
takes place in a wide range (from 4 to 75%) of hydrogen 
concentration. 
  However the need for reliable and inexpensive space vehicles 
remains urgent. 
  A group of specialists, who have substantiated the 
possibility of creating practical space aviation, have developed 
an alternative project for an aerospace plane--"Promethues," 
which operates on hydrocarbon fuel. It most fully achieves power 
engineering specifications, thus essentially differing from the 
planes mentioned above. In calculating ballistics, strength, 
engine characteristics, and other features, the generally 
accepted methods were used and assumptions were based on real 
and statistical data, taking into account the technical level 
which has been attained to date. 
  A comprehensive analysis of various concepts on aerospace 
planes according to other questions demonstrated that, as 
compared to flying vehicles using hydrogen fuel, aerospace 
planes on hydrocarbon fuel, which have minimal mass and 
dimensions as a result of the high density of the fuel, when 
combined with the lighter artificial earth satellites of the new 
generation are preferable for the near future, since they are 
superior in terms of all crtiteria without exception--economic, 
technical, commercial, operational, technological, efficiency of 
use, reliability and safety, building time, etc. 
  It should not be forgotten that attempts to use hydrogen 
fuel 
in aviation have proved to be ill-founded. A calculation of 
technical economic indicators (in the prices of 1990) confirms 
that, at present the world prices for putting into orbit a unit 
of mass of a commercial payload, the expenditure for the 
development of an aerospace system with aerospace planes on 
hydrocarbon fuel at a rate of 40 launches a year will pay for 
itself within two years. With improvement of operational 
qualities and an increase in the number of launches to 80 per 
year a profit of $ 13.8 billion can be expected over a five-year 
period. 
  The saving in funds as compared to the carrier-rocket Soyuz 
in combination with the space vehicle Progress amounts to 15.3 
billion rubles. In this context one carrier-plane and four 
aerospace planes can put into orbit a payload which is the 
equivalent of the payloads of 800 Soyuz carrier-rockets with 
Progress space vehicles. 
  In addition to this, aerospace systems with aerospace planes 
using hydrocarbon fuel make it possible to economize on metal, 
fuel, alienated lands, and other resources, which are becoming 
ever more expensive. 
  The delay in starting the development of aerospace systems, 
while financing non-priority activities and launches of 
carrier-rockets with Progress space vehicles, is bringing 
irrretrievable yearly losses of 0.6 billion rubles, or 1.6 
million rubles per day. 
  The changes which have taken place make it necessary 
basically to reformulate Russia's policy on the use of 
circumterrestrial space, and to determine the most important 
directions for research efforts in this area. 
  In this context it is necessary to take the following facts 
into account: 
  1. The production of a considerable number of 
carrier-rockets, (whose volume will correspond to the previously 
planned program for space activities of the USSR for the period 
1996-2010), with analogous aerospace planes and payloads will be 
the task of enterprises in the Ukraine. 
  2. The The Baykonur Space-Launch Complex, which provided for 
a significant portion of the launches of carrier-rockets of the 
USSR, is now located in a foreign country. 
  3. The economic situation which is taking shape in the 
Russian Federation is forcing a reduction of financing for space 
programs, yet at the same time it is necessary to save the 
aerospace industry from complete destruction and to provide 
employment for the many factories which are connected with space. 
  In these circumstances the proposed concept for aerospace 
systems offers the only realistic prospect for the develolpment 
of practical astronautics for Russia in the near future,--and to 
be specific: 
  1. Production facilities for an aerospace system are located 
within the territory of the Russian Federation. 
  2. In the territory of Russia there is a sufficient number 
of 
the airdromes necessary for basing aerospace systems. 
  3. In Russia the infrastructure (production facilities, test 
base, etc.) which is necessary for the production of 
liquid-propellant rocket engines on hydrocarbon fuel, aerospace 
planes, equipment, etc., has already been created. 
  4. Russia posseses trained cadres which have invaluable 
practical experience in the development, production, and 
operation of this type of technology. 
  5. The main features of the proposed aerospace system are 
based on a level of technology which has already been attained 
in Russia. 
  6. There is a backlog of uncompleted work in the creation of 
reusable orbital spacecraft, in the development of new 
construction materials and of more perfected hydrocarbon fuels, 
with improved power and operational charcteristics. 
  7. As compared to other concepts, the builidng times, amount 
of necessary financing, and technical risk are minimal. 
  To generalize what we have discussed above, we shall note 
that with competent leadership in the field and the correct 
allocation of funds (both state and private) Russia has a unique 
opportunity to take up a leading position in the field of 
inexpensive and reliable space vehicles for the delivery of 
payloads into circumterrestrial orbit, and to capitalize on this 
position in the form of concrete political and economic gain.

General Designer of the science-production association 
"Energomash"] 
  [Text] Katorgin: A few days ago I discovered in 
the works of Academician M. V. Keldysh an acknowledgement, which 
today is of very topical interest: "Only due to the creation in 
our country of powerful rocket engines has it been possible to 
move forward at a fast tempo towards the conquest of space." One 
would like to learn more about a science-production association, 
an organization which was headed for many years consecutively by 
V. P. Glushko. 
  The story of our science-production association begins on 15 
May 1929, when a group was formed in the Leningrad Gas Dynamics 
Laboratory to develop rocket engines. In 1934 this group became 
part of what became the first jet-propulsion scientific research 
institute in the world, and in 1941 it was reorganized into an 
experimental design office. During the past 60 years this 
organization and its staff have undergone all kinds of changes, 
but the subject of its work has remained 
unchanged--liquid-propellant rocket engines. 
  TRUD: Please tell us, even if only briefly, the 
most important landmarks in the development of the organization. 
  Katorgin: The first liquid-propellant rocket 
engine to be produced in this country was the ORM-1 engine, 
which was developed in 1930-1931 in the Gas Dynamcis Laboratory, 
and which devoloped a thrust of about 20 kg and a pressure in 
its combustion chamber of several atmospheres. As the design of 
the engine was being perfected it went through more than 70 
modifications, right up until the appearnce of model ORM-65, 
which was suitable for manned flight. This engine was built in 
1936. 
  When at the end of the war V.P. Glushko on the instructions 
of Stalin acquainted himself with the engines of the V-2 rocket 
in Germany, his experimental design office had already created a 
series of rocket engines into whose designs at that time had 
been incorporated all the basic principles of liquid-propellant 
engines in their contemporary form. 
  Those who today try to minimize the significance of the 
scientific achievement of Academician V. P. Glushko tend to 
forget that the decision after the war to launch the production 
of engines for the V-2 in the Soviet Union was inspired by 
completely different (although in their own way important) 
aims--to gain experience in the organization of such a complex 
and for those times unique type of production, to prepare the 
material base which was required for it, to forge cooperation, 
etc. 
  Valentin Petrovich at the same time solved another, no less 
important problem. It was demonstrated and proven that any 
attempts to "squeeze out" of the engines of the V-2 any 
appreciable reserves of power, reliability, etc., had no 
prospect of success. 
  Today we can say with legitimate pride that in the engines 
for the Sputnik and Vostok rockets, which put the first 
artificial earth satellite and the first man, Yuriy Gagarin, 
into space, were realized those same principles and solutions 
which were laid down and developed experimentally by V. P. 
Glushko and his pupils on their own, and indepedently from the 
Germans. These principles and solutions were also in many ways 
different from those of the Germans. 
  TRUD: You mentioned an engine of the next 
generation? 
  Katorgin: Yes, I mentioned the first 
liquid-propellant engine of powerful thrust which uses 
oxygen-kerosene fuel, and which was developed in the years 
1954-1957 for the first stage of the carrier Vostok. In 
connection with it the RD-108 is usually mentioned, also a 
four-chamber engine, which uses the same fuel, is based on the 
same design and technological principles, and which made up the 
second stage of the rocket in question. Both of these engines 
and their modifications up until the present time have been in 
operation as part of the assortment of space carrier-rockets 
which are are making it possible to carry out the the Russian 
Program for Manned Flights..... 
  TRUD: Were there any other landmark events in the 
life of your science-production association? 
  Katorgin: Naturally! I would mention, for example, 
the creation of the RD-253 for the carrier-rocket Proton, the 
first stage of which is made up of six engines of this type. 
This is the most powerful existing single-chamber 
liquid-propellant engine, and operates on high-boiling fuel 
components. And take note of this: Since 1969 this engine has 
been operating without malfunction in the first stages of the 
carrier Proton, providing flights for space vehicles on 
assignments relating to the national economy, as well as 
launches of interplanetary space stations and space vehicles 
towards the Moon, Venus, and Mars. It has also put into 
circumterrestrial orbits the long-term manned space stations 
Salyut and Mir. And today this engine surpasses foreign analogs 
in its characteristics, and has good prospects for many years to 
come. 
  And finally the third important stage in the creative work 
of 
the science-production association was the development, 
production, and putting into service of the RD-170 engine, which 
is recognized throughout the world as unique in its power and 
its design solutions. Without exaggeration it is an engine of 
the 21st century, and is attracting the close attention of many 
foreign companies who are working in the field of rocket engine 
building. It is a four-chamber liquid-propellant engine which 
posseses the highest parameters and power charactertics for 
rockets of its class. 
  We are convinced that the use of the engine in question, 
which has no analogs in the world with respect to its 
combination of characteristics, will open up wide possibilities 
for the creation of continuously functioning orbital complexes 
on circumterrestrial orbits and for the actual realization of 
manned flights to Mars. 
  TRUD: It is quite clear that making such a 
significant journey into unexplored realms, at times under such 
extreme conditions, as did Valentin Petrovich and his comrades 
at the end of the thirties and the beginning of the forties, 
could only have been accomplished by a collective of like-minded 
people. 
  Katorgin: This is indeed true! One of the unique 
qualities of Valentin Petrovich as a director lay in the fact 
that at all stages of the work of the science-production 
associaiton he knew how to unite "under the banner" of his ideas 
a pleiad of outstanding designers, engineers, and scientists. 
And, incidently, this applied also to talented craftsmen and 
simple workers, who in no way yielded place to the legendary 
Levsha.....* It was specifically this approach to the solution 
of personnel problems which today gives our asscociation a high 
degree of viability, even at a time of "great shocks" in our 
economy. 
  Valentin Petrovich possessed an amazing integrity of 
character, as well as devotion to a single great idea, which he 
strove to achieve under any circumstances, even to the limit of 
human capacities. He was without a doubt not only a pioneer, but 
also a great enthusiast for space. His life, as well as his 
thoughts and actions were all related to space. All the rocket 
engines which he created bear the stamp of his will and his 
talent. 
  TRUD: What high-priority project is your 
science-production association aiming at today? 
  Katorgin: The presently available test base of the 
association, which is fitted out with up-to-date equipment, can 
be used for conducting comprehensive tests of various kinds of 
products under conditions which have been made as close as 
possible to operational ones. This refinement, if you will, is a 
kind of invitation to potential partners and to collaboration. 
  You will be surprised to learn that our interests nowadays 
go 
beyond the limits of activities which are traditional for 
science-production associations. 
  I will note for a start that space is rapidly being turned 
into an arena of international cooperation, and is becoming a 
realm of politics on a grand scale. At the center of attention 
for world business today are projects for a global 
telecommunications system, a system which would be suitable for 
inclusion into the world system of communications based in space 
which is being built up today. 
  Analysis shows that Russia today, in spite of the extreme 
seriousness of the general situation in our economy, has at its 
dispoisal all the necessary elements for its own independent 
organization of a system of satellite communications and for 
entering into competition on the world market in this field. 
  In order to organize such activities in space, in the 
interests of the Russian people sensible federal programs are 
necessary, which would (particularly in the intiial stage of the 
work) be provided not simply with declared, but with real and 
active support from the government. Unfortunately no unifying 
and mobilizing initiative on the part of government agencies in 
this field, which is so important for Russia, can be perceived. 
And time is passing. 
  TRUD: Speaking of the future, do you consider a 
further incrrease in the power of the rocket engines built by 
the association as an urgent task? 
  Katorgin: I believe that the capacity and power engineering 
of the liquid-propellant rocket engines which are being built 
for today are completely sufficient for answering the 
requirements of humanity within the foreseeable historical 
perspective. 
  TRUD: If it is not a secret, what do you dream of 
today ? 
  Katorgin: Why should there be any secret here? I would like 
to believe that all we Russians recognize that in the future we 
simply cannot live without space. Without a recognition of this 
truth we cannot continue to move ahead with confidence in the 
conquest of space. 
  The enormous experience which we have accumulated in the 
creation of powerful liquid-propellant engines and our 
possession of unique technologies creates a favorable basis for 
fruitful international cooperation. Our science-production 
association is open to contacts and cooperation. And we shall 
welcome any steps in this direction. 
  [*Translator's note: Levsha (Lefty) is the main character in 
a well-known story by the Russian writer Nikolay Leskov 
(1831-1895)--"The Tale of the Cross-Eyed, Left-Handed Craftsman 
of Tula and the Steel Flea." 
  In the story (briefly outlined) Tsar Alexander I after the 
end of the Napoleonic War makes a state visit to England. 
England was then the most technologically advanced country in 
Europe, and the tsar during his visit is taken on tours of 
English factories of various kinds. The tsar, in a tradition 
begun by Peter the Great, is very much of a "Westernizer"--(that 
is he tends to admire everything European and to disparage 
everything Russian). Accordingly he is very impressed with 
everything he sees, as are all the members of his staff--all 
with the exception of a Cossack officer, one Platov, who is in 
the habit of saying: "Yes, that's very good, but our Russian 
craftsmen can do just as well or better." Before his return to 
Russia the tsar is given a gift by a group of English steel 
manufacturers,--a life-sized steel flea, which, when wound up 
with a very small key, can hop about and move its feelers. 
  The tsar returns to Russia and forgets about the flea. Some 
years later (in 1825) he dies, and is succeeded by his brother 
Nicholas I. Nicholas, (who is less of a Westernizer than 
Alexander), finds the flea, summons Platov, and asks him if he 
can't find a Russian craftsman who can copy it, or at least make 
something as good. 
  Platov takes the flea and departs. After some weeks he 
returns with Levsha (Lefty), a cross-eyed, left-handed craftsman 
of Tula (a town famous for its metal workers). Platov tells the 
tsar that Levsha has improved the flea. On inspecting it the 
tsar can see no change from the flea's previous condition, 
except that, although it can still move its feelers, it can't 
seem to hop about as nimbly as before. On Levsha's suggestion 
the tsar examines it under a microscope. He now sees what the 
"improvement" has been: Levsha has shod the flea with tiny 
golden horse-shoes.
