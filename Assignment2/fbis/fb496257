<F P=106> [Article by L. Kamanin "Is Access to Outsiders Allowed?; Our </F>
How We are Entering the World Space Market" the first paragraph 
is an introduction] 
  [Text] The critical state of the national space industry is 
approaching a limit beyond which its resurrection in the years 
immediately ahead may become impossible. In striving to avert 
the impending catastrophe, the Russian Space Agency (RSA) is 
imparting maximum efforts for the commercialization of all space 
activity in the country and to enter the world market. Recent 
publications in the foreign press give eloquent testimony of the 
"successes" attained by the RSA in this field. 
  To start off I will cite an article by J. M. Lenorovitz, 
senior international editor of AVIATION WEEK AND SPACE 
TECHNOLOGY, included in a special number of this journal in the 
Russian language under the highly promising title "Russian 
Commercial Launches Not Far Off." 
  "The United States has defined the conditions for entry of 
Russia into the world market for commercial launches of boosters 
and has notified West European representatives of the need for 
concessions in the direction of development of free competition. 
The fact that an American-Russian agreement was signed ... has 
caused dissatisfaction among representatives of the American 
aerospace industry..." 
  This same article states that one Dana Rohrabacher, a 
Republican from California, tried to console the representatives 
of the leaders of aerospace companies, declaring that it was 
necessary "to perceive the appearance of a competitor in the 
form of Russia to be a result of the collapse of the Soviet 
Union, long awaited by the United States." 
  Just what are the conditions causing the dissatisfaction of 
American entrepreneurs, who for some reason or another have 
"forgotten" the principal precept of the businessman: "Whatever 
you do in this world you have to pay for it?" 
  Under the adopted agreement Russia up to the end of 2000 can 
conclude not more than one contract annually for the launch of 
geostationary satellites by Russian carriers and contracts for 
the launch of low-orbit satellites must be specially examined in 
each individual case; the "bilateral agreement applies to all 
satellites put into space regardless of where they were 
constructed and by what countries they will be operated." 
Businessmen in the United States have exhibited a touching 
concern about the income of Russia: the amount of payment for 
each commercial launch of the Proton carrier must not be less 
than 92.5% of the price asked for similar launches by 
American 
or West European companies. 
  Moreover, the congressmen and representatives of the 
American 
administration are not without success playing the role of good 
Samaritans, as if defending Russian interests against the 
encroachments of evil West European commercial interests. The 
latter, it goes without saying, are not delighted with the 
attempts of "Russian agents" to intrude themselves into the 
"trade ranks" of the world space market. But American 
businessmen, in turn, are anxious about the considerable 
fraction of Western Europe in profits from commercial launches 
of satellites despite their own relatively small (35%) 
share. 
That is why they, relying on the protectionist policy of the 
American government, are striving to dictate their rigid 
requirements on the concluding of trade deals with both new and 
well-known competitors. As declared by an assistant of the U.S. 
Trade Representative, Peter Allgeier, ... the representatives of 
Western Europe are trying to load the agreement, defining such 
(fettering for Russia and other potential competitors -- L. K.) 
rules, with simplification of the procedure for their obtaining 
sanctions by the American government for carrying out launches. 
  What kind of profits can we count on in the event that the 
bilateral agreement enters into force within the framework of 
the restrictions set by them? 
  Yuriy Koptev, general director of the Russian Space Agency 
(RSA), declares with assurance that participation of boosters in 
commercial launches and the sale of rocket-space technology will 
annually bring Russia not less than 200-220 million American 
dollars. However, we take into account that in 1992 the total 
world profits from the commercial use of space technology 
attained 13.2 billion dollars; the income from the use of 
boosters did not exceed 1.2 billion, that is, 9% of the 
total 
sum. This means that the country which was the first to blaze 
the trail into space will be allowed to receive for making its 
boosters available to other countries not more than 1/60th of 
the total world "space profits." So that, pardon me for saying 
so, is the net result of commercialization... 
  And then there's another "space ultimatum" which the 
American 
administration directed to the Russian government in connection 
with the contract concluded in 1991 between the USSR Glavkosmos 
and the Indian Space Agency on the delivery of cryogenic engines 
to India. For the freezing of the two-million dollar contract 
with India we were handed a "bird in the bush": increased 
chances for Russia to participate in construction of the Freedom 
orbital station were promised. 
  President Clinton, on the basis of expert evaluations, has 
set a limit of 10.5 billion dollars on the financial 
expenditures for constructing the Freedom station up to the end 
of the 20th century, either independently or in collaboration 
with Western Europe and Russia. 
  As already reported in the press, the Russian prime minister 
Vladimir Chernomyrdin, in setting off for negotiations in the 
United States, declared that the participation of Russia in 
implementation of the Freedom project would enable the Americans 
to come out ahead by more than two billion dollars. But what 
would we receive? The directors of the Russian Space Agency 
declare that for the assistance which Russia will give the 
United States in constructing the station they will pay us 
600-700 million dollars. We note: in the event of adoption of a 
joint trilateral project a good half of the station modules will 
be units developed for our future Mir-2 station and the American 
laboratory will be occupied with not more than a quarter of the 
total volume of construction. 
  Why, you may ask, do we place such a low value on our work, 
our scientific and technical achievements? After all, the 
minimum cost of the American "quarter-share" of the future 
station is estimated by American specialists at 10.5 billion 
dollars, whereas the Russian "half," if our prime minister is to 
be believed, is only the 2 billion saved by the Americans due to 
use of units from the Mir-2 station. And why can we, if the RSA 
is to be believed, receive only a third of this obviously 
understated sum? 
  From everything said above a conclusion follows which is as 
evident as it is disconsoling for us: neither our West European 
space partners, nor the Americans, are burning with desire to 
have still another competitor in the space technologies and 
services market. And therefore our penetration into the world 
space market conforms to the Russian proverb: "he went for the 
wool and returned with the clippings." 
  Editor's note. The author of the article has touched on the 
most important aspects of the entry of Russia into the world 
space market. We are sure that there also are other opinions on 
this subject. Accordingly, we invite all interested readers to 
continue the initiated discussion.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Shakhray, deputy prime minister of </F>
Russia, by journalist Natalya Zhelnorova; place and date not 
given: "The Contradictions Have Already Been Revealed..."] 
  [Text] [Zhelnorova] Sergey Mikhaylovich, why, in your 
opinion, do we hate each other so much? What has happened? 
  [Shakhray] There is just one answer: There has been no 
universal brotherhood and love. Man's soul is an entire world. 
And we hate, remembering someone in a cloth cap at the market or 
with an assault rifle. But in that same soul there is also love 
for people of another nationality, for their culture and 
history. What Russians do not have, incidentally, is a 
recognition of themselves as a national great community. After 
all, there are 150 million Russians. And for this reason it is 
harder for us to consolidate as some national "ego." Tolerance 
of the ideas of other peoples is strong in Russian man. Russians 
are the sole nation not to have swallowed up all other 
nationalities, even the smallest. We looked for the same 
attitude, naturally. And national unity with us emerges only as 
a necessity, as a blow in retaliation for a threat. 
  [Zhelnorova] But what is happening now? Russians in the role 
of social odd-men-out outside of Russia. Russian soldiers 
fighting for the sake of others' interests and dying on the 
territory of the former Union republics. And the "great nation," 
which should be displaying concern for its fellow citizens, is 
essentially betraying them. People do not feel that there is a 
native state which is defending them. You, as a minister, more, 
deputy prime minister, what are you doing to ensure that 
Russians recognize that they are protected? 
  [Shakhray] This is what I am working for. At the diplomatic 
level within Russia I have sought to ensure and will continue to 
seek to ensure that Russia, as the successor of the Union, bear 
responsibility for all people carrying the passport of citizen 
of the USSR. Not simply in spirit--the sense of blood and 
kinship--but legal responsibility. It is a question of the 
conclusion of treaties and agreements on citizenship and on aid 
to Russians who live in other countries. The delivery of 
humanitarian freight. The settlement of interethnic conflicts, 
which is saving the life of Russian people. Finally, we will 
adopt a program of their reconstitution and settlement in 
Russia. For this work to be effective, not only in the form of 
intentions, we need to revive Russia as a powerful state. 
  [Zhelnorova] This will take some time. They are living 
today. 
And suffering today. 
  [Shakhray] Your question presupposes that some people are 
sitting on a moneybag and not giving money to Russians. 
  [Zhelnorova] You represent the authorities. Both party and 
state. You should, therefore, be prepared to bear responsibility 
for all that happens. Many people were unaware that in switching 
from one economic system to another we had to negotiate an era 
of cynicism. Crime is on the rise, morality is declining, wealth 
is being exported from the country. You here, behind these 
strong walls, are less aware of this, perhaps; we, however, find 
ourselves beneath a barrage of grievances and disappointments. 
People hate both you and us for the fact that we are not, 
allegedly, showing the real picture. They are asking: Who do we 
believe, on whom do we pin our hopes? 
  [Shakhray] I personally believe that our news media are 
"exposing and revealing" by force of inertia. Only those who are 
shooting, blowing up, and burning are being shown on the screen. 
People are already tired of this. But what is the greater 
cynicism: what is happening now in open form or what was for 
decades driven inward and has, as a result, exploded? Where has 
the lack of faith come from? At one time we were building 
communism, then, developed socialism. People of the 
1920's-1940's went on believing everything.... And by the 
1960's-1970's did not believe in anything. This is where the 
roots of our cynicism lie. Nothing with us is sacred. Religion, 
spirituality, and culture were eradicated, and nothing was given 
in exchange. And now added to this are the problems of the 
transitional period.... We are moving from one era to another. 
And the lancing of the abscess could either be cleansing or will 
lead to gangrene. 
  [Zhelnorova] You take offense at us showing scenes of 
violence. This, of course, jars on me also, as an average 
person. But the journalist cannot, after all, remain silent 
about the fact that children, playing near entrance ways, die as 
the result of the detonation of automobiles containing some 
"stern" uncles. Children are being abducted and sold, people are 
demanding money for them. Is there in Russia no force capable 
tackling this insane crime? 
  [Shakhray] The authorities and the state still have to be 
created. Society has been left to its own devices. Thank God 
that the force of inertia is strong in our society, that Russian 
man could not give a damn. Where are the authorities? There are 
none--understand this. An agonizing process of recovery or 
extinction is under way. Recovery, I hope. It was so that there 
be order in this society and so that the individual and his 
family be protected that society invented the state and 
authority. But we have still a long way to crawl before we reach 
this. 
  [Zhelnorova] Society to crawl or the authorities? 
  [Shakhray] Society. There are no authorities without 
society. 
  [Zhelnorova] You mean that society will have a long time to 
wait while there is a change in political elites? 
  [Shakhray] Not simply a change--a war--of elites--economic 
and political. And there will be such until these groupings 
share property. And they will either destroy one another in this 
war or will reach an understanding. Why are people being killed 
and automobiles being blown up? Because the elites are at war 
with one another. Because society has no mechanisms for 
resolving such conflicts in civilized ways. 
  [Zhelnorova] And what about on the inside--THIS is 
approaching an end or not? Everyone has obtained what he wanted 
or not yet? 
  [Shakhray] The contradictions have already been revealed, in 
any event. As always, there has in Russia been a noncoincidence 
in terms of phase: Society wants transformations, the 
authorities are not prepared for this. Social revival and 
renewal peaked in the period 1987-1989, but the authorities 
missed it. This curve of social assertiveness has now turned 
down, and the curve of arousal of the authorities, up. Whence 
the conflict. The restoration of authority and order cannot now 
rely on public forces. The utter apathy at the last elections 
was evidence that authority can no longer be revived at 
referenda. That's it, gone. These elites fighting one another 
have now been left to their own devices. We need now to pray and 
to work. While there is a parliament, a president--their 
interests are known. 
  There are now no incidental votes, no incidental documents, 
believe me. The situation is heating up, and all parties need to 
sit down at the negotiating table. Because if these elites, God 
forbid, switch to a war with weapon in hand, society will 
suffer. And a new wave of clarification of relations will begin. 
The tragedy of our society is that political and economic 
groupings whose power is based on exports and the groupings 
whose financial and economic power is based on industry, on 
native technology, have different political signs. Conditionally 
speaking, some are democrats, others, communists. 
  [Zhelnorova] Was it worth having this whole "perestroyka" 
and 
all the demonstrations and congresses to clear the way for new 
power-lovers.... 
  [Shakhray] We have to find parallel levers of influence. 
This 
is why parties are being formed, to assemble forces in the face 
of danger. The concept of civil reconciliation was created for 
this also, so that not only the senile and idiots sit at the 
table. Although both those who manipulate them and those who are 
standing behind them with money and with their own interests 
will sit at the table, all the same. 
  So a shareout has taken place, not everyone is happy with 
what he has received, but if the shareout continues, this will 
mean simply war. We have now approached the line at which we 
need to agree: 30 percent for you, 30 percent for him, and so 
forth. And, with regard to this division of property and power, 
to start to live peacefully. This is what the concept of civil 
reconciliation amounts to. 
  [Zhelnorova] And what, then, in your opinion, will everyone 
agree? 
  [Shakhray] For many of them, inasmuch as they are actual 
proprietors, there is no other way. Otherwise, open 
confrontation and, as a result, a chance to suffer and lose 
everything. 
  [Zhelnorova] It has been the case that many questions of 
regional and national policy have been decided without you. Is 
this becoming the norm? 
  [Shakhray] It is not a question of me but of the general 
chaos. The federal institutions of power should, particularly in 
respect to the regions, operate in concerted fashion. I have 
attempted to achieve this. And I have been more or less 
successful. People harbor illusions: It seems to them that 
another's problem is easy to resolve. But this proves not to be 
the case. 
  [Zhelnorova] You are not afraid for your life? 
  [Shakhray] I am, of course. I have two small children. A 
politician has to be afraid. I have no accounts in banks 
overseas. Nor do I have any relatives there. I live here and 
make policy here. This is how it should be. 
  [Zhelnorova] What do you fear most? 
  [Shakhray] That the self-preservation instinct and common 
sense will cease to operate in society. 
  [Zhelnorova] What might operate in place of this? 
  [Shakhray] An emotional outburst of hatred. An attempt to 
resolve all our problems at a stroke. The most important thing 
the authorities must do is to speak with people honestly. People 
are tormented not only by prices, crime, housing. The main thing 
is the unknown, the unpredictability. Everyone is now expecting 
of the authorities calm and peace, therefore. 
  [Zhelnorova] Do you consider yourself a person with power? 
  [Shakhray] I consider myself a person with authority. The 
functions of authority are sometimes very close to the functions 
of power. I believe that no one has power with us at this time.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Shakhray, leader of the Party of </F>
Russian Unity and Accord and minister for nationalities affairs 
and regional policy, by Vitaliy Yaroshevskiy; place and date not 
given: "The USSR Will Not Be Restored by Pushing Buttons in 
Parliament"] 
  [Text] [Yaroshevskiy] When visiting Moscow, Nursultan 
Nazarbayev called into doubt the effectiveness of the CIS, 
advancing the idea of the Eurasian Union. In purely 
chronological terms, you made your proposal thereafter. At issue 
is the "Eurasian confederative agreement." Did Nazarbayev's 
pronouncements give it an impetus, or did this idea mature in 
parallel? 
  [Shakhray] I take pleasure in yielding political priority to 
Nursultan Abishevich; I respect him as a politician who knows 
how to take a long-term view. As far as the legal, 
organizational aspect of the issue is concerned, I prepared the 
draft of a confederative agreement by April 1992. Everyone 
understood that the formation of the Commonwealth of Independent 
States in December 1991 amounted to preventing a spontaneous 
breakup of the USSR, which was fraught with great trouble, the 
beginning of integration on new principles, along new lines, 
rather than an act in divorce proceedings. 
  The thrust of my draft is not to disband the CIS but rather 
to create a confederative nucleus of three to four countries 
within the Commonwealth of Independent States. 
  The topic of a confederation was a component of our election 
platform. In April 1994 I revisited this idea, proposing this 
time a specific draft confederative agreement which I released 
and officially introduced in the State Duma. 
  To me this topic also has a moral dimension in conjunction 
with the charges concerning my participation in the Belovezha 
negotiations. Incidentally, on the issue of breaking up the USSR. 
  The USSR was a mighty state, was it not? Of course, it was a 
nuclear power, a world power. However, another question is also 
proper: Could a truly mighty state be broken up by three 
persons--Yeltsin, Shushkevich, and Kravchuk--in the woods, under 
KGB supervision? The answer is obvious--it could not! 
  Two points are fundamental to me: The Belovezha agreement 
was 
not the beginning of the collapse of the USSR, but the 
completion of a quite protracted and tragic period of the 
destruction of the state; the formation of the CIS was the first 
stop on a long path toward economic and political integration. 
It is impossible to restore the Soviet Union by pushing buttons 
in the parliament. There is only one path toward the 
future--from the CIS toward the Confederation as a voluntary 
union on an equal footing with Eurasian states on the principles 
of economic integration. There is no alternative. 
  The confederation would continue the political sovereignty 
and independence of the states belonging to it and would be 
created to achieve common goals. For the states of the former 
Union, this is primarily economics, our Common Market if you 
will, in which after a while the free movement of goods, 
services, and capital will be guaranteed. 
  Collective security and the coordination of certain foreign 
policy actions would be the second goal of the confederation. 
The preservation of minimum sociocultural relations, insurance, 
retirement benefits, and so on would be the third goal. 
  It appears to me that the idea of integration is even 
somewhat overripe now. The elections in Ukraine and Moldavia 
[Moldova] indicate this. 
  [Yaroshevskiy] At present, everybody is "fixated" on the 
idea 
of reunification--national-chauvinists, fascists, and democrats 
alike.... Nonetheless, there are two approaches--frantic and 
balanced. What is your vision of the position of the democrats, 
of the democratic movement? 
  [Shakhray] The destruction of the Union is a grave 
psychological trauma associated not only with the loss of 
territory or the fact that 25 million Russians have ended up 
beyond the borders of Russia. For many people this is also a 
personal tragedy because the Russian people, Russians, always 
perceived themselves within a specific state. This is, if you 
will, the sense of great statehood. It is possible to exploit 
the self-awareness of the Russians and restore the one and 
indivisible Rus within the borders of 1975, 1913, or any other 
year. 
  This is the forcible and bloody path of Vladimir Volfovich. 
  Voluntary integration on an equal footing is the second 
path. 
The confederation is precisely a legal form for such integration. 
  [Yaroshevskiy] Your idea of a confederative structure 
appeals 
to common sense. The ideas of, say, Zhirinovskiy and his ilk are 
designed for emotions. Are you confident that common sense will 
prevail this time? Are you not afraid of major interethnic 
clashes? Many people have a preference for feelings; they could 
not care less about what the confederation is. 
  [Shakhray] You are absolutely right; this is why I say that 
we are even being late with the confederation proposal because 
time and painstaking work are necessary for common sense to win 
out whereas a fraction of a second suffices for an emotional 
outburst. However, we should keep it in mind that an attempt at 
forcible integration would be yet another attempt to turn the 
Russian people inside out. 
  [Yaroshevskiy] Each historical period brings forth its own 
political leaders. There was a parade of sovereignties, there 
were people who exploited this very social condition. The 
spontaneous craving for unification is strong at present. Are we 
right to surmise that the forthcoming replacement of the current 
political leaders is predetermined by the striving of the people 
toward some kind of community? 
  [Shakhray] If upwards of 80 percent of the population are in 
favor of integration but politicians are against it, such 
politicians will not have a future. Their stubbornness is 
fraught with conflicts, societal breakups, and clashes. 
  Let us conduct a referendum on unification in Ukraine, 
Belorussia [Belarus], Russia, and Kazakhstan. I think that not 
one sober-minded person has doubts about the outcome of such a 
referendum. Perhaps we should not spend tens of billions to hold 
it, but actually solve the problem of integration. 
  [Yaroshevskiy] Could you give us examples of those in favor 
of and against your proposals? 
  [Shakhray] The response of political leaders is known in 
part: Nazarbayev supported it; Akayev supported it; the largest 
faction in the Belarussian parliament welcomes the idea of the 
confederation. We have proposed to establish an international 
group for refining our draft. The Party of Russian Unity and 
Accord is appealing not only to the leaders of states but also 
to the public, political parties, movements and deputies who 
come out in favor of integration on the basis of common sense, 
on the basis of voluntary participation and equal rights. That 
is to say, we are trying to create a critical mass that will 
prevent violence under the guise of unification from spreading 
like a forest fire. 
  [Yaroshevskiy] How will the State Duma respond? 
  [Shakhray] The LDPR [Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia] 
will 
come out categorically against, and I will view this as proof 
that we have taken a very serious and timely step. 
  I think that Russia's Choice and Apple will take a 
moderately 
favorable position. They will respond favorably because no 
sober-minded politician will come out against integration or 
civic peace. They will respond with moderation because there are 
objective difficulties and obstacles on the path toward 
integration. I think that support can be expected from a segment 
of the Communist faction and some agrarians, the New Regional 
Policy group. We hope to gain support from other associations, 
too. Therefore, there should be more allies than adversaries. In 
all of this, I am prepared to give up the authorship if the name 
"Shakhray" irritates someone. This is why I propose to establish 
a working group. Let the idea itself work.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article under the rubric "Sociological Poll": </F>
"Democracy or Dictatorship?"] 
  [Text] The International Institute of Marketing and 
Social Research GFK-Rossiya conducted a poll of the population 
in 110 cities and 66 rural population points. It questioned 
2,000 people. 
  The study showed that 50 percent of the population were in 
favor of a democratic form of rule, sharing the opinion that in 
any case democracy is better than dictatorship. Another 27 
percent think that under certain conditions dictatorship can be 
better than democracy. It makes no difference to the remaining 
23 percent whether they live under a dictatorship or democracy. 
  Fifty percent are against restoring the communist system. 
  Nineteen percent said they would "rather not," 15 
percent--"categorically yes," and 16 percent said they would 
"rather have it than not." 
  While there is great universal confidence in the army, the 
version of a military dictatorship does not attract our people 
either. The balance here is 85 percent "no" and 14 
percent--"yes." 
  The idea of restoring the monarchy is not popular at all 
either: "No"--87 percent and "yes"--11 percent. 
  The idea of not a parliament and elective organs but a 
strong 
leader who can quickly implement decisions is extremely popular: 
"Yes"--63 percent and "no"--36 percent. 
  Even more popular is the idea of an independent "government 
of experts" who are not involved in politics: "Yes"--71 percent 
and "no"--28 percent. 
  Thus hopes are placed either in a "wise government" of 
specialists who do not participate in political disputes or in a 
strong authoritarian individual. 
  Can we expect that our new political system will eliminate 
all its "growing problems" or should we replace it with another 
one if it does not produce good results in the near future? The 
opinion of Russians was divided almost equally: 49 percent and 
51 percent. 
  So far our compatriots are not ecstatic over the existing 
political system. Only 9 percent say that their expectations 
related to the change of the political system were justified; 42 
percent were more disenchanted and another 26 percent were 
extremely disenchanted because they expected more; the remaining 
22 percent expected nothing good from the change of political 
system from the very beginning.

<F P=106> [Letters to and replies from President Yeltsin under the </F>
heading "From the President's Mail"] 
  [Text] 
  Dear President of Russia: 
  I am the wife of Captain 1st Rank A.G. Ushakov, commander of 
the nuclear submarine cruiser Kasatka. 
  You visited this nuclear cruiser, dear Mr. President, in 
Severodvinsk in April 1992, and presented my husband with the 
personal watch of the first president of Russia for achievements 
in utilization of new technology; my husband was also presented 
with a video film of your visit to the nuclear submarine, in 
which my husband accompanies you. This is a tremendous treasure 
and souvenir for our entire family: parents, children, future 
grandchildren and great-grandchildren. We will remain grateful 
to you for the rest of our lives, and I have always been proud 
of my husband--for he was the one to be granted the honor of 
playing host to the first president of Russia. 
  Forgive me for taking time, dear Boris Nikolayevich, from 
your state affairs, but I am compelled to appeal to you 
personally, since for three years already my husband has been 
unable to resolve the problem of continuing his military 
career--meaning our life as well--through the proper channels. 
  Here is the substance of the matter. My husband--the 
commander of submarine cruiser Kasatka, Captain 1st Rank 
Aleksandr Grigoryevich Ushakov, is 42 years old; of these, he 
has served 25 years in the Russian Armed Forces. He graduated 
with honors from the Imeni Leninskogo Komsomola Higher Navy 
School; has been given government awards; has served all his 
conscious life on nuclear submarines in the Northern and Pacific 
Fleets; is the only submarine commander in Russia who has 
received an award personally from the president; has glowing 
character references for the next career transfer from Rear 
Admiral Salnikov, commander of the Belomorsk Navy Base, and Rear 
Admiral Motsak, chief of staff of the Northern Fleet nuclear 
submarine group. My husband's submarine also was personally 
inspected by the Pacific Fleet commander, Admiral Gurinov, and 
this inspection resulted in an article-review in the fleet 
newspaper, which I enclose. For 1993, my husband received a 
commendation from the Pacific Fleet submarine group commander, 
Vice Admiral Komaritsyn. 
  For three years already my husband has been unable to get a 
career transfer to a training center. The training center 
commander, Rear Admiral Yamkov, has all the aforementioned 
references given to my husband by his immediate superiors, but 
nevertheless does not want to resolve the matter in our favor. 
As a civilian, I do not understand why. Especially considering 
that we are not being given the reasons for the rejection. Who 
then is worthy of teaching submariners? I think my husband has 
earned this with his 25-year impeccable service to our 
Fatherland. 
  Boris Nikolayevich! I apologize once again and appeal to you 
as a godfather of our family. Not everyone in this life happens 
to come upon such happiness and trust. Please help us, and I 
will pray to God for you, Boris Nikolayevich, for the rest of my 
life. 
  I would like to hope for a positive and quick resolution of 
our problem. 
  With my deep respect for you, 
  [Signed] Nadezhda Vasilyevna Ushakova 
  Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy 
  8 February 1994 
  Dear Nadezhda Vasilyevna: 
  Your letter unwittingly reminded me of the time I spent in 
the city of Severodvinsk, and the unforgettable meeting with our 
Navy personnel, including your husband. They are courageous, 
brave people of great fortitude! They have been and will provide 
steadfast support of our Fatherland. It is our duty to do 
everything possible so that their daily difficult, demanding 
service always receives the proper appreciation of the state, 
whose borders they protect. 
  Now about your request. There are certain procedures for 
transfers and promotions in the Army and Navy. Since we are 
building a law-based state, no one has the right to violate 
these procedures. Including the president of Russia. Therefore I 
advise your husband to once again petition the appropriate 
competent organs on the subject of a transfer to Obninsk to 
continue his service there. I hope you will understand me 
properly. 
  [Signed] B. Yeltsin 
  Boris Nikolayevich, when you come home from work and sit 
down 
with your family, please read these lines. 
  On 29 January we, a group of elderly women who survived the 
blockade, decided to gather for a home party. We baked pirozhki, 
made salads, and quickly had the table filled. We remembered the 
war, the blockade, cried a little, sang wartime sings. Life is 
not all that bad here--you see, we found enough food and many 
kind words, and most importantly, we still have hope and are 
waiting for better life. 
  On 27 January I was at a concert in October Hall. I came 
back 
very impressed, wrote these lines and read them to my blockade 
comrades. They told me to send them to you, with the hope that 
you will read them. I was at the concert in October Hall the day 
the president visited our city. First he visited Piskarevskoye 
cemetery, and in the evening came to October Hall. He sat in the 
stalls. During the intermission he left, and everyone who stood 
by the aisle tried to tell him something. When he approached 
them, I decided to shake his hand and said a few words, too: "We 
believe in you, Boris Nikolayevich, so protect our Russian 
people, just as we defended and held against the enemy our home 
city of Leningrad during the grim days of the blockade." As I 
was saying these words I had a vision: There was a fairytale 
mighty warrior standing there, I reached out, and he shook my 
hand. And in this handshake I felt the mighty force, and the 
pure, Russian soul. You carry such a burden, our people's 
president! So many dark clouds have gathered over your head! So 
rise to your full height, straighten your shoulders, and blow 
with your mighty force, disperse these clouds and open the way 
to warm, life-giving sunlight for us. Squeeze in your mighty 
fist all the darkness--and with such force that when you open 
your fist there would be only purity left there, and hope, and 
faith in the light and happiness. Maybe not for us, but at least 
for our children--open a clear, light road for them. 
  I am a native Leningrader, I lived through the blockade, and 
I have worked for 45 years; I now am raising my granddaughter, 
instilling in her all the goodness, honesty, and love for people 
and the motherland. 
  I am sending you my poem: 
  WAR 
  It knocked on our doors, Not even knocked but broke in, 
Broke 
in as an uninvited guest, Bringing all the horrors with it. It 
was then when I saw through a child's eyes All the horrors of 
war, And hunger, and exploding shells, And I heard the cry Of my 
own land, Pleading: Do not let, my people, Do not let the 
fascists trample me. And the people rose then And defended you, 
our land. So let us honor those Who are now buried in it And 
those who lived. 
  [Signed] Vera Ivanovna Amelina, St. Petersburg 
  Dear Vera Ivanovna: 
  I sincerely thank you for the letter filled with your noble 
feelings for Russia, its leadership, and the policy it conducts. 
  Your heartfelt letter is especially touching because it is 
written by a woman who survived the blockade and the horrors of 
wartime hardship. They are eloquent confirmation of the fact 
that the course of socioeconomic reforms being implemented in 
the country finds support among broad population strata, despite 
the temporary difficulties many Russians are encountering. This 
support lets us look to the future with optimism, and prompts us 
to double, triple the efforts of rebuilding society in the name 
of the well-being of the Fatherland and all its citizens. 
  I wish you and all your loved one health and success, dear 
Vera Ivanovna. 
  [Signed] B. Yeltsin 
  To President of the Russian Federation B.N. Yeltsin. 
  Dear Boris Nikolayevich: 
  Almost two months have passed since the day of the elections 
to the Federal Assembly and adoption of the Constitution of the 
Russian Federation--enough time to have conducted a deep 
analysis and drawn correct conclusions from this extraordinary 
event. 
  In this letter, addressed personally to you, I want to touch 
on just one issue, which in my opinion is of great importance 
both for the past and future elections, which are not too far 
away; we have to start preparing for them now, today, or maybe 
we should have begun yesterday. 
  What I have in mind is a voters committee, without which no 
elections are possible; both the practical experience and your 
high praise of the fruitful activities of the Volgograd Voters 
Committee last year tell us this. 
  The Volgograd Voters Committee, whose goal was to assist 
citizens in carrying out their constitutional right to 
participate in the management of state and public affairs 
through an effective democratic electoral mechanism, was 
officially registered in November 1992, although its practical 
work in our city and oblast began much earlier. 
  Over this time the voters committee has accomplished a lot 
in 
forming a high political culture of voters, as called for by the 
modern democratic process in our country; it coordinated the 
work of its component groups and units and integrated their 
activities with the activities of other public organizations and 
structures; monitored compliance with the Law on Elections, 
observance of electoral procedures and suppression of their 
violations; developed recommendations for an improvement of 
electoral system on the basis of analysis of public opinion; 
conducted information and propaganda events which facilitated 
the realization of voters' rights; and increased the numbers and 
political activism of voters. 
  In addition, the Volgograd Voters Committee conducted a 
broad 
propaganda campaign in labor collectives and at voters' places 
of residence aimed at bringing them into socially useful 
political activities; in helping labor collectives, public 
organizations, and citizens to conduct the entire range of 
election campaigning, it actively used in its activities 
information and propaganda flyers and posters, methodological 
materials, and created its own mass media--and quite effective 
at that. 
  It should also be noted that the Volgograd Voters Committee 
supported in every way the voters' initiative aimed at improving 
the electoral system; helped ensure voters' direct influence on 
the direction and nature of activities of elected bodies, and 
promoted glasnost in the work of electoral commissions, making 
public the relevant administrative instructions and statutes on 
election matters; fought to ensure equal opportunities in the 
conduct of the electoral campaign for all candidates to elected 
bodies of authority, and observance of legal and ethical norms 
of political competition; and ensured public control over 
setting the necessary organizational conditions for voters to 
recall and re-elect elected representatives. 
  Over the time of its operation the Volgograd Voters 
Committee 
became an authoritative organization, to which residents of 
Volgograd and the oblast turned with all sorts of questions: 
legal, social, economic, political, ecological, pedagogical, 
cultural, and so on; it was especially true during the election 
campaign, when it was arranged to have someone on duty at all 
times, including on weekends. 
  The reasons people came to us varied: questions, 
consultations, complaints, concerns, petitions, requests for 
concrete practical assistance, and so on. 
  There were also different categories of people who turned to 
the voters committee. Employed and unemployed, housewives, 
pensioners, farmers, Cossacks, and single mothers--especially 
those who had been abandoned by their husbands, leaving the 
children without alimony. 
  Unwed mothers at least get some help from the state; women, 
however, who have been legally married and then abandoned by 
irresponsible husbands do not get any assistance for their 
children either from the state or from the former husbands, 
since it is practically impossible to extract alimony from them. 
There are a great many such women, and they ask you to issue a 
special edict on protection of their rights and the rights of 
their children. 
  Unfortunately, too few young people came to the voters 
committee. Now it is clear why young people were so unwilling to 
participate in the election campaign. We have many political 
parties, and all of them first and foremost want power, while no 
one works seriously with the youth, or takes their interests 
into account. This is a very sad but real fact. 
  In the past each residential building in the city was 
assigned to an agitator from some or other organization; now 
this is longer the case, and voters sometimes do not know who to 
vote for, where to vote, how to vote, and even when to vote. All 
this, and many other things, negatively affect the course, and 
especially the results, of elections. 
  All this and a lot of other work could be done by a 
permanently functioning voters committee with a staff of several 
people. 
  There is no money, however, in the city and oblast to 
support 
such a committee, and nobody wants to try to find any. The 
Volgograd Voters Committee is not functioning now for one and 
only one reason: There is no money. 
  Both state and public organizations in the city do not deny 
the importance of the voters committee, but nobody will 
undertake financial support of it; as a result, the voters 
suffer. 
  In the past, when we had soviets, sometimes people could get 
help there from the commissions for protection of citizens' 
rights. Now there are no soviets and no commissions either. As 
they say, they threw the baby out with the bath water. Some time 
in the future analogous commissions will undoubtedly emerge in 
the dumas, but so far they have not, and the voters committee 
could be of great help to the people during this important and 
difficult period. 
  Based on the above, I ask you to take personal part in 
aiding 
the Volgograd Voters Committee, and perhaps also voters 
committees in other regions in Russia--first and foremost those 
that have already shown themselves well during the recent 
elections to the central and local bodies of authority. 
  The issue at hand is maintenance of just several staff 
persons; it is not a great expense, and it pays off many times 
over; you know this very well, since last year you personally 
congratulated the Volgograd Voters Committee on its successful 
work in the conduct of the election campaign. 
  If you now provide the needed help to our voters committee, 
it will certainly do everything to make the upcoming elections a 
success; the future fate of Russia is predicated on this, the 
fate of its long-suffering people, who expect from you more 
changes toward a better life. 
  [Signed] Labor Veteran B. Orlov 
  Volgograd 
  Dear B.S. Orlov: 
  I value very highly the work of the Volgograd Voters 
Committee, which you described in your letter. I see the 
creation and functioning of such independent public 
organizations both as a form of manifestation of true democracy 
and as one of the methods of developing it, aimed at assisting 
all citizens in the realization of their constitutional rights 
and developing high political culture among the voters. 
  Unfortunately, the state is currently unable to financially 
assist voters committees, which, along with Volgograd, exist in 
other cities of Russia as well. The national leadership is 
counting on their activities being carried out on a volunteer 
basis, while the lack of material incentives is more than 
compensated for by moral dividends--the knowledge that you are a 
direct part of realization of a high goal: the restoration of 
Great Russia. 
  I wish you success in this difficult endeavor. 
  [Signed] B. Yeltsin 
  To the President of the Russian Federation Boris 
Nikolayevich 
Yeltsin 
  Dear Boris Nikolayevich: 
  We, veterans of the Great Patriotic War, armed forces 
veterans, and wartime labor veterans of St. Petersburg, are 
writing to you with a very important request and some proposals. 
  Boris Nikolayevich, the people who bring this plea to you 
have gone through severe trials in combat and battles for the 
Motherland, the Fatherland, trials that have befallen 
internationalist soldiers, and wartime labor veterans. The 
people who bring this plea to you have gone through the harsh 
school of serving in the military, former privates and 
commanders of companies and battalions, regiments and divisions, 
people who commanded corps and armies, military schools, 
institutes, and academies, former heads of organizations, 
production facilities, factories, and plants, former public 
figures, and scientists--from a candidate of science to 
academicians of the Russian Academy of Science. 
  This entire preamble serves the sole purpose, dear Boris 
Nikolayevich, of letting you know that we are not unthinking 
people; together with our country we have gone through trials 
and tribulations--as have you--and we have one and same goal: 
Through the modest efforts of those who still work, and by our 
advice and proposals, to try to help the common cause of the 
well-being of the Fatherland and to the extent possible make 
easier the life of the older generation, first and foremost war 
veterans. Bear with us; hear our voice--it is a cry from the 
heart and soul; hear us out as the president, who is guaranteed 
to remain in this position of authority until 1996; as the 
supreme commander in chief; and simply as a human being. 
  Less than a year and a half remains until the historic 
date--the 50-year anniversary of the Great Victory of the Soviet 
people in the Patriotic War. We ask you, Boris Nikolayevich, to 
issue an edict on preparations for this remarkable date no later 
than the first half of 1994. And to take into consideration in 
this edict our requests and proposals, namely: 
  1. To set up a committee (commission) for the preparation 
and 
direction of the celebration of the 50-year anniversary of the 
Great Victory under the chairmanship of the minister of defense 
or one of his deputies, and with the mandatory participation of 
war veterans, armed forces veterans, and wartime labor veterans. 
As well as local subcommissions (subcommittees) under the 
leadership of military district commanders. All work should be 
done on a volunteer basis without additional remuneration. 
  2. To have under the president and the chairman of the 
Russian Federation Government and heads of administrations of 
Russian Federation components representatives for war and armed 
forces veterans' affairs. These representatives should not be 
members of any party or bloc. It would be best to appoint them 
from armed forces veterans. 
  The duties of representatives of war and armed forces 
veterans' affairs should include: 
  --taking care of veterans' everyday problems and needs 
locally; 
  --leading veteran organizations; organizing patriotic 
upbringing of the young generation in schools, technical 
schools, vocational schools, and institutes. 
  3. To instruct the minister of defense, military district 
commanders, and military commissioners at the local level to 
more actively and fruitfully care for war and armed forces 
veterans. 
  4. Keeping in mind that increasingly fewer war veterans will 
still be alive by the time of the 50-year Victory anniversary, 
to assign the status of category II disability, with all 
attendant benefits, to all participants 
(precisely--participants, not persons equivalent in status) in 
the war, who have been given awards for participation in combat 
and battles. 
  5. To study the possibility of our state materially 
rewarding 
the remaining participants in the Great Patriotic War on the 
occasion of the anniversary. Keeping in mind that there has 
never been a war in the history of humanity comparable to this 
one in the scale of cruelty on the aggressor side and the mass 
heroism and uncompromising stance on our side. It was we who won 
in this cruel battle--we Russians, who made a decisive 
contribution to the victory in the entire World War II. 
  6. To canonize in a secular manner the great troop leader, 
defender of the Fatherland Georgiy Konstantinovch Zhukov, whose 
services to our Fatherland have been no lesser than those of our 
great forebears: Aleksandr Nevskiy, Suvorov, Kutuzov, Bogdan 
Khmelnitskiy, Ushakov, and Nakhimov, in whose honor the highest 
orders have been established. To establish a "Zhukov Order" and 
a "Zhukov Medal" and award it to all surviving war veterans in 
our Fatherland, the CIS, and particularly distinguished World 
War II veterans in the United States, England, and France, 
regardless of rank and title. 
  We have no doubt that such a decision, Boris Nikolayevich, 
will be truly appreciated not only by the peoples of Russia and 
the CIS but also by the world community. 
  To erect monuments to G.K. Zhukov at Poklonnaya Mountain in 
Moscow and at the sites of decisive battles: in St. Petersburg, 
at Kursk Bulge (the site of the historic tank battle), and a 
number of other places. 
  Dear Boris Nikolayevich, you approved this proposal of ours 
during your visit to the former front line in the vicinity of 
Leningrad, around Maryino village, on 27 January 1994, for which 
we are sincerely grateful to you and hope that it will be 
implemented in a timely manner. 
  With respect and hope, on behalf of veterans, we sign this 
letter: 
  [Signed] Chairman of the Committee of the Leningrad 
Organization of Brother War and Armed Forces Veterans, Hero of 
the Soviet Union, Colonel General V.N. Kubarev 
  cochairmen of the Club of Aleksandr Nevskiy Order 
Recipients, Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences N.A. 
Moiseyenko and Artillery Major General, Doctor of Technical 
Sciences V.M. Kislov 
  St. Petersburg 
  Dear Vasiliy Nikolayevich, Vasiliy Mironovich, and Nikolay 
Andreyevich: 
  I thank you for your letter. Many of the wishes expressed in 
it are within the mainstream of the policy conducted by the 
national leadership and whose main directions were formulated in 
the recent Message to the Federal Assembly of the Russian 
Federation. The task now is to combine the efforts of the entire 
society towards this in order to energetically overcome the 
socioeconomic crisis and its negative consequences. In this work 
we also count on the support and help of your heroic 
generation--the generation that defended the independence of the 
Fatherland. 
  I wish you health, happiness, and wellness, dear veterans. 
  [Signed] B. Yeltsin

<F P=106> [Article by K. Dushenov, press secretary to Ioann, </F>
metropolitan of St. Petersburg and Ladoga: "Warning in Informant 
Report-Style"] 
  [Text] Well, gentlemen, say what you wish, but there is no 
greater torment for an intelligent man than feeling that he has 
not fulfilled his civic duty, which compels him to report to 
high superiors--immediately and in detail--all the shortcomings 
and (God forbid!) seditious inclinations of his compatriots that 
he may have noted. It must have been this noble feeling that 
moved Mr. Gleb Yakunin recently to write an open letter to the 
president, which was published by NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on 12 
April of this year. 
  All jokes aside, though! In the letter, written in the genre 
of a frankly shameless informant report, the author urges the 
president to initiate administrative and criminal proceedings 
against the highest hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church. 
"The patriarch," according to Mr. Yakunin, "covers up 
anticonstitutional activities... of pseudo-Orthodox 
chauvinists," while "the agreement signed by Patriarch Aleksiy 
II and Minister of Defense P.S. Grachev may potentially result" 
in "fascist ideology penetrating the Russian army." 
  Metropolitan Kirill, chairman of the External Church 
Relations Department, was attacked by Yakunin for having dared 
to send SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA editors a letter containing the 
"seditious" phrase that he is "ready to work together for the 
good of our Fatherland and the Russian people." "The 
patriarchy," Yakunin draws the conclusion, "through Metropolitan 
Kirill officially announced its solidarity with the 
national-communist opposition." 
  But the famous democrat reserved the most vicious slanderous 
attacks for the Most Reverend Ioann, metropolitan of St. 
Petersburg and Ladoga. The author of the denunciation accuses 
him of "preaching anti-Semitism and inflaming religious strife 
and enmity between peoples," and openly urges criminal 
proceedings against the most authoritative Russian archbishop 
under the famous Article 74 of the RSFSR Criminal Code. 
(Footnote 1) ("Congratulations, citizen, you lied," one famous 
literary character used to say in such situations.) 
  What is the reason, however, for Mr. Yakunin's unstoppable 
rage of denunciation? It turns out that on 22 March 1994 a RUS 
PRAVOSLAVNAYA newspaper insert devoted its issue to discussion 
of the "forbidden" Jewish question. The key material in that 
issue was an article by His Eminence Ioann "Creators of 
Cataclysms," in which he answered questions and letters from 
readers, including foreign ones. Urging, by the way, that 
discussion of this topic be approached "without hatred and 
bitterness," "without preconceived conclusions," and without 
pinning insulting and unfounded labels onto opponents. 
Unfortunately, as the material in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA shows, 
this appeal went unheeded. 
  Keeping in mind G.P. Yakunin's origins, we understand his 
interest in discussing the Jewish topic. Moreover, we share his 
concern in the part that incompetent consideration of this 
issue, as well as hushing it up without good reason, may be 
fraught with negative consequences for Russia's sociopolitical 
life. It is unclear, however, why at the same time some 
politicians persistently try to suppress public, pluralistic, 
comprehensive, and interested debate of this burning and topical 
problem. 
  Against the background of the unprecedented groundless 
stream 
of accusations dumped on Metropolitan Ioann, permit us to pose a 
few questions to Mr. Yakunin as well. Such as: 
  --Why does any attempt on the part of the public to touch on 
the "forbidden" topic and begin constructive discussion of it 
cause a hysterical reaction on the part of the groveling press? 
  --Why does the unwritten "double standard" permit, for 
instance, Svanidze to feed with impunity the fruits of his 
wounded ethnic pride to multimillion television audiences--such 
as vulgar concoctions regarding "Zhirinovskiy the Jew"--while at 
the same time suppressing all attempts on the part of 
"outsiders" to discuss the Jewish question at a serious 
scientific-historic and moral-religious level instead of a 
kitchen-provincial one? 
  --Why is the mean and unfounded lie of "Russian 
anti-Semitism," "Russian chauvinism," and "Russian imperialism" 
being spread so willingly by "democratic" mass media, while the 
slandered and plundered Russia is sliding deeper and deeper into 
the abyss of public chaos? 
  One can ask many more such questions. Judging by all signs, 
neither the "democratic public" nor the powers that be 
apparently have any intention of answering them. On the other 
hand, there is still hope that the Russian people, awakening 
from decades of atheistic and cosmopolitan haze, will figure out 
on their own who is their enemy and who is their friend; who is 
a loving--albeit strict--shepherd, and who is a provocateur and 
a liar. 
  As to Mr. Yakunin's exhortations to put Metropolitan Ioann 
on 
trial, they truly are superb! 
  In conclusion we cannot refrain from the pleasure of quoting 
two excerpts which shed an especially clear light on Mr. 
Yakunin's complete theological and political incompetency. The 
first belongs to the holy saint John Chrysostom, to this day 
revered by the entire Universal Church (even Catholics) as one 
of the pillars of the Divine Truth. 
  "A synagogue is a thieves' den and a lair of beasts," this 
holy man said 1,500 years ago (should we perhaps put him on 
trial, too, under Article 74?). "Demons inhabit it, and not only 
this place but also the very souls of Hebrews. Should we not 
avert ourselves from them as a universal disease and a sore for 
the entire universe? Is there any evil they have not committed? 
Is there a villainy or lawlessness that has not been surpassed 
by their infamous murders?... What should amaze us in them the 
most? Their dishonesty, or their cruelty and inhumanity?... If 
someone killed your son, tell me, would you be able to look at 
such person, to listen to him talk? The Jews killed the Son of 
your Lord, and you dare to hold court with them in one and the 
same place?" 
  The second quote belongs to Henry Kissinger, the famous 
American politician of Jewish origin. "Anybody who has at least 
minimally seriously studied Russian history," he said recently, 
"knows that it was Russian nationalism that always ensured the 
integrity of the country and helped it deal with numerous 
enemies and troubles. Now the Russians have lost the huge empire 
they built. Could anyone expect a different reaction to this 
humiliation other than an explosion of nationalism? I see 
Russian nationalism as simply a reality of Russian life, which 
we should accept the way it is..." 
  Very valuable advice for everyone who, like G.P. Yakunin, is 
blinded by hatred toward the Russian people and the Orthodox 
Church.

<F P=106> [Roundtable discussion with Chairman of the Majority Party </F>
Vyacheslav Grechnev; People's Artist of Russia Vera Vasilyeva; 
Yuriy Moiseyev, member of the Majority Party Political Council, 
president of the Russian Potato concern, and doctor of chemical 
science; and Andrey Orlov, member of the Political Council, vice 
dean of the Economic Academy, and doctor of economic science; by 
LITERATURNAYA GAZETA senior staff members at the LITERATURNAYA 
GAZETA editorial offices; date not given: "Will the Majority 
Follow the Majority Party?"] 
  [Text] A year and a half ago LITERATURNAYA GAZETA 
made a trip to Germany. At the request of our German colleagues 
we brought to a "roundtable" organized by them representatives 
of all the parties then registered in Russia. At the time there 
were 25. The Germans were bewildered: How do you navigate in 
such a large number of parties; we in Germany have only four 
major ones and several small ones that are of no consequence? 
The LITERATURNAYA GAZETA staff promised them that Russia, too, 
will have everything the way it is supposed to be "in a polite 
society"--two, three, or four parties. A year and a half passed, 
however, and instead of 25 parties we have 40, or perhaps 50 (it 
is hard to keep track)! 
  Not too long ago a new party appeared on the horizon, 
which chose a name that carries quite a claim--the Majority 
Party. So we decided to ask them a question: How does the idea 
to set up a party come up today; what is it set up for? 
  Our guests at the LITERATURNAYA GAZETA editorial 
offices are Chairman of the Majority Party Vyacheslav Grechnev; 
People's Artist of Russia Vera Vasilyeva; Yuriy Moiseyev, member 
of the party's political council, president of the Russian 
Potato concern, doctor of chemical science; and Andrey Orlov, 
member of the political council, vice dean of the Economic 
Academy, and doctor of economic science. 
  Senior staff members of LITERATURNAYA GAZETA 
participated in the discussion. 
<H5>  Writhing Mute Streets </H5>
  [Grechnev] How are parties formed? Probably in different 
ways. As to our party, if someone told me three months ago that 
I would be participating in this, I would have been very 
surprised. After the 12 December elections, when the elements of 
society's disintegration became obvious; when one could figure 
out using a simple calculator that only 17-20 percent of 
Russians were represented in the parliament; when we saw that, 
on one hand, a clown had come to the forefront of politics, and 
on the other, Russia's Choice's weaknesses became obvious, we 
came to the conclusion that Russia needs a new party that will 
reflect the interests of the majority of its population. 
  [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] We--meaning who? 
  [Grechnev] A group of entrepreneurs and intellectuals in the 
humanities. We came to the conclusion that in reality Russia 
does not have parties as such at all. They are more like 
associations by interests: a club of Zhirinovskiy lovers, a club 
of beer lovers... As for a true party that would express the 
interests of average business, the interests of the middle class 
in the population, such really does not exist in Russia. 
  We decided to create a party that would truly be a party and 
represent the interests not only of the Moscow mingling circuit 
but mainly those of the regions. It did not take us long to set 
up a party organizing committee, hold a founding congress, and 
open branches in 58 regions. 
  We acted on the following principle: At the first stage we 
contacted commercial, cultural, and sports structures with whom 
we had partnership relations. This facilitated the search. Take 
for instance entrepreneurs. As a rule, they are successful 
entrepreneurs. At their enterprises they pay decent salaries. 
And the families that work here also trust those who let people 
work normally and earn a normal living. You know, we ourselves 
did not expect the tremendous, snowball support we got. We have 
already made a trip to the Urals--Chelyabinsk, Chelyabinsk 
Oblast, Sverdlovsk Oblast, Yekaterinburg, Nizhniy Tagil. These 
are huge regions with immense potential. We visited Bryansk 
Oblast--regional branches are operating there actively. There is 
interest in our party in the North Caucasus. We have a very 
strong branch in Smolensk, and there is lot of interest in us in 
Kaliningrad Oblast and Kaliningrad itself. 
  [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] Do you consider the name of your 
party 
well chosen--the Majority Party? On one hand, it sounds like 
pure advertising; on the other, you will be nicknamed 
Bolsheviks. In reality, it follows from your program documents 
that you intend to be a party of the middle class, and among 
other things a party of small and medium-size business. In such 
a case, why could you not make this clear right away? 
  [Grechnev] We thought for a long time about the name; it is 
not accidental. This name expresses the very essence. I will 
explain why. In our opinion, in a normal, civilized society, 
where Russia should belong, the middle stratum of the 
population, the middle class, should comprise 70-80 percent of 
the population. It includes far more than just entrepreneurs, of 
whom there are no more than 15 percent in society; it truly is a 
majority. In our perception the middle class includes skilled 
workers, doctors, teachers, engineers, any specialists working 
for hire or self-employed, professional athletes, creative 
intelligentsia, retired military officers, small and medium-size 
business owners... In short, everyone who is engaged or wishes 
to be engaged in free, creative, highly skilled labor. This 
stratum effective maintains the state, ensures its prosperity. 
That is why we say that we want to express and defend the 
interests of the majority, the middle class. 
  [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] You said that you have support in the 
regions. Any party in the country probably has support in the 
regions. Shakhray, for instance, proclaimed that his PRES [Party 
of Russian Unity and Accord] is a party whose support base is 
the regions. According to you there are capital city parties and 
there are all-Russia parties, right? 
  [Grechnev] As to Shakhray, the tactics he uses in work with 
the regions is bewildering. He calls a head of administration, 
talks to him, and after that believes that the region supports 
him. This is far from true. The impression that heads of 
administration have a great influence on the situation in the 
regions is incorrect. Rather the contrary, entrepreneurs 
directly supply them with foodstuffs. Therefore a head of 
administration also depends on the entrepreneurial class. To the 
best of my knowledge Shakhray, at least in the regions where we 
traveled, did not deem it necessary to establish contacts with 
local entrepreneurs. So I do not know how real his support in 
the regions is. 
  [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] It is difficult to set up a party 
these days. It takes money. Who is behind your party? Big 
capital? Medium-size? Small? 
  [Grechnev] Medium-size capital. That is, people who have 
earned their money themselves. They are mostly our business 
partners. Trade business, construction... 
<H5>  The Market Is Being Strangled by Taxes </H5>
  [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] From some of your remarks one may 
draw 
the conclusion that you do not believe that all businessmen have 
earned their fortune honestly. Of course, this is true. But here 
is the question: Do you work only with those you consider 
absolutely honest? 
  [Grechnev] We are not interested in how a person earned his 
money. We are not the procuracy or a court. This is a matter for 
a person's conscience and appropriate law enforcement organs. If 
a person shares our views; if he has money and will contribute 
to the stabilization of society--for goodness sake, we are 
always open. 
  [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] When one reads your program there are 
some unclear points. We would like to hear more specifically 
what you offer instead of, for instance, Gaydar's economic 
policy. How is your economic program different from other 
parties' programs? 
  [Grechnev] Let us begin with taxes. In our opinion, until 
the 
system of taxation is fundamentally changed no further reform, 
no pulling out of the crisis is possible. 
  [Orlov] Our current system of taxation is completely 
anomalous, idiotic. No matter how you count it, right now from 
every million rubles [R] made by an entrepreneur, 
R850,000-900,000 "disappear." There are 40-plus taxes--federal, 
republic, city... 
  The conclusion is very simple. Until R650,000 out of this 
million remains for investment, development based on market 
forces, production is not going to grow. And we will not build a 
critical mass of small business, will not be able to support 
that part of the middle class that is already deteriorating 
today. And is our potential for the 21st century. This means 
that we have to create a new tax structure. For our party this 
is a very real question. We have announced an international 
competition to develop the best tax system. 
  [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] What problem would you name as second 
in importance after taxes? 
  [Orlov] We are facing an explosion of unemployment. In the 
worst case scenario, keeping in mind the VPK 
[military-industrial complex] potential--up to 30-35 million 
persons. In the medium-gravity scenario--up to 12-15 million and 
a change from latent, hidden unemployment to open. Among the 
unemployed will be a tremendous number of people we consider 
middle class. Based on that, we placed the emphasis on a simple, 
well-developed, easy to understand economic program. So that 
people will not evade taxes. So that we will find stimuli for an 
economic upturn. We have a number of concrete projects that will 
allow us to improve the economic situation, Yes, inflation will 
persist, but it can be reduced. 
  The proposals for tax systems we have already received in 
the 
competition tell us that such potential is there. 
  [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] In your remarks you frequently 
mention 
the names of Abalkin, Petrakov, and Shatalin. Does this mean 
that if your party comes to power, these are people who will be 
your advisers rather than younger economists? 
  [Orlov] No, it does not. In the past I was indeed close to 
this group. But I believe now that, with the exception of 
Petrakov, they have somewhat exhausted their potential. Today we 
need young flexible minds. And we have on our team many young, 
talented people. 
  [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] In your opinion, is the return to 
state regulation, a planned economy possible? 
  [Orlov] Impossible. 
  [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] And what if those who insist on such 
a 
return come to power? 
  [Orlov] Well, with the attitudes that currently exist in 
society, with the way we are moving now, they are not going to 
get power. 
  [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] No, this is not what we are asking: 
What if they do take power? 
  [Orlov] If they take power, we will fight, we will argue 
that 
they will lead us into another dead end... 
  [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] Some people believe that even if 
retrogrades take the power, the processes in the economy are 
already irreversible and there is no way back... 
  [Orlov] They themselves understand this. They know full well 
that there is no way back. You can slow down some things; some 
components in the equation may be changed, but there cannot be a 
genuine turning back... There is another possibility--a partial 
return. For instance, market socialism with some new face. A lot 
of state ownership, a lot of regulation, a lot of all sorts of 
slogans: Let us protect these, and those... Not such a fast 
progression to a liberal economy of the American type, but 
something like a social market economy. 
  [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] What is your position in the current 
polemics around customs duties? 
  [Orlov] They are needed, of course, but not as high as they 
have been set. 
  [Grechnev] It is just that this is a bad time to impose 
them. 
In time, when production is up; when a new taxation system is in 
place; when it is profitable for producers to work and expand 
production--then, of course, in order to protect the domestic 
producer customs duties will need to be imposed. 
<H5>  Does a Party Need Discipline? </H5>
  [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] There is an obvious contradiction in 
your program documents between the claim to be a party of the 
majority and the disciplinary restrictions you intend to impose 
on your ranks. You even use the odious term "democratic 
centralism..." You have not offered anything unifying in the 
sphere of ideology. Only disciplinary measures. 
  [Grechnev] I do not see any contradiction here. You say that 
you cannot pinpoint the ideology. In my opinion, the ideology is 
defined very precisely and clearly. What is, for example, 
important for me as a businessman and a member of the middle 
class? First and foremost, stability in society. A society that 
is split into the lumpen and the elite is unstable... 
  About democratic centralism. This is our reaction to the 
past 
few years of the democratic talking shop. Only talking shop, no 
real action. People do not have any real responsibility. We 
think, on the other hand, that real members of our party will 
have a real responsibility to it. Because they will receive and 
already receive something from the party. I do not mean some 
monetary handout or something of this kind. We help people in 
their self-realization. To some we give a direct distribution 
market. To others we help find jobs. That is, we do real things. 
And while for others things did not get beyond declarations, we 
gather our supporters by concrete, real actions; we help them, 
and we have the right to ask for reciprocity. 
  [Orlov] Today our task is to create distribution markets, 
create new jobs, create schools for young talents... We have, 
for instance, a studio which is called exactly this: "Young 
Talents." We sponsor it. A wonderful school! They recently gave 
a great concert in the Rakhmaninov Hall in the conservatory. If 
we do not support this, we will lose a great number of talented 
kids brought in from all over the former Union. But in order to 
help, we ourselves have to be well organized. 
<H5>  Place in the Political Spectrum </H5>
  [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] What are your goals in the area of 
privatization? In your opinion, is it being conducted the right 
way? What do you think about vouchers? 
  [Orlov] We have to start with land. Establish true ownership 
of it. Look at what is happening now. There are 200,000 peasant 
and private farms. But have you counted how many of them are 
true, market-type? Only 25-30 percent. And they only feed 
themselves; the rest are merely registered. The critical mass, 
however, which forms a real market, must comprise at least 
500,000 farms. Only then will some sort of competitive basis 
appear. Next we have to organize 3-5 million small 
enterprises... Vouchers are a stage I call a registration 
stage--statistical, learning stage. We have not yet achieved 
fundamental change. 
  [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] But voucherization has already taken 
place; this is a fact... 
  [Orlov] When I go to my dairy store on Gruzinskaya Street I 
see a new sign there--a TOO [limited liability partnership) or 
AO (joint-stock company). But it is as dirty as it used to be. 
And the sales clerks are as rude as they used to be... So what 
has privatization given us? Is this an increase in efficiency? 
Is this an upturn coming in place of losses and decline? 
  [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] When a new party appears on the stage 
everybody wants to know that kind of party it is. There are 
certain tests by which the reader can determine what part of the 
political spectrum you are in. Test No. 1: Which of the Duma 
parties is closest to you? 
  [Grechnev] Probably Shakhray's party, because it places 
emphasis on the regions. We, too, as we have already said, want 
to be a party of the regions rather than a Moscow party. 
  [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] Test No. 2: How do you feel about 
calls to restore the USSR? 
  [Grechnev] In our opinion, restoring the USSR in the form in 
which it existed before certain events is impossible. 
  [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] But do you see unification in some 
form? Or do you support the CIS? Or something else? 
  [Grechnev] I will answer the question this way. There was 
Russia, Russia Minor, and Belorussia. This is the way it should 
be. It is one whole organism. 
  [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] But Russia Minor does not want to be 
with us. 
  [Grechnev] This is an arguable contention--about Russia 
Minor. A Ukrainian Majority Party is being set up there. Also a 
Belorussian Majority Party. Hopefully we will work together. 
  [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] How do you feel about the recent 
amnesty declared by the Duma? 
  [Grechnev] In my opinion, when mercy is shown, this is good. 
But the degree of culpability should be determined by a court. 
  [Orlov] I also want to add that it would be good if the 
initiative in such matters came from the president. 
  [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] Do you have a presidential candidate? 
  [Grechnev] Yes. A well-known name, but we do not want to 
mention it yet. A person who shares our views. 
  [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] What will you say regarding the 
current rumors that Luzhkov supports your party? 
  [Grechnev] I think Luzhkov is the best person to speak up on 
this subject. And he has said that he has nothing to do with our 
party and that he wrote greetings to our congress at the request 
of a friend who shares the views of our party and since his own, 
Luzhkov's, views are not in conflict with it. 
<H5>  Russia Is a Rural Country </H5>
  [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] In your perception, do peasants 
belong 
with the middle class? 
  [Moiseyev] Yes, we believe that ordinary rural 
workers--peasants, farmers--are part of the middle class. 
Although they as a social group have a number of special traits 
that have to be taken into account. First and foremost, the 
rural population is a pragmatic part of the population, the most 
pragmatic one, which no longer believes slogans. They do not 
accept revolutionary reforms. Therefore, when farmers come and 
say: Let us divide everything--it causes psychological 
hostility. Finally, it is the most technologically backward part 
of the population. As a result, they have higher production 
costs, greater storage losses... So now we have arrived at such 
a logical state where food prices in the domestic market are 
higher than world prices. And lastly, a proprietor is developing 
now in each producer in the rural area. While in the past 
house-adjacent plots were mere vegetable gardens, now people 
have one or two hectares. They are becoming private producers of 
goods. But at the same time they do not want to leave state 
organizations. If a person works at a post office, or someplace 
else, or in a kolkhoz, he does not want to leave. Such duality 
requires great tact in treating the choice of path Russia will 
follow in this area. 
  [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] But do we not have to finally get 
this 
sluggish cart moving? 
  [Moiseyev] We are looking into various scenarios now. The 
first is the administrative way: make everyone a farmer. Today 
farmers occupy 2 percent of the total area and produce as much 
output--a little more than 2 percent. That is, when it comes to 
efficiency they are no different from other sectors in 
agriculture. This way, as I already said, currently causes 
hostility on the part of the rest of the rural population. From 
the economic and psychological standpoint, I think that in the 
nearest future any forcible pressure in this area is 
unacceptable. I can quote in this respect the famous message of 
Petr Filippov, head of the Analytical Center of the President's 
Administration, in which he recommended "breaking up" over the 
period March-April large producers into smaller partnerships 
comprising 20-30 persons. Naturally the countryside was 
completely hostile to the idea. 
  The second way is currently officially supported by that 
part 
of the Duma that oversees the agrarian sector. It envisages 
continuing financial aid to the agrarian sector. But this is a 
temporary measure. 
  [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] So what way do you--the Majority 
Party--propose? 
  [Moiseyev] We are searching for a third way. And we see two 
potential trends here. The first is in uniting rather than 
pitching against one another personal plot owners, who at the 
same time also participate in collective production. This may be 
perhaps a purely Russian way. It requires division of functions 
instead of division of property. If a collective entity takes 
upon itself procurement of seed and equipment, and will take the 
final product from the peasants--this will be a rational 
division of functions. Therefore, new structures must emerge on 
the microeconomic level. They already exist now, and we actively 
support them. 
  [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] You said that there are two trends. 
What is the other one? 
  [Moiseyev] The second trend is that associations, concerns, 
and corporations must emerge on a higher, macroeconomic level. 
Not by the territorial principle, however--by product. We had 
the experience before the reform of organizing the APK 
[agro-industrial complex] by territorial attribute. Meanwhile, 
the experience of world development shows that a different 
variant is more promising. Sometime after the crisis of the 
1930's large concerns came into existence--such as Coca-Cola, 
Pepsi-Cola--which combine production, growing, distribution, and 
even science in their field. 
<H5>  Who Are You With, Stage Workers? </H5>
  [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] Let us now ask Vera Kuzminichna: Has 
the entire Theater of Satire joined the Majority Party or only 
part of it? And how did you come into the party? 
  [Vasilyeva] The Theater of Satire is not part of any 
parties, 
including this one. The same goes for me. Being the age I am and 
having experienced so many disappointments, it would be stupid 
to run from one party to another. But there are things I 
consider very important and welcome. This is what I mean. 
  As you know. the situation in culture is very difficult now. 
Our theater is doing quite well, though. As they say, we do not 
go around begging. At a time when everybody is getting rid of 
the "ballast," our people prefer smaller salaries but no 
layoffs. Well, we have four plays in production now, and money 
has been found for all four of them. For a year, however, we, 
together with director Boris Aleksandrovich Lvov-Anokhin, have 
dreamed of producing Gnedich's "The Assembly." The part I have 
is far from a dream part, and I could certainly do without this 
play, but I think it is very much needed precisely now. This is 
also the opinion of our leadership. Because this is a play about 
how Peter the Great attempted to lead our Russia onto a 
civilized road of development, which turned out to be very 
difficult. Everything that is taking place there resonates very 
much with our times. Stealing, drinking. The desire of many 
people, despite tremendous difficulties, to still walk this road 
of civilization. We decided to conduct an experiment: produce 
this play together with the New Drama Theater, which is directed 
by Lvov-Anokhin, because we realize that there are many acting 
parts and expenditures will be considerable. 
  [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] We are beginning to guess: Is it they 
who got you together with the Majority Party? 
  [Vasilyeva] Since I am in charge of the domestic commission 
in the Theater of Satire, where I very frequently have to ask 
for money for old actors, sick people, I am used to asking. I am 
not ashamed of it because I ask not for myself. Therefore, when 
I was invited to this event--I do not even know what to call it: 
a party presentation or simply a meeting--I told the person who 
invited me: "Pardon my cynicism--are there going to be rich 
people there?" I was told: "Yes." I said: "Then I will be happy 
to come. And I will be happy if the new party turns out to be a 
good one. I will speak of every good deed and will never hide 
who helped us." 
  [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] Did you get help? 
  [Vasilyeva] We were promised stage-by-stage financing for 
this production--"The Assembly." I repeat, we are not poor, but 
this will simply be a very good act on the part of a party that 
intends to help intellectuals, people of art, and helps a 
theater in a difficult moment. I consider it a good deed. 
<H5>  The Law Is the Law </H5>
  [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] Another question for the party 
leadership. In your program documents, among the main values you 
mention legality. You write about the primacy of the law, the 
sanctity of the law. But there are laws and laws. You see, you 
are already unhappy about the law on customs duty. On 3-4 
October, too, some defended the law while others apparently 
violated it... 
  [Grechnev] You may have noticed that by our orientation we 
lean towards the conservatives. To take a Western analogy, we 
are a conservative party, and we do indeed respect the law. 
Although we see, of course, the difference between the law and 
the legal system. As to specifically regarding our attitude to 
the October events, we consider it a national tragedy. As your 
newspaper reported, we have opened a special account, money from 
which will be used to aid all victims of this tragedy. 
  [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] Once again about your program goals. 
You make your priority a strong, stable state as a guarantor of 
freedom, dignity, human rights, and the individual, etc. But in 
Russia, the state, the bureaucratic state, has always been and 
remains the opposite--a guarantor of lack of freedom. A 
guarantor of suppression, an annihilator of the individual. The 
bureaucracy has acquired a gigantic scale even in comparison 
with communist times. How can one worship such a state? Only a 
civil society should be a guarantor of freedom--only such a 
society is capable of restraining the army of bureaucrats. 
  [Grechnev] In my opinion, the state per se currently does 
not 
function at all. What we see is the tyranny of bureaucrats. 
  [Orlov] The situation right now really is anomalous. We 
understand very well that everything is permeated with 
corruption. We have to create a civilized stratum of civil 
servants. But bureaucrats are not necessarily the state. A state 
is a combination of at least three authorities: executive, 
legislative, and judiciary. We in the party also attach great 
significance to the fourth estate--the mass media. We are 
supporters of a state in which laws are intelligent; where there 
is a combination of effective authorities, with a great role for 
judiciary structures. As for building a civil society--this is a 
long process. 
<H5>  We Are Open to Everyone </H5>
  [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] Do you know how many members you 
currently have, or is there no such record-keeping? 
  [Grechnev] There is. We receive up-to-date information. 
There 
are about 200,000 active party members. 
  [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] In one of your program documents 
there 
are words about the priority you attach to the development of 
Russian spirituality. Do you have a certain weakness for 
national-patriots? 
  [Grechnev] We are talking about Russia's [rossiyskaya], not 
Russian, spirituality. We have emphasized this many times. 
  [Orlov] It is our principle, which also was expressed at the 
congress. There can be no doubt about it. The same extends to 
our attitude to different religious confessions. We are an open 
party. 
  [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] How do you feel about such populist 
undertakings as a beer lovers party? 
  [Grechnev] I like beer. 
  [Orlov] Let there be a lot of beer, good-tasting and 
different. 
  [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] The last question--on your plans for 
the immediate future. What can we expect of your party? In which 
elections will it participate? 
  [Grechnev] The plan for the immediate future is to work with 
the regions, travel to the regions: Orel Oblast, Nizhniy 
Novgorod, Bryansk, Kirov, Yakutsk, Kabardino-Balkaria. We will 
participate in elections whenever they take place. We are ready. 
We are already participating in regional elections. 
  [Orlov] We are setting up international contacts. We will 
visit Austria and Germany. 
  [Grechnev] At the end of the month I am going to Cyprus, 
where we have already established contacts with the Conservative 
Party. 
  [Orlov] We have very promising contacts in the United 
States. 
Everything will be fine, we hope. 
  [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] Can we see your party card? 
  [Grechnev] We have the design, and the cards will be printed 
soon. 
<H8>  *** </H8>
  As this issue of LITERATURNAYA GAZETA was going to print, 
the 
Majority Party held another press conference, at which the party 
leadership expressed their attitude to the draft Agreement on 
Civic Accord. The statement says that while supporting the IDEA 
of the agreement, the party at this point cannot endorse this 
wording of the document. For instance, calls for compliance with 
the constitution--which is the duty of any citizen regardless of 
agreements--are seen by the Majority Party leadership first as 
nonsense, and second, as an attempt to place this document above 
the constitution. Also unacceptable is the desire of the 
document's authors to impose additional political restrictions 
in the form of obligations to "not initiate political campaigns 
with the purpose of holding early elections of federal organs of 
authority," "not conduct and not participate in organizing 
strikes," and others. 
  In many of its provisions, the party said at the press 
conference, this agreement is just a collection of obvious 
maxims and banal assertions. To endorse such a document would be 
TANTAMOUNT TO ENDORSING THE BIBLE. 
  At the same time, it was said that the Majority Party is 
ready to take part in work on the preparation of a more serious 
Memorandum of Accord. It will bring into this work the cadres of 
highly skilled jurists, economists, and political scientists the 
party has at its disposal.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Barkashov by correspondent Valeriy </F>
Batuyev; place and date not given: "Those Who Are Called Brown. 
Honor and Russia Barkashov-Style"] 
  [Text] Aleksandr Barkashov too, it turns out, intends 
to put himself in the running in the presidential elections in 
1996 and offer the people his model of society. Its essence is 
reflected in the "code of honor"--the party document of "Russian 
National Unity." Our correspondent Valeriy Batuyev met with 
Aleksandr Barkashov a couple of days ago. 
  A couple of provisions of the code of honor: 
  "The comrade-in-arms (party title.--ed.)...must restore 
justice to the Russian people with his power and his arms, 
without appealing to judicial or other authorities." 
  "Any questions are decided by the comrade-in-arms, 
guided only by his national sense of justice in keeping with the 
authority granted to him by the Chief Comrade-in-Arms, and he 
obeys no other laws." 
  "The comrade-in-arms must constantly recall that Russia 
has no friends. Anyone who forgets this becomes a traitor." 
  "Persecution of foreign and domestic enemies of the 
Russian Nation, regardless of how far they might be outside 
Russia's borders, is a matter of honor for the comrade-in-arms." 
  "The comrade-in-arms can cleanse himself of shame only 
with blood." 
  "Betrayal is the most heinous crime for the 
comrade-in-arms and is punishable by the death sentence." 
  [Batuyev] Aleksandr Petrovich, what do you mean by the word 
honor? 
  [Barkashov] This is a person's internal condition (each 
person concretely!) as well as the general condition of people 
who are joined together by a national or civil principle. A 
person cannot allow others to spit in his face. Regardless of 
what kind of spit it is: social, political, ethnic...if small 
ethnic groups can join into communities to protect their 
political and ethnic interests, the Russian people have been 
deprived of this right. As soon as we join together to protect 
our national interests, people immediately begin to call us 
chauvinists and fascists. Is that not spit? 
  [Batuyev] "Everything for the Nation. Nothing against the 
Nation. The Nation is above all." It is this "life principle" of 
the comrade-in-arms that gives many people justification for 
calling you Nazis or fascists. 
  [Barkashov] Since they have no alternative to our ideology, 
they have no arguments with which to respond to us, they, like 
little children, descend to the level of name calling and pin 
labels on us. Yes, I am a Nazi. What is wrong with that? Nazi 
consists of two words--nationalism and socialism. The first is 
the elevation, the revival of our nation, and socialism is 
social justice, that is, I am in favor of what the communists 
and democrats are fighting against. 
  [Batuyev] If you are really guided by the teachings of Jesus 
Christ with respect to the Russian people, certain points of the 
Code: "A comrade-in-arms can cleanse himself of shame only with 
blood," and "betrayal is punishable by the death 
sentence"--contradict the Christian "thou shalt not kill." 
  [Barkashov] If the comrade-in-arms has violated his oath, 
the 
Code of Honor, he must take actions which can wash away this 
shame. He can go to a "hot spot" and defend the interests of the 
Russian people. There are also other alternatives. 
  [Batuyev] You said that you are offering a new model of 
society. 
  [Barkashov] The power will belong to the people and at the 
same time be authoritarian. 
  [Batuyev] That is, according to the principle of your party: 
The Chief Comrade-in-Arms, the other comrades-in-arms, the 
associates, and the sympathizers? 
  [Barkashov] Quite right. The hierarchical ladder is not 
frozen in place. The most worthy people, the nation's cream of 
the crop, will advance to the power structure. 
  [Batuyev] And all "non-Russians," "non-sympathizers" with 
your movement will end up outside our state? 
  [Barkashov] Why so? Any state has a Constitution which 
determines the activity of any citizen. If he is obedient and 
follows this law of the society and the state conscientiously 
fulfills its obligations, this person can live peacefully in our 
state, even if he does not share our views. But if he undermines 
the system of our values, fights against them, and thus 
undermines the unity of our nation, the state, naturally, will 
have no place for him. 
  [Batuyev] I have heard that many comrades-in-arms viewed 
your 
flight as a violation of the Code of Honor and that the attempt 
on your life on 20 December 1993 was made by them as a kind of 
revenge. 
  [Barkashov] There was no flight. We all left together when a 
decision was made to cease resistance. I wanted them to arrest 
me along with Achalov, but the officer from the Ministry of 
Security said that he had no order for my arrest and he would 
not act arbitrarily. I left with everyone else. 
  [Batuyev] On 6 October you were 40 years old. Where did you 
celebrate your birthday? 
  [Barkashov] At someone else's dacha. It was 20 kilometers 
from Moscow. 
  [Batuyev] But your neo-Nazi friends in Germany were waiting 
for you at that time. 
  [Barkashov] Indeed, a group of our comrades-in-arms had gone 
to Germany and met there with people who share our 
views...without contacting me, the boys accepted their 
invitation, but I had other plans. I was in Moscow the whole 
time. True, I went to Belarus for three days. 
  [Batuyev] What authority do you delegate to your 
comrades-in-arms? Is it possible for them actually not to obey 
"any other laws" of the society? 
  [Barkashov] Only a person who enters our organization can 
know what this authority is. In what case can we go against the 
law? If the Constitution is changed by the will of several 
people, as it was in September-October, and is violated 
unilaterally, the other side automatically receives this right.

<F P=106> [Dialogue between ZAVTRA Editor in Chief Aleksandr Prokhanov </F>
and Aleksandr Barkashov; place and date not given: "Aleksandr 
Barkashov: 'Heil Russia!'"] 
  [Text] [Prokhanov] I see the past two years as an integral, 
complete period: political, spiritual, perhaps even 
spiritual-religious. One could see this especially clearly when 
that period was brought to an end--over there on the Moscow 
River embankment, by this blaze, this massacre... 
  As a writer, a novelist, I felt that Russian history itself 
was writing a novel. Amazing people came through my editorial 
offices; their characters and internal relations developed. 
These relations turned into friendships, conflicts, enmity, and 
then people would come back together again. And the entire 
sequence of events entwined into some sort of knot, some plot, 
some suspenseful, frightening, mystical novel, which had to have 
a focus and a resolution. I was waiting for this, I repeat, not 
as a politician, but as an intuitivist. I expected this novel to 
end in tragedy: blood, grief, stoicism, some explosion of 
light-bearing energy. 
  And during those days in September-October, when I was tied 
up in the newspaper process and in politics, meetings, 
intrigues, struggle, I was not able to grasp to the end or 
understand these events in the House of Soviets. Our meeting 
there, fleeting as if in a fog, when I walked into the room and 
you were sitting there, tired after a sleepless night; fleeting 
meetings with Achalov, Rutskoy, with our politician-friends, 
Sterligov, spies and saboteurs--all of this for me is still some 
mysterious, tangled web. 
  It is very important for me to learn from you how you acted, 
how you lived, how you felt in the White House labyrinths--both 
your movement and you personally. What have you learned from 
this; what was your understanding of this process? 
  [Barkashov] The events that are happening in our country are 
undoubtedly of a metaphysical nature. It is almost meaningless 
to try them on, appraise them from the standpoint of political 
gain. Unfortunately, many still have not understood this and are 
attempting to make political calculations and forecasts--all for 
the purpose of jumping to one side or the other in time and not 
ending up a loser. Time has already shown that those who were 
guided by this political reckoning lost in the long run. While 
those, I think, who were guided by intuitive feeling gained 
politically, although perhaps this was not their goal. And this 
knot, as you said, was being entwined not out of political 
expediency. I also was in contact with many people then. I 
worked rather closely with Sterligov and others... 
  The search for political alliances brought satisfaction. 
There was this inner feeling--not only mine but also of my 
comrades--that some historic mystery was taking place in Russia, 
and we need to look for friends, strategic allies in exactly 
this, mystical spirit that permeated this event. 
  Of course, we came to the White House not out of political 
considerations. It is just that there were concrete people, with 
whom we were friends, who saw the situation more or less the 
same way we did and tried to participate in it in order to move 
events in the direction they wanted. I remember your words: You 
were sitting at the table, visiting Achalov, and you said: "This 
is not our celebration yet, not our battle." Yes, it was not yet 
our battle; for instance, it would not have brought us a final 
political victory. But we had to try to influence events in such 
a way that sooner or later would make it our hour, our time. We 
had our view of it, our intentions, which perhaps were different 
from the intentions of others. But we could not stand back and 
not participate, and that is why we came to the White House. In 
principle, we could have left, acted differently even at the 
last moment, but we stayed there to the end knowing that a 
mystical event was taking place. Speaking of political 
underpinnings, however, we also anticipated the outcome. But, on 
the one hand, it is the outcome of the preceding stage, and on 
the other--the beginning of a new one. Is it not? 
  Back in March, when all those Moscow brain-grinders were 
interviewing me: "How will you feel about it?...," "Whose side 
will you be on?" we said then that we will be on the side of 
those who raise the issue of the integrity of the state, defense 
of national interests, the issue of Russian people. Since it was 
the Supreme Soviet that did so, specifically Khasbulatov, who 
openly raised the issue of the problems of the Russian people, 
and also Rutskoy, we took their side, of course. We said that we 
will provide a full range of support--from moral to physical. 
Then also, I personally have great respect for General Achalov; 
we are rather close friends; I respect him as a Russian, a 
general, and a man of principle. 
  [Prokhanov] What affected you most from the emotional 
standpoint during all these events? 
  [Barkashov] You know, there were two moments. 
  The first one was on 3 October, when people broke through to 
the White House. During the time of this whole stand-off since 
21 September, when the parliament declared itself a defender of 
interests of the people and statehood and the enemy of those 
destroying it, they naturally wanted to attract to their side 
large numbers of people. The public mind in principle was 
already receptive to the idea of statehood and national 
interests. So on 3 October these people came. I estimated their 
number at 100,000. Later, talking to foreign journalists who 
have a better eye for this, I learned that 500,000 people came. 
You saw it for yourself: They were not lumpen, as we were told; 
they were the cream of Moscow, mainly young people between 17 
and 25 and mature men, 35 and older. Clear, pure 
faces--distorted, of course, somewhat by emotions and the heat 
of battle, but, I repeat, this was the cream of Moscow. Workers, 
officers--whose who make up the foundation of the state. 
  So they came, this half a million people, and the 
parliament, 
which wanted them there, and the leaders of this stand-off did 
not succeed in organizing the actions of those who came to their 
aid. On the one hand, they wanted it; on the other--they were 
caught unprepared. On 3 October, when all this happened in such 
a disorganized and chaotic manner, one could see that there were 
some with a lot of personal ambition, their own calculations; at 
the same time, the people who came to their aid were united by a 
common sense of support. And this, so to say, disparity between 
those who had urged them to come and those who came was 
especially noticeable. In principle, the situation was 
controllable and much could be directed differently. This is 
when I experienced--not even disappointment, but a very strong 
emotion that it happened this way. 
  The second moment was on 4 October, when at about noon we 
realized that we would not get out of there alive. I was very 
concerned for my people. They were doomed just like everyone 
else who was at the Supreme Soviet, but it was I who had brought 
them there, and therefore they were my responsibility. And of 
course, I was also concerned about the family. But then I 
thought that war is war, and there always are losses. 
  These were the two most emotional moments of that period. 
  [Prokhanov] After that physical defeat--because I believe 
that spiritually and morally we did not lose but win--you were 
stronger, stood taller, nobler; and heroes were among us, not 
among the "knights," OMON [Special Designation Militia 
Detachments], and beytars... after that the next 10 days were 
terrible. I felt as if Moscow was black, sticky; that it had 
been surrendered to rapists. And all of this was done by the 
most cruel laws of a torture chamber. The nation was being 
raped; the people were being raped for the entire subsequent 
period, that is, the worst there is in a human being was being 
brought out: fear, animal fear, social fear. 
  I remember how terrible it was to learn that Anpilov had 
been 
arrested--he was not able to disappear despite the fact that he 
represented one of the most secret organizations. Which means 
there is no secrecy, no organization, and what is there is 
defenselessness and helplessness... 
  Konstantinov was arrested, although one would think that all 
he had to do was sit tight in a safe place and not venture 
anywhere. But some force--whether infantilism, madness, or 
anxiety and helplessness--compelled him to get out on the 
street, where he was immediately arrested. 
  And I remember how everybody asked: "What about Barkashov? 
What about Barkashov?" No, Barkashov has not been arrested, he 
is hiding in the woods, he has survived. That Barkashov remained 
at large all those days inspired joy, hope that he would indeed 
get through this period of persecution and remain at the helm of 
his movement. And then this terrible news that there was an 
assassination attempt on you, you were shot and wounded, and 
ended up in the hands of oppressors. What can be more horrible 
than a wounded, helpless man finding himself in the hands of 
executioners, enemies? My heart was bleeding for you. 
  Tell us about this incident; there are so many legends 
surrounding it, all sorts of versions, First, how did it all 
happen? 
  [Barkashov] Everything happened more or less as described in 
the newspapers. I was walking at night on business of my 
own--there are such instances when you have to go alone--and I 
was shot at from a passing car. How many times--I cannot tell: 
three, two, one... I did not hear the shots. Simply felt a dull 
blow in the leg and several seconds later realized that I was 
wounded. The car disappeared without slowing down. This happened 
near Krasnogorskiy military hospital, and a passing car took me 
there, Since my condition was grave, I was immediately accepted. 
There I found myself among honest people, who conscientiously 
did what needed to be done. 
  I ended up in the hands of enemies about 10 days later, when 
the information somehow leaked out. They were already looking 
for me. It appears that they knew more or less where to look, 
because there is no other explanation--I was under deep cover in 
this hospital: a different name, different papers... 
  The time I spent in the hospital was hard only from the 
physical standpoint, because I was treated very well there. 
Later, in the Ministry of Internal Affairs [MVD] and then in 
Sailor's Rest prison, it was also hard morally, but I came to 
the conclusion that there are people who share our views 
everywhere, and there are many more normal, good people than bad 
ones, even there. 
  [Prokhanov] What is your own guess regarding that shot; what 
could it be? Beytars on a hunt, the MVD? An accident, a strange 
incident? 
  [Barkashov] It is hard to tell. Usually armies, upon 
capturing a city, were given three days for looting; here they 
had three times three, since Moscow was let up for 10 days. At 
the time we received through our channels information from the 
MVD that there was a secret directive with respect to certain 
people on the wanted list. Do not take prisoners: stage 
resistance to arrest and an escape attempt. Therefore we were 
very cautious during that time; afterwards, we boosted our 
activities and perhaps relaxed; perhaps I personally relaxed. 
  I believe that I myself made it easier: I had not been home 
for quite a while and decided to stop by. This is where they 
picked me up: They had external surveillance in place. Who was 
there--whether it was the MVD, militia, or beytars--they do not 
display signs on their cars. Until then I was out of their 
reach. Why they acted precisely this way, I do not know. Why 
they shot at me instead of arresting me. Maybe they wanted to 
kill me, or maybe to wound me first so that it would be easier 
to take me later--I cannot tell. Neither do I know who it was. 
But I had the impression somehow that is was a special MVD unit. 
  [Prokhanov] Over the past three years since 1991 I have had 
a 
constant feeling that besides a contest of ideas, intrigues, and 
political potentials, a struggle of two principles is also going 
on. And perhaps we called ourselves a "newspaper of spiritual 
opposition" not so much because we do not have tank armies and 
airborne units, do not have our own spetsnaz, as because we 
clearly understood that victory, if we achieve it, must be won 
in the realm of the spirit, as if in heaven. And heaven can 
exist anywhere--in your soul and in your heart. And which spirit 
will turn out stronger: the spirit of darkness, the spirit of 
hell, the spirit of universal cunning, or the spirit of 
stoicism, the spirit of light, the spirit of eternal salutary 
goodwill goals and states. 
  And we remember how during those terrible days of 
despondency, darkness, resistance, when it looked as if even 
unbending people were getting cold feet, people who had lived 
through wars, Afghanistan, suddenly disappeared, others turned 
into shrinking violets, when people were getting hysterical, 
there came your word, this expression of yours: "field of 
honor"--the message you addressed to the public. 
  When I read it, it gave me many noble and bright moments. My 
friend Nevzorov told me the same thing. Aleksandr Glebovich also 
admired your message. It came as if from the rack, from a cross, 
operating table, torture chamber--a time when a person is 
expected to be silent, to moan, to groan. It was a spiritual 
phenomenon; it was a ray of light cutting through the walls of 
Sailor's Rest, and many perceived it precisely as proof of 
spiritual victory. 
  I think that in prison you did not just suffer physically, 
not only were concerned about your family and comrades, but you 
definitely experienced a mystical state. I want to say once 
again: What came through to me in the brief words of your 
message was mystical, holy energy. Did you experience this 
state, or am I mistaken? 
  [Barkashov] No, you are not mistaken. It was precisely in 
Sailor's Rest that I suddenly became convinced that this 
spiritual victory in heaven, as you have described it, had 
already been won. What contributed to it perhaps was my 
psychological state of mind and certain asceticism, cleansing of 
the spirit and body, because I practically did not eat and was 
exhausted. In such a condition, the spirit takes over the flesh; 
mystical horizons open for you. I prayed a lot then--very hard, 
with all my heart, and got a feeling of certainty that we had 
won. It became especially strong in the middle of February--that 
we had already won in spirit, and all that was left to do was 
implement it in a physical sense. It will be difficult, I think, 
but not as difficult as before. 
  What is happening today in the camp of our enemies can be 
analyzed and presented this way and that way, of course. In 
truth, however, they also sense intuitively, with animal 
instinct, that they have lost the spiritual battle. 
So they are scattering like rats. 
  I completely agree with you: There is always a struggle 
between good and evil, but in 1991-1993 it spilled onto the 
political level. This is the only way to look at the situation. 
And since it is this way, we are on the side of good, not evil, 
good in its ultimate manifestation. Time removes all pretenses, 
and no matter what our opponents say, no matter what values they 
use as a cover, one can see that they are demons. And we must 
defeat them. By political or any other means, but we must. 
  [Prokhanov] In the final analysis all that drives us is 
concern for the state of our own soul, repentance for some 
sin--perhaps the original sin, perhaps the sin of a life lived 
iniquitously, and at the same time, concern and caring for the 
people. And thoughts about the people, a part of which each of 
us feels himself, and thoughts of one's own essence, spiritual 
nature, merge together, and frequently are inseparable. Today 
some say of the people: "they are asleep;" others say: "they are 
drinking themselves to death;" still others: "they have betrayed 
their mission, turned into a nation of money-grabbers, a nation 
of money changers. In reality, by their inner self--their 
mystery, their tenderness, their naivete, their virtue--they 
resemble a sleeping knight, who has covered himself with a 
shroud of Christ, a cloak. This cover may look like a horrible, 
disgusting rag or a garment made of foreign fabric in a foreign 
manner, but underneath it breathes the same eternal, mysterious, 
kindred and dear chest of a huge being sleeping--our people. He 
is having a dream in his sleep. And this is my dream, too; I 
also see this dream. 
  [Barkashov] We all see this dream. 
  [Prokhanov] Yes, we all do. It is a dream of some great 
memory, where there are many beautiful mysterious states coming 
from clean rivers, sorcerers making their way along these 
rivers, the first wondrous orthodox temples, snow-white on green 
hills, amazingly wise and kind old men--perhaps half-wizards, 
but also half-first Christians. This is one part of the dream, 
associated with the past, mystical and mysterious, which you do 
not even read about in fairy tales. 
  The other part of the dream is the future. I see the same 
brilliant, light-giving, beautiful future. And it consists of 
shapes that are no longer archaic but symbolic--a huge building, 
cathedral, temple, land covered with flourishing cities and 
roads, where the people you love, brides, children, relatives, 
righteous men live. The country has been turned into a wondrous 
palace built by our labors. This is my vision of our future 
truth and our incarnation--perhaps very personal and subjective. 
  Do you ever get such visions? If you see what I mean, what 
do 
you feel? 
  [Barkashov] I understand you perfectly. It is common today 
among many Russians to look back into the past. It is the memory 
of the soul, the awakening of the archetype, which happens to 
the people at some stage, at the right moment. The dream of the 
future is linked with it, because they will have to break 
through to the future across everything that surrounds them now. 
This awakening happens at a time when it seems that there is no 
place to go, that everything is bound by artificial rules, 
marked by circumstances. It is at this point that man gets a 
vision of the past and the future. Many people are experiencing 
it today. 
  Our people are at a borderline from which they are to break 
through, discarding all circumstances, all conventions imposed 
on them. And this future great endeavor is the reason the people 
have remained silent until now. Look, even democratic 
politicians are amazed: "How long can one keep the Russian 
beast, and keep humiliating it! Somewhere in Salvador they would 
have rioted a long time ago, and more than once, but Russians 
take everything." But this is all because the social factor will 
not be the dominant one in this accomplishment. It may provide 
momentum, start the movement, but the breakthrough will be 
achieved in the mystical, spiritual sphere. 
  Our people are like no other people. A great future awaits 
them, as great as their past. And therefore at a certain stage 
politicians will no longer be able to influence the general 
course no matter how much they want to; they will not be able to 
speculate on the issues of the day, direct the movement--it will 
not longer be in their hands. It will be an explosion of popular 
mysticism, which will provide the energy for building the state. 
And it will be a breakthrough into the future. 
  It is wonderful that many have already developed this 
feeling. This means we have already approached this borderline, 
we are already close to it. By the way, speaking about 
mysticism, this year Orthodox Easter coincides with Walpurgis 
night, when the most powerful occult magic operations take 
place. This is further evidence that this year is especially 
mystical in the sense of the struggle between good and evil and 
will be a decisive one... 
  [Prokhanov] Nevertheless, you and I are not only Orthodox 
mystics, not only monks who have taken the vows of schema or 
zealots--we are politicians, and we know what a political 
organization is; we are concerned with the problem of creating 
powerful patriotic movements. I remember the siege of the 
Writers House in 1991. You were there, too... Since then, rather 
energetic attempts have been made to create a large patriotic 
nationalist party, a right-wing party, a party of the white 
idea. These efforts have not succeeded to this day. There are 
numerous small movements, initiatives, and groups that are very 
attractive by their membership and ideology--not only in Moscow 
but also in the provinces; there have been attempts to unite all 
these forces--first in the Pamyat, then in the Slavic Assembly, 
then in the Russian National Assembly, the National Salvation 
Front [NSF], the Congress... But we still have not pulled 
ourselves together into a right-wing healthy conservative party 
encompassing the nation. 
  What, in your opinion, stands in the way of creating such a 
party? Is it the result of the social factor, meaning that it is 
very difficult to build a stable political organism in a 
disintegrating socium; or is it the result of some psychological 
confusion of the nation as a whole? Or perhaps our people simply 
are not prone to uniting into a traditional type party? Is it 
that the people have different forms of self-organization, 
different forms of collective self-rule? 
  [Barkashov] First, I would like to point out that such a 
party must have a powerful base in the most socially organized 
groups of society. It should not be, for instance, a group of 
intellectuals and "politicians" who get together and decide what 
to do, vote, elect a leadership--and go no further than that. 
The main factor in realizing the idea proclaimed by the Congress 
of Patriotic Forces, the Russian Assembly, or the NSF are the 
Russian people, who are part of different social groups and live 
in different conditions of existence. 
  In order for a party to become a mass organization, popular, 
and capable, we need to first and foremost create an ideology, 
then a grass-roots organizational structure through which to 
promote this ideology, and then finally build on this an 
organization in politically promising social groups. At this 
stage it is, of course, numerous groups, with little money, 
going through difficulties because of the current processes, and 
united by a social attribute. In my opinion, it is first and 
foremost the military, workers, and the youth. This is where we 
should look for support. 
  The failure of all attempts to unite into a single party can 
be explained perhaps by the fact that objectively these groups 
were not yet ready to accept the ideas offered to them. While 
sympathizing with the ideas, they had not yet been brought to 
such a state as to truly accept them, absorb them, and then 
reinforce them in the form of creating organizations. I think 
that now they are ready for this. 
  I have participated in many congresses and know the standard 
fare: get them together; proclaim. And personal ambitions: Who 
sits in the presidium, who will be in charge of this or that. 
Everything is parceled out, and in two weeks all work already 
dies down. For some reason secondary things always get confused 
with priorities. A priority is to prepare the soil, to implant 
the program, ideology, create a social base, and only then a 
congress--as a final stage, as a result of what has been 
achieved. 
  We did it in reverse order: first a congress--as soon as we 
proclaim, state, advertise ourselves, everybody will learn about 
us and run to us--and right away we will have an organization. I 
have always tried to explain that a congress, a conference is 
the final stage of work. But everything was done the other way 
around. 
  Many of those who participated in the congresses did not 
sincerely trust the leadership. Hence all these conflicts and 
ambitions. Because to start serious business with people who 
have different motives, who are cunning, for instance, does not 
make any sense--it dooms us all to defeat before we even start. 
  Now perhaps the time has come for a national movement. We 
have seen each other--those who truly are sincere, able, who 
resonate with us in spirit... At the time this was not the case. 
At the time, we could not sort it all out without trials and 
errors... 
  [Prokhanov] I am labeled a fascist--as are you. And my 
friends, my newspaper are in a way demonized by this label. By 
itself, the term is neither good nor bad. Actually, I still do 
not know what fascism is. There are several varieties of 
political regimes, political trends that are classified as such. 
Some remained theoretical constructions--such as, for instance, 
the Kharbin version of Russian fascism; others, such as the 
Italian version, remained in the shadow of the more powerful 
European national-socialist movement, with which all negative 
aspects of fascism are associated. For instance, Latin American 
variants, which also are called fascism, are completely exotic 
and absolutely unsuitable for Russian soil... 
  [Barkashov] If we look at it closer, you will see that the 
negative points are being over-emphasized, while positive 
fascism--such as, for instance, in Argentina--nobody mentions... 
  [Prokhanov] Nobody mentions Argentina, or Brazil for that 
matter. Neither is anyone talking about the American postwar 
period, which provided stability, some features of which were 
close to components of fascism... 
  After the September-October events Yeltsin established what 
seems to be a "new Russian order." He thinks that he has 
established it, and he is now the master of the next period in 
Russian history. In reality, Yeltsin belongs with the 
post-Soviet period and is already finished, even though he may 
rule for another two or three years. As a political figure, 
Yeltsin is done; he has gone to rot; he is not there, and those 
who want to take power after him are now surfacing. 
  For me, such a dark figure personifying very gloomy, cruel 
parts of our history is Luzhkov with his Moscow group, his 
banks, where 70 percent of all capital in Russia is concentrated 
and which he controls through commercial and economic 
structures. MOST [BRIDGE] is the main one among them. A bridge 
to where--to hell or to Manhattan? Everything associated with 
MOST is shrouded in mystery and apparently criminal secrecy. 
  Luzhkov is gang formations, extremely well equipped--many of 
them shot at us on the 3 and 4 October--ruthless and cruel, well 
set-up, billeted in Moscow. Luzhkov is an instant party, a party 
of the "majority," which is ensuring for itself a political 
infrastructure. Luzhkov is influence on the highest echelons of 
the military, to a large extent corrupt and incensed and also 
representing semi-mafiosi organisms that have merged with 
similar civilian structures. Luzhkov--and this is the most 
dangerous part--is a gentleman standing in a temple, standing in 
front of an icon holding a candle. Luzhkov is a gentleman who 
contributes billions to the Russian zemstvo movement, who 
supports and saves impoverished provincial writers and artists... 
  For me, these groups, which are thirsting to take a dominant 
place in Russia, are a synonym for everything most negative, 
cruel, ruthless, colored, strange as it may sound, by the ethnic 
national idea. This is fascism; this is the real evil and 
trouble... 
  As to your movement, along with other small nationalist, 
well 
organized movements, I see it more as a kind of an order, 
semi-military--semi-monk perhaps; an order of Orthodox 
secularity; in your actions there is an equal share of the 
political as of the religious and spiritual. How would you 
yourself describe your movement and the stage it is currently 
going through? 
  [Barkashov] Speaking of Luzhkov's criminal formations, they 
do represent a certain danger. But Luzhkov himself, who, like 
Yeltsin, belongs to the post-Soviet, Gorbachev period, also is 
spoiled meat. It is another matter that they may promote someone 
less stained, because they will be playing along with trends 
that are promising from the point of view of mass psychology. 
They do it deliberately, without that inner state that exists 
within the masses, and the latter will not accept them. If they 
attempt, however, to hook up to powerful collective energies, 
they will simply burn up. It is the same as plugging a telephone 
into a 220V outlet. So far, good technical equipment is giving 
them a tactical advantage. But when these energies mature, I 
think, they will be powerless. 
  They can fool once again the already fooled people, give 
them 
more promises. But when that particular archetype that we have 
discussed awakens in the people; when people become aware of 
themselves; when a community of individual energies develops, 
which turns into a collective one, they can no longer deceive, 
win, or rule. They will be doomed, no matter how much they cling 
to power. Yes, it is annoying to part with stolen millions, 
Mercedes, and dachas. It is annoying to face trials. And 
frightening. But it is inevitable. Looking at events through a 
mystical prism, we are not afraid of them, although politically 
and technically we are still facing a tough battle against them. 
  Right now, speaking of the current state of our 
organization, 
we are going through a period where its solid nucleus is turning 
into a broad political movement. We have felt that social groups 
are ready to accept our ideology. We already have the 
organizational skills, the needed number of organizers to enable 
us to quickly become a mass movement. But we do not want this 
movement to be a mere backdrop for one-time use--we want it to 
be politically mobile, well organized, and with good enough 
discipline... 
  [Prokhanov] And in conclusion--about your health. How is 
your 
leg? I can see how unaccustomed you are to holding these 
crutches. When will you be physically rehabilitated? 
  [Barkashov] Aleksandr Andreyevich, with your prayers... And 
ours, too. Anyway, everything is fine...

<F P=106> [Interview with Lyudmila Vartazarova, chairman of the </F>
Socialist Labor Party, by Lidiya Timofeyeva, under the rubric 
"The New Left"; place and date not given: "Socialism With 
Vartazarova's Face?"] 
  [Text] It appears that, having had enough "bad" communism 
and being poisoned by "inedible" neoliberalism, Russian society 
is timidly trying to taste modern socialism. Last year an 
attempt was made to unite the democratic left of Russia. This 
movement was headed by Lyudmila Vartazarova, the current 
chairman of the SPT [Socialist Labor Party]. Her personality is 
as out of the ordinary in the party milieu as it is mysterious. 
There were rumors to the effect that this female intellectual 
from Moscow, a doctor of economic sciences and a person from the 
"backwaters" of academia, was being paired as a vice president 
in the possible early presidential elections with Air Force 
General Rutskoy and then "general of the military-industrial 
complex" Yu. Skokov. The future elections may serve up some kind 
of surprise in her person. 
  [Timofeyeva] Does it appear paradoxical to you that the 
motherland of "real socialism" has not produced an authoritative 
left-wing democratic party since the disintegration of the CPSU, 
actually, until now? The leaders of the giant party have gone to 
all kinds of quarters: Some went into commerce, some turned 
liberal, others--orthodox communists and nationalists, leaving 
the leftist idea an orphan.... 
  [Vartazarova] This is not quite true. When after the 
troubled 
wait for a "paddy wagon" in August 1991 I decided to check who 
was still alive for thinking and for work, and who had not 
ultimately been "annihilated," I was happy to learn that there 
were such people even among the former party elite, for example, 
First Secretary of the Russian Communist Party Valentin Kuptsov. 
We tried to bring back the leftist idea and cleanse it of lies 
and mistakes together with him and other like-minded people. 
  [Timofeyeva] What is the "leftist idea?" Is it social 
democracy or socialism, or perhaps social liberalism? 
  [Vartazarova] Yes, in the broader meaning of the word. 
Everything that unites people around the ideas of justice, 
freedom and equality, democracy, and solidarity may be 
classified as the notion of the leftist idea, adding to it 
reinforcement of the regulatory role of the state in the economy 
and greater social protection for the people. 
  [Timofeyeva] Your colleague and SPT cochairman, the 
historian 
and essayist Roy Medvedev, who was considered the domestic 
precursor of "socialism with a human face," distinguished 
between social-democrats, socialists, and communists as early as 
the stagnant 1970's. 
  [Vartazarova] Of course, there is a difference between us. 
There are many leftist parties in Russia. With the exception of 
the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, they are not all 
that big, and some number altogether three or four dozen people. 
The SPT of Russia is a liberal party emphasizing the issues of 
freedom and entrepreneurship. Pavel Kudyukin's United 
Social-Democrats advocate the idea of self-management socialism 
while sharply restricting the centralizing role of the state. 
  [Timofeyeva] How are you, the Socialists, different from the 
Communist Party of the Russian Federation of Gennadiy Zyuganov? 
  [Vartazarova] Unlike the Communists, we have socialism as 
our 
goal rather than communism. We consider relations that ensure 
distribution of the social product in proportion to the quantity 
and quality of socially necessary labor, rather than on the 
basis of the need to be just. We come out in favor of a socially 
oriented mixed economy and do not believe that the market is a 
concession of the period of transition. Both economic pluralism 
and the market are features of socialism. However, in view of 
the fact that modern production calls for a considerable 
concentration of material and labor resources, we have a 
preference for various forms of collective ownership. This makes 
it possible for the members of the labor collective to act as 
co-owners of their enterprise. 
  Unlike the Communists, we do not maintain that class 
solidarity is the only one: It is merely one of the types of 
solidarity. Besides, we do not have a preference for the ideas 
of patriotism over the ideas of internationalism, but see them 
in their harmonic integrity.... 
  [Timofeyeva] How do your principles of justice and equality 
go along with freedom and democracy? Will you be able to strike 
a balance between them? 
  [Vartazarova] There is the notion of "solidary 
responsibility." This is when you are free to do everything you 
like but in the process should relate your actions to the 
interests of those around you. I like a particular parable on 
which I reflect continuously. A man went out to hunt in the 
mountains. A misstep caused an avalanche which destroyed a hut 
and claimed the lives of the people residing at the foot of the 
hill. The question is: Who is to blame? On one hand, it was his 
free choice and an absurd random occurrence. On the other hand, 
there were the grave consequences of this freedom, and the need 
to think about how our words may resonate. This is how the 
strategy and tactics of the SPT are structured--we walk on a 
razor's edge: between freedom and necessity, freedom and 
responsibility, law and morality.... 
  [Timofeyeva] Your party is sometimes accused of excessive 
altruism, "eggheadedness," and the inability to put your best 
foot forward. For some reason, few people know that 
representatives of 19 parties with a socialist orientation from 
the CIS countries, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Finland, 
Poland, and Bulgaria gathered for your Fourth Congress...and 
that you held an authoritative international conference on 
prospects for the development of the socialist idea throughout 
the world.... 
  [Vartazarova] This is true, we did not engage in 
self-promotion. However, we did not set this goal, either. We 
did what we considered necessary. We are now busy with our own 
business. We have developed and adopted a new party program, and 
prepared a program for urgent measures to stop the crisis in the 
country, "New Priorities--the Negotiating Process--Crime 
Security," and forwarded it to the Duma. We will try yet again 
to gather all democratic left-wing forces, this time at the 
Second Congress.... 
  [Timofeyeva] What about your participation in the future 
presidential campaign? There have been rumors that they saw you 
as a vice president together with Rutskoy, and then with Skokov. 
  [Vartazarova] This is the first time I have heard of this. 
Our party conducted negotiations with the Civic Union; we joined 
the Coalition of Civic Forces, one of whose tasks was to achieve 
accord in our society. However, this idea quietly passed away 
later. Subsequently, we negotiated with Yuriy Skokov about 
forming a centrist movement in Russia, and I became a member of 
the Accord for the Motherland committee in September 1993. 
Unfortunately, this committee also gave its soul to God.... This 
is it. Our party may support someone running for president, but 
only after we familiarize ourselves with his program and come to 
know him well. We will not select a pig in a poke.

<H5>  Economic and Sociopolitical Situation in Russia </H5>
  The market reform being implemented has brought about the 
collapse of the economy and the impoverishment of the majority 
of the population. 
  The price of food, clothing, medicines, and transport, 
municipal, and ritual services is growing continuously. 
  Even basic necessities: bread, milk, sugar, vegetables, 
fruit, are now beyond the reach of many of our compatriots. 
  The chronic malnutrition of old people, mothers, children, 
and citizens without work is leading to an increase in Russians' 
mortality, the level of which is in Russia higher than the 
birthrate indicator. 
  Hundreds of thousands of people are standing in public 
places 
with outstretched hand in the hope of charity and are picking up 
the refuse at dumps and garbage heaps. 
  The number of suicides and other serious accidents is 
growing. 
  The moral degradation of society and the humiliation and 
disparagement of those who, on account of their age or illness, 
cannot fend for themselves continue. 
  Russia still lacks a scientifically substantiated, national 
program of a way out of the economic and sociopolitical crisis 
and of the extrication of our compatriots from destitution, 
hunger, and extinction. The endless political struggle, the 
rudeness and incompetence of the authorities, and the constant 
promises and deception of the people are creating an 
extraordinarily dangerous situation in our society, which is 
unstable as it is. 
  There can be only one way out of this situation--the 
awakening from their silence of the people's masses and the 
mobilization of their efforts for struggle for their vitally 
necessary rights and interests and for the elaboration, 
adoption, and unswerving compliance with the laws on social 
protection of the citizens of Russia and on this basis for the 
creation of a mass social movement which would undertake the 
accomplishment of this noble goal. 
  The people's masses can only be awakened from their silence 
by a truly fundamentally new people's party--the Party of the 
Poor of Russia. 
<H5>  1. General Provisions </H5>
  1.1. The Party of the Poor of Russia (PBR) is a political 
organization. It is being formed on the initiative of the 
participants in the mercy movement in Russia. 
  1.2. The party's motto: "Social justice and protection of 
the 
poor of Russia." 
  1.3. The Party of the Poor of Russia unites in its ranks: 
  the needy and socially unprotected strata of the populace, 
to 
which pertain today: retirees, the unemployed, the disabled, 
students, large families, the handicapped, and other categories 
of citizens eking out a wretched existence and in need of 
support and assistance; 
  other categories of people, regardless of their party 
affiliation, religious belief, or nationality, who recognize the 
program and rules of the Party of the Poor of Russia and who 
could by conviction render the party the utmost material and 
moral assistance in the accomplishment of its statutory tasks; 
  all those to whom such general concepts as "care," "mercy," 
"kindness," "philanthropy," and "compassion" are dear. 
  1.4. The Party of the Poor of Russia shall organize its work 
on the basis of the party's program and rules. 
  1.5. The party's entire activity shall be exercised on the 
basis of the Constitution of the Russian Federation, current 
legislation, and the party rules. 
<H5>  2. Purpose of the Party of the Poor of Russia </H5>

contribute to the building in our country of a society of social 
justice and social protection and the genuine equality and 
freedom of all its members.

power. It is prepared to cooperate with any legitimately 
elected, strong, and authoritative power which defends the 
interests of all our compatriots. 
  The Party of the Poor will support in every possible way 
authorities and political parties and movements that devise and 
offer a scientifically substantiated program of the extrication 
of our powerful state and long-suffering people from the 
humiliating, shameful condition of the hunger, poverty, and 
destitution of the majority of the population. The Party of the 
Poor would actively support such a program and implement it as 
far as the forces and capabilities of its members allow. 
<H5>  3. Basic Tasks of the Party of the Poor of Russia </H5>
  3.1. The basic tasks of the Party of the Poor of Russia are: 
  unification of the efforts of all Russians for our society's 
speediest escape from the profound economic and sociopolitical 
crisis; 
  the creation of a mass social movement capable of 
championing 
the interests of the needy and socially unprotected strata of 
the populace--workers, peasants, and the intelligentsia who are 
living in poverty and who have become hostage to the totally 
unjustified reforms which are under way in the country, 
piratical commerce, and the collapse of production, everyday 
amenities, education, and health care; 
  imparting greater organization, plan-conformity, 
single-mindedness, and perseverance in the actions of the poor 
for the defense of their legitimate rights and liberties and in 
the aspiration to be heard and understood by the president and 
the government of Russia and the organs of state power both in 
the center and locally; 
  rendering members of the Party of the Poor in need of social 
support and care specific targeted moral and material assistance 
and other types of services; 
  active participation in the elaboration and realization of 
an 
official program of the social protection of the needy and 
unprotected strata of the population of Russia; 
  the aspiration to make each compatriot of ours who is 
experiencing acute material need and who is morally humiliated 
and insulted by current realities stronger in the defense of his 
own and the common interests of the people living in poverty.

individual talk on the part of a representative of the local 
party organization with the specific individual who has declared 
a desire to be a party member, with the subsequent entry of his 
basic biographical data in the "List of Registration of Members

  [Text] 
<H5>  [Preface] </H5>
<H5>  From the "Most Gruppa" [Bridge Group] Limited Partnership </H5>
  Our time is defined as a "transitional period." Everyone 
agrees with that. It affects all aspects of the country's life. 
It is not possible for one part of society to be restructured, 
while others await their hour. Such impulsiveness is harmful for 
that society, although the objective nature of the reform 
process does presuppose its own leaders and outsiders. But in 
all cases, it demands new basic ideas. 
  From this standpoint, the collective work of the authors of 
the National Doctrine of Russia (problems of 
formation and priorities) is an interesting attempt, essential 
to society, to outline and to a certain degree develop the range 
of problems which society must comprehend in order to move 
forward. The very science on society also demands development. 
  The reader will not find a precise and exhaustive formula, 
the "National Doctrine of Russia," in the collection. If such a 
thing is even possible, it is obviously the fruit of the labor 
of more than one authors' collective. The fact that the labor is 
collective inevitably entails a difference in the approach to 
particular problems. 
  One may confidently predict that this work will elicit 
criticism, controversy, and objections, and not only in 
scientific circles. 
  Nor does the leadership of the "Most Gruppa" Limited 
Partnership fully share certain ideas and principles of the 
National Doctrine of Russia. Above all, we take issue 
with the idea of its economic substantiation. It is distinctly 
one-sided in nature. There is no constructive alternative 
offered to criticizing the idea and practice of monetarism. 
There is no new "model" of socioeconomic progress. 
  The thesis of the unification of the all-Russian people 
clearly needs further development, modification, and 
substantiation. Narrow "Russianism," which risks collapsing into 
nationalism and chauvinism, and Russophobia are equally alien to 
the all-Russian popular mentality. Patriotism combined with an 
internationalist attitude toward all the nationalities 
inhabiting Russia, which historically, culturally, and 
socioeconomically have gravitated toward the nation with the 
largest number of people--that appears to be the way to 
all-Russian unity. This theme is an important and extremely 
delicate one which requires exact and precise points of 
emphasis. In this connection, it is clear that the problem of 
the Russian-speaking population is growing into anxiety over the 
fate of Russian Federation citizens in the states which have 
emerged on the territory of the former USSR. 
  The section "Russia's Military Security and Military Policy" 
also elicits some objections. It occupies a disproportionately 
large place in the collection, although the topic itself is 
undoubtedly very critical. But it turns out that the purely 
military component has absorbed the authors to the detriment of 
the constructive peace-keeping aspect of military policy. 
History proves that it is better not to have enemies than to 
fight with them. More specific but also important comments may 
be made. Most likely, in speaking of the "population's health" 
in contemporary conditions, it is wrong to ignore the system of 
insurance medicine which is taking shape. Sufficient attention 
has been devoted to the role of the Russian Orthodox Church, but 
other religions have been ignored, above all Islam, whose 
influence on politics recently has risen substantially. 
  Nonetheless, despite these and other possible comments and 
guided by the motives mentioned above, the "Most Gruppa" 
considers the publication presented useful and timely.

<H5>  Summary (Special Issue) </H5>
  [Translator's Note: The summary, presented in English in the 
original text, is typed as is, with the exception of 
punctuation, spelling, and typographical errors corrected] 
  Dear reader, 
  This special issue of the RAU Corporation's weekly 
"Obozrevatel" is devoted to Russia's national doctrine. 
  Neither the authors nor the independent experts who 
contributed to this issue, says the preface, make believe that 
their materials are exhaustive and complete. We just attempted, 
they assert, to find approaches to the solution of the problem. 
Some problems are only raised in the text. What is important is 
that those who have the power of decision-making could make a 
choice out of a wide range of substantiated proposals. We offer 
the following strategy of overcoming the crisis in which Russia 
finds herself: 
  To begin with, it is necessary to stop the political 
struggle 
in its extreme forms. Efforts should be exerted to strengthen 
the legality, the public peace and order, and the executive 
discipline without which the authorities are helpless. In other 
words, it is necessary to strengthen the State. 
  Secondly, it is necessary to improve the living standards of 
Russian citizens and, above all, to increase the social 
protection of the poorest and weakest sections of the 
population--the old people retired on pension, the children, the 
sick, and the disabled. 
  And, thirdly, it is necessary to uphold the unity, the 
economic and political independence, and to restore Russia's 
intellectual potential. 
  They all discuss a series of measures to consolidate the 
State and to restore the nation through awareness of its 
interests. 
  Let us recall what ran through all life and activity of our 
glorious ancestors, beginning from the great princes of the Kiev 
Rus. It was a struggle for the unity of the Russian lands. The 
unity always spelled calm, prosperity, and welfare, whereas war 
and conflicts always meant grief, bloodshed, and devastation. 
This has always been the case, like it is today. We are all 
witnessing a terrible phenomenon which is out of our 
control--the decline of a great power with all traditionally 
resultant consequences. 
  It is not accidental, therefore, that a central topic of the 
report supported by all its chapters is "The Unity of the 
Russian State." The foundation of this unity, claim the 
independent experts, is civil peace and agreement. No matter 
what the situation might be, the State should not be made 
dependent on the "victory" of some views or political forces. 
Ambitious politicians, even most conspicuous, come and go, 
whereas Russia remains. Any political victory will turn into a 
defeat if the State is hurt and confrontation in society becomes 
rampant. 
  In this connection, the interests of the State warrant that 
the mechanism of independent branches of power--legislative, 
executive, and judicial--be brought into play. In other words, 
it is vital to create real counterbalances that could guarantee 
democratic development within the framework of law. It is also 
of utmost importance to lead the country out of the crisis and 
to gradually form strong democratic grounds of civil society, 
because true democracy can exist only in a society free of the 
deadly threat to the State and the nation. 
  The authors of the report hold that the krays and oblasts of 
Russia as subjects of the Federation should be equalized in 
rights with the Republics with a possible later transformation 
into integrated entities (gubernias, lands). The broader is the 
level of local self-government, the stronger will be the real 
integration between the subjects of the Federation, including 
the "Russian regions." The fuller is the integration, the less 
is the opportunity of "self-dismemberment" of the Russian 
nation. The rights of national minorities and guarantees of 
cultural autonomy should be a part of the Constitution. In these 
conditions, runs the report, a clearcut division of competence 
between the central and local authorities and the 
self-government bodies is very important, because excessive 
"sovereignty" may turn the Federation into a weak, poorly 
controlled confederation, which, under the presently weakened 
government, spells an eventual collapse of the State. 
  Occasional threats to secede from the Federation run counter 
both to the Constitution and the Federative Treaty and, 
therefore, contend the experts, have no legal force and should 
be resolutely rejected. It is wrong and out of the question to 
extend the rights of subjects at the expense of the other 
nations' interests and the interests of all peoples of the 
Federation who also enjoy this right. The principle of 
self-determination defends the interests of all peoples and 
curbs nationalist egoism. For this reason, it continues to 
underpin the nationalities policy. 
  The cause of ethnic conflicts is neither democracy nor the 
extended rights of the peoples. The authors are inclined to 
think that the off-shoots of democracy and the hopes of the 
peoples for national restoration have become a hostage of 
extremist forces, various political adventurers, and criminal 
and corrupted structures. Some nationalist movements, which came 
to exist as forces oriented towards preserving and restoring the 
original cultures of their peoples and insuring their social, 
cultural, and language survival, have slid down to political 
radicalism and extremism. They are attempting to secure the 
freedom and rights of their own people through infringing on the 
freedom and elementary human rights of the neighboring peoples. 
  The report suggests that the Federal authorities should be 
more consistent, constructive, and principled in these matters 
because if the nationalities problems, which the extremists play 
up and use for their interests, are not solved from "above" in 
relatively civilized forms, they will be solved from "below" in 
ugly forms. It is high time to summon a special meeting of 
Russia's peoples to examine the strategic, political, and legal 
aspects of inter-nationalities relations. We should bring back 
to life the time-tested values of friendship between all 
nationalities to unite them. 
  The main hotbeds of ethnic conflicts in Russia today are the 
territories populated by the peoples severely repressed in the 
past (Chechens, Ingushies, Kalmyks, Karachayevs, and 
Balkartses). Russia's authorities have long since been seeking 
to settle this problem, which dates back to bygone times. With 
this aim in view, Russia's Parliament adopted the Law "On the 
Rehabilitation of the Repressed Nations." It is a good law and 
it has many positive features. But, according to experts, its 
provision on "territorial rehabilitation" was a mistake. Many a 
decade has passed since certain nationalities were resettled 
from their native lands. They were moved over to other regions 
of the country. Other nationalities came, or were often driven 
under compulsion, to settle down on the vacated territories. 
They have lived and worked here since, in the houses they built, 
with their families, children, and grandchildren. And now, under 
the above Law, they are to leave and move somewhere else. 
Specifically, this is the root of the bloodshedding conflict 
between the Ossetians and the Ingushies. They are fighting for 
the possession of the Prigorodniy district of the Vladikavkaz 
city, which used to belong to Ingushetia before the compulsory 
resettlement. The struggle is fierce, with no compromises. And 
although a moratorium was announced concerning the 
above-mentioned article of the Law, it makes no difference now. 
Blood has been shed, and both sides are still on the warpath. 
  The report makes a conclusion that the forcible resettlement 
of citizens now inhabiting the lands formerly occupied by the 
repressed nationalities is impermissible. Efforts must be made 
to define the legal, economic, and social guarantees of their 
protection. After the euphoria of adopting the new Constitution, 
which is a roadblock to separatism, it is necessary to follow up 
with resolute and prompt joint actions in the interests of 
people. 
  The authors of the report are fully aware that neither of 
the 
former Soviet Republics, including Russia, could become within 
such a short span of time a fully independent state capable of 
functioning normally without each other. 
  The effects of the initial period of trying to win 
sovereignty, when the Baltic countries and the Ukraine strove, 
in fact and above all, for independence from Russia, are still 
felt. The said countries sought power and strong statehood on 
the basis of anti-Russian sentiments and laws. Paradoxical as it 
were, they simultaneously wanted Russia to supply them as 
before, on unprofitable for this country terms, with raw and 
other materials, completing parts, and especially fuel and 
energy. It is but natural that such approaches could not become 
constructive and led to a host of problems, tensions, setting up 
of frontiers, increasing debts, halted deliveries, and, in the 
final analysis, the rupture of economic relations and the 
general economic depression in all countries. 
  Therefore, the experts presume that in supporting the 
process 
of creating a common economic space, expanding the ruble's zone, 
and promoting other re-integrational processes, Russia is 
obliged to be aware of its own interests. Russia's support of 
the above processes should be steady and insistent, but 
extremely delicate and weighted. It must be based on the 
following principles: search for common interests rather than 
emphasizing differences; respect for own and others' interests; 
recognition of the interests of people rather than those of 
politicians; and historic responsibility for peace on 
one-seventh part of the Earth. 
  The report also deals comprehensively with problems of 
"Civil 
Society and the Ways of Its Formation" and "Crimes in Russia and 
the Country's Security." 
  Speculating about Russia's destiny and its national 
security, 
we cannot avoid touching upon the lot of the Russian people 
themselves, who, contend the experts, are in a great jeopardy. 
Having defended not only own independence, but also the 
independence of other nations united by common historical 
development, the Russian people find themselves today in a 
difficult situation because a large portion of Russians (25.3 
millions) live outside the boundaries of the Russian Federation. 
  For the first time in the history of Russia, we observe so 
vast a breakup of the Russian ethnic space, which is in itself 
fraught with potential conflicts. The "Russian problem" is 
shaping up before our eyes. It includes the following 
components: Russians and the Russian language speaking 
population in the "Near Abroad" are being made "second rate" 
citizens or citizens without nationality (adoption of laws on 
national languages in the former Soviet Republics gave a start 
to this process); ousting of the Russians from the newly formed 
countries; an inevitable rising of Russian national movements in 
these countries; the allying of these movements with the Russian 
national (or nationalist) movement in Russia herself; and the 
turning of the "Russian problem" into a decisive factor in the 
interpolitical struggle in Russia. 
  In this connection, the report suggests that the Russian 
statesmen should pursue the following aims: to introduce 
bilingualism in all the new states--the national and the Russian 
languages; Russia should actively support the establishment and 
consolidation of Russian language communities, including 
cultural and national autonomies; the "Near Abroad" countries 
should grant double nationalities to all Russian-origin citizens 
at their request; financial support should be extended to 
Russian culture and education; to energize all Russia's foreign 
policy endeavors to support her just demands for observance of 
human rights and liberties in the "Near Abroad"; and to 
immediately sign agreements with the former Soviet Republics on 
issuance of citizenship, protection of the national minorities' 
rights, migration, legal aid, pension schemes to retired old-age 
people, mutual recognition of university and other academic 
diplomas, and establishment of consular offices. 
  The conduct of a severe policy is recommended in respect of 
those countries which defy civil rights, up to applying economic 
sanctions. 
  The chapter on "Problems of the Socioeconomic Situation in 
the Country" holds an important place in the report. It stresses 
that the 2 years of drastic reforms have resulted in a 40 
percent slump in production, a three-fold decrease in the 
population's living standards, a 25 percent reduction in labor 
pay, and a galloping inflation. By the end of 1993, Russia had 
fallen out of the world labor division. Its economy was thrown a 
long way back into the past. 
  Russia's share in world trade has dropped very 
significantly. 
Its relations with the West can be described as an economic 
blockade. World markets are closed to Russia. Credits have been, 
in the main, extended to enable poor Russians to buy grain from 
the rich Western farmer. 
  In the last 2 years alone, investments in the Russian 
economy 
have shrunk more than two-fold, which is a roadblock not only to 
economic restructure, but to elementary growth of production as 
well. 
  The refusal of the State to regulate economic and social 
processes turned into a total loss of manageability. The world's 
experience of state regulation has been completely ignored, 
especially the experience of the countries with 
socially-oriented market economies. As the result, the vacuum of 
state control is increasingly filled, on the one hand, by 
expanding narrow-group and regional separatist interests and 
elementary plundering of national wealth, and, on the other, by 
the real and no less dangerous authoritarian rule. There is no 
control over prices and incomes and the distribution and 
redistribution of material and financial resources. 
  Especially important from the point of view of a 
multimillion 
country's national security is the agrarian economic sector 
because the lack of own foodstuffs cannot be replenished in any 
manner. Even kneeling for aid before its rich neighbors, such 
country cannot escape starvation because no effective aid can be 
furnished for 150 million starving people. 
  Unfortunately, there are grounds for concern in this sphere. 
The experts argue that presently the financial, tax, prices, 
crediting, and investment policy in the agroindustrial complex 
has fully paralyzed the economic activity of agricultural 
producers. 
  To begin with, the larged specialized production, which, in 
the main, matched in efficiency the world standards, is falling 
to pieces. In animal production, for example, only one-third or 
a little more of its powerful capacities are used for lack of 
feeds. It will take at least 12-15 years of the hardest work to 
recover the losses in animal husbandry. 
  The state programs for better soil fertility and enlarged 
production of farm machinery and implements have been suspended. 
Practically all social programs to help the countryside--road 
construction, gas and electricity supply, communications and 
water supply, housing and cultural and welfare facilities--have 
been canceled. From 1991 to 1993, investments in this industry 
plummeted seven-fold. 
  More than 3 million hectares under grain crops remained 
unharvested in 1993. Only 70 percent of acreage has been sown to 
winter crops for 1994. Sixty-six percent of the needed areas 
were plowed in the autumn. About 4 million hectares were 
undersown to winter crops for lack of fuel and equipment. 
  The authors of the report opine that if the state fails to 
support agriculture it will not survive. Together with it, all 
other economic sectors are going to fall to pieces. The world 
experience indicates that in countries with a highly 
industrialized agriculture, the latter enjoys state support. The 
report contains specific recommendations on this point. 
  The report also reviews the regional economic policy and a 
package of social and financial measures, Russia's foreign debt, 
and the ways to handle them. 
  From a deep study of the situation, the report arrives at 
the 
following conclusion: there is a progressing tendency to make 
the Russian economy dependent on the world market and the 
developed nations. Many measures of the Russian Administration 
today are, in fact, anti-market, anti-entrepreneurs, and 
anti-state. 
  Now it is clear that the transitional period to the new 
economy will take many years. Taking into account this fact, the 
Government and the Central Bank should formulate a long-term 
economic, crediting, and monetary policy based mainly on state 
economic regulation of the economy and the creation of favorable 
conditions for entrepreneurs' production activity. 
  In the present conditions in our country, the high crediting 
rates give rise to a quick growth of prices and continued 
devaluation of money. According to the experts, the growth of 
commodity production may be given a quick push through 
decreasing the crediting rates, a speedier turnover of funds, 
and mission-oriented crediting of the economy. Consequently, 
these measures will enhance the economic effect for the creditor 
and the producer and help overcome the inflation. 
  It is necessary to alter the economic policy and the 
strategy 
and tactics of the economic reforms, i. e., to give priority to 
domestic manufactures, businessmen, agrarians, farmers, and 
workers. 
  The next chapter of the report is entitled "The Creation of 
Favorable International Conditions for the Reforms in Russia." 
  It is clear that the calmer is the international situation 
around a country, the more opportunities it has to deal with its 
internal problems. The experts presume that Russia's priority 
task is to normalize and stabilize her relations with the CIS 
nations and to work out a system of coordinating both the common 
policies and the specific actions to insure mutual security. 
Special attention should be paid to the conflicts underway in 
the CIS countries and between them, including armed conflicts. 
  Russia's long-term security interests call for the 
following: 
to preserve the general world stability capable of withstanding 
local armed conflicts; to maintain normal relations with all 
countries, primarily with the European and Asian nations; to 
turn these relations into partnership: to strengthen the 
peace-making opportunities of the UN and the CSCE; and restore 
Russia's prestige as successor of the former Soviet Union, a 
power recognized by the world community. 
  Special attention should be turned to the NATO's changed 
policy. The international community could not help being put on 
the vigil by the NATO's attempt to dictate its will to other 
countries, specifically its ultimatum to the Serbs. For the 
first time during its existence, the NATO dared to shoot down 
the planes in the no flying zone. A radically new element in the 
NATO's latest policy was an extension of the bloc's "zone of 
responsibility." The meeting of the NATO Council in Oslo decided 
to conduct "peace-making operations" under the aegis of the 
CSCE, which means that the NATO can use its troops all over 
Eurasia--from Yugoslavia to Tajikistan. Thus, runs the report, a 
concept has been developed oriented toward the bloc's 
interference in the home affairs of other countries. 
  The authors of the report opine that the Russian politicians 
should firmly oppose the NATO's extension at the expense of its 
close neighbors--the CIS nations, the Baltic countries, and the 
East European states. Strategically, the NATO's extension could 
increase the possibility of the engagement of its troops over a 
wide frontline--from the Baltic countries to the Black Sea--and 
to the revision of the land and sea limits for hostilities. The 
now transparent and friendly frontier could again become, with 
the passage of time, an "advanced post." All this can 
unprecedentedly restrict Russia's opportunities for insuring her 
security. 
  The fifth and sixth chapters of the report ("Overcoming the 
Conflicts and Collective Security" and "Russia's Military 
Security and Military Policy," respectively) specify the two 
most principled points of security touched upon in the preceding 
chapter. 
  In the presentday conditions, the CIS nations should not be 
as careless and nearsighted as to attempt individually to 
provide own security. In this connection, the report supports 
the Treaty on CIS Nations' Collective Security. The key 
provision of the Treaty stipulates that any Signatory subjected 
to an aggression shall be extended the necessary assistance, 
including military aid. The Signatories agreed to form special 
forces to maintain peace in the CIS countries. The principles of 
forming and the procedure of functioning of these forces are 
formulated in the Protocol on the status of military observers' 
groups and the collective peacemaking forces. The principles of 
instituting the central defense authority were discussed in 1993 
in Ashgabad. 
  For the time being, these accords are only on paper and 
Russia's task is to display maximum political will to make the 
Treaty work. 
  The experts maintain that it is necessary to work out and 
adopt, as soon as possible, the major principles of the military 
policy of the parties to the collective security system and to 
formulate the military doctrine of collective defense, focusing 
attention, specifically, on coordination of all CIS nation's 
defense efforts. 
  It is expedient to extend the guarantees of nuclear security 
to all CIS countries, to establish within the CIS framework 
powerful mobile peacemaking forces, and to coordinate the 
mechanism of their employment. 
  Further on, the report draws attention of the Russian policy 
makers to the obvious fact that military security is a part of 
the common problem of insuring national security, which, in 
turn, is interrelated with the problem of regional and global 
security. Of course, the contemporary civilized world recognizes 
that war cannot be used as a political instrument and that the 
use or the threat to use military force for achieving political, 
economic, or other aims should be ruled out. 
  However, it would be a mistake to ignore the fact that many 
countries possess strong armed forces and the systems of their 
basing near the Russian borders. Many American military bases, 
which were created during the "cold war" period to exert 
pressure on the USSR, are still functioning. Some reduction of 
the armed forces by several large powers (the United States and 
other NATO countries) is being compensated by the introduction 
of new, more effective types of armaments. 
  Improvement of nuclear weaponry and other means of mass 
destruction continues. Neither should we let out of sight the 
lessons of history which teach us that the military and 
technical superiority over a potential enemy were frequently 
used to attack it. 
  Security, runs the report, cannot be considered achieved, 
unless it is guaranteed and reliable. 
  The report clearly defines the defensive nature of our 
military doctrine. The main tasks of Russia's military policy, 
it points out, are to prevent war and preserve peace, and to 
insure national, regional, and international security. Military 
force can be resorted to for the sake of defending state 
interests when diplomacy proves inadequate and ineffective. In 
case a war is imposed on us, we must be ready to beat back the 
aggression, to defeat the enemy, and to create the conditions 
for a quick termination of the war. 
  The development of nuclear arms should serve to consolidate 
the strategic stability through containing the enemy's plans to 
use them. It is vitally necessary that Russia keeps its status 
of a nuclear power over the foreseeable future. Apart from the 
strategic defense tasks, this enables Russia to provide nuclear 
guarantees to the former Soviet Republics as an element of the 
agreement between them on military matters. 
  History teaches us that it is the people's strong spirit and 
morale that helped our country to emerge victorious from great 
difficulties and terrible troubles. Lack of high morals is the 
first sign of a dying civilization. This is the main idea dealt 
with in the chapter "The Formation of the People's Spiritual and 
Moral Values." 
  The formation of the nation's spiritual and moral values, 
runs the chapter, is the cornerstone of restoring the great 
power. The national security doctrine must be based on a 
national idea which, in turn, is the major condition for all 
reforms. 
  Today, the public begins to understand that the economy as 
such is only a means of society's development rather than the 
aim, that it is a built-in part of a unique system of public 
relations, cultural and intellectual life. And it is this system 
that should be discussed in the first place. 
  The authors assume that Russia's self-consciousness, which 
is 
coming to life again, tends to restore its historical continuity 
in all parameters. The period of unpunished Russophobia is a 
bygone time. Hence, the struggle of various political forces for 
personifying most precisely and truly the expression of the 
"Russian idea" will be a major element in the struggle for power 
in Russia. And this struggle has already commenced. 
  The chapter draws attention to the fact that there are quite 
a few people who announce that this is "the end of Russia." 
These are Smerdyakovs in a democratic wrapping. This country, 
they say, "is unfit for human living." It is clear that the 
people who have built a great power, who defeated the fascist 
hordes in the last world war, and who produced world famous 
thinkers, writers, musicians, and painters, cannot be defective 
and inferior. It is clear that these "conspicuous," "famous," 
and "prominent" personalities are lying, and with a purpose in 
mind. The transition to market relations makes everything, 
including interpretations of history, a commodity. The law of 
demand and supply govern the respective relations. The demand is 
determined by the requirements of the economically and 
politically strong powers of the world. Meanwhile, the 
historical truth is necessary to all--the communists and the 
liberals, the rightists and the leftists, the conservatives and 
the progressive-minded people, provided they are seeking to 
restore Russia's good name and standing. The past, even its most 
tragic events, should be overcome and not rejected or betrayed. 
Otherwise, the country becomes a hostage of its past. 
  The work underlines that the country's moral and 
intellectual 
potential depends on the development of its culture, science, 
and education. Unfortunately, the existing situation in science, 
according to Russia's leading scholars, is catastrophic. The 
State's refusal to fund this sphere has led to such a "threshold 
of lagging behind," which makes problematic real research 
activity within the framework of the world's scientific system, 
or even impossible in many fields. 
  The independent experts recommend that the Russian 
Government 
finance from the state budget in 1994 at the level of at least 
2.3-2.5 percent of the country's GNP and increase the funding in 
the next several years to avoid immigration of scientists abroad 
and to make them interested in working in their native country 
as effectively as they can. 
  The utilitarianism which is now prevalent in society, claim 
the authors, has considerably dehumanized culture and destroyed 
many cultural values, offering practically nothing as 
substitute. We have substantially violated or lost the 
traditions which underpinned the spirit and morals of the 
preceding generations. The ability to reproduce the culture of 
the people has lessened. Time is disjointed in the minds of the 
young generation. They are not sensitive to the integrity of the 
world which is a sine qua non condition for the reproduction and 
development of culture. In this context the uppermost task is to 
restore the continuity of generations, to implant in the young 
people's minds the historical roots stretching from the past of 
their people and all mankind to the present time and serving as 
a connecting link between them. Unfortunately, the prestige of 
high morals, intellectuality, education, and upbringing has 
fallen in our country to the lowest mark in the history of the 
20th century. Culture should hold a special place in this 
process. 
  The cultures of the peoples of Russia, argues the report, 
are 
called upon to consolidate cultural unity and integrity because 
Russia's multinational culture as such is a historically formed 
integrity, a united culture. 
  The Russian Orthodox Church could serve as a spiritual 
support in Russia, hold the authors. The Russian Orthodox Church 
has a vast historical experience of uniting the peoples and 
cooperating with other religious confessions in Russia. 
  The final chapter, "Russia Before the Elections" [correctly, 
"Russia Faces a Choice"--translator], reasons out that the 
central problem in 1994 will be to restore the authority of the 
state power in Russia and to establish an effective mechanism of 
enforcing the laws and controlling the fulfillment of adopted 
decisions. The chapter offers a series of forecasts of Russia's 
possible economic growth and the political situation in the 
current year.

<H5>  [Foreword] </H5>
<H5>  To the Reader </H5>
  In 1993, in a special issue of the information-analysis 
weekly OBOZREVATEL-OBSERVER entitled "National Security: Russia 
in 1994," the experts of the RAU-Corporation centers and the 
authors of the journal proposed their variant of a solution to 
the crisis. The report was intended for persons formulating and 
making political decisions or actively participating in their 
preparation. Above all for deputies of the Federal Assembly of 
Russia. We received a multitude of responses and requests to 
cover this topic more extensively and present it in a more 
deeply political-philosophical perspective. That is why readers 
are now offered a broader variant which may be the platform for 
debate on the National Doctrine of Russia. 
  Today as never before, we need a critical analysis of the 
path which has been taken, a clear objective of society's 
continued development, and pursuit of the most efficient ways to 
achieve that objective. A great world power now stands at a 
historical crossroads: there is no way back, but the choice of a 
new path is yet to be made. In a very short interval of time, 
the country has moved from one historical period to another: 

  -  the state structure, institutions of power, and 
the attributes of that power have changed radically; 
  -  in Russia the former political system, the basis of 
which was the CPSU's monopoly on power and ideology, is 
finished; 
  -  the ratio of forms of ownership in the RF [Russian 
Federation] and the entire system of social 
interrelations are changing rapidly; 
  -  interethnic contradictions within Russia and 
problems with the former republics of the USSR which are now 
sovereign states are increasing; 
  -  the status of our great power in the world community 
and its interrelations with foreign states have fundamentally 
changed; 
  -  the nation's spiritual potential, the basis on which the 
power 
of the Nation and the State have rested since earliest times, 
has been weakened. 

    All these changes have fundamentally altered the situation 
in 
Europe and Asia and the entire geopolitical map of the world and 
created a serious crisis which has affected not only the 
republics of the former USSR, but a large number of other 
countries of the world, which to one degree or another has had 
an effect on all aspects of the life of humankind. 
  It is important to emphasize two fundamental features of 
these changes which have led to an extremely serious crisis in 
Russia. 
  First, objectively crisis phenomena are 
characteristic of any "transitional period" and reforms of this 
scope. Consequently, it is essential not so much to seek 
subjective errors or even catastrophic miscalculations of 
particular politicians and parties--history will evaluate 
them--as to try to find the patterns and particular 
features of this "transitional period" in order to use the 
analysis of them as a basis to propose the right solutions. 
  Secondly, the crisis period must not be 
chronologically restricted to any narrow framework: the 
"Gorbachev period," the "Yeltsin period," and so on. The sources 
of the crisis are much deeper, and each of the stages was only a 
continuation of the chain of errors of the previous ones. 
  It is essential to clearly define present and future 
Russian national interests which satisfy both the 
interests of individual citizens on the whole and of the entire 
human race. Among them those upon which our state's very 
existence depends must be singled out and possible measures to 
realize them must be proposed. 
  We think that the two top priority ideas in the 
National Doctrine of Russia--the greatness of 
Russia (the state) and the greatness of the 
Nation (the national and the social aspects)-- must be 
clearly and concretely defined in the political programs both of 
the president and the Government, and of the parties, public 
organizations, and other influential political forces. As soon 
as that happens in practice, this will signify the 
Authorities' actual choice in favor of 
national-patriotic development (and in favor of the class of 
owners and advocates of a socialist orientation forming on a 
national basis) and rejection of a dependent "comprador" 
[national servant of foreign companies] path of development. 
  In our opinion, the most important thing today is 
to prevent the Russian State from becoming weaker and 
collapsing. This is impossible using only traditional 
administrative-state or financial methods: that is not enough 
for Russia. We should revive the Russian idea and 
form a foundation of unity--a national doctrine which 
represents views recognized by most nations on the objectives 
and tasks of development of the society, the Nation, and the 
State, the character of the state order, and the direction and 
methods of the state order's development. In light of that, 
the national doctrine is based on the economic potential which 
has taken shape and the existing system of interstate relations 
and is formed and realized in the system of interstate relations 
which has taken shape. 
  In the most critical periods of our Fatherland's history, 
the 
mighty reserves of the Russian people's spiritual power saved 
the nation. The Russian idea plays a most important role here. 
It is based on the concept of conciliarism [sobornost] as 
uniting people for the sake of reviving the Orthodox faith and 
the prosperity of the Fatherland. The Russian people's devotion 
to the idea of statehood is historically established. 
Only state power is capable of keeping the anarchic pursuit of 
the truth on an evolutionary course. 
  Yet another crucial feature of the Russian idea is the 
openness of the Russian national character to all peoples, that 
is to say, tolerance of and receptivity to other beliefs and 
traditions and amiability toward neighboring peoples. These are 
precisely the qualities always used by people who would like to 
dissolve universal love for one's neighbor into abstract "common 
human values." 
  It has long since been time on the state level to 
announce the need to restore great power status. Because of 
its unique geopolitical position, Russia has the opportunity to 
take a worthy place in the community of the 21st century and 
become a truly highly developed world power. Russia's 
geopolitical uniqueness is that it is not Europe and it is not 
Asia. Russia is Eurasia. It is precisely by virtue of its 
geopolitical position, history, particular features of spiritual 
development, and many other factors that Russia appears as a 
unique phenomenon in the development of all 
humankind. Consequently, disputes over what country Russia 
should focus on in its development are meaningless. 
  We have always been proud of our Russia, its past, its 
ancestors, and its Legacy. People have tried to take 
this pride in the Fatherland away from us, but the Nation did 
not allow this to happen. The stormy process of restoring 
national self-consciousness has begun. One of the mistakes of 
our Government, the president, and his circle is that they 
seldom talk about this with the people. The Nation must 
restore its dignity, see historical perspectives clearly, and 
feel confidence in tomorrow and its own strengths. 
  We must not allow extremism to triumph in Russia again. So 
it 
is essential that the idea of great power status is the 
state ideology and political practice, and 
ultimately--state policy. All citizens, state 
institutions, and branches of power must give all-out support to 
the idea of great power status, which must become the Nation's 
dominant ideology. 
  The Federal Assembly began work in a critical and dramatic 
period of Russia's history. The future of Russia largely depends 
on the decisions the legislative and executive organs of power 
make. Whether we continue to sink into crisis or begin to 
recover slowly and with difficulty is the dilemma. 
  Let us recall that the year 1992 entered Russia's history as 
a year where the mortality rate exceeded the birth rate for the 
first time in peacetime. During the last 5 years, 25 million 
fewer people were born in Russia than in the previous 5-year 
period, and the nation's capacity for self-reproduction has 
already been called into question. Even according to official 
statistics, Russia's population in just the first 9 months of 
1993 declined by 522,600 people.

  Today more people in the country die "random deaths"--from 
accidents, mishaps, and the like--than die from cardiac and 
oncological diseases taken together. The Nation is on the 
threshold of degradation. This sad outcome is the result 
above all of negative socioeconomic factors. That is the price 
paid for the wrong path of development chosen. The country finds 
itself without state borders, with an undetermined 
social-economic order, and with a Constitution adopted by a 
minority of the population. 
  What direction will future historical development take? 
Where 
is Russia's optimal path of development which best fits its 
national interests and the interests of development of all 
humankind? 
  In recent years, certain at times "Western" and at times, on 
the contrary, "Eastern" models of development have been 
aggressively thrust on society. But Russia cannot follow either 
one of these paths which are acceptable for other civilizations 
and peoples. Thus, for example, one representative of Western 
society (the average statistical Western European or North 
American) at the present time accounts for 50-70 times more 
resources than one average statistical South American or 
African. We must simply learn the obvious truth: Western 
society lives at the expense of other countries. 
  No, we must seek a path of development based on using our 
own 
wealth and resources--which we have more of, incidentally, than 
any other nation, but which are used extremely inefficiently. 
  Before beginning treatment, we must make an accurate 
diagnosis, that is to say, we must soberly and impartially 
assess the condition which the country is in. We must understand 
the reasons for past tragic events. We must abandon the habit of 
making the analysis and assessment of what is happening match 
the objectives of particular political parties, ideas, and 
leaders. We must make the interests of the country and the 
people as a whole paramount. We must also abandon 
reformer-neodogmatism, which is already becoming an obstacle to 
development and progress. 
  On this basis we can start the path to accord among the 
various political forces. It is impossible to formulate the 
right policy and combine efforts to fulfill a joint program for 
getting out of the crisis when we are divided. 
  The main barriers on this path are the distribution of 
power, 
the redistribution of ownership, and political and personal 
ambitions. After rejecting them, we must make a search for a 
strategy and tactics of cooperation in conditions of political 
and socioeconomic crisis. 
  The authors' collective, independently of the experts, in no 
way claims that the material presented is exhaustive and 
complete. It is important that those who have the right to make 
decisions have the opportunity to choose from a broad 
range of substantiated proposals. 
  Today, unfortunately, there are frequent cases where wrong, 
mistaken decisions are not only proposed but even made, and then 
the state and society suffer from them. In order to avoid that, 
it is important to use all possible ways to encourage 
independent experts to develop different drafts and variants of 
political decisions, and subsequently to discuss them 
extensively. 
  Such an approach is especially important in working out 
complex problems of the state's security and development 
strategy, since up to now many important issues have been 
researched and decided in practical isolation from each other, 
which has done and continues to do enormous harm. For example, 
the seemingly correct decision to reach weapons parity with the 
NATO countries resulted in a severe weakening of our economic 
security. The pursuit of gross indicators and the lack of a 
systematic competent notion of the living environment created 
ecological disasters involving serious violations of the 
biosphere as a result of human activity (Chernobyl, territories 
of the Far North, and many industrial regions). 
  Or take the latest examples. While truly striving toward 
conversion, the country's leadership has in fact destroyed the 
military-industrial complex, and we have ceded world weapons 
markets to Western countries and now are incurring enormous 
losses. 
  Curbing inflation is the task of any government. But the 
anti-inflation measures adopted by the "reformers" resulted in a 
paralyzed economy, strikes, enterprises shut down, a disastrous 
drop in production, and... higher inflation. 
  All this was undertaken, it would seem, for the sake of the 
supreme interests of the country overall, although the effect 
was a negative one, not to mention the enormous amount of 
material means spent irrationally. 
  In formulating the National Doctrine, after 
defining priorities it is wise to formulate a program of 
reforms in the interests of all society rather than in the 
interests of particular groups. Obviously, such a program will 
be nationwide in character. It must be 
comprehensible, realistic, and pragmatic and free of any 
ideological extremes. Citizens have the right, or are even 
obliged to know what the next "shining" future being offered to 
them is like, how reforms will be conducted, and how much time 
they will take. Citizens have the full right not only to ask 
about this, but also to disagree completely with the program 
proposed and ultimately, to demand a report on the Government's 
activity. 
  The great Russian philosopher Vl. Solovyev stresses: "Both 
human individuals and entire nations face the task of 
counterbalancing each other without losing their original 
uniqueness, but on the contrary, manifesting it most fully. 
Genuine unity of peoples is not uniformity but universality, 
that is to say, the cooperation and solidarity of all people for 
the self-sufficient and full life of everyone." 
  These are truly sacred words calling for unity. All the 
things that have happened in the last few years sometimes remind 
one of a hasty retreat by troops leaving behind 25 million 
"prisoners," Russian and Russian-speaking compatriots who 
suddenly find themselves in a foreign land now called the near 
abroad, cast to the winds of fate. But even those who are now 
living in Russia are experiencing if not moral-political at 
least socioeconomic oppression. They include tens of 
millions of formally and de facto unemployed people; and 
they include tens of millions of pensioners, 
students, and disabled persons. 
  Now underway is the collapse of the Russian 
ethnos, or rather its violent breakup, and the 
formation in the former Union and autonomous republics of 
Russian national minorities which in certain cases reach or 
approach 50 percent of the population, which in itself is 
fraught with disastrous conflicts. Attempts to concentrate in 
Russian communities millions of people who find themselves 
refugees in their own country or hostages of ambitious 
politicians are having virtually the same result. Abandoned 
homes and hearths, migration of work force fatal to the national 
economies, and the misfortunes and death of people. Years of 
work by tens of millions of people are being nullified by the 
redistribution of ethnic areas. 
  Russian people regardless of where they live, if they 
preserve their national self-consciousness, are a powerful 
driving force for the rebirth of Russia. The state strategy 
of the Russian great power must rely on the historical and 
spiritual legacy of its people. Because Russia will never be 
reborn if the disposition and national self-consciousness 
inherent in our people are not reconstructed. 
  The path to national accord must be sought on the platform 
of 
respect for the individual and the right of each citizen, 
regardless of party, religious, or national affiliation, to 
tolerance and harsh treatment of all attempts to 
destabilize the situation in the country and once again to 
try to break up the State. It is remarkable that in recent 
months positive trends focused on achieving national 
accord and strengthening the Russian State are beginning to 
show in the policies of the president, the Government, the 
Federal Assembly, and most political forces. But potent 
destructive forces which are in the structures of power and in 
the opposition oppose these weak shoots. Thus, today the 
watershed lies not so much between the president and the 
Government, on the one hand, and the opposition, on the other, 
as within these camps: between the forces of creation and 
the forces of destruction. 
  Today a Government able to find a way out of the crisis is 
needed. Only a program which is oriented to the needs of most of 
the population in the spiritual and material spheres will enjoy 
the support of the people. And only then can consolidation of 
all progressive forces interested in Russia's rebirth be 
achieved. 
  How do we propose to begin? 
  FIRST, immediately abandon the extremes of the 
political struggle and strengthen legality, law and order, 
and elementary performance discipline, without which any power 
is doomed to impotence, that is to say, strengthen the 
State. Any weakening of one of its branches signifies a 
weakening of power and the state as a whole. The 
mutual reinforcement of the representative, executive, and 
judicial branches of power would be wiser. 
  SECONDLY, undertake a series of measures to improve the 
living conditions of citizens of the Russian Federation, 
above all the least protected ones, pensioners, children, the 
sick, and disabled persons. 
  THIRDLY, defend unity and economic and political 
independence. 
  FOURTHLY, restore Russia's spiritual potential. 
  The most important condition for achieving these objectives 
is the rebirth of the nation's dignity and spiritual potential, 
which in the most tumultuous years of hardship saved Russia, 
encouraged consolidation, and helped overcome the most serious 
crisis. That is the most important prerequisite of 
political, economic, and social Progress. Without a 
National Idea, in Russia's conditions it is 
impossible to achieve a significant result either in 
politics, in economics, or in implementation of the reforms. The 
shaping of the National Doctrine has already begun 
and should continue at an extremely fast rate. Only then is a 
realistic success in the particular area of the reforms possible. 
  The first attempt at a comprehensive view of the 
National Doctrine of Russia is attached for your 
attention. Naturally, the authors in no way claim their views 
are absolutely correct. Moreover, there is by no means full 
unanimity among them. We invite opponents to a well-supported 
debate in the interests of the Nation. 
  With respect to readers and opponents,

international nongovernmental scientific research organization

"The Entire Community Against Corruption"] 
  [Text] Fighting corruption shall be the duty of all 
state and municipal organs, organizations, and institutions, of 
all individuals empowered to perform state functions.... 
  (From the draft of the Law on Fighting Corruption) 
  The draft Law on Corruption was one of the last documents 
which the Supreme Soviet considered and approved in its time. 
However, President Yeltsin did not sign it, referring it for 
revision. According to Viktor Ilyukhin, chairman of the 
Committee on Security of the lower chamber of the Russian 
parliament, the committee has resuscitated the draft and made a 
number of substantial revisions in it. Possible amendments to 
the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, which does not 
define precisely what should be considered corruption in Russia, 
are being considered in parallel with the law. In Ilyukhin's 
opinion, this evil has afflicted the state structures of Russia 
from top to bottom. 
  The draft, hearings on which have already been held at a 
joint meeting of two commissions of the State Duma--for 
security, and for legislation and judicial reform--envisions 
punishments of several kinds for unconscientious officials. 
Being disciplined administratively is the lightest punishment 
that a bribe-taker holding a state position can get away with. 
This is followed by dismissal from his position with a 
subsequent ban on working for state institutions for a certain 
period of time. Criminal liability is envisioned for crimes in 
office which have considerably damaged the interest of the state. 
  The chairman of the Committee on Security has no illusions 
about the new law working to the fullest extent immediately 
after its adoption by the parliament and confirmation by the 
president of the Russian Federation. Like many others, the 
document is threatened with falling victim to the atmosphere of 
"legal nihilism" that reigns in the country. 
  Some deputies from the Russia's Choice faction oppose the 
adoption of the Law on Fighting Corruption as such. In their 
opinion, the law torpedoes the economic reform that is underway 
in Russia. 
  Viktor Ilyukhin believes that the attitude of the president 
of the Russian Federation toward the new draft law is being 
formed under the influence of two legal schools, 
"theoreticians"--who are represented by the Institute of State 
and Law of the Russian Federation, and "practitioners"--the 
Institute of the Russian Federation Procuracy, the Academy of 
the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and others. Whether Yeltsin 
will sign the document after it is approved and passed in the 
Federation Council largely depends on who succeeds in 
substantiating their position better--the "theoreticians" or the 
"practitioners." In the opinion of the chairman of the Committee 
on Security, there are quite a few people on the staff of the 
president of Russia and in the government who are resisting the 
appearance of the new law. An alternative draft of the law is 
being developed in the recesses of the president's staff. 
However, Ilyukhin believes that the Duma is outpacing the team 
of the president. The presidential law is still at the 
development stage, whereas that of the Duma is almost ready.

<F P=106> [Article by Rodion Morozov under the rubric "Company </F>
Secret": "FAPSI Avoids Chance Liaisons"] 
  [Text] In our times perhaps only children have not 
heard about such things as "government communications," "the 
Kremlin circuit" [kremlevka], and "the dialing circuit" 
[vertushka]. However, even those who use the services of special 
communications usually do not surmise how they operate and in 
what way the confidentiality of conversations between its 
subscribers is ensured. Secret communications are what the name 
says. Nonetheless, certain things may be learned about them 
anyway. An OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent was assisted in this 
by a colonel of the FAPSI [Federal Agency for Government 
Communications and Information], who naturally wished to remain 
anonymous. 
  [Colonel] In conventional terms, the entire telephone 
network 
may be divided into a few categories: the first, the second, and 
the third. The regular urban network is the third category; 
operational networks used for in-house communication between 
employees of special, classified establishments, for example, 
the General Staff, are the second category. In this instance, a 
certain degree of protection for communications is employed. 
Communications of the first category are so-called "government" 
communications--ATS [Automatic Telephone Exchange]-1, ATS-2. 
Similarly, ATS-1 has a narrower circle of subscribers than 
ATS-2. Previously a man who held the position of deputy minister 
at a minimum, and not just any deputy minister, was supposed to 
have ATS-1. Besides, other types of special communications 
exist: HF communications (high-frequency)--for long-distance 
conversations, satellite communications.... 
  Naturally, various degrees of protection are established 
depending on the status of the subscriber position. For example, 
there is a type of communication--previously it was called 
Metal--which envisions restricted access to telephones. That is 
to say, the telephone is "enclosed" in a box and sealed; the 
seal needs to be broken first in order to make a call using it. 
The telephones are opened only in extreme situations; the 
president, the minister of defense, and some other individuals 
are supposed to have them "by virtue of rank." I remember the 
horrible panic that we had and how everybody hustled when this 
communications line was damaged. 
  [Morozov] Do faults occur on government communications 
lines, 
too? 
  [Colonel] Of course. On occasion some excavator would begin 
to dig where it should not, and sever the cable. Do not worry, 
repair complications do not influence subscribers in any way: 
They do not have to wait until we patch up faults. Some other 
network is used in all such situations. 
  [Morozov] Could you tell us about ways to protect special 
communications? 
  [Colonel] There are quite a few ways. For example, highly 
pressurized air is pumped into a cable. When a "malefactor" 
tries to tap the cable, we learn about this virtually right 
away. Electromagnetic manometers are installed at all of our 
switching centers; as soon as air pressure within the cable 
drops, an alarm is activated. A command is given right away, and 
an operations group moves out toward the leak. 
  Besides, such a thing as encoding devices exists. If 
information is classified, secret, it is encoded first: The 
telephone is connected to the scrambler, and all the words turn 
into absolutely unintelligible, untranslatable "garble." After 
passing through the descrambler at the receiving end, the 
"garble" turns into words once again. This is why if someone 
tries to tap the line it will make no sense at all: Years will 
be needed to decode even a few sentences. 
  A precaution such as noise masking [zashumlenie] is also 
used. A cable has, say, 20 cable conductors; five carry 
information, and noise from a special generator is piped into 15 
cable conductors. As a rule, noise masking is used for sections 
of cable between the telephone and the coding machine. Why is 
this necessary? I will give a very simple example. Imagine that 
you sitting in your office and typing. Each typewriter key (the 
typing plate with a letter) is located at a certain distance 
from the sheet on which you type. Consequently, different time 
intervals for keystrokes are characteristic of different 
letters. This is why if a sensitive microphone is installed in 
your office, a wiretapping service will subsequently easily 
reproduce, word for word, what you typed by using a special 
program. (This is why typewriters on which secret information is 
typed are screened in a special way in certain offices.) The 
same is the case with cable. With the use of special equipment 
the signal may easily be read, even from a distance of a few 
dozen meters, off an unprotected section of the cable which 
carries uncoded information. Subsequently, this signal may be 
transformed into information. With noise masking, the likelihood 
of this is reduced to virtually zero. 
  [Morozov] Have the general economic difficulties affected 
your service? 
  [Colonel] Very unfavorably. Previously we were served on a 
priority basis: How else, these were the needs of government 
communications! At present, they fill on a priority basis the 
orders of those who pay the most. The things we have at our 
disposal are gradually growing obsolete, but there is nothing 
with which to buy new equipment. For a while people were held 
back by the hope that "everything will change for the better 
soon." Later, that was it, the hope was gone, and people fled in 
every which direction, one after the other. Officers who had 
served for 15 years quit. They abandoned everything and 
went--without retirement benefits, without anything. At present, 
many people understand that the things that are happening may be 
called the beginning of the end. 
  [Morozov] The end of communication? 
  [Colonel] Perhaps so. I recall now how we rejoiced at first 
when we were removed from the Committee for State Security to be 
a separate structure--the Federal Agency, and then under the 
president. Some hazy prospects began to emerge. There was talk 
about merchants--those who are capable of paying big money--also 
becoming our clients and this, correspondingly, affecting our 
salaries. No sooner had we started dreaming then they hit us 
with a tonne of bricks: Really, guys! These are government 
communications, and you are turning them into a commercial 
venture! 
  Now we have a feeling that we have been left high and dry: 
There is neither the money nor the prestige. After all, 
previously there was the system, and whatever they might say, 
this system needed us, and it took care of us. We were 
respected, which is important. We would come to a ministry and 
say: "I am such and such, from the USSR KGB." They would 
accompany you, show you around, and look you in the eye.... What 
about now? Our prestige has ultimately dropped, and not only 
ours but that of all former services of the committee. So, many 
people would like to go back now. However, where is the system 
now?

<F P=106> [Article by K. G. B.: "Primakov's Stripes"] </F>
  [Text] Academician Ye.M. Primakov is the director of the 
Foreign Intelligence Service [FIS] of the Russian Federation. 
Yevgeniy Maksimovich is the only one of the notorious 
Gorbachev's closest and prominent confederates who also stayed 
on Yeltsin's team. As is known, this happened because Primakov, 
a very farsighted politician, got his correct bearings in time 
and from the beginning of 1991 began to secretly supply the 
needed information to the former RSFSR president's inner circle. 
The academician's talent for secrecy served him well later, when 
he bargained for himself the job of FIS head (he was also aiming 
at that of minister of foreign affairs). 
  ...The academician-director's prominent trait is lordly 
generosity and love for his "loyal crowd." For instance, 
Primakov's permanent aide (of many years now) Robert Vartanovich 
Markaryan, who has never been in any way related to 
intelligence, was recently promoted to the rank of general! 
General Markaryan (who lovingly and tenderly carried Primakov's 
suitcases during his numerous voyages) is planning to become 
head of the FIS information-analytical department. My, what a 
gift for the CIA! 
  Some time in the past Primakov gave his buddy Kantorov the 
job of legal department chief, which has only a few employees. 
And behold!--Kantorov also becomes an intelligence general. 
  A man Primakov needs very much is Yuriy Antonovich Zubakov 
(a 
friendly nickname within the FIS--Dubakov). Deputy director for 
personnel, Zubakov has already become a rear admiral. Having 
donned a glittering admiral's uniform, Yuriy Antonovich likes to 
admire himself in the mirror when he is alone. 
  By the way, the personnel director-admiral Zubakov-Dubakov 
intends to become head of one of Russia's stations in a far 
abroad foreign country. One imperialistic tabloid has already 
published a write-up of this dream. 
  Academician-director Primakov is not only a "hospitable" 
host, but also a "wise" arbiter in the squabbles among his 
entourage. For instance, Mr. Mertsalov, chief of the FIS 
transportation and utilization department, and his "war" deputy 
Mr. Panov recently came to blows. To such an extent that the 
shock waves generated by this "clash of the titans" reverberated 
throughout the entire service. Professional intelligence 
officers, who still remember the special responsibilities of 
their profession, came to the conclusion that both Mertsalov and 
Panov were on their way to being dismissed in disgrace from the 
FIS. Naive people, they forgot about the academician's love for 
his retinue. Mr. Panov ceremonially departed for a foreign 
assignment, while Mr. Mertsalov still grandly occupies his old 
position of responsibility. 
  ...Do you want to become a general under Primakov? Become a 
"useful" person for the academician-director.

<F P=106> [Article by Major General Viktor Filatov: "A Leap on </F>
Beijing--It Appears That This Is What the Creators of the `New 
World Order' Have in Mind. And Not Without Russia's Help"] 
  [Text] The Americans are planning field training exercises 
at the Totskiy training site in Orenburg Oblast. At the approach 
of such events, requests are submitted for ammunition, fuel, 
foodstuffs, the number of films to be shown to field training 
exercise participants during hours of "rest," the number of 
copies of KRASNAYA ZVEZDA to read during the halt... There is 
also a request for caskets: There are always corpses at field 
training exercises--after all, people fire submachine guns, 
throw grenades, fire guns, move around in tanks and armored 
personnel carriers, launch rockets... Besides, Orenburg Oblast 
is in Asia, the very heart of the Eurasian continent. The 
"stars-and-stripes" have never set foot here. On the moon 
perhaps, but here--definitely never. It looks like a fool's 
dream is coming true: Their stars-and-stripes will be flying 
over Eurasia without firing a single shot... 
  Our side will definitely submit a request for caskets; I am 
curious--will the Americans? And if they do, for how many? Ours 
will ask for approximately 15 to 20--this is our norm at all 
field training exercises without exception. Commanders later 
inform mothers tersely: "Died while carrying out his duty..." A 
platoon commander and two soldiers--or more often someone going 
on leave to the parts where the deceased family lives--bring the 
parents the body of their son in a zinc "jacket." After 
that--who cares? I am curious how the Americans do it. 
  Why did I start with caskets? The point is that "by the 
number of sides undergoing training, field training exercises 
are divided into without and with an opposing force [OPFOR]. At 
field training exercises with an OPFOR, the troops (forces) of 
each side operate according to their army's tactics. At field 
training exercises without OPFOR, the actions of the opposing 
side are indicated by specially allocated units, sets of 
targets, and other means of imitation in keeping with the 
tactics of a foreign army..." 
  The field training exercises being planned at Totskiy 
training site cannot be with an OPFOR since each of the 
participating divisions represents in every sense of the word a 
completely different "ideology." Does this mean they will be 
field training exercises without an OPFOR? It does not figure 
otherwise. Who will imitate the enemy? I have seen numerous 
field training exercises, and almost always "ours" and "theirs" 
in the heat of the battle clash in all seriousness almost in 
hand-to-hand combat: Russian against Russian, but from a 
neighboring division. And this is, as they say, not the most 
deadly thing that happens at training exercises. 
  Generally speaking, these questions should be addressed to 
the field training exercises commander. Field training exercises 
have been announced, but there is no commanding officer--or at 
least no one has heard of one. Two divisions will participate in 
the field training exercises--one of ours and one American. 
According to regulations, the field training exercises commander 
must be someone one step above a unit commander--in this case, a 
division commander. According to regulations, this is an army 
commander or higher. There is only one field training exercises 
commander. Will the Americans entrust this job to our general? 
This is absurd. For the Americans today our general is a 
defeated general. They will not place themselves under his 
command. 
  There is a solution--to invite a German. If not as an field 
training exercises commander, then as an intermediary--as is 
known, there are no field training exercises without an 
intermediary. The winners are determined by the intermediary's 
reports. Better still, the British: It looks as if they have 
some problems in the making with the Chinese regarding Xiangang 
and Hong Kong... Most likely, however, a solution will be found 
through a "co-" prefix: co-chief, co-commander, co-drinker. 
  Still, I think that despite everything these will be field 
training exercises with an OPFOR--that is, when "troops (forces) 
of each side operate by the tactics of their army." The point is 
that the Russian army--at least since Yeltsin's time--is a 
full-fledged member of NATO, and NATO is a common grave of all 
national armies and national military doctrines. It does not 
matter that no papers have been signed publicly. Those that need 
to be signed have been signed, as they say, behind closed doors. 
And there was only one meaning to all the exercises NATO ever 
held--to demonstrate "military might," "unity and monolithic 
character," "readiness to act against the enemy..." But more 
often NATO exercises are used as a "means of political pressure 
on the opponent, inciting military hysteria." 
  Who is NATO's enemy today, when Russia is practically a NATO 
member? In this respect it is amusing to watch these Estonias 
and Moldovas, who are rushing to get into NATO's trenches 
against the Russians in the hope that this "anti-Russian" front 
line will be well rewarded. All these Tallinns and Chisinaus 
think that they are NATO's road to Moscow. But this is a 
mistake: Today they are only milestones by the road, but not to 
Moscow. NATO is already in Moscow--without their help. NATO took 
Moscow in as a battering ram against Beijing. The Balts, the 
Moldovans, or anybody else will not get any profit from this. 
Too late. 
  It is said that the upcoming field training exercises are 
aimed against Kazakhstan... You mean against Nazarbayev, who is 
completely buddy-buddy with Washington and Billy? Without any 
military pressure, Nazarbayev does whatever he is told by 
Washington or Brussels. Kazakhstan is as much an occupied 
country as Russia. 
  Clinton, Yeltsin, Nazarbayev... They are people of the same 
"campfire," hired for the job by the same personnel 
director--the "world government." For each of them, just in 
case, there is an almost standard compromising dossier: Clinton 
got slapped with real estate machinations; Nazarbayev--with 
rigging elections; as to Yeltsin, he got himself in a mess over 
so many things on his own that should the "world government" 
decide to remove him tomorrow, there will be no Yeltsin the 
president. This is what it means to be on hook with the "world 
government"--on the brink of impeachment. 
  For the "world government," Tallinn, Chisinau, Kiev, 
Alma-Ata 
[Almaty]--all of them are a road to nowhere. While Moscow for 
the "world government" is a road to Beijing. What do Estonia et 
al have to do with it? It was back under Gorbachev that in 
accordance with allegedly mutual agreement with the USSR, within 
the framework of the completely mythical for us European 
security, all our troops began to be pulled beyond the Urals. 
Under Yeltsin the only troops left in the European part of 
Russia are essentially two punitive divisions near Moscow. The 
entire army is in the east. Facing what enemy? 
  Today only great China is free; it is the only country where 
a new occupation regime under the name of the "new world order" 
has not been established. True, in Russia there has been a 
show-inspection of some mythical troops in Kaliningrad (when the 
entire army is in the east), pretending that a new impregnable 
Koenigsberg is being created in the west. Against whom? Against 
Lithuania, which in the best times, pardon me, of its 
independence under the Germans had an army of 80,000, counting 
the rear services? Against Poland? This is absurd--it will have 
quite a task now to hold the German lands in the west without 
the USSR's aid. It is facing score-settling with "that" side, 
not "this" one. Stalin knew what he was doing when he palmed off 
to the Poles the traditionally German lands. They will be lucky 
if they avoid a fourth partition today... 
  All this being done for diversion, in order not to alarm 
Beijing before the time comes. The "world government" is taking 
it into hard tongs: in the East--the American-South Korean 
group, and in the West--the American-Russian one. China is 
condemned by the "world government" to at least quartering: into 
Xinjiang, Tibet, Inner Mongolia, and the South--the Yunan 
territory... But the No. 1 point is Xinjiang--the Xinjiang 
Autonomous District. Nazarbayev knows some details of this big 
game; that is why he is now hustling to move the capital from 
Alma-Ata further away from the potential military operations 
theater: under any outcome, Alma-Ata will have it. It was 
founded by Russians as the Vernyy military post. There is a 
possibility that Alma-Ata once again will be reduced to its 
original status... 
  Sowing discord between the Russians and the Chinese is an 
old 
and painstaking job for the "world government." They succeeded 
once--and we had Damanskiy and Zhalanoshkol. By the way, 
Zhalanoshkol is awfully close to Alma-Ata, almost next door. 
Nazarbayev probably also remembers the bodies of Soviet border 
troops who defended Soviet Zhalanoshkol. Both we and the Chinese 
had dead bodies at Damanskiy and in Zhalanoshkol. And also... 
  Hungarian analysts, for instance, believe that in 1973 we 
amassed a million-strong army against China. An action against 
China, a confrontation with it, eventually cost us $200-250 
billion. We spent $60 billion on the war in Afghanistan, and as 
much on the war between China and Vietnam: both these conflicts 
were a "continuation of the Russo-Chinese discord." An expense 
of a minimum of $320 billion--this is greater than the combined 
material damage to European countries inflicted by World War II 
($260 billion, of which $128 billion was sustained by the USSR). 
And how much did China spent on preparations for war against the 
USSR? And how much did Comecon countries spend--after all, the 
action was held on two fronts?... 
  Direct military expenditures represent only a small part of 
expenses of a different nature in the Russo-Chinese conflict. We 
should not forget that China used to tie down a considerable 
part of the American military potential. This is true today as 
well. 
  There has existed since the Vietnam war time the so-called 
"Nixon doctrine"--"Asians should kill Asians." It is a very 
well-developed doctrine, tested in many Asian wars. Nobody has 
repealed it to this day--on the contrary, it had been constantly 
perfected. 
  As soon as the joint exercises were announced, PRAVDA ran an 
article under the eloquent heading "We Do Not Mention Damanskiy, 
But..." And this subheading: "Russia-China: Are There Border 
Problems?" It is amazing how synchronously the boys are working 
for the "world government," even though perhaps quite 
unwittingly! The article hypes up hysteria against the Chinese: 
They harass Russians, it says, everywhere--at farmers markets, 
in the taiga, in hotels... But what does China have to do with 
it if Russia is such a mess? I would write it off as stupidity 
had the article been signed by some "reader" or correspondent. 
But the signature under it is that of a doctor of historical 
science. 
  I agree that one article, even written by a PhD, does not a 
spring make, but now the entire occupation press is turning out 
in a broad-front attack against China. In the near future we 
should expect a massive artillery attack on the part of all 
occupation mass media against China. They already dusted off 
Damanskiy... Somebody is already making China into the No. 1 
Enemy of Russia. Why? Who needs it? 
  By the way, it was China that saved us after 1946 from an 
atomic bomb striking simultaneously 100 cities in the USSR, the 
union and friendship with China. The Chinese said: Our atomic 
bomb is our 1 billion population. It was only later that we 
developed our own atomic bomb. The discord that was sown between 
USSR and China turned out to be a catastrophe not only for the 
USSR but for all countries of East Europe, the entire so-called 
socialist camp. The enmity that is now being planted in 
relations between China and Russia will cost Russians their 
complete annihilation. 
  There is rumor that Beria was an old English spy. Allegedly 
since the time they were masters of the Transcaucasus--in 
1918-1921. Maybe he did indeed serve British intelligence--I 
have not had the opportunity to look in the safes of British 
special services. But... "I know them from their deeds:" Beria 
very seriously "developed" Xinjiang--this is a fact. To have 
Xinjiang is absolutely not a Russian national dream and goal. 
  Some time in the past in Alma-Ata I met some people. They 
were mostly Uygurs. There are a lot of them living in and around 
Alma-Ata. There are many more of them living on the other side 
of the border, in Xinjiang-Uygur Autonomous Okrug. After 1945 
Beria planted in Xinjiang under the guise of various specialists 
a tremendous number of Uygurs from Kazakhstan, from the entire 
territory of the USSR. They gradually took all the key positions 
in the autonomous okrug. Events were moving in the direction of 
the creation of an independent state of Uygurstan and its 
secession from China. Is this a Russian dream? 
  Events took a different turn, though. Stalin died. We 
executed Beria. Failures began in Xinjiang--in short, the 
Chinese massacred all of ours there. Very few escaped with their 
life by jumping the border. In Alma-Ata, in the USSR in general, 
nobody needed the surviving Uygurs. They lived almost illegally, 
without residence permits--with relatives and friends. The new 
rulers pretended that they did not know such people--Uygurs. 
This probably was true. The dreadful authority, although Beria 
was no longer there, set up its own people--who did not even 
suspect where they were being led--for a massacre and 
annihilation, and those who escaped could not even get a 
residence permit in their home town. They did not have the term 
"new world order" then, but that does not change the substance 
of the matter. 
  As to the Chinese, in connection with these so-called joint 
exercises the Americans and Pasha Grachev are about to run, they 
should start viewing attentively in today's Xinjiang--as well as 
in Beijing--their own, Chinese, Gorbachevs, Yeltsins, Kravchuks, 
and Shushkeviches. Judging by the game, everything is moving in 
the direction of a Chinese Novo-Ogarevo, a Xinjiang Belovezha 
Preserve, And look less at the United States. Plus move more 
troops into Xinjiang, as they did in the memorable incidence of 
the failure of the attempt to create a Soviet Uygurstan.

<F P=106> [Remarks by Oleg Dobrodeyev, editor in chief of information </F>
service of NTV television company, recorded by Anna 
Politkovskaya, under the rubric `Television": "Is NTV 
Independent?"] 
  [Text] Oleg Dobrodeyev, 35-year-old editor in chief 
of the information service of the NTV television company, 
assures us: "We depend only on common sense..." 
  The NTV television company, which originated in the bosom of 
ITA Ostankino, began its permanent daily broadcasting on 
Channels 3 and 4 in 1993. Various things were said about the 
"youngster": that all the journalists who had transferred there 
had sold out lock, stock, and barrel to the financial group 
Most-Bank and that it is through their mouths that the high 
commercial financial circles of Russia broadcast from the 
screen. But discussions are discussions, and it is difficult to 
imagine a weekday evening without the information program 
"Segodnya" (anchors--Tatyana Mitkova and Mikhail Osokin) or the 
end of Sunday without "Itogi" (Yevgeniy Kiselev). 
  Oleg Borisovich Dobrodeyev is a Muscovite, a specialist in 
modern and recent French history (MGU [Moscow State University] 
history faculty and graduate school), and an ace of domestic 
television. At one time he was the chief of all currently 
existing main information television services of Russia without 
exception. And he left it all: He was never satisfied by the 
concept of information broadcasting--neither on "Vesti" nor 
especially on ITA. Last year he finally got a chance to do 
things exactly as he thinks they should be done. 
<H5>  We Are Dependent. But Only on Common Sense </H5>
  Independence is a fairly arbitrary thing, and those who say 
that TV can be completely independent today are being less than 
candid. Of course, we are independent of the power structures in 
selecting and preparing programs and we determine our own 
information priorities, but here we are guided by OUR OWN vision 
of what is happening. Watch, let us say, the news on BBC or ITN, 
their interpretation of the events in Southern Ireland, and you 
will immediately be able to see that not everything is so 
simple. Even the companies that frequently give only simplified 
outlines as information, and that is how CNN operates--an 
excellent service, which is remarkable in crisis 
situations--even they have their own particular predilections 
and unconditional priorities, their own sympathies and 
antipathies. 
  Our company's main priorities are the same as those of other 
worldwide companies--NEWS. In the first place, we do not 
influence political events but simply register them. In the 
second place, we are not on the side of one or another political 
party or grouping and we try to give the information picture of 
the day in all its diversity. Information, in our view, implies 
a certain reasonable framework as well: We do not chase after 
sensational news, we try to give only verified information, we 
cannot allow ourselves to be too categorical in our assessments, 
and we do not allow those who speak on our programs to be too 
categorical either--whatever they may say, there is editorial 
control, and that is normal. Of course we do not give only pure 
news announcements but at the same time we have no shows with TV 
hosts. In the future we will try to get away from commentary. 
But the attitude of the host or journalist toward the event 
could be manifested also in the selection of information; nobody 
is insured against that--it is impossible to run everything 
through a computer so that it will have an ideal design in its 
final form. Nonetheless, the makeup of the program, its 
information portraits, each topic--these are never random on 
"Segodnya" or "Itogi," they do not appear in one place or 
another just because that is what somebody wants. And in this 
respect we depend only on common sense. 
  There are socially significant events which undoubtedly 
influence the subsequent course of the political or economic 
process. Therefore, as a rule, the political news goes first, 
but it can also be something else that happened today but did 
not yesterday and will not tomorrow. For example, the loss of a 
person who was involved in many people's lives. For example, on 
the day of the death of Yevgeniy Leonov we decided to begin the 
program with this particular piece of news. We try to approach 
information from a position of universal value--human life. We 
always place the problems that are bothering our compatriots 
today in the first segment--and this is our fundamental 
position. Even if only to break down the stereotype of abstract 
state news: Here are state interests and here is the human 
being, who is very separate from them. The tradition of 
Ostankino news was precisely not to air anything that pertained 
concretely to a given person, whether it be Chernobyl or the 
tragedy in Baku. 
<H5>  NTV Does Not Sing the Praises of Financiers </H5>
  I know many bankers, but this is in no way reflected in our 
work. People see us every day and we cannot allow ourselves such 
a luxury as to declare our predilections from the screen. 
Moreover this is unproductive: As soon as we join with one 
financial group or political party or another, regardless of 
whether they are our investors or not, our ratings will 
immediately start to fall. This is why we have no commercial 
pieces, as other leading information services now do, in which 
the anchor gives the lead in: "Today is the anniversary of such 
and such a commercial structure," and later in the middle of the 
information program, among other pieces, there appears a newsy 
but purely complimentary piece created in keeping with all the 
rules of commercial advertising and production. The commercial 
financial information is woven into the fabric of the program 
and it undermines confidence in everything else. Such pieces 
should be used only during advertising time. 
  The problem of today's TV and of all journalism for that 
matter is that aesthetic boundaries are erased and ideas about 
what is permissible and what is not evaporate. And after the 
commercial financial information, which is shown daily (we are 
quite well aware of where and how it is placed), it is 
impossible to avoid the next stage, which we have encountered 
anyway, especially during the last election campaign. It is 
POLITICS FOR HIRE. NTV, incidentally, is the only company that 
has never given its air time to any political party for money. 
Naturally, they have asked us. But this was the fundamental 
position of both the leaders and all the workers. The strangest 
thing we have in journalism today is when representatives of one 
party or another come to an interview with an envelope in their 
hand. 
<H5>  NTV's Prospects </H5>
  It will be simply reasonable, consisting of three components 
which are mainly interesting to the audience: information, 
entertainment, and sports. I would like for us to synthesize the 
BBC's balance, CNN's efficiency, and ABC's accounting for viewer 
interest. At the same time we understand quite well that we are 
living in Russia and working for a Russian audience, and we must 
make certain adjustments, taking into account the specific way 
in which we are viewed. One thing I can promise for sure--NTV 
will not do any political programs since they bring the lowest 
ratings and nobody needs them. 
  "Itogi" is primarily analysis. And that is why those who 
receive it, those who do not receive it, and those who are 
indifferent to it are checking their political watches against 
it. The most difficult thing today is simply to register the 
event and give all existing viewpoints. Not to influence what is 
going on, not to have an impact on what the journalist 
encounters and, of course, not to harm it to any degree. 
Everything is filled with contradictions nowadays, and to 
represent it adequately to the audience without being on one 
side or the other is very difficult. But we think that there are 
some things that are inadmissible in journalism. We must not, 
for example, air an interview if it provokes a situation of 
conflict. 
<H5>  Our Ratings Are Rising </H5>
  We especially order a determination of our ratings from 
sociological services. And so far we are satisfied--we have a 
fairly large number of viewers, the number is always with two 
figures, in the millions, naturally. Our audience is more 
knowledgeable than the audience of Ostankino's "Novosti" and 
"Vesti." We are watched by people who do not need a readymade 
assessment of events, who can put the facts together for 
themselves. Although, of course, we do not set a special goal of 
having news for the elite. Throughout the world companies invest 
colossal amounts of money in analysis of television audiences, 
since the rating means the value of advertising on which 
commercial TV exists. The value of each program is determined by 
its rating, which is typically determined the day after a 
program is aired. 
  So far we do not intend to increase our broadcast time: We 
need to assimilate what we have now, which, in my view, is at 
fairly good times--1900 and 2200. The audience, as a rule, is 
not always the same and therefore no more than 20 percent of the 
newscast is repeated. Thus we end up with a very large amount of 
information broadcasting--a whole hour. Moreover, in a month or 
two our correspondent network will be in operation, and then it 
will be possible to speak further about the development of the 
NTV news service. For now we rely on help from stringers 
(nonstaff investigative reporters). The correspondent network 
will be fairly compact: two regional foreign correspondent 
bureaus--in the United States and Germany, and about 10-12 (in 
the first stage) in Russia and nearby foreign countries--in 
Vladivostok, Yekaterinburg, Rostov-on-Don, St. Petersburg, 
Syktyvkar, Saratov, Riga, and Tbilisi.

<F P=106> [Text of "Appeal to the President of Russia, B. N. Yeltsin, </F>
on Questions of Local Self-Government"] 
  [Text] Esteemed Boris Nikolayevich! 
  In the last 3-4 months, the heads of administrations of such 
major Russian cities as Omsk, Saratov, Vladivostok, and Nizhniy 
Novgorod have been released from the posts they occupied. 
  The circumstances of the dismissal were varied, but 
everywhere they took place under pressure of the governors of 
the oblasts. The standard set of accusations was made against 
almost every one: attacks on the oblast administration, the 
collapse of Russian statehood, ties with opponents of the 
reforms, corruption, repeated flagrant violations of work 
duties, and so forth. The same situation is now taking shape in 
a number of other cities. 
  We are very worried that honest, decent people who are truly 
supporting the interests of their cities and vigorously 
defending the rights of local self-government established by the 
Constitution of Russia and guaranteed by your edicts are leaving 
the job. Objective examination of the work of the heads of 
administrations of the cities did not precede the dismissals and 
they did not receive written explanations, and the grounds for 
removal were not considered by any commissions, while some were 
refused the right to meet personally with the president of 
Russia, which your edicts stipulate directly. 
  Today most of the governors are doing everything possible to 
subjugate local self-government to themselves, which directly 
contradicts Article 12 and Chapter 8 of the Constitution of 
Russia. Those who oppose this are as a result either dismissed 
or they resign themselves. One gets the impression that local 
self-government is a fiction and the federal authorities do not 
need it, although we are certain that local self-government is 
objectively an ally of the president of Russia and the central 
authorities in the political and economic reform of our country 
and in the defense of public interests. 
  We propose the following to you: 
  1. Put local self-government under your protection and 
supervision. 
  2. Meet with representatives of unions and associations of 
the cities of Russia. 
  3. Speed up the development of normative enactments to 
demarcate the jurisdictions of the organs of state power of the 
subjects of the Federation and local self-government. 
  4. When heads of administrations are released from their 
posts, set elections of the heads of local self-government on an 
alternative basis. 
  5. At the petition of heads of administrations who have 
been released from their posts, conduct reviews and publish 
their results. 
  Accepted at the meeting of the Union of Cities of the 
Northwest of Russia on 9 April 1994, city of Kirov.

<F P=106> ["Paraphrased" report on speech by Prime Minister of the </F>
Republic of Tatarstan M.G. Sabirov at 19th Session of the 
Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Tatarstan on 19 April 1994: 
"Reform the Economy in the Interests of Society"] 
  [Text] Respected People's Deputies! That criticism heard 
during the session with respect to the government is quite 
understandable. It is associated most of all with the difficult 
situation that has developed in our republic's economy. The 
purpose of my speech is not to give an explanation for all the 
critical statements--I consider it my duty to report to you, 
deputies, about the economic condition of the republic, and to 
inform you of the government's near-term measures concerning a 
reduction in the rate of the production slump and our 
capabilities for its stabilization, in order, in the final 
analysis, not to permit a reduction in the standard of living of 
the citizens of Tatarstan. 
  Today, an interstate treaty has already been signed that was 
long-awaited by a majority of the population, and within its 
framework 12 intergovernmental agreements, and our opponents 
from various sides are criticizing both the documents themselves 
and the persons who participated in their preparation and 
signing. But at the same time, should they not think about 
Tatarstan's political situation and economic prospects if there 
were no treaty? How would many of our residents feel, continuing 
to experience a condition of vagueness in their position with 
respect to other citizens of the Russian Federation, with their 
next-door neighbors, with their fellow-workers? [line missing] 
this psychological burden of a majority of our people, which, 
naturally, will serve to further strengthen interethnic harmony 
in Tatarstan. I think that everyone understands the high value 
of this harmony and this friendship of the peoples of the 
republic. 
  What do the treaty and agreements offer on an economic 
plane? 
I will say frankly: Clarity has emerged among the government and 
economic managers and workers of financial-economic services in 
mutual relations not only with structures of the Russian 
Federation but also with state organs, firms, and enterprises of 
the near and far abroad. In this difficult period of entering 
the market, this already gives our commodity producers, bankers, 
and average and small entrepreneurs freedom of action to arrange 
and reinforce relations with their colleagues in a unified 
economic space. Now the efforts of our entrepreneurs and 
managers--no matter what kind of property they own and 
manage--should be directed at maximizing the effectiveness of 
using new capabilities for their practical activity. Thus, this 
is essentially a new program establishing new tasks, on whose 
implementation the government and all entrepreneurs will have to 
work energetically. 
  The government, on its part, prepared a program of action 
for 
implementation of the treaty and the agreements. All collectives 
should obviously have such programs, so that after organizing 
their activity thoughtfully and with initiative, they will get 
the maximum possible use and benefit from them. Such purposeful 
work should be calculated for at least five years. Incidentally, 
such periods are specified in the treaty and the agreements. 
  Afterwards, the prime minister said: The government 
conducted 
all its work on the basis of the Concept of the Transition to 
the Market, which was adopted by the Supreme Soviet of the 
Republic of Tatarstan in 1991, and which is being adjusted 
annually. Besides implementing a number of other programs 
adopted by the Supreme Soviet, the government worked on 
implementing the constitution, laws of the Republic of 
Tatarstan, edicts of the president, and also its own resolutions 
and decrees. 
  In March 1994 work was completed on a draft of the Main 
Directions of the Economic and Social Development of the 
Republic in Consonance with the Constitution of Tatarstan. The 
draft [line missing] a number of comments were made. In the near 
future we propose to distribute a corrected text of the draft to 
all deputies, in order to consider and adopt this important 
document at the next session. 
  Considering that the information and concluding speeches of 
Deputy Prime Minister F.G. Khamidullin and Minister of Finance 
D.N. Nagumanov presented an analysis of the work for 1993 and 
forecasts of the development of the economy for 1994, and a 
report and analysis of the budget, I will dwell briefly only on 
certain features. 
  The individual, the resident of our republic, with all his 
concerns and affairs is always at the government's center of 
attention. "Not allowing a drop in the standard of living of the 
population" is the main principle by which we are guided in our 
daily work. 
  The facts say that the standard of living that determines 
the 
ratio of the average per capita income to the subsistence 
minimum had in the course of 1993 a clearly expressed growth 
tendency--from 2.2 in January to 2.9 in December (in Russia this 
indicator fluctuates from 1.45 to two, respectively). It was 
possible to achieve this most of all with a balanced price 
policy, repeated raises in the minimum scale of payments for 
work, increases in allowances and compensation payments, and the 
development and introduction of specially directed social 
protection. We were able to maintain prices for minimum 
commodity subsistence at a lower level than in neighboring 
regions and in the Russian Federation as a whole. Two very 
important laws were adopted in the republic in 1993: "On the 
Subsistence Minimum" and "On the Minimum Wage Scale." In 
accordance with them, the minimum wage scale cannot be less than 
the value of the figure for the subsistence minimum. I will note 
that the subsistence minimum is a low limit, a limiter, and we 
should in no case permit a drop in the level of incomes below 
this figure. If something like this happens, the mechanism of 
specifically directed social protection is immediately turned 
on. Analysis shows that of the standard collection of 19 food 
product designations adopted in the Russian Federation, 
quantitatively more can be bought in Ulyanovsk, next in Kazan, 
and then Samara. 
  It should be said that starting in 1994 we have already 
begun 
to orient ourselves to a higher indicator--a minimum consumer 
budget. While today the subsistence minimum is equal to 40,500 
rubles [R], the minimum consumer budget is R131,000. 
  The actual cost of food, commodities, and services that are 
part of the subsistence minimum amounts to R40,500 plus R31,500 
for April 1994; that is, R72,000. (The subsidy allocated to each 
individual of the republic is contemplated at a level of R31,500 
for April.) Analysis of the standard of living for the first 
quarter of 1994 shows that a fall in it is occurring 
nevertheless. In November 1993 it amounted to 2.65, in February 
1994--2.22, in March--2.41, and 2.44 is expected in April; i.e., 
lower than in 1993. The reason is that it is possible to 
restrain prices only to a certain limit, after which the ruin of 
the consumer market could begin. But with an increase in prices, 
the cost of the subsistence minimum also increases. In order to 
maintain their required ratio it is necessary to ensure a faster 
growth of the incomes of our citizens. 
  As you know, wages are the main source of income of the 
working population. However, the Law of the Republic of 
Tatarstan of 8 February 1994 "On the Minimum Wage Scale" has not 
been put into effect at all enterprises and 
organizations--according to it, starting 1 February 1994 a 
minimum wage scale of R3,000 is established on the entire 
territory of the republic. According to 32 enterprises and 
educational institutions that have just been checked, where the 
established minimum has not been introduced, this minimum is not 
received by more than 4,000 persons. I repeat: only where 
verified! These are mainly educational institutions that are 
financed from the budget of the Russian Federation, medical 
apparatus and compressor plants, KOMZ, the joint-stock company 
Kvart, the computer system PO [production association], 
individual NII's [scientific research institutes) and KB's 
[design bureaus], and everyday services enterprises. In 
addition, as a rule, unskilled workers--office cleaners, guards, 
and cloakroom attendants. But, after all, it is for this 
category that the minimum was introduced! 
  A very low wage is paid by the Kazan electromechanical 
plant--R23,427, the Tochmash plant--R46,357, Promstroy 
Progress--R45,506, Leninogorsk sewing factory--R38,085, and 
others. 
  At the same time, the level of wages is excessively high at 
Tatenergo--R479,061, the Kazan liquor-vodka plant--R362,775, the 
Kazan leased tobacco factory Aromat--R294,526, the Menzelinsk 
liquor-vodka plant--R314,444, the Urussu ZhBI [reinforced 
concrete articles]--R303,595. Moreover, a majority of them are 
permanent clients in begging for favorable credits and other 
types of subsidies. Under these conditions the State Labor 
Committee, jointly with the ministries, departments, and heads 
of administration, should immediately conduct a check on the 
"minimum" for all organizations and enterprises located on the 
territory of the republic, no matter what property category they 
come under. Workers of the Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee 
for the Management of State Property] of the republic should 
also participate. It is necessary to take quick and effective 
measures in each specific case. Where it is possible, to assist, 
and where the situation is hopeless, to proceed in the end to 
activate the bankruptcy system. 
  It is necessary to regulate the "spread" in the level of 
average wages through taxation. A work rating figure that is not 
taxable should be closely tied to the results of the work of an 
enterprise. Given a very high wage, if it is not connected with 
increased volumes of production and the ability of the produced 
product to compete, it is necessary to introduce a mechanism for 
progressive taxation on resources being directed at wages. 
  Afterwards, M.G. Sabirov began to set forth the 1994 program 
for further reformation of the economy. Its main point is the 
conduct of radical changes in tax, budget, credit, and price 
policy. The government established a working group headed by 
F.G. Khamidullin that in the near future is supposed to submit 
proposals for reforming tax policy. It is proposed to reduce the 
amount of taxes, to eliminate some of the taxes introduced in 
the localities that were not approved at all, and to bring order 
to tax benefits. Benefits should be given only to those 
enterprises and organizations that, after submitting justified 
calculations, can sharply increase the volume of production of 
competitive products, and not only to fill in deficiencies owing 
to the benefits taken, but that will also give additional 
revenues to the budget. 
  It is necessary to perfect the methodology for calculating 
budgets submitted by the local soviets, with a gradual increase 
in the importance of the local budgets. It is advisable in the 
republic consolidated budget to retain only that part that is 
used to cover general republic expenditures and the 
implementation of republic and federal programs. 
  Resolution of the price problem is seen in the adoption of a 
normative document in the form of an edict of the president of 
the Republic of Tatarstan concerning freedom of economic 
activity in which it is advisable to envision a further 
liberalization of prices in all spheres of activity. 
  The issue of payments, or more properly nonpayments, has 
become the most important one for everyone today. Managers of 
all ranks, including the president and Cabinet of Ministers 
workers, are losing a lot of time searching for resources to 
support production and the life support of the population. 
  The upper house of the Federal Assembly of the Russian 
Federation passed a decree "On the Solvency Crisis in the 
Economy of the Russian Federation." We see the resolution of 
this question in the immediate introduction of securities in the 
republic, first and foremost, the bill of exchange system within 
whose framework settlements should be conducted for the debts of 
enterprises in all types of economic management. A package of 
necessary documents has been developed and is going through the 
endorsement stage. The task of the government is to launch them 
starting 1 May 1994. The next measure--it is necessary 
immediately to develop a mechanism for and conduct a quarterly 
offset of mutual indebtedness at least in the economic space of 
our republic. Possibly the Russian Federation will also 
introduce this system later. It is also necessary to activate 
work to attract foreign financing for the purpose of financing 
the improvement and reorganization of enterprises, and to use 
the barter mutual relations of commodity producers, importing 
into the republic for "debts" first of all the needed group of 
food commodities, medicines, equipment, and materials. 
  In 1994 it is necessary for us to accelerate, intensify, and 
expand privatization. It is also necessary to include new 
facilities in privatization, to complete small privatization 
this year, and to increase the privatization share in state 
property. All this will make it possible to increase the rate of 
costs of enterprises being privatized and to accelerate 
structural restructuring. 
  Small and average enterprises are the most flexible form of 
commodity producers that react instantly to market demands. A 
system of measures should be worked out in a short time, 
including adoption of the necessary laws of the Republic of 
Tatarstan, edicts of the president, and decrees of the 
government. Then the growth of small entrepreneurship in number 
and quality will not only cover many spheres of the market with 
commodities of their production, will not only make it possible 
to increase the number of jobs, but will also provide 
significant revenue for the budget, mainly for local budgets. 
This is where it is necessary to have a system of tax benefits 
first and foremost. 
  We should further reorganize agricultural production, which 
was discussed in detail at two group conferences of agrarians. A 
special place is given in the draft on the main directions of 
this branch. A program on the agricultural industry is now under 
development. 
  At the present time there is active interest on the part of 
deputies in reforming the executive organs of authority. This is 
understandable. The concept of reforming the Cabinet of 
Ministers was worked out at the end of 1993 by a group of 
specialists and researchers. The structure of the higher 
executive organs of about 40 states were studied. On the basis 
of this analysis and taking our peculiarities into account, in 
the first quarter of this year I proposed a new so-called mixed 
economic structure of the Cabinet of Ministers oriented on the 
market, including its staff, and the ministries and departments. 
We can also distribute this material to the deputies together 
with the draft Main Directions of Socioeconomic Development of 
the Republic of Tatarstan in Accordance with the New 
Constitution. 
  In concluding his speech, M.G. Sabirov emphasized that the 
president, the government, and a majority of the deputy corps 
are working as an integrated team. Herein lies our strength. As 
for the arguments and debates on urgent problems in the 
development of the republic, they can be explained by a desire 
to find a way to more optimal solutions. The government is ready 
to receive and examine all proposals of people's deputies and 
positive criticism, no matter where it originates, in the most 
careful way, and to draw practical conclusions.

of the Republic of Tatarstan: "On Implementation of the Republic 
Budget for 1993 and the Draft Republic Budget for 1994"] 
  [Text] Esteemed people's deputies! 
  A total of 854 billion rubles [R] in taxes and revenues was 
collected in the territory of the republic last year, of which 
R529 billion was credited to the republic budget. 
  The rayon and city budgets were implemented with a surplus 
of 
revenues over expenditures of R12.9 billion, and the republic 
budget--with a surplus of R9.8 billion. 
  The expenditures of the consolidated 1993 budget came to 
R833 
billion, or 98.5 percent of the revenues raised. 
  Expenditures for the national economy account for the 
greatest proportion of the overall volume of expenditures in the 
republic--45.5 percent. The same percentage of expenditures in 
this section of the budget was planned in the projected 
consolidated budget. 
  Expenditures of the national economy from the republic 
budget 
were made in the amount of R180.4 billion, or 34.7 percent of 
all expenditures. 
  The expenditures of agriculture and other sectors of the 
agro-industrial complex, including subsidies, account for the 
largest proportion of the expenditures for the national economy 
out of the republic budget (65.7 percent). An additional R84.3 
billion was allocated from the republic budget for the 
development of these sectors. 
  With a view to supporting goods producers, rates of grants 
per unit of animal husbandry output far exceeding those 
officially established by the Russian Government were used in 
the republic through all of last year. For example, by the end 
of the year this rate was exceeded by a factor of almost seven 
for milk, more than eight for cattle, and more than nine for 
hogs. 
  The total amount of budget expenditures for the payment of 
subsidies for animal husbandry output in 1993 came to R80.3 
billion, which exceeds the projected statistic by a factor of 
almost three. 
  The establishment of higher rates of subsidization for the 
products of animal husbandry made it possible to contain the 
sharp growth of retail prices for the principal products of 
animal husbandry during the entire year. For other types of 
foodstuffs, the differences between wholesale transfer prices 
and retail prices were refunded with a view to making foodstuffs 
cheaper. About R25 billion was spent out of the budget for these 
purposes, which exceeds the projected level by a factor of 
almost four. 
  Some R42.1 billion was allocated to finance capital 
investment in agriculture; it was mostly used to defray 
expenditures for the construction of intrafarm roads, social, 
cultural, and consumer service facilities and housing, and for 
provision of gas in rural areas. 
  A total of R178 billion was allocated to develop the 
agro-industrial complex. The proportion of expenditures of the 
agro-industrial complex in the republic budget came to 25 
percent. 
  Subsidies coming to R18 billion (of which R15 billion to the 
enterprises of the Tatavtotrans) were allocated from the 
republic budget in 1993 to various transportation enterprises in 
order to cover losses in conjunction with the use of regulated 
rates of fares in urban and commuter transit. 
  Certain measures were taken in the reporting year to 
reinforce social protection for employees of the sociocultural 
sphere and low-income strata of the population. Expenditures 
from the consolidated budget for this purpose came to R306.3 
billion, or 35.5 percent of all expenditures. 
  The largest sums within this section of budgetary 
expenditures were allocated for public education and health care. 
  The expenditures of the republic budget to maintain the 
organs of state power and government exceeded R6 billion last 
year, and increased by a factor of 4.4 compared to the projected 
level. 
  Compared to the projection, outlays on maintaining the law 
enforcement organs increased by a factor of almost five, and 
came to R17.8 billion. 
  An amount of R39.8 billion was allocated to fund centralized 
capital investment made at the facilities of local soviets. 
  An amount of R127 billion, or R96 billion more than called 
for by the projection, was provided out of the republic budget 
as financial support in the form of grants to rayons and cities 
given in the course of mutual settlements. 
  Some R67.7 billion in loans and credit from the republic 
budget was extended in order to replenish the working capital of 
enterprises and organizations with a view to promptly solving 
important problems of a social and economic nature, which 
exceeds the level of last year by a factor of two. 
  During the reporting year, R310 billion were allocated to 
the 
republic budget for supplemental expenditures. This was 
necessitated by multiple increases in the wages of the employees 
of institutions financed from the budget, the systematic growth 
of the size of scholarships for the students of educational 
establishments, monthly compensatory payments for families with 
children, social benefits, and allowances for children paid to 
single mothers and other categories of the population, the 
growth of material costs in conjunction with growing prices for 
energy resources and other types of products, work, and 
services, the implementation of decisions of the Supreme Soviet 
on the priority development of the key sectors of the national 
economy, and the carrying out of programs adopted by the Supreme 
Soviet. 
  The speaker stressed that the year 1993 came to an end with 
a 
lot of strain, despite the apparently favorable implementation 
of the revenue side and the presence of a certain surplus of 
revenues over expenditures (R9.8 billion, or 1.8 percent). 
Individual directives and decrees of the government on the 
allocation of budgetary appropriations to defray the 
expenditures made, mainly in capital construction, were not 
executed in the fourth quarter because of a lack of funds. Total 
arrears by the end of the year exceeded R80 billion. 
  The areas of expenditure mentioned testify to the fact that 
the supplemental budgetary funds were allocated strictly within 
the framework of the budgetary legislation of the republic to 
ensure the vital operations of the critical sectors of the 
republic's economy and social protection for low-income strata 
of the population, taking into account the priorities set by the 
Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Tatarstan. I ask that you 
confirm a report on implementation of the 1993 republic budget 
in the amount of R529.5 billion on the revenue side and R519.7 
billion on the expenditure side, with a surplus of revenues over 
expenditures coming to R9.8 billion. 
  The 1994 budget message of the president of the republic is 
also submitted to you for consideration. The government worked 
on it for a long time. Since the message was submitted to the 
Supreme Soviet, it has been thoroughly worked on by standing 
commissions, and has been repeatedly discussed at the meetings 
of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. Within the government 
itself, painstaking work has continued to refine a projection of 
socioeconomic development and individual provisions of the 
budget. We could not fail to take into account the results of 
the first quarter of this year. For this reason, the government 
is compelled to submit a second version of the main documents 
that make up the budget message. 
  The main proposals that will be reflected in the findings of 
permanent commissions will form the foundation for the operation 
of the government, just as in the previous year. 
  We must admit frankly that the financial situation in the 
republic is unprecedentedly difficult. Both the slump in 
production in the republic and the nonpayments crisis, which 
became cataclysmic by the end of last year, are the main 
reasons. As a consequence, large arrears in payments to the 
budget emerged in the process. The failure of the budget to take 
in the planned amount of funds prevented the government from 
financing to the full extent the projects envisioned by the 
budget. The backlog of last year was carried forward to this 
year and became an additional heavy burden. Particularly large 
arrears remain in funding for capital investment. Despite the 
measures taken, arrears in last year's payments to the 
construction sector have not been paid to this day. 
  The nonpayments crisis is growing worse. As of 1 April the 
accounts receivable of enterprises and organizations, i.e. the 
debts to our enterprises, came to R1.5 billion, whereas now they 
have exceeded the R2 trillion mark. According to the most 
conservative estimates, more than R300 billion which has not 
been contributed to the budget constitutes nonpayments. 
  The situation remains difficult. Only R250 billion was taken 
in by the budget of the republic in the first quarter, with 
projected estimate of intake being R600 billion. Hence the 
difficulties with funding current expenditures whereby arrears 
have emerged for the first time even in the payment of wages to 
employees of institutions financed from the budget, to say 
nothing about other expenditure items in the budget. 
  Under the circumstances, various measures, at times 
desperate 
measures, to improve the situation in settlements between the 
enterprises of the Republic of Tatarstan have been taken in the 
republic: Mutual debts have been offset, including relationships 
with the budget, and the circulation of bills of exchange has 
been introduced. We have even succeeded in getting enterprises 
located outside of Tatarstan involved in such circulation. 
  We can now say that the republic has succeeded in 
undertaking 
a number of large projects in the national economy, primarily in 
the agro-industrial complex, as well as those to support the 
Kama Automotive Plant, some construction organizations, etc., 
solely due to such measures. 
  However, it is necessary to stress that it is extremely 
difficult for our government to radically change the situation 
under conditions whereby the lion's share of indebtedness to our 
enterprises for the products delivered is held by partners 
outside the republic. 
  The economy of the republic has been integrated into the 
economy of Russia, the CIS, and the world to such a degree that 
we are simply not in a position to counteract crisis phenomena 
without ameliorating the common economic space. Unfortunately, 
the Russian Government has so far not taken radical measures to 
fully resolve the nonpayments crisis. 
  I believe, the minister said, that we have succeeded in 
offering for the deputies' judgment the only possible budget 
which not only reflects present-day realities but also comes up 
with a projection for the future. 
  The income level has been forecast with average yearly 
prices 
growing by a factor of 2.59 compared to prices of the fourth 
quarter of 1993, profits growing by a factor of three, and the 
level of reduction in the physical volume of production coming 
to 17 percent. It would be absolutely incorrect to believe that 
the budget should be drawn up proceeding from today's situation. 
A realistic projection is definitely a necessity, which would 
make it possible to reflect the main directions of the budget 
policy and give the government an opportunity to work on 
accomplishing the tasks set by the Supreme Soviet. 
  The draft budget for the year [word illegible] was drawn up 
on the basis of the tax system in effect and proposals by 
ministries, departments, and the heads of administrations 
concerning the areas of fund disbursement, as well as measures 
to ensure a balanced budget. 
  At the initial stage the draft budget, which was drawn up on 
the basis of requests from ministries and departments and the 
indexes of the growth of prices to calculate certain budget 
expenditures, was put at R4.1 trillion on the expenditure side, 
proceeding from the volume of revenues in the amount of R 
[number illegible] trillion. The budget deficit was put at R1.5 
trillion, which exceeds 50 percent of the volume of revenues. 
Implementation of this budget could cause the financial 
situation of the republic to worsen sharply, the budget deficit 
to grow, expenditures not covered by revenues, and ultimately, 
the standard of living of the population to decline. 
  The concept of designing the budget system of the republic 
for 1994 is aimed mainly at ensuring the survival of the 
existing network of sociocultural institutions, providing social 
protection for the people, ensuring the completion of housing 
construction projects in progress and other facilities in the 
social sector which are nearing completion, and maintaining the 
necessary standard in the sectors of the national economy whose 
sectors and tariffs are regulated by the state. 
  What does the revenue side of the budget consist of? The 
principled position of the government is that the existing tax 
system is to be fundamentally changed. In the process, it is 
already difficult to make any proposals to amend tax legislation 
in the territory of the republic under the conditions of a 
common economic space and tax policy with the Russian 
Federation. For this reason, the government requests that the 
Supreme Soviet endow it with the necessary rights to grant 
relief of the main sources of taxes in the process of 
implementing the budget. 
  The raising of revenue sources in an amount exceeding R3.7 
trillion is projected in the republic as a whole. Under a treaty 
between the Government of the Republic of Tatarstan and the 
Government of the Russian Federation, between 20 and 23 percent 
of this will be transferred to the federal budget for the 
Russian Federation to exercise the powers delegated to it by 
Tatarstan and to carry out joint programs. The net revenue of 
the consolidated budget is projected to be about R3 trillion. 
  The following peculiarities are characteristic of the main 
sources of revenue in 1994. The value added tax is the largest, 
and at the same time the one whose impact on today's economy is 
ambiguous. The rates have not been changed, and come to 10 
percent for foodstuffs and merchandise for children and 20 
percent for other goods, work, and services. The intake of value 
added tax by the budget of the republic is projected to exceed 
R360 billion, or 12 percent of the total volume of revenues in 
1994. 
  Excise taxes, which call for appropriating for the budget 
additional profits from the sale of alcoholic beverages, tires 
for passenger cars, oil including gas condensate, fur products, 
and some other goods, are the next significant source of revenue 
for the state budget. The intake of excise tax by the budget of 
the republic is projected to exceed R720 billion, or 22 percent 
of the total volume of revenues. 
  Unlike value added tax, profit tax is an instrument that 
affects the pattern of the spending of funds by enterprises and 
organizations. In keeping with legislation in effect, it is 
envisioned to exempt from taxation up to 50 percent of the 
taxable profits of enterprise funds allocated for the retooling 
of production, construction and remodeling of facilities of 
social infrastructure, as well as conversion, repayment of 
credit, and replenishment of working capital. 
  The intake of profit tax in 1994 is projected to exceed R725 
billion. It is actually given in full to the local budgets; it 
is projected that less than one-third of the tax, or R232 
billion, will be taken in by the republic budget. 
  The receipt of individual income tax, the main source of 
revenue for local and in particular rural budgets, is projected 
to exceed R370 billion in 1994, with the growth of wages taken 
into account. 
  The total amount of budget receipts from resource user fees 
(the water fee, mineral fee, land fee) is projected to reach 
R104 billion. 
  Now about the special-purpose taxes to be introduced in 
1994. 
In keeping with Russian tax legislation, a transportation tax 
and a special tax for financial support of key sectors of the 
national economy have been introduced. The projection for them 
comes to R180 billion, or 6 percent of the volume of budgetary 
revenues. We recommend that the Supreme Soviet introduce two 
more taxes: a levy to meet the needs of educational institutions 
in the amount of 1 percent of the labor compensation fund of 
enterprises, organizations, and institutions, and a tax for 
maintenance of the housing stock and facilities of the 
sociocultural sector in the amount of 1.5 percent of the volume 
of product sales by enterprises. The projection for these two 
taxes comes to R156 billion, or 5 percent of the volume of 
budget revenues. 
  With a view to reinforcing the budgets of the local soviets, 
we propose to assign the property tax to the localities in full, 
the volume being more than R240 billion, or 8 percent of the 
volume of budget revenues. It is proposed to raise the level of 
the rate of this tax to 2 percent. 
  Subsequently, D.N. Nagumanov moved on to outline the budget 
policy of the economical disbursement of funds. The proportion 
of expenditures for maintaining sectors of the national economy 
is still considerable in the draft budget. The main task of the 
government is to gradually abandon comprehensive subsidization 
of the sectors of housing management and municipal facilities, 
passenger transportation by motor vehicles, and other sectors in 
which all residents of the republic enjoy preferences. It is 
necessary to make a gradual transition to a level of rates and 
the cost of services approximating actual outlays, with powerful 
social protection afforded at the same time to the least 
affluent strata of the population. 
  However, there are many objective difficulties in this 
instance. Thus, a clear-cut system of accounting for the incomes 
of citizens is lacking. Issues of registration of citizens by 
category have not been ultimately resolved at the local level; 
the mechanism of compensation for individuals in need of social 
protection has not been fully refined. This is why at present it 
is impossible to abandon the existing system of subsidization 
for the sectors of the national economy. As a result, it is 
expected that large sums will be allocated to offset the losses 
of the housing management sector and municipal services (R600 
billion) and to offset losses due to the use of regulated rates 
in highway, river, railway, and air transportation (about R100 
billion). 
  We propose to allocate more than R115 billion to maintain 
the 
departmental housing stock which will be, as needed, converted 
to municipal property and maintained out of the budget. 
  Support for the agro-industrial complex--the social 
development of rural areas, coverage for a proportion of the 
outlay of the producers of agricultural output on the 
acquisition of mineral fertilizer and pesticides, fundamental 
upgrading and reclamation of land, and so on--remains a priority 
area for budgetary expenditures. It is planned to allocate R370 
billion for these purposes. 
  It is envisioned to allocate about R250 billion as subsidies 
to the producers of agricultural output in order to maintain 
prices for food staples at a level affordable to the population 
of the republic. 
  It is proposed to allocate 20 [words illegible] for the 
conversion of enterprises in the defense complex. 
  Major funds are still planned for the sociocultural sphere. 
However, the current volume of envisioned expenditures for 
public education, culture, health care, and other sectors does 
not fully meet the now customary needs in this area in view of 
the absence of sufficient funds. 
  As far as expenditures for the maintenance of the organs of 
state power and government are concerned, the speaker stated 
that in the draft consolidated budget for 1994 they increased to 
2.4 percent compared to 2 percent of the actual expenditures 
based on the results of 1993. The main reason is found in the 
multiple increases in prices for the lease of premises, motor 
vehicle maintenance, municipal services, and office expenses. 
There is only way out: The strength of the government apparatus 
and the number of official passenger cars need to be cut deeply. 
  After protracted debate and discussions, a program of 
capital 
construction for the local soviets was set at a volume of R530 
billion. 
  In designing mutual relations between the republic budget 
and 
the budgets of the republic's rayons and cities, observed D.N. 
Nagumanov, the tasks of the government and the Ministry of 
Finance were to coordinate the entire economic potential of the 
republic with a view to stabilizing the situation in the 
national economy. The economic conditions are not the same for 
all regions at present. In some regions the defense complex with 
its problems prevails, whereas in others--highly profitable 
enterprises adapted to a market economy. At present, agriculture 
does not generate revenue for the budget at all, whereas the 
existing network of sociocultural institutions, as well as the 
production of agricultural output proper, require a large 
investment of capital. Therefore, the volume of subsidies and 
standard withholding rates were planned proceeding from the 
potential of the republic and individual regions to raise 
revenues, the structure of ownership in each rayon (city), and 
the need for all budgets to finance expenditures in keeping with 
the legislative and regulatory acts in effect. 
  In summation, the speaker stressed that the 1994 budget was 
drawn up with a considerable deficit, and even now is extremely 
difficult to comply with because of the current economic 
situation. Adjustments will have to be made continuously 
proceeding from the rapidly changing economic and financial 
situation.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Grachev by Galina Grigorenko; place and </F>
date not given: "The Political Situation in the Republic of 
Tatarstan Is Developing Normally"] 
  [Text] Two days ago the 19th session of the Supreme 
Soviet of our republic adopted a decree on termination of the 
authority of the people's deputies who have been elected to the 
State Duma of the Russian Federation. They include Ivan Grachev, 
who was for several years the head of the Power of the People 
parliamentary faction of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of 
Tatarstan. But the change in status does not, of course, mean 
that this politician is no longer interested in problems of a 
republic scale. He frequently travels to Kazan and coordinates, 
as before, the activity of the Equality and Legality election 
bloc. Our correspondent met with Grachev on the first day of 
business of the present session of the Republic of Tatarstan and 
put several questions to him. 
  [Grigorenko] Ivan Dmitriyevich, how would you evaluate the 
present session? 
  [Grachev] Quite a standard session, nothing new or 
interesting. I have a negative view of the budget message of the 
president of Tatarstan. In what way, for example, does a feudal 
state differ from a democratic one? In the first the ruler 
distributes the requisitions from various classes at his 
discretion, in the second, the collected taxes are transferred 
to the representative authority, which determines the rules of 
their expenditure and monitors all outlays. 
  I know from personal experience that the deputies of 
Tatarstan had no opportunity to exercise supervision of budget 
funds and the actual income from the republic's foreign economic 
activity or to influence the distribution of taxes. The real 
structure of the budget is now as follows: for the needs of the 
agro-industrial complex, up to 70 percent of all investments in 
the national economy, and for the development of "defense," 
which is the future of the Republic of Tatarstan, only two 
percent. This imbalance is unfair to the urban electorate and is 
fraught with the danger of a surge of unemployment and the 
destitution of many thousands of inhabitants of the republic. 
Even today we need to be creating new jobs in the cities of 
Tatarstan and to be seeking options for support of the 
"locomotives"--the most active industrial enterprises. All this 
will require much material expenditure because nothing comes 
free. The well-known saying: "The skinflint pays twice," should 
not be forgotten. 
  [Grigorenko] What step, in your view, should the corps of 
deputies take? 
  [Grachev] It would be expedient to vote down the proposed 
budget for approximately a month. Within this time a working 
group composed of people's deputies, members of the government, 
and businessmen would examine the most serious problems. I refer 
primarily to an easing of the tax burden, which is far higher in 
the Republic of Tatarstan than in the Russian Federation. Thus 
at industrial enterprises of Russia there are per R1 of profit 
an average of R1.4 direct and indirect taxes, in our republic, 
R1.7. Were it possible to find a solution that would make it 
possible to lower certain types of taxes, many municipal 
structures and industrial enterprises would have a pretty good 
chance of development. 
  [Grigorenko] Lately, information has been heard from various 
sources that the Government of Tatarstan will very shortly be 
forced to resign or, at least, undergo significant personnel 
changes. How do you view this prospect? 
  [Grachev] The members of Power of the People do not intend 
to 
vote for the resignation of Prime Minister M. Sabirov. I am 
convinced that for the reform of the managerial structures a 
transitional period, in which it is necessary to preserve 
stability and set about the reforms in earnest, is essential. 
Mukhammat Sabirov is coping successfully with the first task, 
and the accomplishment of the second is not, from our viewpoint, 
confined merely to this candidate. The opposition is opposed to 
revolutionary changes in the government. Let the team that is 
there now maintain economic stability in the republic. And a 
market managerial structure imbibing more and more powers should 
grow and gradually strengthen. 
  [Grigorenko] What, in your view, is the political situation 
in Tatarstan? 
  [Grachev] It is developing in the right direction. The fact 
that more than 30 parties and blocs are operating in the Russian 
Federation at this time is of little use, in my opinion. A two- 
or three-party political system may be considered suited to 
regulation of the economy. A favorable situation is taking shape 
here in Tatarstan in this sense. We have the Equality and 
Legality bloc, the party of the nomenklatura, Unity and 
Progress, the national political organizations, the communists, 
who will, most likely, "degenerate" into social democrats.... 
Ultimately a three-party system will be formed in the republic, 
and the electorate will know precisely at the next elections for 
whom to vote. 
  [Grigorenko] Judging by foreign press reports, the rating of 
the leader of the Yabloko bloc has begun to grow once again. 
Among the candidates for the office of president in the 
not-too-distant future experts put Grigoriy Yavlinskiy second 
after Viktor Chernomyrdin.... 
  [Grachev] From the viewpoint of personal image the leader of 
our bloc could lay claim to first place also. But, as practice 
has shown, an excellently organized team, which gathers all the 
necessary information, distributes leaflets, and performs 
precisely many other assignments, is also needed for the 
achievement of complete success. It is this election machine 
that Yabloko lacks. I am prepared to help Yavlinskiy create it. 
  [Grigorenko] May the suppositions of certain of the 
capital's 
journalists that the president will necessarily acquire such 
allies as the Russia's Choice and Yabloko blocs be considered 
objective? 
  [Grachev] There need be no doubt about Russia's Choice, but 
close interaction with the Yabloko bloc with a normal 
development of events is unlikely. The situation could change 
only in the event of a powerful showing of the Zhirinovskiy and 
Zyuganov factions. 
  As far as my personal opinion is concerned, Yeltsin should 
not run in the next elections: he has already honorably done all 
that he was supposed to have done. Of course, the president's 
entourage could play a part. These people are no longer in a 
position, evidently, to nominate a new leader and for this 
reason are prepared to instill in Boris Nikolayevich the idea of 
the need to take part in the elections once again. 
  [Grigorenko] There are stories in Moscow about the fine life 
of deputies of the State Duma. A few words about how your daily 
routine is arranged and whether normal conditions for work have 
been created. 
  [Grachev] I am staying in a hotel and I have been promised 
an 
official apartment at the end of summer. I can summon a car, 
although I am successful here far from always. But, like other 
deputies of the State Duma, I am most depressed by the fact that 
practically none of us has his own work place. It is not even a 
question of the lack of an office but of an ordinary writing 
desk in the parliament building.

<F P=106> [Report by R.F. Muratov, deputy prime minister of the </F>
Republic of Tatarstan, at the 19th session of the Republic of 
Tatarstan Supreme Soviet on 18 April 1994: "On the Foreign 
Economic Activities of the Republic of Tatarstan in 1993 and the 
Paths of Its Development in 1994"] 
  [Text] Esteemed people's deputies! In 1993, our foreign 
economic activities proceeded under quite difficult conditions. 
Pricing discrepancies in conjunction with the introduction of 
national currencies by a number of CIS countries were acutely 
felt. The introduction of various customs restrictions and new 
export and import tariffs posed a serious problem. The situation 
was complicated by continuing crisis processes in the economies 
of Russia and Tatarstan. Nonetheless, there were conspicuous 
changes in the foreign economic activities of the republic. The 
volume of foreign trade of the enterprises and organizations of 
the republic came to $1.7548 billion, which was 2.7 times more 
than in 1992. A number of factors were responsible for the 
increase in the volume of foreign trade, including an increase 
in the number of participants in foreign economic relations, of 
whom there were 1,340. The 1993 exports came to $1.0166 billion, 
of which $760.8 million was through direct relations. In terms 
of the sectoral structure of exports, changes occurred in the 
direction of increasing the proportion of raw and other 
materials from 79 percent in 1991 to 89 percent in 1993. The 
proportion of machinery and equipment declined accordingly from 
20 percent in 1991 to 10 percent in 1993. Last year, the 
enterprises and organizations of the republic imported products 
worth $738.2 million, of which $188.2 million was through direct 
relations. 
  In the three and a half months of 1994, 10 enterprises with 
the participation of foreign investors were registered. The 
total number of such enterprises reached 127 as of 15 April 
1994. Thirty-three representatives of companies from America, 
England, France, Germany, and Austria have been accredited. 
  The conclusion of a treaty between the Russian Federation 
and 
the Republic of Tatarstan, as well as an agreement between them 
on the delimitation of powers in the area of foreign economic 
relations have fundamental [word illegible] for our foreign 
economic activities. The treaty has clearly laid down the right 
of the republic to independent foreign economic activities. The 
treaty and the agreement impart the necessary certainty to the 
regulation of foreign economic activities, the jurisdiction of 
the parties, their powers, and their responsibility. 
  Tatarstan is free to sign commercial and economic agreements 
with foreign states, as well as foreign partners. At the same 
time, a mechanism for the implementation of these important 
documents is lacking at present, and an enormous effort to 
develop it lies ahead. 
  The speaker went on to note that a number of projects and 
programs in the area of foreign economic activities have now 
been developed, in particular, the draft of an incentive program 
for industrial exports from Tatarstan and a draft program for 
attracting foreign investment to the republic. 
  Much attention has been paid to integrating the republic 
into 
the existing system of international economic relations. 
Forty-four projects to create new production facilities and to 
introduce new technologies have been selected. Standard forms 
for substantiating investment projects have been developed; a 
computer database for these projects has been developed; 
patterns for the receipt of loans from foreign banks and 
financial corporations to be guaranteed by the Republic of 
Tatarstan government have been specified. 
  At the same time, the raising of foreign capital is hampered 
for two principal reasons. First of all, we have yet to complete 
working with the federal government on defining independence in 
the area of setting quotas and issuing licenses for products 
delivered for exports, as well as in the area of export and 
import duties. At this point, R.F. Muratov stressed that for us 
to be able to make a clearer determination as to our prospects, 
we must agree that these quotas, if there are such, should be 
established for a term of no less than five years. At the same 
time, it is necessary for the republic to agree with the federal 
government that the government of the republic will set export 
and import customs tariffs independently within the concept of a 
national program in which priority directions for the 
development of the economy will be mapped out. 
  If we want to attract foreign investment, we must say to 
what 
degree we can guarantee its return so that the excessively 
frequent change in the decisions of the federal government 
related to export and import tariffs will not eliminate the 
opportunity to make long-term projections of investment in the 
economy of Tatarstan. 
  The second reason is related to issues of an internal 
nature. 
This is primarily the issue of ownership, further on, the issue 
of the finance and credit policy of the republic, and only after 
that the establishment of market-economy institutions. 
  At present, the issue of ownership is the bone of 
contention, 
beginning with the ownership of land. Uncertainty in this area 
may hamper the process of foreign capital investment. It should 
also be clearly perceived that the financial and credit status 
of the republic is such that it cannot cure the ailing economy. 
It is necessary to rationally use finance and credit within the 
circulation of the ruble itself by revealing internal reserves. 
In the process, it is also necessary to take into account [word 
illegible] funds that are yet to be received during 1994 from 
our enterprises in the form of taxes. At present, unconventional 
decisions are needed with regard to the use of credit from the 
Central Bank of Russia and federal credit as a whole. 
  R.F. Muratov went on to say that the issues of creating 
market institutions are becoming increasingly current. If such 
are active in some quarter it is necessary to support them so 
that they will be able to work with foreigners directly. If we 
want to integrate into the world economy, and we do wish to do 
this, we should definitely accept the rules of the game of those 
who already operate in this sphere. They demand that we create a 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry, an agricultural chamber, 
leasing and insurance companies, and banks, and give them an 
opportunity to operate. All of them should be privatized, i.e. 
amount to joint-stock companies or be privately administered. 
  We proceed as an independent state, and we must be aware of 
and know how to analyze economic problems. Undoubtedly, the 
analytical segment of our operations should be developed to this 
end. In view of this, it has become necessary to create within 
the State Committee for Statistics of the republic a service 
that would engage in the development of clear-cut approaches, 
the forecasting of financial and credit relations, and the 
dovetailing of our actions with those of the economic components 
and customs statistics of the Russian Federation as a whole. We 
would like to hope that in the future, this would be done to 
European standards. 
  The speaker subsequently noted that very many questions 
arise 
concerning approaches to and the implementation of the program 
of priority areas. These questions are asked with a sense of 
alarm over the propriety of the use of foreign exchange funds 
received. We must say that there has been certain progress on 
this score. An export department has been established at the 
Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations; expert reviews are 
administered with the use of specialists. As a result, funds 
exceeding $700,000 have been saved since the beginning of this 
year alone. It is necessary for the Ministry of Foreign Economic 
Relations to be in possession of all informational materials, 
for a long-range program to be developed, and for action to be 
taken to solve urgent problems. 
  Touching on the disbursement of foreign exchange funds 
obtained by the republic in 1993, R. Muratov said that, on the 
whole, oil exports yielded $306.5483 million. The balance of 
funds as of 1 January 1993 came to $67.8362 million. Therefore, 
$376.6473 million were allocated by us to meet social needs. As 
of 1 January 1994, we had $22.3608 million. 
  Owing to credit resources, we paid $116 million less for 
foodstuffs in 1993 than had been envisioned. That a number of 
goods whose prices increased considerably were delivered by 
various unorganized structures and were sold in the territory of 
our republic also was a factor. Health care and the organization 
of leisure also made certain economies. Overspending was allowed 
to occur in the agro-industrial sector in conjunction with 
purchases of insecticides and pesticides, seeds, and machinery, 
and the acquisition of advanced technologies. This endeavor 
should be put in order. We cannot go along with such purchases 
turning into the free handout of additional funds. I would like 
to stress that in the long term, all foreign exchange outlays 
will be accompanied by ruble cover out of the budget. There is 
no other way. 
  We have issued to you, the deputies, a detailed table based 
on the projection of foreign exchange proceeds from the export 
of oil in 1994. To my mind, it does not even require commentary. 
What is important is that the severance export duty established 
by the federal government eliminates oil from the export 
potential because it becomes unprofitable. However, we must say 
that the issue of not setting quotas at all for the delivery of 
oil abroad is being discussed by the Russian Government, as well 
as the issue of the reduction of the export duty. The government 
of the republic is making efforts to this end; however, so far 
we have not heard about a decision of the federal government to 
exempt oil within the regional quota from the export duty. 
  At present, oil is sold through the Tatneft Association. As 
you know, in keeping with a decision of the federal authorities, 
all export deliveries and the foreign exchange they yield are 
exempt from duties of all kinds on the condition that these 
funds are allocated to expand prospecting for oil, and the 
production and delivery of it and other energy resources. At 
present, a similar situation is also emerging at the 
Nizhnekamskneftekhim Production Association whereby a number of 
key petrochemical products, beginning with fuel oil, first, are 
subject to the export duty and, second, are covered by the 
decision on delivery quotas and licensing. Therefore, the 
Nizhnekamskneftekhim could have customers abroad who would pay 
in foreign exchange; however, the customers want to work with a 
supplier, say, at least a year rather than one to two months. 
  In summation, R.F. Muratov stressed that the export 
potential 
of the republic is sufficiently large and its development may 
proceed in a more optimistic mode. However, a precise 
coordination of activities is needed to this end.

<F P=106> [Article by Galina Kovalskaya: "Behind a Line a Stone's </F>
Throw From Home"] 
  [Text] I remember these trailers. Typical temporary 
trailers made of planks, void of conveniences--God knows how 
many people stuck inside... It seemed to me then that unless the 
refugee problem were resolved in the immediate future, a quick 
explosion would be unavoidable--you cannot live that way. 
  Now that a year has passed, the number of temporary trailers 
has multiplied. There are 11 refugee settlements in Nazran 
alone, with 100 families in each. You can live months with the 
most loving relatives, the most cordial and hospitable hosts, 
but not for a year and a half--with a mob of kids (the way the 
Ingush see it, a four-child family is a small family) and other 
people hanging on. 
  And all those who have not yet moved into a temporary 
trailer 
look into your eyes ingratiatingly when they run into you: "Will 
you be meeting with our leadership? Could you not help me 
out--to speed up the time I have to wait in line for a trailer?" 
While the settlements grow one by one--enclosed areas densely 
covered with trailers and two or three wooden outhouses. 
<H5>  Crowded and Pinched </H5>
  Gas and electricity lines have been laid to the settlements. 
Now and then the light goes out due to overloads--heating 
devices are hooked up everywhere and some people have obtained 
old television sets from relatives, though the power supply is 
intended only to energize room light bulbs... 
  There is yet another stinging refugee problem--sickness. Due 
to the terrible population density, lack of normal hygiene 
conditions, and simply the moral and physical shock of a year 
and a half ago, epidemics flare up and spread rapidly in the 
refugee camps. The shortage of medicines is felt more acutely in 
this republic than on the whole across Russia. Medical 
institutions designed to treat a certain number of patients are 
located in areas where the population has almost doubled since 
November 1992. 
  The settlements are attached to nourishment facilities which 
provide food free of charge once per day. The rest comes from 
what relatives dish out--one is not going to live it up on the 
Russian allowance of R1,800 per month. There are also 
"children's" allowances and unemployment compensation. Without 
any doubt, there is not enough money to live on. And only a 
certain few specialists manage to find work in Ingushetia. 
  It is not only the residents of Prigorodnyy Rayon that the 
war has doomed to unemployment. From a time long ago, ever since 
they returned from Kazakhstan, it was so ordered that the 
residents of Nazran and the large and small villages would 
travel to work every day in Vladikavkaz, the capital of Northern 
Ossetia (the Ingush prefer to use the Soviet name Ordzhonikidze, 
but most often simply call it the city), or--which was 
considered less prestigious--to the Chechen city of Groznyy. 
  Today there is no work in Groznyy even for its own 
residents, 
and the Ingush are prohibited from going to Vladikavkaz. It 
turns out that the newly formed republic has collected tens of 
thousands of active, able-bodied people without normal living 
quarters, without the means of existence, without prospects to 
quickly find work. 
  The bulk of the refugees are rural people who have become 
accustomed to their own gardens and orchards, their own 
livestock, their own housekeeping. Tens of thousands of people 
who day after day without exception fed livestock, milked, 
plowed, sowed, fished, and gathered the harvest--for a year and 
a half now have been lying about with nothing to do, half 
starving for days on end. 
<H5>  Just a Stone's Throw From Home </H5>
  Human beings become accustomed to everything. No matter how 
many refugees there are in this unfortunate country, adaptations 
and accommodations are made. For these people deported from 
Vladikavkaz and Prigorodnyy Rayon, however, their own homes are 
just a few dozen kilometers from their present location. You 
could get into the car of any relative. No need to load any 
things--you left with just what you had on you, and you would be 
home in half an hour. 
  There, at home, war has not been seen for a year and a half. 
Your garden sits there unsown. Your neighbors have your cow, if 
it is still alive, and they would probably return it to you. How 
do you resign yourself to the fact that situated between you and 
your own home is the Russian Army? How do you tell yourself that 
you will go home no more and might as well get settled in your 
new location, where no one needs you? 
  The Ingush is accustomed to putting everything into his 
home. 
About 30 percent of the adult male Ingush population have 
engaged in so-called "moonlighting." In Vladikavkaz, in Groznyy, 
and in Russia, the Ingush have been hired to perform the most 
menial daytime labor. But at least they received decent pay for 
it, at least they had the opportunity to build themselves a 
house. Without his own home, a man is not a man. It is not 
befitting for him to marry, let alone start a family. 
  The most important thing sustaining the Ingush Republic 
today, the thing that is on everyone's lips--from politicians to 
kolkhoz workers, from refugees to inhabitants as local as can 
be--is the return of those deported. A change has taken place in 
the overall national concept. Whereas before, the main idea 
uniting the Ingush was the return of Prigorodnyy Rayon, today 
the main thing is the return of the refugees. 
  It is not that the Ingush are prepared to reconcile 
themselves to the fact that Prigorodnyy will remain within 
Northern Ossetia. It is simply that this question has been 
shifted to the background for the time being as compared with 
that of the deportees. This is without any doubt due to the 
personal efforts of President Ruslan Aushev, who declared that 
over the period of moratorium with respect to territorial 
redistribution declared by Russia (until the end of 1995), 
Ingushetia would not raise the issue of Prigorodnyy Rayon. 
<H5>  The Other Side of the Terek </H5>
  Any modern political figure would envy Aushev's prestige in 
the republic. In the year of his presidency he has been able to 
accomplish what until quite recently was considered 
impossible--to announce the rejection of any claim to the right 
bank of Vladikavkaz and demonstrably lay the foundation of a new 
future for the capital of Ingushetia. 
  The history of the right bank issue is as follows. In 1924, 
when the Ingush Autonomous Oblast emerged, Vladikavkaz became 
the dual capital of Ossetia and Ingushetia. In 1934, the Ingush 
Autonomous Oblast was merged with the Chechen Autonomous Oblast, 
Groznyy was declared the capital of Checheno-Ingushetia, and 
Vladikavkaz (then Ordzhonikidze) was given to Ossetia. 
  When in 1991 the Law on Rehabilitation of Repressed Peoples 
was issued with its famous Article 6 providing for territorial 
recovery, the Ingush declared that the repression of their 
people began not in 1944, the year of deportation, but in 1934. 
The inference drawn here was that the Ingush Republic should be 
restored to its 1924-1934 borders, i.e., that half of 
Vladikavkaz be ceded to the Ingush. 
  This concept was very quickly assimilated by the Ingush 
masses--the point being that the Ingush did not simply lack 
their own capital, they virtually lacked a city of their own. 
Nazran is essentially a city-type settlement. It has no 
institutions of higher education, no scientific research 
institutes, no major enterprises. A tremendous part of the 
Ingush people was associated with Vladikavkaz, where they went 
to earn a living and to market far more frequently than to 
Groznyy. 
  It would be difficult to imagine the future republic without 
this city. It is precisely for this reason that people 
stubbornly refused to hear the voice of a few Ingush politicians 
with common sense who tried to warn that an undertaking with 
Vladikavkaz was pure adventurism which could only impede efforts 
to get back Prigorodnyy Rayon. 
  And so it came about that Ingush representatives failed to 
approve, and thereby prevented, signing of the edict already 
drawn up on the reassignment of jurisdiction of Prigorodnyy 
Rayon only because this left the whole of Vladikavkaz within 
Northern Ossetia. In addition, they did not build a capital of 
their own out of useless expectations of getting Vladikavkaz. 
They did not work to create republic industry, a system of 
education, public health care, or an infrastructure. 
<H5>  Ruslan and His Team </H5>
  In addition to everything else, Aushev's decision marked a 
transition to real state structuring. Aushev knew what he was 
doing when he moved toward the universal presidential elections. 
One year ago his only capital in Ingushetia was popular 
recognition and trust. His main ties and contacts remained in 
Russia. 
  Relying on this trust, he has today been able to create a 
political structure comprised of people loyal to him, a 
structure fairly strong on the local scale. The key positions in 
Ingushetia are occupied by pro-Aushev Afghanistan war 
veterans--people whose reliability the president need not doubt 
and with whom he can truly effect teamwork. The clearest example 
of this--though far from the only one--is that of Vice President 
Boris Agapov, not even Ingush in nationality but Aushev's fellow 
comrade in the military. 
  The rapid movement along the path of turning the Ingush 
Republic from myth into reality led to an almost equally rapid 
movement of previous national leaders now living and working in 
Groznyy to the periphery of political life. Groznyy is today an 
ever more alien center, the capital of a different republic, and 
the Ingush intelligentsia of Groznyy have correspondingly less 
and less influence on the public opinion of the Nazran Ingush. 
  According to the Ingush Constitution, all heads of 
administration, from top to bottom, rayon to village, are 
appointed by the president. Here too Aushev has been actively 
replacing leaders, preferring to appoint people who are at least 
"his own"--tested and reliable, if not from among local 
residents. 
  It cannot be said that replacement of the entire political 
and economic elite has been effected without any pain. Protests, 
complaints, and petitions requesting that the former leader be 
restored have assumed such a large scale that Aushev was forced 
to respond to them with the military straightforwardness that is 
characteristic of him. He issued a special edict warning of 
accountability for attempts to intercede on behalf of "notorious 
criminals." 
<H5>  The Hotel and OMON </H5>
  All the same, neither the decision on Vladikavkaz nor the 
landslide flow of resignations has managed yet to temper the 
people's love for the president. He and his team remain 
completely effective. Changes made over the past year are even 
evident to the eye. Eternally dirty, ragged Nazran has quietly 
become cleaner and tidier, especially in its center. 
  For the first time in the entire history of the Ingush, a 
hotel has appeared. This is no trifling matter, but rather a 
significant political act. Up until now, officials visiting the 
Ingush Republic were forced to stay over in Vladikavkaz. It is 
even more significant that state structures have begun buying up 
weapons from the populace. 
  It is in fact a buy-up that is taking place and not a 
confiscation--which would be entirely unrealistic. In other 
words, actual efforts as stipulated by agreement with Northern 
Ossetia with respect to disarmament and disbandment of unlawful 
armed formations are underway. 
  In addition, Aushev has managed to reduce criminal tension 
in 
the republic. It is being done with difficulty, in a far from 
faultless process at present, but the activity of OMON [Special 
Missions Militia Detachment], the police, and the courts is 
being set on track. In this sense, the absence of roots in local 
tradition by the Aushev team works for the good. 
  A state of emergency was maintained in the village of 
Troitskaya and OMON detachments stationed here by presidential 
edict for half a year. The OMON people are now gone, and the 
order which was restored is still generally present. 
  Troitskaya is that very village from which the mass exodus 
of 
Russians began following the sadly well known pogrom of the 
spring of 1991. At the outset of 1991, 90 percent of the village 
population was Russian (mainly the descendants of Terek 
Cossacks). Today 11 percent of the populace is Russian. I 
travelled to Troitskaya immediately following the pogrom and 
again last year, and I can attest that local authorities not 
only did not force the Russians out--they tried in every way 
possible to halt their departure. 
  But people continued to leave, frightened by the growth of 
banditry and crime against which they found themselves 
defenseless. (The Ingush also suffered from the ineffectiveness 
of law enforcement organs, but they very quickly engaged a 
system of familial and clan self-defense, while the Russians 
simply found themselves victimized by the hooligan lawlessness.) 
  Now that protection is at least in some way restored, it 
would seem that there is no longer any reason to leave. However, 
the change in demographic interrelationship has already been so 
strong that in itself it seems to provoke resettlement. People 
accustomed all their lives to living in one cultural milieu 
found themselves in an entirely different world literally in the 
space of two years. 
  Although relations with neighbors are good, as a rule, many 
of those who remain talk about the fact that they would like to 
move to where their relatives are. To the credit of the Aushev 
team on the highest and on local levels, leaderships understand 
full well that any and all measures must be taken to preserve 
the Russian community. 
  First of all, all political speculation regarding oppression 
by Russians is undesirable for Ingushetia in its present 
state--after all, it is to the Russian authorities that the 
Aushev leadership is looking to obtain measures on refugee 
resettlement, and in the long term--measures to effect the 
rejurisdiction of Prigorodnyy Rayon. 
  Secondly, there is simply the existence of national 
specialization. Who is going to work on a pig farm without 
Russians? Indeed, like doctors and teachers, Russian 
agricultural specialists are presently irreplaceable. 
  In order to sustain the Russian community, it is necessary 
to 
augment it. Serious negotiations are underway and a delegation 
is being sent to Krasnodar Kray, to those who recently 
resettled. Aushev is proposing certain benefits for "returnees." 
At present just a few people have returned to Troitskaya--13 
families in all. But the process is in fact underway. 
  Of course, the refugee problem remains one of the main 
obstacles on this path. Conversation arises now and again: "Why 
must we go around persuading departed Russians to return when we 
have 60,000 people we do not know what to do with?" But official 
ideology and the mood of society are oriented on the idea that 
the refugees must be settled back to their origins immediately. 
<H5>  Attacks Coming Not From Neighbors, but From Bandits </H5>
  To what degree are these hopes realistic? The Ossetian 
leadership is trying in every possible way to impede the return 
of Ingush refugees. However, some have returned in defiance of 
threats and prohibitions. 
  Those with whom we managed to speak explain that their 
arrival has not elicited any "spontaneous protest" on the part 
of neighboring Ossetians. The danger confronting the Ingush 
comes from quite a different direction--at night, at any moment, 
armed people in speckled uniforms may appear (who knows whether 
they are OMON or Ossetian, the Guard--now renamed the 
Directorate for Defense of Economic Facilities, or simply 
bandits?) and begin firing at windows, setting fires, and 
raiding. 
  Russian forces, of which there are 30,000 in the state of 
emergency zone, are in no position to protect residents from the 
bandits. In the view of the Ingush, they appear to manifest a 
rare helplessness. 
  According to prescribed procedures, Ingush refugees who want 
to take a look at their home or take something from among their 
things which has miraculously remained intact must provide a 
statement of their intent beforehand, wait in line, and then 
move to the village in question in organized column formation, 
accompanied by Russian military personnel. 
  But often the column is attacked and forced to return, 
sometimes assaulted and pelted with rocks. Under these 
conditions, soldiers not only fail to fire warning shots into 
the air--they also do not use gas, water, or whatever is 
available to put a halt to the hooliganism. 
  So what are the Ingush counting on, since the Russian 
protective force is not working, or at least is not working in 
their favor? From all appearances they are counting on a change 
in the aims and sentiment of Russian leaders--from 
"pro-Ossetian" to "pro-Ingush." 
  Judging from the recent session of the Federation Council, 
certain shifts are taking place in this direction, although not 
as rapidly as Aushev would like. The drama lies in the fact that 
the refugees must at least begin to resettle immediately.

<F P=106> [Article by Olga Vasilyeva: "One Way Out: An Ingush Enclave"] </F>
  [Text] Despite the state of emergency existing in the zone 
of conflict, a "quiet war" continues between the Ossetians and 
Ingush. According to data from the Russian Ministry of Internal 
Affairs, from December 1992 through January 1994, 167 homes of 
Ingush and 107 of Ossetians were blown up, and more than 100 
people were killed. Arms purchases and attacks on military 
facilities continue. Many times the situation has been on the 
verge of renewed armed clashes due to a failure to provide 
accommodations for refugees in Ingushetia and Northern Ossetia. 
  Both sides continue to preserve their paramilitary 
formations--"officially" in Northern Ossetia and "unofficially" 
in Ingushetia. The leadership of Northern Ossetia explains its 
refusal to disarm the republic guard (presently termed "units 
for safeguarding economic facilities") by virtue of the absence 
of borders with Chechnya and attacks on economic facilities by 
armed individuals from Chechnya. 
  Sergey Shakhray, chairman of the State Committee on 
Nationalities and Regional Policy Affairs, noted that until such 
time as the sides engage in constructive negotiations, "Russia 
is financing the conflict." We should add that in 1993, R100 
billion from the federal budget was appropriated to finance 
accommodations for refugees, and R23 billion--for upkeep of the 
provisional administration. 
  The positions espoused by the parties have not undergone any 
special change. The Ingush side has not abandoned the idea of 
the return of Prigorodnyy Rayon--Article 1 of the Constitution 
of Ingushetia, approved 27 February 1994, states that it is the 
objective of the state to effect the return by political methods 
of illegally seized lands. As before, the Ossetian side believes 
that the status of Prigorodnyy Rayon within Northern Ossetia 
must be consolidated in order to resolve the conflict, and 
following this must come the demarcation of Ingush borders. The 
North Ossetian leadership is insisting on the need for a 
political assessment of the events of 1992 and on holding the 
initiators of the conflict accountable. An agreement was reached 
at the latest bilateral talks of 2-3 April on the return of 
Ingush refugees to four villages: Chermen, Dangaron, Dachnoye, 
and Kurtat in Prigorodnyy Rayon, as required by the Russian 
Federation presidential edict of 13 December 1993. However, 
Northern Ossetia is declaring its readiness to accept only those 
Ingush who "did not participate in the conflict." In this 
regard, in the opinion of the Ossetian side, resolution of this 
issue should be comprehensive, i.e., should take into account 
the problems of 47,000 Ossetian refugees from Georgia and 
consideration of the opinion of the rural (Ossetian) population 
that remains in Prigorodnyy Rayon. From all appearances, the 
leadership of Northern Ossetia intends to torpedo resolution of 
the problem of returning Ingush refugees to their homes. This is 
seen by the slogan advanced one year ago of the "impossibility 
of joint habitation" of Ossetians and Ingush. 
  The Ingush side, in turn, supports the introduction of 
federal rule as the only measure capable of resolving the 
problem of phased return of the Ingush to Prigorodnyy Rayon. 
  Most representatives of federal structures of power also 
consider it necessary to introduce federal rule in the territory 
inhabited by the Ingush in Prigorodnyy Rayon. However, they are 
not raising this issue at trilateral meetings out of fear of 
destabilizing the situation in the region. In addition, the 
legal basis is lacking at present for effecting federal rule in 
the territory of a nation-state formation in the Russian 
Federation. 
  A full settlement of the conflict is impossible at the 
present stage. To stabilize the situation in the zone of the 
Ossetian-Ingush conflict, it would be advisable to drag out the 
question of demarcation of borders of Northern Ossetia and 
Ingushetia, since a "definitive" resolution one way or another 
with respect to borders could aggravate the situation in both 
republics and lead to new armed conflict. 
  It is necessary in the zone of conflict to return to the 
idea 
of creating a "purely Ingush" enclave of villages. Judging from 
the decree adopted by the Northern Ossetia Supreme Soviet on the 
"impossibility of joint habitation of Ossetians and Ingush," the 
Ossetian side supports such a decision. The Ingush side will 
likely come out against it since they are counting on a return 
to the borders of 1944. However, creation of a "purely Ingush" 
enclave of villages in the development of local self-government 
will in time enable resolution of the problem of forming a broad 
autonomy of Ingush in Northern Ossetia and will thus remove the 
question of clashes of the Ingush populace with "Ossetian" 
organs of authority, which was the immediate cause of the 
military operations in 1992. In the future, the "Ingush enclave" 
could fall within a dual jurisdiction--subordinate to Northern 
Ossetia for administrative matters, to Ingushetia for cultural 
affairs. 
  It is necessary that efforts begin in the construction of 
housing and in the return of refugees to control of the federal 
authority. In this regard, the financing of such measures must 
be public and effected directly out of the federal budget. 
Otherwise, it is highly likely that the leadership of Northern 
Ossetia will reject the return of Ingush refugees under pretext 
that the construction was proceeding "at the expense of the 
republic budget" (although the budget of Northern Ossetia in 
1993 was subsidized by the federal budget to the extent of 57 
percent) and that its organs of authority have the right to 
decide which refugees--Ossetians from Georgia or Ingush--are to 
be settled into new homes. 
  The search for a resolution to the conflict must be based on 
bringing the situation and the legal norms regulating it into 
conformance with the general federal laws and Constitution of 
the Russian Federation, not on historical research from various 
points of view. 
  One of the most immediate tasks of the Federal Assembly is 
to 
draw up a legislative base to allow the federal center to 
effectively play the role of arbiter in the event one of the 
sides refuses to seek compromise. In addition, it is necessary 
to develop a legal basis for the interrelationship between the 
center and regions in order to overcome the lack of regulation 
of the activities of local organs of authority on the part of 
the federal center. 
  Periodic hearings in the Federation Council on settlement of 
the Ossetian-Ingush conflict could become an effective mechanism 
of accelerating the procedure for coordinating the positions of 
the sides. This measure would enable the federal center to avoid 
ill-considered decisions in the region, exert pressure on the 
conflicting sides prior to the formulation of general federal 
legislation on conflict resolution, and avoid accusations of 
application of a unilateral approach in resolving the crisis.

<H5>  Oh, Those Barabinsk Steppes! </H5>
  While waiting for an electric commuter train to pass through 
Kargat, the participants in our experiment were warmly greeted 
in the editorial offices of the newspaper ZA OBILIYE. By evening 
they had reached Barabinsk. 
  We did not do our act in the commuter train to 
Barabinsk--there were only four cars, and very few spectators, 
so we decided to take a nap as we were very tired. We looked at 
the schedule in the station. A man with a week's worth of gray 
beard who had not had a bath for a long time stood next to us 
studying train arrival times. He was carrying a small bundle. We 
went to the second floor where it was warmer and sat down on a 
bench. From our conversation we learned that he was going home 
to Voronezh. That was on our way for the time being. He had 
worked there as a crop farming brigade leader and then his wife 
had died. And, as frequently happens, the man fell on hard times 
and started roaming around the country. He had worked all his 
life as a tractor driver. Out of loneliness last year he took in 
a tramp. 
  "He lived with me for a half year, we ate from the same 
plate, but the son of a bitch deceived me," the man sighed. "He 
set me up to go to Altay to join a brigade of tractor operators. 
He promised mountains of gold. Fool that I am, I dropped 
everything and went. But when we got there he said: Wait just a 
minute, I will be right back. I waited for an hour, then another 
hour, but he had just taken off." 
  Now he was without money and trying to hitch a ride on the 
rails. He was not allowed on the train, you have to pay to get 
into the train station in Novosibirsk; he sat down on the 
bundle, but no--on your feet, old man! The militia made him 
stand up, you cannot sit on the floor. 
  "When you were in Novosibirsk, did you go to the emergency 
social aid center, where they will give you money and food, at 
19 Sverdlov Street?" 
  "I was there on Sverdlov, I could barely find it. I had not 
eaten for three days, and they did not help me at all..." 
  ...In the evening the trains pull in, but an order had been 
given not to take anyone. The guard and militia train brigades 
go through and check to make sure that no bums are on board. In 
the morning there will be an electric commuter train headed for 
Omsk. We will get there somehow--train hopping. A hungry night 
without water lies ahead.... 
<H5>  Is It Possible To Live in Chelyabinsk? </H5>
  After crossing the Siberian expanses we arrived in the 
capital of the Southern Urals--the city of Chelyabinsk. We had 
"heart-to-heart" conversations with the local residents and 
visited the oblast committee on ecology. 
  The first words we heard in response to a request to see the 
reports on the work of the ecology committee were: 
  "Our oblast is off-limits. Therefore we cannot show you the 
figures from the readings. There are newspapers for that and all 
the data are published there, go read them..." 
  We did not try to clarify why figures published in 
newspapers 
could not be shown in the office. In general terms, V.S. 
Smorodintsev, deputy chairman of the committee, characterized 
the situation in the oblast for us as follows: The Southern 
Urals area has been declared an ecological disaster zone. In 
1957 there was a radiation discharge (or more precisely: a 
nuclear explosion at a warehouse for radioactive wastes) at the 
Mayak Plant. 
  As we learned from the local residents, it was at this plant 
that Kurchatov made his bomb, and the plant had been built by 
Beriya on Stalin's personal orders. And then four years after 
the generalissimo's death his mustached shadow covered 
Chelyabinsk, Sverdlovsk, and Kurgan Oblasts with a radioactive 
cloud. 
  Now the situation has stabilized in the Mayak area. The 
plutonium reactors have been shut down and readings are normal. 
But the Techa river and VURS (Eastern Urals Radiation Trace) 
will be dangerous for another 300 years. This is really enough 
to last for our age--and for our children and our grandchildren! 
The area has been surrounded by barbed wire, and taking in 
water, swimming, and grazing livestock have been prohibited. 
  Then the electric locomotive engineer told us that not all 
of 
the villages next to the Techa river had been evacuated, and the 
remaining residents were forced to use the "gifts of the river" 
as usual--the cows drink there, people walk there, children 
swim, people wash clothes and they fish. To be sure, they cut 
the fish's head off in the belief that in fish most of the 
radiation is in the head because it digs into the radioactive 
sand, and the rest--goes into the soup! There is a joke from the 
area of black humor about the local fish soup: Three fishermen 
were cooking fish soup on the Techa river, they were eating the 
soup with their vodka. Two of them drank the vodka, but one of 
them did not drink any, and died. (As we know, alcohol helps 
eliminate certain radionuclides.) 
  The plant's reactors were shut down, but in the settling 
tanks were 300 million cubic meters of radioactive water. And 
what if the dam were to break? It would be worse than Chernobyl. 
But the most terrifying thing is the zone of the plant. One 
recalls the Strugatskiy brothers' "Stalker." True, there was no 
radiation in the "zone" in the novel, but in the sanitary 
exclusion zone of Mayak there are more than 500,000 tonnes of 
radioactive waste. Now they have begun to "bake" it into glass, 
to weld it shut in steel containers and pour concrete over it. 
The danger has diminished. 
  Besides, we learned from newspapers in Novosibirsk about 100 
tonnes of some kind of waste that were delivered to Chelyabinsk 
from abroad. It costs a lot to destroy waste there, and here it 
is almost free of charge, one-third of the cost, and so the 
waste is brought here. It turned out that the waste arrived in 
Russia in the form of...humanitarian assistance for deaf mutes! 
This is what happened. One resourceful trading company got word 
of some yarn waste--synthetic fiber, dust, short thread, down, 
and other filth from which even the thrifty Germans could not 
extract anything else--accumulating at a certain enterprise in 
Germany. Having collected Deutsche marks from the Germans for 
disposing of their waste, the crafty traders arranged for free 
delivery of the yarn waste to two cooperatives of deaf mutes in 
Orekhovo-Zuyevo and Chelyabinsk. They said that the deaf mutes 
could produce filaments and sweaters, without the need to pay 
for raw materials! They would buy Snickers bars and Barbie dolls 
for their children. The deaf mutes rejoiced; they received 
railcar-loads of such filth that even ropes could not be woven 
of it--even if one really wanted to hang oneself. In 
Orekhovo-Zuyevo they tried to burn this "cotton wool." However, 
it burns poorly, stinks, and gives off harmful gases into the 
bargain. It is now hard to figure out where to dump the 
"presents." 
<H5>  Panikovskiy Was Right! </H5>
  Anatoliy Nikolayevich! We tried to send information by fax: 
There are hardly any newspapers, and no faxes. We decided to 
write letters after all, following Father Fedor's example. 
  In Ufa the Bashkir mistook Aleksandr Salostiy for an insane 
mullah who had abandoned his mosque to work electric commuter 
trains. They yelled at him: Go to work, go back to your mosque! 
  We were travelling to the Volga area, to the parts M.S. 
Panikovskiy rejected when the country was being carved up into 
the protectorates of Lieutenant Shmidt's children. Panikovskiy 
was right! Money is extremely scarce, and the people are drunk. 
  There were no electric commuter trains. We traveled in a 
large-compartment car across the Ukrainian border at night. 
There was a drunken brawl in the car which ended with a bottle 
of vodka being smashed on someone's head. Gypsies stole our 
sugar and bread. At night, customs officers came and inspected 
the luggage. An accordion and an immersion heater were 
extracted. Everything was thrown back in. That was the end of 
the inspection. 
  In Kharkov we did not have Ukrobucks. The rate was 20-22 
karbovantsy to one ruble. Prices went into tens and hundreds of 
thousands of karbovantsy. 
  We began experiment No. 2. We traveled across Ukraine 
without 
money; we made Ukrobucks--stacks upon stacks of scrap paper, 
mounds of money! Ukrobucks are a distinguished currency (that 
is, distinguished from the others). The response to our shows 
was excellent, the applause was thunderous, far merrier than in 
Russia. 
  Finally we arrived in Odessa. We were there on 30 and 31 
March and 1 and 2 April. There is no humor in Odessa. The 
Festival of Humor was canceled. A ticket to a Zhvanetskiy show 
cost 500,000 karbovantsy (for comparison: The salary of an 
Odessa journalist from the newspaper PORTO-FRANKO was 300,000 
karbovantsy). The Festival of Humor occurred in the form of the 
drunken loafing of costumed citizens of Odessa along 
Deribasovskaya Street. They stole wallets and put a pioneer tie 
on the Duke. Following the "Festival of Humor," Salostiy went 
for a historic swim in the Black Sea, upon finding a relatively 
clean spot. In general the shore is stained with fuel oil; there 
is trash, dirt, and dumps. The decaying architectural monuments 
were all that remained of the erstwhile fame of Odessa.... 
  We were late! We were traveling the route of Venedikt 
Yereofeyev, Moscow-Petushki. Just like in the book, the people 
in the car were drunk. In Petushki everybody was drunk, even the 
militia! We headed for Nizhniy Novgorod to take part in the 
conference of the Social-Ecological Union. 
  ...To the sound of loud and prolonged applause, our 
association, Siberian Bums for Ecology and Survival, was 
admitted to the Social-Ecological Union. 
  Our future route: We will go to an accordion plant in Shuya.

<F P=106> [Article by Yu. Nikitin: "How the Budget Was Replenished: </F>
Oblast Tax Inspectorate Collegium Summarizes 1993 Work"] 
  [Text] Today, one can hear from everywhere: "The budget is 
bursting at the seams." There is no money to pay teachers and 
workers in higher schools and health services, culture, sports, 
the militia, and fire fighting. Indeed, where is it to be 
gotten, when there is a sharp slump in the economy, industrial 
enterprises are on the brink of closing down, and there is 
massive unemployment? Under these complicated conditions, the 
fate of the budget depends to a great degree on the successful 
organization of the work of tax organs and the completeness of 
the adoption by them of all of the measures stipulated in 
legislation for the receipt of payments. 
  M.I. Chemodurov, chief of state tax inspection for 
Chelyabinsk Oblast and second rank state tax service adviser, 
noted that inflation processes had an influence on the growth of 
tax revenues in 1993. Simultaneously, the influence of factors 
grew that restrained an increase in budgetary incomes, in 
particular, the growing payment-financial crisis. According to 
estimated data, about R317 billion have accumulated in produced 
but unsold products. The drop in the volume of production, 
temporary stoppage, and sometimes the full closing of production 
determined the budgetary losses for another R260 billion. 
  The lack of tough incentives that prompt enterprises to 
manage effectively and unpredictable changes in the formation of 
prices result in increasing growth rates in product cost with 
respect to sales volume and, as a consequence, profit level is 
lowered. This is about another R50 billion. 
  Besides narrowing the tax formation base, the financial 
crisis is causing high growth in defaults. According to the 
status on 1 January 1994, overall it exceeded R70 billion in the 
oblast, which is almost 40 times more than a year earlier. 
  The situation at the beginning of this year has gotten even 
worse. As a result of the growth in mutual indebtedness of 
enterprises (about R2 trillion), and the expansion of the 
practice of mutual offsets between them, the nonpayments to the 
budget increased sharply, and on 1 February 1994, R95 billion of 
taxes on profits, value added, and resource payments were in 
arrears. This exceeds the January sum of revenues for calculated 
taxes by almost nine percent, and the gap in Magnitogorsk 
amounts to a factor of 3.2.... 
  Nevertheless, last year the oblast tax organs transferred 
R1.23 trillion to the budget and off-budget funds, which is 7.6 
times more than a year ago, and R751 billion were collected for 
the needs of the oblast. The indicator in comparison with other 
oblasts of Russia is rather high. One documentary check 
conducted by the inspectorate on the average gives more than 
R5.5 billion of additional income. The most effective were the 
checks in Zlatoust where at one time R23.3 million more was 
added, and in Kopeysk and Trekhgornyy (former Zlatoust-36), 
about R13.5 million. Rural tax inspectors in a check declared 
more than R6 million additional in Agapovskiy and Argayashskiy 
Rayons. 
  One of the reserves for the replenishment of the budget is 
the tax on persons who are engaged in entrepreneurial activity 
without the formation of a legal entity. Last year, their number 
grew by factor of 2.2, and it was in excess of 29,000 persons. 
It will not be an exaggeration to say that entrepreneurs are not 
the most law abiding payers. For violation of tax legislation, 
3,600 persons were made answerable, and the sum of fines 
amounted to R43 million. An analysis of the results of raids 
conducted at mini-markets and places of unmanaged trade shows 
that only three to four persons out of 10 register as 
entrepreneurs. 
  All of this requires a definite reorientation in the work of 
the service. The first experience of the oblast inspection 
indicates that the creation of a specialized group of workers 
who follow the activity of entrepreneurs could give a high 
return. In the second half of last year, the activity of 40 
young businessmen was checked by a sector numbering only four 
persons, as a result of which R11.7 million more was added to 
the budget. Counter checks of another 22 enterprises added 
another R16 million to the budget. All told in the oblast, 
according to the results of joint actions with the 
Administration of Internal Affairs and the Procuracy, 250 
enterprises were checked, which brought more than a half billion 
rubles of income. 
  Every ninth ruble of revenues, or about R124 billion, was 
the 
share of the tax from physical persons. Under conditions when 
each citizen can work in several places, enterprises and 
organizations frequently forget to submit information on incomes 
paid to physical persons who are not permanent employees. Only 
in 3,000 of the 7,800 who were checked was the person within the 
field of vision of the tax inspectors. The mass of our citizens 
has not gotten into the habit of declaring incomes. 
  Monitoring the implementation of the Law on Monitoring 
Control Cash Registers (KKM) in Conducting Monetary Calculations 
With the Population brought in more than a billion rubles in 
additional payments in several months of last year. According to 
the law, since 1 March 1994, KKM were supposed to be in all 
trade points of the oblast center, and, starting on 1 January 
1995, in the entire oblast. Meanwhile, the naked eye can see 
that the stalls and kiosks and even the large stores in 
Chelyabinsk conduct monetary operations with the people in cash, 
while not using the cash registers. 
  However, how is it possible to complain about the ordinary 
taxpayer, if the workers of inspectorates themselves do not 
succeed in understanding the numerous changes, refined points of 
the edicts of the president, instructions, and other documents 
of the government? The collegium appealed once again to the 
managers of the central organs with a proposal to simplify the 
system of taxation, to make it stable, easy to understand, and 
efficient, and one that promotes the development of production.

<F P=106> [Interview with Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, president of the </F>
Republic of Kalmykia, by Yelena Dikun; place and date not given: 
"Initiative; Ilyumzhinov Is on Top Once Again"] 
  [Text] On Tuesday the Kalmykia Constitutional 
Assembly supported the initiative of Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, 
republic president, who replaced the present constitution of 
Kalmykia with a "great steppe code." The "code" recognizes the 
indissolubility of the relations of Kalmyks with Russia, the 
impossibility of the republic's secession from the Federation, 
and a single citizenship of the Russian Federation; that is, it 
disavows the previously claimed state sovereignty of the 
republic. What compelled Ilyumzhinov to surrender to Moscow the 
dearest gain of the former Soviet autonomies? 
  [Ilyumzhinov] I did not surrender any kind of sovereignty. 
In 
fact, we did have semisovereignty, a condition in which it is 
impossible to stay very long. It is equivalent to being half 
pregnant or half hanged. There are only two solutions here: 
either full independence, separation from Russia in the Chechen 
or Tatar variant, or the opposite, unification. After analyzing 
the situation, I preferred the second scenario, because under 
conditions when everything is falling apart, we will not 
extricate ourselves by ourselves. For the sake of preserving 
Russia, and its unity and indivisibility, we are taking a step 
not away from the center, but toward the center. 
  [Dikun] It is being said that the laurels of "gatherer of 
Russia" are enticing you... 
  [Ilyumzhinov] I have no such ambitious designs--to go down 
in 
history. This is a course that is dictated by life itself... I 
am frequently asked, why did you go with a white flag to the 
White House during the days of the October events? Was it really 
in order to save Rutskoy's little suitcases, or to resolve some 
of my own affairs? I behaved then not as the president or a 
politician, but as an honest man: When two brothers are 
fighting, it is necessary first of all to stop the bloodshed. 
And my behavior today, once again, is not a political act, but 
the step of a normal manager who should call things by their 
names. Many run to the Kremlin now, and they swear: They say, we 
are with you, we are for a "united and indivisible" Russia, but, 
as a matter of fact, they are breaking away from it. But I 
declare openly that we cannot live outside of Russia. 
  As for the rumors that allegedly I intend to reduce Kalmykia 
to the rank of a province, they have nothing in common with 
reality. I emphasize, I am not changing the state structure; on 
the contrary, this would denote an encroachment on the Russian 
Constitution. As before, Kalmykia will remain a republic with 
all of the pertinent attributes, with its own president and its 
own national khural [parliament]. 
  [Dikun] You, evidently, know that there is also another 
version that explains your behavior. The MVD [Ministry of 
Internal Affairs] and the FCS [Federal Counterintelligence 
Service] allegedly have compromising material on you that they 
did not circulate as long as you were loyal to the Kremlin, but 
all it would take would be for you to desert to the side of the 
opposition, for them to threaten you: Either sacrifice 
sovereignty, or we will institute a criminal case. 
  [Ilyumzhinov] I am completely fed up with all of this talk 
about the shady origin of my capital. The appropriate services 
checked me out numerous times, when I was running for national 
deputy of Russia, and when I ran for president--and nothing was 
found. And think about it yourself, how can the Kremlin pressure 
a republic! This is unrealistic, and even not in the interests 
of the Kremlin. Incidentally, even after the October events, I 
did not sense any kind of pressure on me on the part of Moscow. 
  [Dikun] Do you want to say that the attitude of the Moscow 
authorities toward you has not changed even a little since 
October? 
  [Ilyumzhinov] Not entirely so. Previously in the Kremlin, I 
was, as the saying goes, on a white horse. And even the first 
person who eliminated Soviet authority! But after the October 
events, a certain coolness emerged in relations, and 
misunderstanding: They said, Kirsan betrayed us, deserted us. 
But, after all, I never belonged to anyone's team, I always made 
my own policy, that which I consider necessary for my own people. 
  [Dikun] Meanwhile, many interpreted your latest initiative 
as 
national betrayal. The opposition, with which you assured you 
are completely finished, has once again raised its head. A 
committee for the protection of the constitution and the state 
was organized, and it is demanding from you that you reject your 
intentions. 
  [Ilyumzhinov] In fact, there is no opposition, it is simply 
a 
handful of people who always come out against everything. In the 
main, these are former communists and ex-deputies of the 
dissolved parliament who want to get into power at any price. 
The so-called parties and movements are not registered anywhere, 
just like the committee that they organized. I met with its 
representatives at one time, and I understood that it was a 
futile matter. They only want to kick up a row. 
  We took a public opinion poll that showed that 74 percent of 
the population supports my initiative, 61 percent of the Kalmyks 
are "for." For the most part, it does not matter to the 
people--Russians, Kalmyks, Tatars, Jews--under what constitution 
and under what citizenship they live. The main thing is that 
they have a good wage and filled stores. 
  [Dikun] Thus, perhaps, this explains everything? Inasmuch as 
the transition from socialism to capitalism is proceeding in the 
republic with a squeak, do you expect to exchange sovereignty 
for Moscow subsidies? 
  [Ilyumzhinov] If it was a question of money, I would not 
undertake all of this. When primary emphasis is placed on 
mercantile interest, this does not lead to anything good. 
  [Dikun] It is known that your colleague presidents have 
interpreted your step, to put it mildly, without particular 
enthusiasm. 
  [Ilyumzhinov] Actually, they treated it with caution. Some 
of 
the regional leaders even began to say that I betrayed someone 
and something. I considered myself one of the leaders of the 
regional movement, and I came out with the initiative to 
establish a Council of Components of the Russian Federation. 
Moreover, I was elected its cochairman. And I was treated 
accordingly. But, after all, I remained the very same "regional 
supporter," and I think that Russia is not restricted to the 
walls of the White House and the red Kremlin. 
  I will not hide the fact that I was even happy, when I heard 
on television the statement of the Russian Federation 
president's press service of his negative evaluation of my 
initiative. This somehow rehabilitated me in the eyes of 
colleagues. And they indeed began to call me up from the 
republics: They said, we thought that you were playing some kind 
of a clever game behind our backs with Yeltsin, but you, it 
turns out, are not welcome there. 
  The other day, I was in the Kremlin, and I talked for a very 
long time with Vyacheslav Kostikov, the president's press 
secretary. It became clear that I was not understood quite 
correctly there, and they decided that I, in a unilateral order, 
without discussions with Moscow, decided "to abolish the 
republic." But inasmuch as, I repeat, we do not intend to 
"abolish" the republic, then the Kremlin also has no complaints 
against me.

<F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Bespalov (Rostov Oblast): "Taganrog Will </F>
Be Russia's Main Maritime Portal to the South"] 
  [Text] Contrary to the forecasts of many skeptics and 
in spite of the absence of a legislative base and other 
difficulties, the city of Taganrog is methodically and 
persistently laying the foundation for a free economic zone. 
  The idea was conceived and took shape two or three years 
ago. 
Its main advocate, Mayor Sergey Shilo, and his associates insist 
that Taganrog's geopolitical position is certain to give it new 
roles to play. The former southern ports of the 
USSR--Ilyichevsk, Odessa, Nikolayev, Sevastopol, and Kerch--are 
now part of Ukraine, and Russia's remaining ports of Tuapse and 
Novorossiysk are overloaded beyond measure. 
  Officials in Taganrog studied the experience of existing 
free 
economic zones in different countries--from the United States to 
China. An English firm ordered an investigation of the 
possibility of establishing a free economic zone in Taganrog. A 
year later the idea had taken the form of a package of solid 
proposals and projects. The concept of a free economic zone in 
Taganrog won the approval of the higher economic council of the 
Russian Supreme Soviet Presidium. It appeared that it would also 
acquire legal status at any time. 
  Regrettably, that time never came. There is still no law on 
free economic zones, and the zone's promoters in Taganrog do not 
have enough influence to "score" the status of a free economic 
zone by means of a presidential edict. Furthermore, they are not 
that eager to start any intrigues or to rely only on one 
top-level signature. 
  "In the final analysis," Sergey Shilo said, "the free 
economic zone is not our final goal, but only the direction we 
have to take for the maximum use of all of Taganrog's advantages 
and potential for the good of its inhabitants and all of Russia." 
  That is why Taganrog officials decided to begin laying the 
foundation for the future zone piece by piece. 
  Are there any signs of the imposing future changes today? 
Fifteen ships from distant foreign lands are being unloaded in 
the port at this time. Just recently, however, Taganrog was 
chock-full of defense enterprises and was off limits to 
foreigners. Two military runways have been converted for 
civilian use. Soon regular flights to St. Petersburg, Bulgaria, 
and Turkey will be added to the Moscow run. These were the first 
steps that were taken by the joint-stock company that hopes to 
build an international airport in Taganrog. The construction of 
a new business center has begun in the old part of the city. 
There will be at least five such centers, with hotels, 
restaurants, convention halls, banking establishments, and 
everything necessary for business contacts and the work of 
businessmen, in the Taganrog free economic zone. 
  And what about the new port? This key element of the plans 
for the free economic zone has aroused the interest of many 
local enterprises and firms. It is not surprising that several 
competing groups have come up with completely different project 
plans. 
  They say that competition generates progress, but I am 
afraid 
that the competition between different groups over the port will 
hold up the project. In any case, the exact location of the new 
port (or system of ports, according to one plan) is still 
unknown. Furthermore, investments are also lacking. After all, 
the English firm which was given a chance to design and build 
the new port in Taganrog estimates that it will cost around 4 
billion dollars and take at least eight years. Obviously, 
investors need complete certainty and confidence before they can 
consider investing such large amounts for such a long period of 
time. 
  And will these investors even materialize, in view of the 
fact that the status of a free economic zone for Taganrog is 
still indefinite? Mikhail Ionov, the chairman of the municipal 
administration's committee for the development of long-range 
planning and foreign economic contacts, promises that they will. 
Major Russian exporters have expressed an interest in the city, 
and so have the states of the Transcaucasus and Central Asia, 
which see the Taganrog transport hub as a means of access to 
Europe and to large Western firms. Of course, the legal status 
of a free economic zone would do much to accelerate the 
attraction of big capital to Taganrog. 
  Everyone in Taganrog has heard about the free economic zone 
and, predictably, few understand the implications of the 
attainment of this goal for the city and its population. 
Nevertheless, the skeptical wisecracks about the project are 
giving way to sincere interest. In any case, provincial Taganrog 
has never been as close to realizing the dream of its founder, 
Peter I, who wanted it to be Russia's main maritime portal to 
the south.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Kislov (Republic of Mordvinia): </F>
"People in Moscow Are Talking About the New Russia, but People 
in Mordvinia Are Restoring the Soviet Regime"] 
  [Text] The Presidium of the Mordvinian Supreme Soviet 
has decided to revive Soviet power in its cities and rayons. A 
provisional statute on so-called local deputy conventions has 
been approved. These conventions, consisting of at least 25 
former people's deputies, have been endowed with the same powers 
as the local soviets that were abolished by Presidential Edict 
No 1617. Now we can expect the Republic of Mordvinia to become 
part of the "red belt" around Moscow. 
  The republic Supreme Soviet, which survived the events of 
last October, used its prerogative to frame the republic 
constitution to acquire unprecedented power and to strike a blow 
at President Yeltsin's edict. Incidentally, this is not the 
first time the Mordvinian members of parliament, headed by 
Nikolay Biryukov, have thumbed their noses at the federal 
government. The readers of IZVESTIYA will recall when the 
Supreme Soviet abolished the office of republic president, 
rescinding the will of the people, who had elected democrat 
Vasiliy Guslyannikov to this office. After some minor 
altercations with the obstinate Mordvinian people's deputies, 
the Yeltsin administration "gave up" Guslyannikov and thereby 
encouraged Biryukov to continue his audacious behavior. 
  One of the ideologists of neo-Sovietism, Professor Viktor 
Veshnyakov, who is now a State Duma deputy representing 
Zhirinovskiy's party, declared during a recent visit to 
Mordvinia that the representative branch of government in the 
republic should be the supreme and sole authority. This idea was 
echoed in different keys by Sergey Baburin and Vladimir Isakov, 
who also visited Mordvinia at the height of the Soviet's 
confrontation with the local and federal presidents. To be fair, 
we have to admit that many government officials representing the 
president also came to Saransk. There was the recent landing 
party, for example, at the time of the turbulent Supreme Soviet 
session deciding the future structure of the republic 
government. Saransk was then visited by Sergey Filatov, the 
president's administration chief, and Yuriy Yarov, deputy 
chairman of the government. Understandably, they did not approve 
of the Supreme Soviet's claims to supremacy, justifiably citing 
the federal constitution. They promised the tormented government 
of Valeriy Shvetsov, the fourth of this convocation, that Moscow 
officials would take political action in the event of 
undesirable developments. 
  Regrettably, the winter session of the Supreme Soviet wiped 
out the powers of the executive branch, subordinating it 
completely to the representative branch and burying all hope of 
restoring the status quo of the Russian Constitution by 
parliamentary means. There was no reaction from Moscow, although 
Article 72 of the federal Basic Law stipulates that one of the 
areas under the joint jurisdiction of the Russian Federation and 
its members is the "establishment of common principles of the 
organization of government agencies and local self-rule." 
  Now the Mordvinian members of parliament have gone even 
further. A day before the deadline for the registration of 
candidates for the State Assembly that was supposed to replace 
the Supreme Soviet, they suddenly cancelled the election 
scheduled for 5 June and rescheduled it for 27 November. They 
also issued a resolution which effectively restored the Soviet 
regime throughout the republic. All that was left was the 
trivial act of raising the red flag over the Palace of Soviets. 
  The Council of Ministers is still resisting, but these 
forces 
are clearly unequal. The republic Constitutional Court could 
have acted as the arbiter, but it was abolished by the Supreme 
Soviet a couple of months ago for its autonomous behavior. 
According to Shvetsov and Valentin Konakov, the president's 
representative in the republic, it is time for the federal 
government to finally keep its promise. Otherwise, the "red 
noose" around Moscow will be pulled even tighter.

<F P=106> [Article by Ye. Frantseva under the heading "Politics": "New </F>
Movement Presses for Urals Revitalization"] 
  [Text] No members of the media were invited to the charter 
meeting of a social movement called "South Ural" [Yuzhnyy Ural]. 
However, the media were invited to the second meeting, held this 
past Saturday. In the intervening period the movement changed 
its name from a neutral one to one that is clearly more 
politicized: "For Revitalization of the Urals" [Za vozrozhdeniy 
Urala]. And even though in the program adopted at the first 
meeting and in all the movement's program points distributed to 
journalists at the second meeting the movement is always 
referred to as a social movement, nevertheless P. Sumin, its 
leader, and other speakers referred to it as both social and 
political. That appears to be closer to the truth. 
  Movement activists gave a political assessment of the 
reasons 
for the current situation in the oblast: "overly ambitious 
policies by the executive branch in the oblast center and 
locally that give little consideration to consequences...", "the 
authorities have little control over the situation at the local 
level and are not complying with laws, edicts and decrees..." 
  Among the objectives announced were opposition to any 
attempts to restrict the power of the people, support for 
domestic producers, efforts to increase the oblast's economic 
and administrative independence, and social justice. 
  Also presented at the meeting were the members of the 
movement's council, who fairly eloquently characterize this new 
association, which has aspirations of becoming a mass movement. 
In addition to P. Sumin, the head of the council, the other 
members will be: V. Utkin, State Duma deputy; jurist A. 
Salomatkin, former oblast soviet deputy chairman; D. Peters, 
former chief of Bredinskiy Rayon Administration; Professor V. 
Belkin, doctor of economic sciences; Professor G. Khashimov, 
dean of the Chelyabinsk State University Law Department; leaders 
of oblast communist organizations and the Working Chelyabinsk 
[Trudovoy Chelyabinsk] movement -- V. Buravlev, P. Svechnikov, 
V. Skachinskiy, V. Usanov and Yu. Kholshchigin -- and others. 
  At this meeting the leaders preferred not to discuss the 
movement's actual activities, which will soon be tied in with 
the election campaign, merely informing their supporters of the 
address and phone number of their headquarters and directing 
them to contact it for information. For the next meeting their 
are plans to present a list of candidates both for the 
Federation Council and the oblast Duma who will have the new 
movement's support.

<F P=106> [Article by L. Filipovich, reporting from Yekaterinburg </F>
under the heading "Meetings": "They Take Away One Life After 
Another" 
  [Text] The number of murders in the oblast has increased by 
a factor of more than 2.5 over the past five years, and in 
Yekaterinburg there has been a threefold increase. This was 
discussed at a meeting of oblast law enforcement agencies. 
  In 1992 the oblast reported 898 homicides (an increase of 
54.6 percent over the previous year). In 1993 there were 1,097 
homicides in the oblast, 319 of them in Yekaterinburg. In the 
oblast capital more than 30 murders were committed with firearms 
(rifles and sawed-off shotguns), and in 61 cases the 
perpetrators attempted to conceal their actions by dismembering 
and concealing the bodies. The circumstances under which more 
than 20 murders occurred indicate that they were contract 
killings, i.e. carried out by professionals. 
  The oblast's murder conviction rate is on a par with the 
Russia-wide average, but in 1992 there were 160 unsolved 
murders, and 248 last year. Analysis and investigative practices 
connected with these personal crimes, the most serious and most 
threatening to society, were the focus of attention at a joint 
meeting of law enforcement agencies held at the oblast 
procuracy. Those attending included Ivan Ovcharuk, oblast court 
chairman, Vladislav Tuykov, oblast procurator, Vladimir Demin, 
head of the oblast Internal Affairs Administration, and Gennadiy 
Voronov, head of the oblast branch of the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service. 
  The personnel issue seems to be particularly acute. There is 
constant turnover among investigators, with the professional 
core eroding away. Currently, of the 153 investigators working 
for the procuracy one in three has been on the job less than a 
year. The situation is no better among personnel in the oblast's 
criminal investigation division, either; there 45 percent of 
personnel have no training for the job they are doing. 
Meanwhile, the operational situation over the past two months of 
this year has been a difficult one, with 190 reported murder 
cases, or 20 more than in the same period last year. 
  All these conclusions convincingly attest to the need to 
establish specialized units to investigate murder cases, and the 
government of the Russian Federation should adopt decisions 
toward that end.

<F P=106> [Article by B. Berzin, chairman of the Sverdlovsk Oblast </F>
Government Committee for Relations with Public Organizations and 
the Study of Public Opinion: "Poll: Which Way Will the Voters 
Lean?"] 
  [Text] On 3-5 February the oblast government's Committee 
for Relations with Public Organizations and the Study of Public 
Opinion conducted an express poll of voters. The objective was 
to reveal changes in the correlation of political forces that 
have occurred since elections to the Russian Federation Federal 
Assembly and to examine the overall situation in nine population 
centers in the Central Urals. Participating in the poll were 904 
people, selected to be representative in terms of sex, age, 
educational level, social status, type of urban area and 
geographical location. The poll's margin for error is three 
percent. 
  For the past five years the public's social and 
psychological 
feelings and attitudes toward the changes taking place have been 
conducted on a regular basis. During that period there has been 
a drop in the number of people who are confirmed supporters of 
radical economic reforms. Whereas in 1991 50 percent of those 
surveyed supported such reforms, 27 percent were convinced of 
the need for partial changes and only nine percent deemed it 
possible to leave things as they were, in 1992, just three 
months after the start of reforms, 19 percent of respondents 
said that new opportunities were opening up for them, while 28 
percent were ready to go back to the way things were before. 
  As of February 1994 the situation has to a certainly extent 
stabilized for the time being, with a substantial number of 
people -- 44 percent -- of the opinion that although they 
personally have not gotten anything out of the reforms, they are 
in fact essential to Russia. However, in comparison to 1992 
there has been a decrease by a factor of three in the number of 
respondents who feel that new opportunities have opened up to 
them as a result of the economic changes, currently at six 
percent. Today 33 percent feel that it would have been better 
not to undertake reforms. 
  The adolescent type of emotional reactions so typical of the 
mass mentality of Russia's people is also evidenced in the 
correlation of political forces prior to elections to the oblast 
duma and local governmental bodies. There has been an increase 
in the number of voters who are willing as a sign of protest (or 
perhaps in order to draw attention to their needs) to vote for 
political parties and movements opposed to the president and the 
government of the Russian Federation. 
  Survey data indicate that for many people that protest is a 
subconscious reaction to the events occurring in their lives and 
does not indicate an increase in the number of confirmed 
opponents of radical economic reform in our oblast. On the other 
hand, it is precisely at the level of the common, mass mentality 
that the prerequisites for the creation of a social base for 
emerging parties and social movements are created. 
  According to the survey data, prior to the start of the 
active electoral campaign the public's pre-election sentiments 
are as follows. 
  Of those surveyed, 25 percent are prepared to vote in the 
upcoming elections for parties that favor radical economic 
change (Russia's Choice, Democratic Russia, the RDDR, etc.). In 
the December 1993 elections those groups won 23 percent of the 
vote. 
  There are 23 percent prepared to support opposition forces, 
which received 10 percent of the vote in the last election. This 
includes the LDPR -- Zhirinovskiy's party -- with the support of 
10 percent of voters (formerly 7.6 percent), parties of a 
communist or socialist orientation, with 10 percent (formerly 
2.5 percent) and the patriotic and nationalist movements, with 
three percent. 
  This is the first time in recent years that an increase in 
the popularity of communists and socialists has been observed, 
and though it may be only relative (recall that according to 
poll results in October-November 1993 similar rates of 
increasing popularity held true for Zhirinovskiy's party as 
well) this could indicate emerging trends in the mass 
consciousness of people in Sverdlovsk Oblast. 
  Of those surveyed, 22 percent are thinking about voting for 
parties that hold centrist positions, parties which got nine 
percent of the vote in the December elections. The increase in 
this bloc's popularity is primarily due to the fact that our 
survey included among this group Transformation of the Urals 
[Preobrazheniye Urala], which is headed by E. Rossel, and it 
received the support of a majority of those surveyed. 
  A significant portion of those surveyed -- 19 percent -- are 
planning to vote for independent candidates. 
  Another 13 percent remain undecided. 
  Generally speaking, it is clear that the position of 
Russia's 
Choice is strongest in large cities, with the opposition and 
centrist parties having the most supporters in medium-sized and 
small cities and in rural areas. 
  The voter turnout problem remains serious. Since 1990 voter 
participation has been decreasing by an average of 10-15 percent 
in the interval between each election. Survey data indicate that 
this past trend will continue, with only one in two of those 
surveyed expressing a desire to go to the polls. 
  As in the past, voters in rural areas are more active. By 
way 
of comparison, on 12 December 46 percent of voters in 
Yekaterinburg went to the polls, while 61 percent did so in 
rural areas. Considering this, and also taking into account a 
likely drop in voter turnout among the residents of large 
cities, the position of those living on the outskirts of the 
oblast, in those areas where the standing of those critical of 
the government is better, will be a significant factor in the 
outcome of this election. 
  The poll also examined residents' attitude toward the local 
administration, with 48 percent saying that life in their city 
or rayon is largely defined by the personality of the individual 
who heads the local administration, with that individual's 
effectiveness hampered by the following factors: lack of 
physical resources, lack of budget funding, lack of a clear-cut 
program of action and insufficient knowledge of the public's 
interests. Other reasons cited less frequently: a low level of 
professionalism among those working in the apparatus, and a lack 
of respect for the administration chief. Only one person in 20 
was satisfied with the local administration's actions. 
  The least respect for administrators was found in large 
cities (Yekaterinburg and Nizhniy Tagil). In rural areas and 
small cities the public is more loyal to local administration 
chiefs. 
  Summing up the findings of this latest express poll, one 
should note the increasing alarm of the public in outlying 
areas, trends toward change in the system of political and 
social orientations, and greater social tension among those 
working in agriculture, machine building and mining.

<F P=106> [Article by O. Vlasov under the heading "Law and Order": </F>
"Criminal Economy: Society's Well-Being Is Not Just Up to the 
Department of Economic Crime"] 
  [Text] The fact that economic crimes are constantly 
increasing is clear for all to see. For example, last year the 
oblast reported an increase by a factor of 2.5 in violations of 
regulations governing currency transactions in comparison to the 
previous year, a 33.3 percent increase in bribery cases and a 
4.1 percent increase particularly large-scale embezzlement... 
Personnel with the oblast Internal Affairs Administration's 
Department of Economic Crime [OBEP] calculate total losses from 
economic crimes last year at R483.9 million [rubles]. 
Furthermore, according to studies conducted by the All-Russian 
Ministry of Internal Affairs Scientific Research Institute, 
internal affairs agencies only uncover one economic crime in 
five. The rest, like the bulk of an iceberg, remain hidden. 
  Incidentally, even the cases that have come to light thanks 
to the efforts of law enforcement agencies give one something to 
think about. A tremendous number of crimes are being committed 
in connection with foreign economic activity, privatization and 
the lending and financial system. It is these that we will 
address. 
<H5>  Goods Are Leaving the Oblast, but Where Is the Money From </H5>
Abroad? 
  Were you aware, dear reader, that our oblast has more than 
1,500 entities engaged in foreign economic activity? Among these 
are 327 industrial enterprises, 62 companies established jointly 
with foreign partners, and 530 joint-stock companies of various 
types. As is traditional for Mother Russia, accustomed to 
trading in her most vital riches, 93.6 percent of exports from 
Sverdlovsk Oblast consist of raw materials and other materials 
(we will come back later to the question of where they 
originate). Machinery and equipment account for only 3.6 percent 
of total exports, and services comprise 1.8 percent. Consumer 
goods account for 0.1 percent or, to put it more simply, one 
one-thousandth of total exports. 
  The most interesting thing is that the oblast does not 
receive the proceeds from this newly-emerged business of 
supplying foreign countries with everything they need. Odd, is 
it not? But judge for yourself: with foreign exports worth a 
total amount of R274.5 billion (the equivalent of roughly $429 
million) the Central Urals received foreign products worth R36.5 
billion ($57 million), or just 13.3 percent of what left the 
oblast. 
  And if you think that instead of products we are getting 
money -- the "greenbacks" that attract such universal attention 
in the Russian market --then you will be sadly disappointed. 
Business people are depositing their funds with foreign banks, 
in violation of current licensing procedure. 
  Inspections carried out by the service assigned to combat 
economic crimes uncovered a massive number of violations. 
  For example, law enforcement agencies have determined that 
special export enterprises, taking advantage of the lack of a 
clear-cut oversight system, are able to deal in raw materials 
and strategic materials under regional quotas for oblast social 
programs and are employing the services of middlemen to do so. 
Once the goods cross the border, these special exporters 
conveniently "forget" about their import obligations. 
Accumulating hard-currency funds in their accounts with foreign 
banks and companies, they reap additional unseen profits, and 
you and I wind up with no medicines, food products or other 
items. 
  A curious fact: out of the 290 joint ventures registered in 
Sverdlovsk Oblast that were inspected, there were 110 in which 
the foreign partners had not contributed a single kopeck to 
their authorized capital -- so where is that money "circulating"? 
  Another very interesting fact: seven enterprises (out of 52 
inspected) were found to be keeping $111 million abroad without 
the appropriate license to do so, i.e. illegally. A telling 
detail: if it had not been for the famous agency Interpol, we 
would probably not have discovered these violations. Local law 
enforcement personnel have no hard currency for official trips 
abroad, so there is no investigation. I can only assume that the 
personnel of renowned Interpol are not terribly interesting in 
looking into the tricks and dodges of Russia's nouveau 
riches, either. They have plenty of foreign affairs of 
their own as it is. 
  Our local internal affairs administration has attempted to 
shake loose at least a little hard currency from the Russian 
Ministry of Internal Affairs, but even there the financial 
situation is not the best at the moment. All hopes rest on the 
local government, especially since currency policy could be just 
the thing to kill two birds with one stone. 
  It is no secret to anyone that the gold mine of foreign 
economic contacts has prompted an upsurge in all forms of 
embezzlement. Last year 661 cases of thefts of ferrous, 
non-ferrous and precious metals were reported. Losses were in 
excess of R182 billion rubles. Every possible means is used to 
legitimize this illegal trade, such as forged trade and 
transport documents and fictitious certificates -- often 
obtained in exchange for bribes. The crime business has expanded 
its scope -- sometimes stolen goods are transported using 
military units' vehicles, including military transport aircraft. 
That fact seriously complicates the work of those assigned to 
combat economic crimes -- it is impossible to inspect every 
military airfield or to establish customs checkpoints at every 
one of them... 
  Of course, hard currency is not the only problem, though 
there is no doubt that if some were available certain problems 
could be solved. But corrupt officials and commanders should 
probably be overseen by those who are above them. After all, 
OBEP capabilities have their limit. 
<H5>  What Is Being Privatized, and by Whom? </H5>
  The privatization process is proceeding exactly according to 
a popular Russian proverb. "The farther into the forest you go, 
the more firewood you find" -- remember that one? Well, the 
firewood -- i.e. violations -- are more numerous in this area 
than in any other "forest." 
  OBEP subunits have uncovered numerous cases of the currently 
fashionable limited-liability companies [tovarishchestva s 
ogranichennoy otvetstvennostyu (TOO)] being created out of 
state-owned enterprises. Their founders are directors and 
officials of higher-level organizations. In violation of 
privatization law, officials are transferring fixed capital and 
operating capital to commercial structures either free of charge 
or for a purely symbolic amount. 
  Founding agreements are being amended without proper 
authorization. Often state-owned enterprises' actual 
contribution to a TOO's authorized capital and the amount of 
dividends paid out are not in keeping with the figures contained 
in founding agreements. 
  Some violations would not happen at all if local authorities 
-- city and rayon administrations -- were stricter about 
registering new enterprises, requiring authorization from 
regional state property management committees. Like the saying 
goes, a businessman should be watched by more than one eye... 
  It is precisely because of this lack of supervision by those 
in power that dubious capital is being laundered through the 
most commonplace structures. Private entrepreneurs are using 
dirty money to actively "work on" the heads of municipal 
enterprises undergoing privatization. They propose pooling funds 
and taking part in the auction to purchase an enterprise on 
behalf of its employees. It is a well-known fact that the latter 
have certain privileges and hence a better chance of winning. 
  Here is one typical example. In Nizhniy Tagil the employees 
decided to convert a certain consumer services combine into a 
TOO for privatization purposes. As it turned out, the combine's 
employees did not have the money to pay for its fixed capital, 
so therefore Citizen A., who deals in commercial transactions, 
was formally made part of the company. He promised to provide 
one-half of the amount of authorized capital required. In order 
to appear more convincing A. was even listed as an employee -- a 
truck driver... 
  The most interesting part began after the auction, i.e. 
after 
the employee group became owner of the combine. Their benefactor 
was elected director of the TOO. But... pursuant to Article 30 
of the "Law on Privatization" the city's Tagilstroyevskiy Rayon 
Procuracy is reviewing documents with a view to filing suit with 
a court of arbitration to have the deal declared illegal. 
  So he who pays the piper does not always call the tune. 
<H5>  The Mint Is Not the Only One Printing Money </H5>
  A total of 545 cases of counterfeiting and other document 
forgeries were uncovered last year by the service that combats 
economic crime. If one divides that figure by the number of days 
in a year, it turns out that our valiant guardians of law and 
order are uncovering one or two counterfeiting cases every day. 
During the year 725 banknotes and privatization vouchers were 
removed from circulation, for a sum of R20 million. 
  Almost all these forgeries were manufactured using copying 
machines and other reproduction equipment and then colored. 
Furthermore, now that office equipment is being bought and sold 
without restriction and in a wide assortment it has become 
increasingly difficult to oversee its use. Previously, every 
piece of equipment had to be registered with law enforcement 
agencies, but now that procedure has been dropped. On the one 
hand, a correct decision -- no one benefited from the 
superfluous red tape -- but, on the other hand, nowadays some 
managers have no idea what their employees are reprinting, 
whether documents or currency. Some of those employees are 
trying their hands at producing little masterpieces worth lots 
of money. 
  OBEP personnel apprehended 36 individuals attempting to pass 
counterfeit money and eight counterfeiters. 
  A case has been filed against Citizen A., who sold eight 
counterfeit $100 bills. Incidentally, that is the denomination 
most often counterfeited... 
  Moreover, some smart individuals on the street long ago 
realized that counterfeiting even the highest-denomination bills 
is too much trouble. It is much more convenient to take 
advantage of the imperfect accounting system to steal a million 
from some bank, or maybe three or four million. 
  Criminals have given the lending and finance industry many 
unpleasant surprises. However, over the course of the year 21 
cases of embezzlement using forged bank documents -- advices -- 
were successfully prevented, saving a total of R6.0 billion. 
  Criminal charges under Article 93, footnote (particularly 
large-scale embezzlement), have been filed against Citizen I. 
This clever individual, representing himself as the commercial 
manager of a state-owned enterprise in Nizhniy Novgorod, 
presented in payment two fictitious clearinghouse checks 
totalling R390 million, thereby acquiring five kilograms of rare 
earth metal from a joint-stock company in Yekaterinburg, and 
then fled. The criminal was subsequently caught and arrested. 
<H5>  It Takes Two To Tango </H5>
  In my opinion the picture is extremely clear -- and that 
despite the fact that under current conditions OBEP is by no 
means able to uncover all violations of the law. Yet blaming law 
enforcement personnel for that seems somehow ridiculous. Normal 
operations require not only personnel but also, I repeat, money, 
equipment, computer programs... 
  Considering that the state at every level has declared over 
and over again that efforts to combat crime are among its most 
important tasks, it should also do everything it can to help 
those who are trying to uphold the law. But it is one thing to 
make nice-sounding declarations and quite another to find 
funding when the budget is already on the point of collapse... 
  Meanwhile commercial structures, often semi-criminal in 
nature, frequently offer their help, either directly or via the 
Law and Order Fund. Of course, there is a price for the money 
and computers that businessmen are willing to contribute: if 
something should happen in the future, they expect their 
expensive gifts to be remembered... Those hopes are far from 
realistic. But the situation itself is abnormal -- we cannot 
protect the state's interests with money that does not come from 
the state. How our society greets tomorrow will depend on the 
way the militia's needs are dealt with by the Russian and oblast 
governments and by local authorities at all levels today.

<F P=106> [Article by L. Roketskiy, chief of oblast administration: </F>
"On Economic Successes in the Functioning of the Agro-industrial 
Complex of Tyumen Oblast in 1994"] 
  [Text] The socioeconomic situation in the oblast 
agro-industrial complex in 1993 developed under the influence of 
further liberalization of economic activity, a restricted 
financial-monetary policy, and reduction of centralized 
allocations. 
  Under these conditions the oblast administration devoted a 
considerable amount of attention to problems of reforming 
agricultural production, it directed material and financial 
resources to supporting rural commodity producers, and it 
rendered assistance in strengthening business ties with 
enterprises of the petroleum and gas complex. 
  As a result, we managed to keep the production of eggs, 
milk, 
potatoes, and vegetables at the 1992 level and in terms of a 
number of other indicators the rates of reduction of volumes 
were lower than the average for Russia. 
  But on the whole measures for reforming agriculture did not 
produce the desired results. The decline of the volumes of gross 
output continued, the areas planted in agricultural crops and 
the number of head of cattle decreased, and their productivity 
dropped. The process of creating farmer-run farms slowed up. 
Social conditions in rural areas deteriorated. 
  In order to create the necessary conditions for the 
functioning of the oblast agro-industrial complex in 1994: 
  1. The main tasks of the oblast administration and the 
administrations of the cities and rayons shall be: 
  further reform of the agrarian sector; 
  provision of stabilization of the reproduction basis, 
prevention of a sharp decline of production volumes, and raising 
of the level of marketability of agricultural products; 
  rendering of financial support for agriculture and the 
creation of economic conditions for the functioning of 
enterprises with all forms of ownership and the development of 
the social infrastructure of rural areas; 
  training of personnel for the agro-industrial complex 
capable 
of managing effectively in market relations. 
  2. The deputy chief of the oblast administration, S.A. Pak, 
the Administration of Agriculture and Food (V.A. Antonyuk), the 
Committee for Food and the Processing Industry (V.Ye. 
Kostomarov), the Committee on Economics and Prognostication 
(S.S. Chikirev), and the Finance Committee of the oblast 
administration (S.N. Martynushkin), and the chiefs of the rayon 
administrations shall earmark and implement measures for 
structural rearrangement of the agro-industrial complex, the 
creation of a competitive environment, and the insurance of 
guaranteed sale of products delivered to the oblast food fund. 
To these ends the following shall be envisioned: 
  in the crop growing branch, increased production of food 
wheat, oil bearing and cereal crops, at the same time 
envisioning financial support from the oblast budget in the form 
of advances for producers of food wheat and grain for the 
production of cereal who have concluded contracts for their

<F P=106> [Interview with Leonid Polezhayev, governor of Omsk Oblast </F>
and member of the Federation Council, by unidentified 
correspondent; place and date not given: "There Will Be No 
Shocks in Siberia"] 
  [Text] [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] The aphorism is that revolutions 
take place in capitals, civil wars--in provinces. How great is 
social tension now in Omsk and Siberia in general? 
  [Polezhayev] Even in the major regions of Siberia it has a 
spotty character. The sociopolitical background in Omsk is even. 
It is based on definite stability and a somewhat more 
advantageous economic situation. But how it is possible to do 
this is a special conversation. 
  Here is an example for you. Harvest campaigns always take 
place with difficulty in Siberia: There is snow and rain, and 
gathering grain from two hectares is like taking Berlin. 
Naturally I have opponents, and there is an opposition, which is 
especially well organized and united in the agrarian milieu. 
They are all awaiting the kind of autumn when Polezhayev finally 
fails. So, I calculated what forces were activated in gathering 
the harvest in bumper-crop years (in the 1970's, etc.). In one 
and the same land areas--2 million hectares of arable land--in 
the years 1970-1985, 15-16,000 combines and 30,000 motor 
vehicles took part in the harvest and 45,000 persons were drawn 
in from city enterprises. Last year and year before, the biggest 
harvests in the last 30 years were gathered in Omsk Oblast. 
However, we managed to get by in the harvest with 7,000 combines 
instead of 16,000, 3,500 motor vehicles instead of 30,000, and 
we did not bring in one person from city enterprises. At the 
same time, all the grain was harvested. What is the reason for 
this? The kolkhozes and sovkhozes are now joint-stock 
enterprises. Every stockholder has a share--several hectares of 
personal land, depending on the area the joint-stock company 
owns. In previous years a combine operator worked for wages. He 
was a fifth category broad specialty machine operator. He could 
earn a maximum of 500 rubles [R] per month in a harvest. Today 
he does not work for wages. We did not operate a bureau, there 
were no heart attacks, we did not expel anyone from a party, and 
we did not employ the Ipatovo method. But the peasant worked on 
his own field. He knew that he was gathering grain that would 
feed him. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Leonid Konstantinovich, you are one of 
the founders and leaders of the Siberian agreement. Just what is 
it? Will it not lead to the creation of some kind of Siberian 
republic? Will it not transform Russia, as the opposition 
threatens, not just into 20 principalities, as there were in the 
16th century, but into 89 uncoordinated components of the 
Federation with an eroded central authority? 
  [Polezhayev] In my view the managers in the regions, after 
all, are specialists in public law. None of them are infringing 
upon the integrity of the state, nor on the priority of state 
authority. When reform began, and when the Union collapsed, the 
leaders of the Siberian regions, perhaps quicker than all the 
others, became concerned about what would happen. 
  Let us analyze just what Siberia is for Russia? Is it simply 
a geographic concept? Or a material-technical and raw material 
base? Or is it an arms shop? How is Russia balanced internally 
today in a geopolitical and economic sense with the loss of 
Ukraine, Belarus, and the Baltics? Very likely, it is now 
necessary to look at Siberia precisely from this standpoint. 
Siberia itself does not need the kind of economy that has 
developed there. Believe me, it is nothing for me to produce 800 
tanks per year. There are enough raw materials for 18 million 
persons in Siberia to live independently: forests, oil, gas, etc. 
  When we begin to collate our budgets and our transfers to 
the 
federal budget, and compare them with the budgets of other 
regions, we find an obvious imbalance to the benefit of the 
center. 
  I once again return to the principle, which I did not 
conceive, that we cannot have patchwork reform. It also cannot 
be uniform for the whole country. In Siberia, for example, there 
are branches that are not even subject to conversion. For 
example, how can you convert an enterprise that was oriented on 
the production of explosive substances or the atom bomb? They 
simply have to be shut down. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] When Gaydar started his reforms, he 
proceeded from the fact that there is no socialist economy and 
there is no capitalist economy, that an economy develops 
according to laws that are common to all. Just as there is no 
socialist or capitalist physics or chemistry. Therefore, the 
center cannot help but work on common problems, for example, on 
the well-known liberalization of prices. But the regions have to 
work on their own problems. 
  [Polezhayev] Thus it is necessary to give them the 
opportunity to work on these problems. This is the first thing. 
Second, even keeping in mind that the economy has common laws, 
it cannot fail to take into account the peculiarities of that 
territory on which these laws operate. It must take into account 
the national features of the individual, his mentality and 
psychology, and, separately, the psychology of work to which he 
has become accustomed over the course of many years. Many of our 
failures result from the fact that economists, who allegedly 
project everything correctly, do not take these very important 
elements and qualities into account. 
  I think it is necessary to have more trust in the local 
authoritative structures and regional associations. Yes, we 
should have a unified transport and unified energy system, and a 
unified foreign policy and defense. But it is not necessary to 
teach me how to live with bordering Kazakhstan. I know this 
better than the Muscovites. Let us determine the specific sum 
that we must give in the form of a federal tax for the 
maintenance of the state structures and support of the state. 
But now, Omsk gives 82 percent of its taxes to the federal 
budget! 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] That is, you think that the tax system 
is 
imperfect? 
  [Polezhayev] Of course. Let even a small part remain in the 
regions, but a reasonable one. This is necessary for 
reproduction, the creation of jobs, and support of the social 
and production infrastructure. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Yavlinskiy is working on reform for 
Nemtsov in Nizhniy Novgorod, and someone has invited consultants 
from America. Is there anyone in the Siberian agreement with 
such a brilliant mind from Moscow, from the United States, or 
from South Korea? 
  [Polezhayev] The development of regional economic policy and 
regionalization of reforms here in Siberia is a job that was 
handled by V.V. Malykhin. Unfortunately, he died recently. He 
was a great economist. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] If Boris Nikolayevich offers you a good 
post in Moscow, will you go? 
  [Polezhayev] I have had more than one offer. And if I have 
to 
say "yes" or "no" today, I will say "no." 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] That is, you feel that you have real 
powers and real authority in Omsk? 
  [Polezhayev] Yes. But I could not work in isolation. I am 
not 
a charismatic figure, but simply a good business manager. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Is there a probability that the 
Federation Council will clash with the executive authority? 
  [Polezhayev] I see no drama in this. Everyone should 
function 
within the scope of his authorities. But he should also be 
confrontational on some questions. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] But not to the degree that occurred in 
October of last year? 
  [Polezhayev] No. This is ruled out. There simply are 
different people there. First, a majority of the members of the 
Federation Council are people who know what ruling is, and what 
responsibility is. The managers of the executive structures are 
not secretaries of oblast party committees. I, for example, am 
not a manager who can be manipulated. The Council will intervene 
and compel the government to make adjustments to program 
actions. But this is natural. 
  I will cite an example. I am a professional hydraulic 
engineer. Years pass while you are building a large 
hydroengineering complex, and there is an accumulation of water. 
When the sluice gates are opened in order to let the water into 
a new stream sector, a rapid current rushes in. Everything 
foams, whirls, gathers up old rubbish, and together with the 
foam, moves to the surface. But then everything quiets down, and 
the foam is cast upon the banks. A calm and clean channel 
remains in the center. 
  This resembles our political life. I think that the process 
of forming the channel has already started. It will become 
calmer and more sensible. But somewhere there is still erosion, 
somewhere there are cave-ins, somewhere there are breakdowns. 
And this is understandable.

<F P=106> [Article by Irina Timofeyeva: "A Quiet War With Invisible </F>
Victims: Over the First Quarter Novosibirsk Militia Confiscated 
Almost Half of Tonne of Drugs"] 
  [Text] She got very scared; this was obvious to 
experienced operatives from the department for combating illegal 
drug distribution. And of course she did! She had spent several 
days on a train. Could not sleep properly--kept watching this 
milk can; she would have put it under the pillow, but this was 
not possible--honey would spill out. She just walked into the 
hotel room; just breathed a sigh of relief. And then everything 
collapsed instantly. Here it is, this milk can on the 
table--there are three kilograms of raw opium in it, hidden in 
the honey. In monetary terms--more than R40 million. Outside her 
window, free, city sparrows were chirping welcoming the spring, 
while she was facing... 
  ...Novosibirsk Oblast is among the 10 regions in Russia 
where 
due to the activism of antidrug departments registered 
drug-related crime is on the rise. There is no contradiction in 
this. Illegal distribution of drugs--growing, manufacturing, 
transporting, storing, and distributing--are a latent--in other 
words, hidden--crime. (Alas, drug use has been taken off the 
list of criminal offenses during the past few years). This means 
that the better the operatives' work is organized, the more the 
personnel are informed--the higher the figures. Over the last 
three months of last year, 302 criminal cases were initiated; 
now there are 470 over the first quarter. This is against the 
background of an overall decline in the crime rate. Almost half 
a tonne of drugs (marijuana, poppy straw, and so on) have been 
confiscated, as compared to 1,200 kg over all of last year. 
Including 15 kg of raw opium. Calculate the value, keeping in 
mind that one kg costs R15 million. Also confiscated: 400 kg of 
controlled substances--narcotics, hallucinogenics, or substances 
enhancing the effect of real medicines (tranquilizers, 
antidepressants, etc.). Despite the ban, they are still sold in 
the streets and in commercial kiosks. Where does it all come 
from at a time when there are not enough drugs in hospitals, and 
some are not in pharmacies--or if they are, it is at prices 
beyond anybody's reach? The old supply and distribution 
disbalance is playing into the hands of those who make money on 
anything. 
  To win the battle against drug dealers, one must have, using 
modern terminology, a data bank. "We control the situation in 
the sphere of drug use," is the simple explanation given by one 
of the senior people in the department. Criminal investigation 
goes from crime to a criminal. In the Department for Combating 
Illegal Drug Distribution [ONON], they go from a criminal to 
crime. Naturally, the woman with the milk can was "escorted" all 
the way to the hotel room. About a month ago there was a 
burglary in an apartment in Leninskiy Rayon. The owner of the 
apartment was messed up so badly that he did not make it to the 
hospital. Several hours later a suspect was detained: The trail 
had started with the victim who was known in the drug addicts 
circles. 
  Approximately 40 percent of the pot consumed by Novosibirsk 
drug addicts is manufactured within the oblast. Which is not 
surprising, since poppy does grow here, as well as hemp, which 
has contaminated 27,000 hectares. Nobody is in a hurry to remove 
it--rural residents are busy with other things, and the militia 
has limited resources. The transparency of so-called borders, 
plus being at a crossroads, attracts drug business from Central 
Asia, the Caucasus, and Ukraine. It is brought most often by 
train or car. In increasingly larger consignments. Only a year 
ago one kg was considered a large consignment. In January almost 
12 kg were confiscated from just one courier. It is not rare to 
encounter consignments of eight, five, four kg. In specialists' 
opinion, the bulk of raw opium (one gram of which is equivalent 
both in effect and in cost to a cup of poppy straw) is brought 
from Afghanistan through Tajikistan. 
  I have heard the opinion expressed that militia efforts to 
combat the drug business only increase it. It does not make 
sense, they say, to catch small-time dealers because others take 
their place. It is a superficial and erroneous opinion. ONON 
works in different directions. A one-time catch of three kg of 
opium is not a small-time deal. In some operations just one 
seller unloads the drugs to 100 or more buyers. They get 
registered, and the seller will face a trial. Drugs cost money, 
and a drug addict as a rule does not work. The more distributors 
are isolated, the fewer the number of mercenary-type crimes. The 
department has an interrayon unit for investigation of general 
drug-related crimes. There were 100 of them solved in the first 
quarter. More than 20 units of firearms uncovered, not counting 
ammunition. In one commercial kiosk, together with marijuana 
they found two shrapnel grenades. A gun disguised as a pen was 
found in possession of a female drug seller. One charge was 
sufficient to kill a person. The next day, a home-made revolver 
was found. A certain T., who has committed 16 apartment 
burglaries and an assault, was detained. 
  Almost half a tonne of confiscated drugs has a street value 
of R410 million--this is just for three months. This is the 
amount taken out of criminal circulation. This means that this 
money will not be used to support crime bosses; will not be used 
to set up organized groups and gangs; will not be used to 
purchase arms or hire contract killers. And these millions, 
which is also important, will not have flown to near-abroad 
countries, where they are like dollars for us--hard currency. 
Because over a three-month period criminal charges were brought 
against 54 couriers and distributors from the former republics. 
  What is the prognosis? The demand--which means the 
supply--will keep growing. Increasingly, more young people and 
teenagers get drawn into the horrible game. A drug addict does 
not live long. He is lucky if he makes it to 40. Drug-related 
crime committed by juveniles last year increased by more than 20 
percent as compared to 1992, and over three months of this year, 
by 19 percent. Crime committed in the state of drug intoxication 
is on the rise. As a rule, distributors do not use their own 
goods. Of more than 300 persons (80 of them women) charged with 
distribution of drugs, only two had previous convictions. Fresh 
people--which means that the drug business does not surrender 
its positions. There is also a trend toward the use of synthetic 
drugs, which destroy a person 20-100 times faster. 
Trimethylphentanil, one gram of which is enough to make 1,000 
doses, and crack have not yet reached us. Choice drugs cost 
incredible money. The situation is under control. Last year two 
labs were liquidated in the city, which had the needed set of 
chemicals to produce "synthetics." The number of poly-drug 
addicts--those who can use anything, whether it is hashish, 
marijuana, or vodka--is growing. 
  Meanwhile, many bitter words are being said in different 
departments on the subject of combating and preventing drug 
addiction. The result is practically zero. It is like the shouts 
"Halva! Halva!" do not make sweet taste in the mouth. While 
medical practitioners for drug addiction have a clear picture of 
the terrible danger, it looks like our educational system does 
not intend at this point to enlighten children and their parents 
openly and on a broad scale. ONON personnel have enough 
conversations with fathers and mothers who refused to notice the 
strange behavior of their offspring and the suspicious glitter 
in their eyes. Where are our hygienic-educational measures, 
which used to be quite strong in the past? 
  The drug business is essentially a part of organized crime. 
It is also smuggling. It has to be interdicted at customs and by 
the endlessly reorganized KGB. Yes, they also work on it. But 
the lion's share of the work is still left to militia. 
Meanwhile, the department that deals with it has only five cars. 
There are probably rich, decent, and concerned people in our 
city, too. The perfidy of drugs also is in that they do 
distinguish whose son (or daughter) jokingly, in pretense, 
inhales that first puff. And then progresses to a needle... 
Perhaps they would find it worth it to help in this quiet war, 
because it is indeed a war against a formidable enemy.

for Facilitating Employment of the Population in Novosibirsk. We 
asked Igor Yevgenyevich Terekhov, chairman of the Committee for 
Labor and Employment of the mayoralty, to comment on the most 
fundamental aspects of this document. 
  [Kamenskaya] What changes have occurred on the labor market 
in the last year? 
  [Terekhov] As of 1 January 1993, 6,500 unemployed were 
registered in Novosibirsk, whereas as of 1 April of this 
year--6,180. This is to say that the number of unemployed has 
not been growing, despite a slump in production. This is 
associated with employees of state structures going over to the 
sector of private trade (200,000 people since 1992). In 
addition, hidden unemployment exists, which in the event of an 
abrupt deterioration of the economic situation might become a 
destabilizing factor. 
  The social breakdown of the unemployed has changed. In 1993 
we referred to engineers, technicians, and clerical employees. 
At present workers account for 30 percent of those registered by 
the Employment Center. There are still complications with the 
placement of women in jobs. They account for 76 percent of the 
unemployed. One-third of those registered are under 30. The 
proportion of this age bracket is growing, as is that of people 
who have not turned 18 yet. 
  [Kamenskaya] What is the outlook for the next few months? 
  [Terekhov] The law on mass layoffs currently in effect 
envisions a certain financial load on enterprises in the event 
of their releasing large numbers of employees. This is a 
restrictive factor. People mostly quit at their own request, 
substantiating this by delays in paying wages. Of the 60 
enterprises of the city that we checked, wages have been paid on 
time at only six as of now. 
  Reinforcements are expected in the youth labor market. 
According to our projections, between 5,000 and 9,000 current 
graduates of educational establishments will be concerned about 
finding employment. 
  [Kamenskaya] Does the form of providing assistance to 
unemployed depend on the situation on the labor market? 
  [Terekhov] Yes. Previously we restricted ourselves to 
consultations at the Employment Center, whereas other forms of 
work are also in use at present. Their objective is to encourage 
self-reliance in those who are going through a difficult time. 
  Of course, a number of measures to alleviate the situation 
of 
unemployed young people are envisioned separately. These are 
traditional forms: retraining, organization of public works, and 
also new forms--for example, half a year of on-the-job training 
for graduates of special secondary and higher educational 
establishments, incentives for entrepreneurs to create jobs for 
young specialists. We will prepare young people for commercial 
activities: instruct them in marketing and familiarize them with 
legal documentation. The plan is to provide financial assistance 
to novice entrepreneurs. In addition, a mayoralty decree on tax 
relief for this group of the population is being developed. 
  [Kamenskaya] Tell us briefly about retraining the 
unemployed. 
  [Terekhov] We have not given up retraining. Last year 700 
people were trained in 20 occupations; 90 percent of them have 
been placed in jobs. To be sure, I will note that training costs 
us four times more than payment of benefits. 
  [Kamenskaya] What is the vacancy situation as of today? 
  [Terekhov] There are about 4,500 vacancies in the city. 
Engineer and technician cadres, clerical employees, and managers 
of various levels are sought. However, for the most part these 
are blue-collar occupations. 
  Here is an interesting fact: There are about 50 vacancies 
for 
those with the occupation of accountant in the city; at the same 
time there are about 200 representatives of this profession 
among the unemployed. What is going on? Employers are not happy 
with their professional competence. As you can see, quality 
requirements for labor are now greater. 
  [Kamenskaya] Do we have unemployed with a long tenure? 
  [Terekhov] On average one succeeds in finding a job in four 
months. 
  [Kamenskaya] How much does this program cost? 
  [Terekhov] About 10 billion rubles, including the payment of 
benefits and support for planned projects. The program will be 
financed out of 2 percent transfers from the wage fund of city 
enterprises and organizations.

<F P=106> [Article by Vika Uzdina: "Will New Revenues Compensate for </F>
Expenditures?"] 
  [Text] In keeping with the prognosis of the receipt 
of revenues into the municipal budget during the second quarter 
of this year, it is suggested that only 50 percent of the costs 
of the municipal economy be financed in May. 
  In May 97.1 billion rubles [R] will be spent on the needs of 
the city. This was announced at yesterday's meeting of the St. 
Petersburg Government by the chairman of the Committee on 
Economics and Finance, Aleksey Kudrin. 
  In June the rough limit on financing for the distributors of 
credit (committee chairmen, administration chiefs, local 
administration heads, etc.) was set in the amount of R125.1 
billion. This money is intended to fully satisfy the needs to 
pay wages and to finance all the city's sociocultural expenses. 
  Aleksey Kudrin emphasized that the reduction of the volume 
of 
financing of the municipal economy was brought about by the 
reduction of the revenue side of the budget. In the second 
quarter of this year the projected revenues for the city budget 
will be R3,535,205, which will in no way compensate for the 
expenditures on maintaining the municipal economy. In all 
probability certain programs for social protection of disabled 
persons will be suspended in May (provision of transportation, 
payment for gasoline, etc.). The reduction of financing for the 
housing and municipal sphere will make it impossible to conduct 
prompt repair of 46 city streets which are in unsafe condition. 
  In order to somewhat improve such a pathetic situation, the 
city authorities intend to look for additional sources of 
revenue. For example, just increasing rents and introducing new 
methods of settlement for certain categories of lease holders 
could bring R53.8 billion into the city budget (during the 
period from 1 May through 1 January 1995). By increasing the 
rates of the land tax and paying for plots of land into the 
revenue side of the budget during the period from 16 May through 
31 December it will receive an anticipated R67.3 billion. (The 
draft of the corresponding directive from the mayor, which will 
be approved, establishes the average rate for land tax in the 
amount of R735 per one square meter.) 
  In the opinion of Deputy Mayor Vladimir Yakovlev, it is 
necessary to draw up a kind of target program for financing the 
city economy which will determine not only the priority areas 
for financing but also the deadlines for allotting funds.

<F P=106> [Interview with Igor Malashenko, general director of the NTV </F>
television company, by Andrey Yevdokimov under the rubric "First 
Hand"; date not given: "We Do Not Get Involved in Conspiracies"] 
  [Text] Moscow-St. Petersburg --[Yevdokimov] Did you know 
that the leaders of St. Petersburg TV are explaining the 
"stirring up of scandal around St. Petersburg TV and its leaders 
as a unique kind of 'smoke screen' for large-scale operations 
for commercial structures to seize television broadcasting 
networks from NTV." They are saying that NTV is backed by 
Israeli capital and the abbreviation NTV, which is well known to 
the viewers, means nothing other than "Non-Russian Television." 
  [Malashenko] I cannot say that we were very disturbed by 
Viktor Sergeyevich Pravdyuk's latest statements against us. They 
are more a characterization of him personally. If he allows 
himself to use as arguments things such as reproaches for 
"non-Russian" origin and the domination of Israeli capital, I 
can only express my amazement. That people who are proud of 
their impeccable credentials as democrats end up with such 
extraordinary ease among those who fan the flames of hysteria 
regarding the so-called worldwide Jewish conspiracy. 
Incidentally, Mr. Pravdyuk's patron, Mikhail Nikiforovich 
Poltoranin, has also taken to making such statements recently. 
  [Yevdokimov] Has NTV made any attempt to seize the 
television 
broadcasting network of Channel 5? 
  [Malashenko] As you know, NTV covers the network of Channel 
4. And we have no intention of taking any network away from 
other television companies. I will tell you that quite 
definitely. Although I must note that the problem is much more 
complicated than it might seem at first glance. In Russia there 
is a complex system of radio relay lines, transmitters, and 
various auxiliary services that support television broadcasting. 
And no one television company may have any exclusive, fixed 
rights to them. 
  I cannot deny that two oblasts came to us requesting 
assistance in switching their broadcasting from St. Petersburg's 
Channel 5 to NTV's Channel 4. The reason is that St. Petersburg 
TV is not attractive enough and there is delay in paying for the 
services of the communications workers. We made no decision 
regarding these requests and we will not do anything without 
notifying the Ministry of Communications, the Rostelekom 
joint-stock company, and other organizations. 
  As for the GTRK [State Television and Radio Broadcasting 
Company] St. Petersburg..., they, of course, have problems of 
their own. But the company's leaders are deeply deceived if they 
think that these problems can be resolved by administrative 
pressure. 
  I wish to emphasize that NTV is not involved in any 
conspiracies and in general we have too many problems of our own 
to think too frequently about the leadership of St. Petersburg 
television. 
  [Yevdokimov] Please explain the causes of the conflict 
related to the rental of Russian films on our television... 
  [Malashenko] We buy the rights to rent Russian and foreign 
films strictly in keeping with copyright legislation. The 
corresponding agreements stipulate the obligations of the 
holders of these rights to respond to all claims right down to a 
judicial investigation. I must say that I first learned from you 
that St. Petersburg TV has certain agreements for films that we 
show. I will take the liberty of questioning that--I am too 
familiar with the leasing practice of past years, when nobody at 
all was interested in the observance of copyrights. 
  [Yevdokimov] But there is a generally accepted practice for 
resolving such disputes. Why can everything not be taken care of 
peacefully? 
  [Malashenko] We have sent a letter about this to St. 
Petersburg and it contained similar proposals. But we have 
received no answer. Therefore we intend to go to court and 
resolve the dispute by purely legal methods. 
  [Yevdokimov] Can you confirm or deny the version that says 
that one of the reasons for the scandal surrounding St. 
Petersburg television and its leaders is the backroom activity 
at NTV? 
  [Malashenko] That is absolute baloney! You can use whatever 
epithets you like. I think the same mentality is at the bottom 
of these absurd accusations. If you believe in an immense, 
worldwide conspiracy against the duped people of Russia, there 
absolutely must be other, smaller conspiracies as well. It is 
very convenient to use such concepts to explain various mishaps 
and personal squabbles--the guilty parties are always at hand.

  [Text] A trilateral agreement was signed in Smolnyy 
yesterday among the Government of St. Petersburg, the Union of 
Associations of Enterprises of Industry, Construction, Science, 
Transportation, and Communications, and the Council of the 
Leningrad (St. Petersburg) Trade Union Federation for 1994. It 
was signed by the city's mayor, Anatoliy Sobchak, the president 
of the Union of the Association of Enterprises, Viktor 
Kharchanko, and the chairman of the Trade Union Federation, 
Yevgeniy Makarov. 
  The parties agreed on joint actions regarding questions of 
socioeconomic policy, regulation of labor relations, provision 
of the necessary guarantees for workers, and prevention of labor 
conflicts. 
  In particular, the agreement envisions prompt payment of 
wages. If there is a delay of payment for a period of more than 
a month, for workers of enterprises financed from the state 
budget, the amounts that are delayed will be indexed taking into 
account the higher consumer prices during this period. 
  Upon signing the agreement St. Petersburg Mayor Anatoliy 
Sobchak noted that last year such an agreement was completely 
justified and the city avoided large conflicts and strikes.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Rally In Front of Kirov"] </F>
  [Text] The theme of the rally at the gates of the Kirov 
plant was as follows: The government is not considering the 
demands of the labor collectives and not paying attention to 
their voice when drawing up state programs. 
  About 4,000 people participated in the rally, including 
representatives of several of the city's enterprises. The 
leaders of the association did not participate in the rally, but 
Kirov's general director, Petr Semenenko, said that they were 
sympathetic toward the demands of the trade unions and 
considered them just. 
  The trade unions' demands are known: for the government to 
develop an economic policy that would stimulate production. We 
have a unique situation today: We have raw material, we have 
production capacities, we have people, but nobody is working 
because the government policy makes it disadvantageous to work. 
  In any case the militia was invited to the rally and there 
were no excesses. The question now is as follows: Will the 
government take the demands developed by the city's trade union 
aktiv and supported by the rally seriously enough or will it 
ignore them? If the government perceives the rally not as a 
demonstration of force but as an ordinary political measure, we 
will arrive at the situation that developed in Russia in 1905.

<F P=106> [Announcement by the St. Petersburg State Newspaper Complex: </F>
"Newspaper Publication Suspended"] 
  [Text] The St. Petersburg State Newspaper Complex wishes to 
make it known that a number of central and local newspapers 
systematically fail to fulfill contract agreements with respect 
to payments for printing services. 
  As of 20 April 1994, the newspaper complex was owed R10.6 
million by ARGUMENTY I FAKTY, R35.6 million by ROSSIYSKIYE 
VESTI, R26.5 million by ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, and R13.9 by SMENA. 
  The total amount owed to the complex by all customers 
amounted to more than R300 million. 
  Because of systematic nonpayments the printing house is 
unable to purchase materials and pay for fuel, energy, and 
transportation, which may jeopardize newspaper printing in St. 
Petersburg and the Northwestern region altogether. 
  Beginning 25 April 1994, the printing house is compelled to 
suspend printing the following newspaper until all payments due 
are received: ARGUMENTY I FAKTY, ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, and 
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA. 
  We suggest that all complaints be addressed to these 
newspapers' editors.

<F P=106> [Interview with St. Petersburg's Vice Mayor Vyacheslav </F>
Shcherbakov, by Vadim Tyagniryadno; place and date not given: 
"The Quarrelsome Mayor"] 
  [Text] There is a new scandal in the upper echelons 
of the city authorities. Anatoliy Sobchak issued a directive to 
relieve Vyacheslav Shcherbakov from his duties as the vice mayor. 
  Directive No. 375, dated 20 April says: "In keeping 
with Minister of Defense Order No. 0831 to place...Rear Admiral 
Vyacheslav Shcherbakov under the command of the Navy commander 
in chief, having relieved him of his duties as the vice mayor." 
  Judging by what Vyacheslav Shcherbakov himself is 
saying, however, the out-of-favor vice mayor has no intention of 
parting with his office in Smolnyy just like that. 
  "I am amazed at the groundlessness of this document from a 
legal standpoint, especially considering that its author is a 
doctor of juridical science," he said. "Leaving aside the fact 
that the number of the minister of defense's order is incorrect, 
the mayor distorts in principle the contents of the order. I 
have been placed under the command of the Navy commander in 
chief since 28 December. And only he may decide what I am to do. 
At this point he is convinced that I should continue working in 
the organs of executive authority because, among other things, 
it is for the benefit of the Navy. 
  "All of this is even more groundless because on 14 April, 
with the consent of the commander in chief, I requested to be 
discharged from the Navy, since I had decided to devote myself 
to work in the City Assembly." 
  [Tyagniryadno] What will you do next? 
  [Shcherbakov] I will have to challenge the mayor's 
directive. 
I was elected vice mayor by the city's population, and I cannot 
submit to the decision of one person. I will attach my 
explanations and forward these documents to the procurator. I am 
sure that the law is on my side. 
  Vyacheslav Shcherbakov still is permitted to come to 
Smolnyy--yesterday morning he was in his office. 
  This is not the mayor's first attempt to get rid of his 
recalcitrant deputy: As is known, the former confederates have 
long had serious disagreements both on the issues of city 
management and in their political leanings. For a long time the 
vice mayor was practically in disgrace. During the events of 
September-October of last year, Vyacheslav Shcherbakov's staff 
was disbanded and he himself suspended from duties for a while. 
Nor was he included in the new city government. So far, however, 
despite all the mayor's efforts, Vyacheslav Shcherbakov 
unfailingly has been able to keep the vice mayor's suite.

<F P=106> [Report by Igor Cherevko: "`Universal'--for 16,000, </F>
Free--for 5,000"] 
  [Text] It looks like the city transportation 
structures decided to establish a "good" tradition of monthly 
increases in transportation rates. 
  Yesterday, fares on the St. Petersburg subway increased by 
50 
percent. Now one ride in the subway will cost R150. Streetcar, 
trolley bus, and bus fares now will be R150. Transporting 
luggage will cost the same. The fare will be accepted by 
punching a R2 or R5 coupon, which will now be assigned a face 
value of R150. 
  The most impressive price hikes will occur with respect to 
monthly fare cards, however. From now on the cost of an 
unlimited monthly fare card for one type of ground 
transportation will be R7,500; for two, R11,200; and for three, 
R13,500. A universal fare card will cost R16,000. 
  Students, as well as vocational and regular school pupils, 
will not fare any better. For instance, a "student" fare card 
for one type of ground transportation will now cost R3,700, and 
a "pupil" one--R2,500. A fare card for two types of ground 
transportation will cost these categories of riders R5,600 and 
R3,700, respectively, and the "universal" will cost R8,000 and 
R5,300, respectively. 
  At the same time, the fine for riding without a ticket or 
not 
paying for luggage will remain the same. As before, it is R5,000.

enforcement organs, the scale of organized crime in St. 
Petersburg is quite substantial. According to Arkadiy Kramarev, 
criminal structures may indirectly influence decisions of the 
city authorities. In order to preclude the possibility of 
criminal elements interfering with the process of city 
administration, deputy Sergey Andreyev proposed that by the time 
the city assembly begins its work all heads of law enforcement 
organs submit a list of priority normative acts, whose adoption 
will make it possible to improve the crime situation in St. 
Petersburg. 
  Also yesterday a group of deputies petitioned Russian 
Minister of Internal Affairs V. Yerin to postpone the question 
of relieving A. Kramarev from his job--the rumors of his 
replacement have been circulating in St. Petersburg--until the 
city assembly begins its work.

<F P=106> [Article by S. Stepanova: "City Life in Figures and Facts; </F>
Deviation From What Was Planned--General Failure?"] 
  [Text] One of the important moments in the report of 
the city administration on work in 1993 was the information on 
the construction-investment complex, finances, and ecology. 
  Last year, R193.6 billion of capital investments (in prices 
in effect) were used by the city at the expense of all sources 
of financing. Of this, R136.1 billion were used for production 
facilities and R57.6 billion, for nonproduction facilities. 
Construction-assembly operations were implemented to the extent 
of R143.6 billion. 
  Capital investments in the construction of housing amounted 
to R40 billion (of this, R1.6 billion was found for housing for 
servicemen, and just as much for workers in public education; 
R6.9 billion, for health services; R8.2 billion, on municipal 
construction; R0.2 billion, on the construction of cultural 
facilities; and R0.8 billion, on various other facilities). 
  Last year, 155,662 square meters of housing were introduced 
(including 3,231 square meters for servicemen discharged into 
the reserve). 
  The construction of all objects was conducted basically on 
resources of enterprises: 84 percent of all capital investments 
for the year. Capital investments of the city's capital 
construction administration amounted to R23 billion; of this, 
R2.5 billion was directed from the federal budget, R2.7 billion, 
from the oblast budget, and the remaining R14.9 billion, from 
the city budget. 
  Besides housing in the last year, children's preschool 
institutions for 600 seats were built in the settlements of 
Pritomskiy and Sadoparkovyy, a food and trade shop in 41-42 
quarters in Tsentralnyy Rayon, and storm sewers (KMK) [Kuznetsk 
Metallurgical Combine] and a public health zone (ZSMK) [Kuznetsk 
Metallurgical Welding Plant]. 
  Work was continued on facilities that were a priority for 
the 
city: the reconstruction of the Kuznetsk TETs [Heat and Electric 
Power Station], the construction of another sewer line, a 
boarding home for old people and invalids in the Novoilyinskiy 
micro rayon, a junction of the Bungur highway crossing, and 
medical and sanitary units for construction workers, and others. 
  Not all of the facilities of the municipal order were put 
into operation. There was one reason: the inadequacy or lack of 
financing. 
  Meanwhile, as for finances, last year the budget of the city 
was filled by 104 percent. This means that the resources 
received and expended on the city's needs were more than what 
was planned. 
  The city received incomes of R85.3 billion. And while 116 
percent of the planned level of the tax on profit was received, 
there were shortages in all of the other taxes. This entails 
income tax from the population (91 percent of the planned 
level), VAT (77 percent), excise taxes (74 percent), and land 
tax (92 percent). 
  There was an ecological program based on financing from the 
ecological fund and the municipal budget. 
  Out of 34 planned measures, only 22 were fully or partially 
completed. There are several reasons for this. One of the main 
ones: There were not enough financial resources. Therefore, for 
example, a municipal socioecological improvement project was not 
established that was supposed to be financed from the federal 
budget within the scope of the federal program "Ecology of 
Russia" (R50 million). Three million rubles were not found in 
the oblast ecological fund for correcting the project for the 
organization of a sanitary zone for the protection of the 
Dragunskiy water intake. 
  As for the city budget, an ecology expenditure line appeared 
in it for the first time in 1993. Instead of R266 million for 
ecological programs, R25 million was allocated last year. The 
fact is that, on examination of the budget, the inner city 
council, after approving the given sum in the expenditures part, 
did not determine the sources of financing. Therefore, spending 
on ecology last year was conducted to the extent possible. 
Purely organizational aspects also had an effect on the 
implementation of the program. For example, the status of the 
Targayskiy coniferous forest, which made it impossible to 
develop a recreational zone there. A decision on the question of 
the establishment of a municipal ecological control service in 
the city was postponed. The city administration and the oblast 
environmental protection committee were unable to arrive at a 
mutual understanding on the Sibgipromez joint-stock company as 
the developer of the city volume of maximum permissible wastes 
(the oblast organization did not vote for this organization in 
the indicated capacity). 
  From what was done, that is, brought to an end, the 
following 
can be named. Drinking water filters were set up and tested in 
schools of the Tsentralnyy Rayon. A working draft was produced 
for installation for purifying sewage of carbomide-formaldehyde 
tars for the furniture factory. One other study concerned the 
organization within the confines of the city of a forest park 
area and the protection of city forests from fires. 
  Analyses were conducted last year of storm waters and snow 
from snowfalls. Instruments were acquired for the health and 
epidemiology inspection and hydrometeorological services, tests 
were conducted on the soil, and an ecological map of the city 
was created. For the future, work is being done to equip a city 
ecological education center and an experimental school for 
general ecological education (on the basis of school No. 4) 
  But, of course, important expensive measures were not 
implemented...

<F P=106> [Interview with A. I. Starikov, by CHELYABINSKIY RABOCHIY </F>
correspondent Yu. Kormiltsev, Magnitogorsk, under rubric 
"Economy": "Anatoliy Starikov: `Don't Patch Up the Holes, but 
Make Decisions in a State Way''] 
  [Text] Five years ago the Magnitogorsk Metallurgical 
Combine bathed in the rays of glory. The first-born child of 
socialist industry continued to surprise people with its 
record-breaking successes. Just think, it used to produce 16 
million tons of steel a year! More than any European 
country. 
  Today the world's largest combine, like the entire 
metallurgical industry in Russia, is in a difficult situation. 
Entry into the civilized market proved to be no simple matter. 
In this situation nothing will help -- not the former merits, 
not the decorations awarded, not the high-sounding titles. Every 
enterprise is fated to take its own path in getting to the 
market. The reform also required that the MMK [Magnitogorsk 
Metallurgical Combine] administrators think about economics in a 
new way, take different approaches than they had in the past, 
and display new talents. This was the topic of a conversation 
that our correspondent had with Anatoliy Ilich Starikov, general 
director of the "MMK" AO [joint-stock company] and president of 
the Chelyabinsk Oblast Union of Industrialists and 
Entrepreneurs. 
  [Kormiltsev] It is unusual to hear reproachful statements 
directed at our metallurgists. Because your plans and production 
orders always used to be fulfilled with enviable constancy. But 
currently either the prices have risen unexpectedly, or the raw 
materials have not been paid for promptly. Of course, everyone 
is having a difficult time. But for such a giant as MMK, things 
certainly should be a bit easier, shouldn't they? 
  [Starikov] Everything is not so simple. Let's recall 
history.. At one time a very catchy jingle was born here: "We'll 
run ourselves ragged, but we won't let down Magnitka" [rhymes in 
Russian]. We ran ourselves ragged during the entire war. And 
even later. Properly speaking, things never were easy. After 
all, we operated on imported raw materials practically all our 
life. Nevertheless we had the highest profitability level -- 28 
percent. That was twice as high as, for example, the level in 
Lipetsk at that time. 
  It is another matter that, while giving its all to the 
Motherland, Magnitka gradually lagged behind with regard to the 
qualitative specifications of the metal. The equipment was 
wearing out, and the assemblies were getting old... Also, iron 
gets tired. You cannot master the latest technologies just by 
shouting "hurray!" And so, even if you were a three-time patriot 
at your beloved enterprise, if you do not renew the technology, 
sooner or later everything will begin to fall apart. 
  At one time a long-term program for the remodeling of the 
combine was prepared. But certain events occurred, and we proved 
to be "thrown overboard," outside the state programs. 
  Well, the market will not accept emotions, and former 
enthusiasm will not save us. This is a stern and mobile conveyor 
belt where, from day to day, there is a merciless struggle for 
survival. But how can we survive if, all of a sudden, everyone 
has proven to be debtors -- not only the producers, but also the 
consumers? The unprecedented crisis of nonpayments, according to 
certain pundits, is just a demand crisis. So they begin --excuse 
me for speaking so sharply -- brainwashing everyone, telling 
them, "You're producing the wrong kind of output, that your 
partners just do not need." That's demagoguery! The reason for 
the production slump is not the law of demand for our metal. 
  The combine's fixed assets today have been supporting a 
workload of only 56 percent. But worldwide practice says that if 
they have a workload of less than 80 percent, their use is 
inefficient. We were forced to stop, for example, two 
coke-chemical batteries: because of a shortage of coal we are 
converting the remaining ones to an operational mode that 
removes the graphite from the walls, and this leads to the 
premature wearing out of the furnaces, so that, consequently, 
their service life is reduced by half. What will this lead to? 
To a disaster. Those are the conditions we are working in. Now 
is it understandable why our combine does not always succeed in 
being a reliable partner? And the fact that thousands of other 
enterprises are in the same situation is small solace for us. 
  [Kormiltsev] Do you mean, then, that we are yielding our 
positions? 
  [Starikov] We maneuver, and sometimes we retreat, but we do 
not give up! We are not sitting idly by. The market has made 
harsher demands on all the services, and has also new things to 
worry about. Let me return again to history. To a certain 
degree, things were not really too bad for us previously, before 
the reforms. The ministry, Gosplan, and Gossnab assumed many 
functions. The state used to provide us with raw materials and 
production orders, and with equipment. There was an opportunity 
to engage deeply in the development of technological innovations 
and to experiment. It was for good reason that Magnitka used to 
be called a nationwide school for advanced experience. 
  But then the centralized supply and distribution 
disappeared. 
The market arrived. Suddenly there appeared the acute need to 
change the way we thought about the economy. Beginning with the 
enterprise director and ending with the packer. We cannot 
produce even a single ton of unordered metal! It is, essentially 
speaking, a revolutionary task. There are no sales for the old 
steel. And if there is no sale of the output, there is no money. 
And the only people we can blame are ourselves. The consumer 
psychology has to be changed as quickly as possible. We must not 
run around in confusion, or act nervously, but we must calmly 
analyze our own capabilities, of which I feel there are many. 
  [Kormiltsev] So where did you begin? 
  [Starikov] We begun from where we had been burned. With 
economic independence. It is not a matter of a fashionable 
slogan. We actually need economic independence. But who needs 
it, and to what degree? You cannot understand what the market is 
by analyzing other people's mistakes. It is necessary to feel 
the market with your own hands, to experience it, because most 
administrators have become accustomed to thinking and doing 
something "from this point to that point," knowing that the 
plant administration will be able to correct any distortion or 
bad decision. But it is necessary for each of them to be not 
only an efficient executor, but also an intelligent conveyor of 
market ideology. 
  Putting it more succinctly, we have created a number of 
daughter enterprises. We have written out their functional 
duties. We attempted to provide for many things. But the 
spontaneous situation in the market proved to be stronger than 
our good intentions. The old psychology is like residual 
magnetism. For that reason many of the subdivision 
administrators felt that the market relations are built only on 
buying and selling. Apparently their head was spinning from the 
complete liberalization of prices, by the fact that today no one 
from the top is requiring detailed reports, that everyone is his 
own boss, and that you can turn any way you want to. 
  For a long time it was necessary to explain things and even 
to spoil the relations with certain "market experts." It is 
necessary to engage not in speculation, but in the organizing of 
labor, in trade, and to learn how to live in the new economic 
situation. 
  Management is not the primitive buying and selling of 
output. 
It is possible to be victorious over your rival in the market 
not by asking a high price, but, on the contrary, by asking a 
lower one. But in order to do this it is necessary to 
construction all your work in a new way. 
  I will say honestly that we have not yet become completely 
successful in breaking the market primitivism, or that peculiar 
kind of self-seeking attitude. Although much has been done in 
this direction: we have had the training of personnel, 
familiarity with foreign practice, and we have invited foreign 
specialists here. Nevertheless we have not yet succeeded in 
bringing to a conclusion everything that was planned. 
  But since 1 April all the production subdivisions that are 
linked with the production of metal have been united into the 
lead plant on the basis of cost accountability. 
  [Kormiltsev] The daughter enterprises have forced you to 
take 
a different look at the process of managing the combine. 
Currently there have been many discussions about the functions 
of the plant administration, and about renewing them. What is 
the significance of this? 
  [Starikov] We are opposed to a simplified understanding of 
the sale of output. The combine is not a flea market where the 
main slogan is "buying and selling" at any cost. We are in favor 
of a civilized market that saturates society with the output 
that it needs. And it is necessary to predict the market. For 
five years ahead or even more. We are required to know what is 
awaiting us tomorrow. Consequently, it is necessary to develop a 
marketing service. A combine is a cumbersome thing. It is 
difficult to rock it. But it is also difficult to stop it. The 
forces of inertia can drag you down a blind alley. 
  That is why the work with personnel occupies absolutely the 
first place with us. Previously we relied on professionalism. 
We wanted the steelmaker to be able to pour the steel better, 
more effectively, and the roller to obtain the necessary rolled 
shape, etc. Now the emphasis is on market knowledge. It is 
becoming a vital necessity to consider the expenditures. 
Otherwise you will be burnt to a crisp. Previously the financial 
service lived its own life, a paper life that was comprehensible 
to only a few people. But now the financiers are becoming the 
leading specialists. That is what the analysts must also be. And 
it is our duty to organize the work of that service properly. 
  And what about credit? To tell the truth, prior to the 
reform 
we had a rather confused idea about credit. Why was that? The 
party and the government make the decision, say, to build a 
converter shop at Magnitka. The funds are allocated, the people 
are sent out, and the contractors are designated. Today it's 
different. You decide for yourself who you are going to call, 
and to whom you are going to entrust the important project. You 
yourself think what this will produce -- not only from the 
production point of view, but also from the social and 
ecological points of view. There is an entire range of questions 
here, and each one requires careful study. 
  And questions of ownership? There continue to be unabated 
disputes about the methods, means, and alternatives of 
privatization. Some people assert that the managerial upper 
layer is attempting quietly to grab as much as they can for 
themselves, and to get rich at the expense of ordinary laborers. 
Others feel that it is not worthwhile to hurry to buy shares... 
It is obvious, however, that there has arrived for us a very 
important period that previously was completely unknown to us 
--it will be necessary for us to learn how to work with 
securities, to penetrate more deeply into the wisdom of leasing, 
trade, and cooperation with foreign companies. In each such area 
it will be necessary to define one's position, and take a 
cautious approach in planning a program of actions. Because once 
the market has been declared to be state policy, it is necessary 
to take a professional, state attitude toward it. 
  [Kormiltsev] Let's return to the real-life situation today. 
Almost all the problems that you listed are linked with the 
remodeling of the combine. Without that remodeling the 
production of quality metal will not occur, and without metal 
there will not be any decent wages, no social blessings, no 
clean sky over Magnitka. The market is merciless competition. 
Essentially speaking, the state has eliminated itself from the 
leadership of the economy, and there will not be any sponsorship 
of enterprises, such as we used to have. How, then, do you plan 
to carry out the remodeling? 
  [Starikov] It is difficult to give any unambiguous answer. I 
shall express my own point of view. The restructuring of 
production in such a cumbersome thing as our combine requires a 
tremendous amount of funds. Not a single enterprise of this kind 
is capable of earning those funds independently. We shall not 
speak about the historical debts that Magnitka has a right to 
expect from the country, because Magnitka continues to "run 
itself ragged." Let's see how similar problems are resolved in 
the civilized countries. 
  The state there does not eliminate itself from large-scale 
production. It is a subject of the market, its regulator. If it 
is necessary to erect, for example, a one-of-a-kind mill or 
shop, that question is resolved frequently not even at the level 
of that state, but at the level of the European government. But 
we suffer from an old disease: we rush from one extreme to 
another. After rejecting total control of the economic sphere, 
our state moved completely away from production. The enterprises 
got unlimited freedom, and the economy remained all alone with 
its own problems. 
  We traditionally consider ourselves to be monopolists in our 
branch. But things are very, very difficult even for us. I feel 
that only the state can introduce order in the rampant price 
anarchy. Only the state can and must regulate the 
interrelationships between the producers and the consumers. No, 
I do not want to beg in a veiled manner to have the state give 
us credit. I know that the Kremlin's treasury has been empty for 
a long time. But the state can and must give a bank a guarantee 
to cover the credit, because we are talking about the 
restructuring of a base branch. 
  [Kormiltsev] Was the recent visit by a governmental 
delegation headed by Oleg Soskovets reassuring in this regard? 
  [Starikov] I shall state outright that we attach fundamental 
importance to that visit. We have prepared a program for the 
development of the combine until the year 2000. There are two 
directions in this strategy: the change in the technology of 
production for producing only output that is capable of meeting 
the competition, and, at the expense of that, diversification, 
the creation of a machine-building complex and a construction 
industry, and the further development of the production of 
consumer goods. Understandably, these ideas require colossal 
funds. Of course, we are earning some of them, by creating 
joint-stock companies, and also at the expense of improving the 
administration of production, the creation of more rigid demands 
placed on the executors, the introduction of all kinds of 
innovations, etc., in a word, by the expense of reducing all the 
expenditures. But we are also counting on state support. And on 
the attracting of foreign investments. 
  The governmental delegation visited very important projects 
in the combine that are ready for activation. It was convinced 
that we had undertaken a big task. The important guests saw with 
their own eyes the condition to which the flagship in heavy 
industry has been brought. Even the small balance-sheet profit 
that was received last year was used not to develop the 
enterprise, and not to implement the social program, but to 
patch up holes, to assure elementary survival. It is necessary 
to be realistic and understand that if, in the near future, we 
do not build at the combine cold-rolling and hot-rolling mills 
No. 2000, if we do not renew all of production, we will not be 
able to withstand the competition with the West. And then, 
alongside of the Snickers and Mars Bars, metal from Europe will 
come to Russia's domestic market. 
  The state has allocated to us 11 billion rubles to complete 
hot-rolling mill No. 2000. We have been promised assistance in 
shifting the deadlines for paying part of our taxes and a 
reduction in the customs duties on the bringing in of imported 
equipment... In a word, the appropriate document concerning our 
metallurgical combine is being prepared in Moscow. 
  Of course this is gratifying. But the same problems of 
nonpayments, remodeling, and excessive taxes also confront the 
metallurgists of Chelyabinsk, Zlatoust, and Asha, and the miners 
and machine-builders. Consequently, it is necessary to resolve 
them in a state manner, rather than on an individual basis, with 
everyone taking his own chances of being successful. 
  [Kormiltsev] You have mentioned Western investments. Much 
has 
already been said about this in the press. Somehow it looks as 
though the West is in no hurry to pull Russia out of its 
economic blind alley. 
  [Starikov] Once again, everything is not so simple. I feel 
that at the conference that, to state it outright, was very 
important for us and that was organized at our combine by the 
Moscow delegation, there were also shifts in this direction. 
Foreign companies have their own well worked-out methods for 
investing capital. Some of them are in no hurry to invest their 
funds not only because the political situation in our country 
still seems to them to be insufficiently stable, but also 
because they need clear-cut guarantees that have been well known 
for a long time in the West. For example, it is necessary to 
give 25 percent of the shares to foreign investors. Naturally, 
our economic managers immediately begin to think deeply about 
this. There appears the fear that if foreign businessmen receive 
the controlling block of shares, domestic industry will be 
threatened by complete failure, all the social and ecological 
programs will be discontinued, etc. But take, for example, the 
Tulachermet joint-stock company. They have already sold a rather 
large number of shares in their daughter enterprises to foreign 
investors, and the people at the plant only won from this. 
  Incidentally, recently the president of a certain major 
international company, speaking on behalf of an authoritative 
foreign expert commission that had been studying the combine's 
work, made a proposal concerning the sale to the company of a 
block of our shares. I shall state outright that that was not 
particularly to the liking of all of my associates. But I think 
that it is time for us to make bolder use of the foreign 
experience of privatizing major companies and enterprises. If 
there are investments, the renovation will occur more rapidly. 
Because, thank God, the metallurgists at Magnitka have always 
known how to work.

<F P=106> [Own information report: "In the Extreme North They Are in </F>
`Dire Straits'"] 
  [Text] The regular session of the Russian Federation 
government commission on operational questions proceeded under 
the sign of modern market terminology and at the same time under 
the clearly marked striving for increased government 
responsibility for all the matters being reviewed. Of course, 
such a mixture of styles is apt to lead to some sort of languor 
in the ranks of the radicals. However, the censor-like 
vigilence of the adherents to slogans as clear as the eyes of 
youth has recently become dull. The main reason for this is the 
lack of brilliant victories in the lightening-speed reformation 
of sluggish Mother Russia. It has already turned out like this 
for us: The slower the harnessing the faster we go. Although 
one will not speak about the speed of providing food products, 
let's say, to the Norilsk industrial region or the Taymyr 
(Dolgana-Nenets) autonomous okrug. 
  The essence of the question being reviewed is such: The 
navigational delivery of goods and resources, including food, 
petroleum products and vital necessities required for the 
population of the above mentioned territories was always clearly 
worked out in the most general terms by the middle of April. 
But that was before. It was carried out by the state Norilsk 
Nickel concern which has all the necessary means for this work. 
  But not today. The Norilsk Mining and Metallurgical Combine, 
producing half of the world's platinum and tens and hundreds of 
thousands of tons of nickel, cobalt and other expensive metals 
on the world market, has itself fallen into the financial abyss. 
And because of the state they were in, in connection with this 
as of 1 April accumulation of freight at the transshipment ports 
had practically not been carried out. The breakdown of 
navigational deliveries will lead to a sharp worsening of social 
tensions in the most important region of the extreme North with 
a population of more than 350,000 people, as well as to 
significant losses for the country's economy due to a reduction 
in the amount of valuable and nonferrous metals. 
  The opinions of high members of the Commission regarding the 
amounts of state financial support for delivering food products 
and goods to the regions of the extreme North are divided. 
According to a preliminary agreements it was decided in favor 
of the following figures: to allocate 500 billion rubles to the 
combine for freight deliveries for the current quarter and to 
provide for allocation of funds for the third quarter within the 
limits of 800 billion rubles. 
  During the break I asked A. Filatov for his impression of 
the 
discussion. Anatoliy Vasilyevich diplomatically avoided a 
direct answer: "The question will be finally resolved on 
Friday. Let's talk then." 
  Today is Friday. As trusted sources from the government 
institutions informed us, the question has been practically 
resolved. It is necessary to feed the peoploe...We congratulate 
everyone for this.

<F P=106> [Article by Pavel Felgengauer: "Balkanization of History"] </F>
  [Text] The Balkans are an unfortunate region for Russia. 
Peter's Prut campaign, the Crimean War, the war of 1878 and the 
subsequent Congress of Berlin--in hardly any other region have 
the Russian military and diplomats experienced such humiliation 
and failures. Nonetheless, Russia intervened time after time in 
the bloody Balkan quarrels in the vain hope that the local 
Slavs, close both in language and in faith, would appreciate it, 
would be inspired, and would become for all time a dependable 
outpost of the empire. But the whole problem is that the Balkans 
were for Russia merely a military theater: Political and 
military expansion was never seriously accompanied by economic 
expansion. The region (Yugoslavia particularly) has always 
gravitated toward Central Europe, primarily toward Germany. 
Millions of former Yugoslavs, Serbs included, are working in the 
FRG today also. The Deutsche mark is the main currency both in 
Serbia and in Bosnia. It is to it that the "new" Yugoslav dinar 
is tied. 
  Slav brethren have always at a difficult moment sought armed 
assistance in Moscow, and when the storm has abated, they have, 
perfectly naturally, forgotten about their "great northern 
brother." In the summer of 1914 Russia emphatically supported 
Serbia (having begun mobilization of the army) in the diplomatic 
conflict with Austria-Hungary following the assassination of the 
Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo. In the ensuing world war and the 
revolution it caused, Russia was devastated, losing, according 
to certain estimates, up to 10 million killed. And what remained 
became the USSR. Serbia, on the other hand, as a result of the 
war enlarged its territory several times over, annexing Bosnia, 
Croatia, Slovenia, Montenegro, and Vojvodina. 
  Today the Serbs are once again attempting to draw Russia 
into 
their war in the Balkans. The "unprecedented success of Russian 
diplomacy" in Sarajevo at the end of February was (this is now 
perfectly obvious) prepared in Belgrade and Pale by no means for 
reconciliation in earnest in Bosnia. The Serbs, it would seem, 
are of a mind to fight until they have taken all the surrounded 
Muslim cities (Sarajevo included). And several hundred of our 
airborne forces have found themselves in Sarajevo simultaneously 
hostages of Russia's future behavior in the region (totally 
dependent on the mood of local field commanders) and, on top of 
that, a live shield against possible NATO bombing raids. 
  When the Serbian tanks tore into Gorazde, all the same 
(during the latest armistice negotiations), Mr. Churkin threw up 
his hands--"he had, alas, been deceived." In which there is, of 
course, no particular perfidy--the internationally isolated 
Serbs have no other solution. It was, after all, the Russian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (not the Serbs) that should have 
done everything possible to prevent Russia's involvement in the 
war, having concentrated its efforts instead in republics in 
which the ruble, not the Deutsche mark, is the main currency. 
There are, for that matter, no dazzling conditions for 
"unprecedented successes" in the "near abroad." 
  The lessons of history have yet to teach anyone anything. 
Last night a new contingent of crack Russian airborne forces 
flew to the former Yugoslavia to show that Russia is still a 
world power with global interests.

<F P=106> [Article by Irina Zvyagelskaya, vice president of </F>
the Russian Center for Strategic and International Studies: 
"Russia's Diplomatic Style in the Middle East"] 
  [Text] The visits to Moscow by PLO Chairman Yasir 
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin testify not only 
to the possibility of new steps toward settlement of 
Palestinian-Israeli relations and the Arab-Israeli conflict as a 
whole, but also to Russia's choice of a new line of action in 
the Middle Eastern area. 
  Russia inherited the role of cosponsor of the Middle East 
conference from the disintegrated USSR. It was inherited under 
conditions where Russia, running up against economic hardships, 
not possessing the military potential of the former great power, 
and having received numerous conflicts in the former Soviet 
republics, was scarcely able to permit itself to follow an 
active policy in a region which was sinking ever lower on the 
scale of foreign political priorities. 
  As a result a very strange situation emerged: formally 
Russia 
had certain obligations resulting from its status and related to 
settlement of the conflict, but at the same time it had 
practically no approaches of its own to the problem. Russian 
policy was realized within the framework of a kind of "Siamese 
twins" notion, spoken of by minister of foreign affairs A. 
Kozyrev in an interview with KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA on 9 April 
1994. This merging with the American position (not only in ends, 
which was justified, but also as to means) undermined the 
traditional influence of Russia in the Middle East. The 
willingness to transfer all the worries of a settlement to the 
United States, which really did have great capabilities, in no 
way fit with the obvious fact that Russian interests in the 
Middle East are not identical with American interests, although 
they can coincide in part. 
  Let me recall in this connection the role of the USSR in the 
period of the Iraqi aggression against Kuwait. Soviet diplomacy 
of that time supported the U.N. Security Council decisions that 
envisioned stopping aggression, using military force against 
Iraq (if it did not withdraw its troops), establishment of the 
embargo, and so on, but still it operated with its own means. 
The USSR even resorted to a certain worsening of relations with 
the United States, which unequivocally favored military force, 
but it kept its image of a power with its own political 
personality and view of the situation. 
  The merging with American policy deprived Russia of those 
advantages which it could have drawn from the ideological 
reorientation. It is well-known that many Arab regimes who 
viewed the spread of communism as a direct threat to their 
existence were inclined to development of closer relations with 
Russia, which had rejected communism as its official ideology. 
The Middle Eastern scheme of international relations has always 
been built on balance. The cessation of the "cold war" and 
removal of the region from the sphere of the Soviet-American 
standoff, which were received favorably in the Middle East, did 
not mean that the states located there were ready to accept, in 
place of the two rival forces, some ugly and unnatural hybrid 
which would deprive them of the freedom of political maneuver. 
Notions of undivided U.S. dominance became widespread in the 
Middle East, replacing the former bipolar structure. 
  Russian participation in settlement of the conflict remained 
a formality and this made it more difficult to work out the 
system of its own interests in the Middle East and their 
relationship with other foreign policy priorities. A pause in 
determination of national interests was probably inevitable 
because Russia had entered a role that was new to it as an 
independent subject of international relations. It could not 
help preserving a certain genetic link with the former great 
power, of which it was a fragment. The duality lying in the very 
history of the appearance of contemporary Russia in the 
international arena was reflected in all its political behavior. 
The natural desire to occupy a worthy place in the world was 
extinguished by fears that it would be accused of a rebirth of 
imperial ideas inherited from the USSR. Moreover, the internal 
political ratio of forces (the predominance of advocates of a 
complete rejection of the old Soviet policy) led to distortions. 
Unjustified hostility to any U. S. actions was replaced with 
equally unjustified "Siamese twinning." 
  Succession and new elements of foreign policy were most 
closely intertwined for Russia in the question of a Middle East 
settlement. The USSR, whose peace initiatives were by no means 
always realistic and often were mere words, consistently called 
for an international conference on the Middle East and for 
participation by the Palestine Liberation Organization in the 
peace talks. It took significant changes in the international 
and regional arenas (the Palestinian uprising in the occupied 
territories, the crisis in the Persian Gulf, and Egypt's 
intermediary role) to bring these appeals to practical 
realization. The Madrid process, which began in October 1991, 
opened the doors to both multilateral and bilateral talks among 
participants in the conflict. The coming to power of government 
of the Avoda [translation unknown] socialist party reordered the 
focuses in Middle East settlement. Emotions gave way to greater 
pragmatism. 
  In the system of talks Russia was an honorary cochairman, 
able to approve agreements that were reached but unable to do 
anything significant to prepare them or put them into effect. 
The Palestinians and Israel began to conduct their own game, 
calling on the United States when necessary and seeming to 
forget about Russia's existence. This was demonstrated in the 
Oslo meeting in August 1993 where the PLO and Israel agreed to 
institute autonomy in Gaza and Jericho, and in September 1993 in 
Washington where they signed the agreement. By itself the 
agreement, with all its unquestioned importance, could not 
signify a smooth transition to Palestinian self-government. 
Bloody tragedies continued and continue to be played out in the 
occupied territories. The crime in Hebron where an Israeli 
settler shot praying Palestinians in a mosque put the whole 
peace process in danger. 
  In this situation Russia has a special responsibility. The 
Middle East, which for it has become the "far" abroad, still 
preserves its special strategic, political, and economic 
significance. After the events in Hebron Russian diplomacy was 
able, using its ties with the PLO and the current level of 
relations with Israel, to prevent a breakoff of the talks. V. 
Posuvalyuk, a special representative of the RF President, was 
sent to the Middle East, followed by deputy minister of foreign 
affairs Yu. Ivanov and minister A. Kozyrev himself. Talks 
between the Palestinians and Israel were renewed in Cairo. The 
visits of Arafat and Rabin to Moscow will obviously help 
consolidate what has been achieved and, despite all the 
difficulties, strengthen mutual understanding. 
  At the same time Russo-Syrian and Russo-Jordanian contacts, 
an important element in the settlement, have broadened. 
  The talks are continuing in essentially the "Washington 
format." Russia's activism, including its proposal to call a 
second Madrid conference, did not arouse enthusiasm in 
Washington. It is not just a matter of different approaches to 
settlement. The steps by Russian diplomacy were perceived in 
Washington, which has already begun to become accustomed to 
close partnership, as an affirmation of Russia's desire to 
distance itself from American policy and receive political 
dividends for its own initiatives. 
  In actuality a normal process is underway. Russia is 
developing its own diplomatic style in the Middle East, trying 
to introduce a contribution that fits its national interests 
into the resolution of this protracted conflict.

<F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Nikonov, chairman of the Subcommittee </F>
for International Security and Arms Control of the State Duma of 
the Russian Federation: "Partnership for Peace: Agenda for the 
Federal Assembly"] 
  [Text] Deputies of both houses of the Federal Assembly 
learned of the decision of Russia's executive authorities to 
affiliate with NATO's Partnership for Peace (PFP) program from 
the newspapers. This fact is a very graphic demonstration of the 
present role of the supreme legislative body of the Russian 
Federation in the foreign policy decisionmaking process. 
  An abnormal situation, to be blunt. And it is dictated not 
only by the new constitution, which quite effectively sidelines 
the legislators from the formulation of foreign policy. The 
obvious short-sightedness of our foreign policy establishment 
explained by the less than most felicitous experience of 
interaction with the former Supreme Soviet and a certain 
wariness in respect to the new corps of deputies may be traced 
behind this trend also. The short-sightedness amounts to the 
fact that even with the current constitution, the influence of 
parliament is potentially quite considerable: adoption of the 
budget, items geared to the foreign policy activity of the 
Russian Federation included; ratification of international 
treaties and agreements (more than 100 of them are to be 
approved by the Federal Assembly); the adoption of laws, those 
regulating the implementation of domestic and foreign policy 
included; the possibility of a wide-ranging appeal to domestic 
and world public opinion. Considering this, it has to be 
concluded that the noninvolvement of the Federal Assembly in the 
overall foreign policy mechanism could threaten the very 
foundations of the policy of the Russian Federation in the world 
arena, which, as we all know, begins at home. In addition, 
foreign policy can only be consistent and effective when it is 
based on a certain consensus within the country. And it is hard 
to count on this when the representative authority is notified 
post factum. Yes, the Federal Assembly is heterogeneous, and 
forces with different views on international problems, differing 
at times from those of the government, are represented in it. 
But it is just as much a reality as the government, and it is 
impossible to hope for a rapprochement of views while adopting 
an ostrich-like position. 
  Parliament's isolation from the formulation of the 
Partnership for Peace decision was a reason for the very 
tumultuous debate on this problem in the State Duma, which 
induced a number of experts to begin talking about the 
conception of contradictions of the two authorities in the 
foreign policy sphere. The PFP problem is, indeed, a complex 
one. And the position of the members of parliament is dictated 
by no means only by ideological predilections but also by the 
obvious lack of knowledgeability, the lack of clarity on many 
essential details (for me included), and the equivocal nature of 
the assessments of the program in the news media. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA has as of late repeatedly addressed, 
directly or indirectly, the Partnership problem, having 
published articles by V. Chernov, D. Yevstafyev, V. Katin, and 
A. Migranyan (NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA for 23 February, 25 February, 
and 15 March 1994). They, as many other publications also, 
contain entirely cogent criticism of the PFP and proof of its 
unsuitability for Russia, which cannot simply be brushed aside. 
On the other hand, official announcements of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Defense of the Russian 
Federation contain outright panegyrics to the program without 
the least attempt to investigate the essence of the arguments of 
its opponents or to respond to them. A debate, in which alone 
can the truth be born, as, equally, a foreign policy course 
acceptable to the majority, has not eventuated. 
  I shall try to fill in this gap somewhat, summarize and 
weigh 
the arguments "for" and "against," and offer the Federal 
Assembly and the executive certain conclusions. 
<H5>  I </H5>
  For the opponents of the Partnership for Peace program the 
starting point is the negative evaluation of NATO and its role 
in the modern world. They see no satisfactory answers to the 
question concerning the reasons for its preservation following 
the end of the cold war. The opinion of NATO merely as an 
instrument for securing an American military presence in Europe, 
in which Russia is interested least of all, is widely held. NATO 
was created as a global organization for containing communism, 
and even recently, when it has been confronted mainly with tasks 
of crisis management, it has, in fact, changed little in its 
doctrines, focus of operational troop training, and so forth. 
The distrust of NATO, which lurks far from just in the minds of 
certain politicians and specialists, but which is also deeply 
rooted in the public consciousness, is being carried over also 
to the Partnership, which is, not without reason, being seen as 
a form of the phased expansion of NATO. 
  Of course, we cannot hope to alter many people's suspicion 
of 
NATO overnight, especially since it is not based on sand. But 
remaining in the soil of reality, not dreams beyond the clouds, 
we cannot fail to note the strength of the arguments of the 
supporters of the preservation of NATO, primarily in the West. 
The North Atlantic bloc exists because the ruling circles of all 
its constituent countries (and of many that are not such), 
convinced of its usefulness on the basis of the experience of 
postwar development, which has made it possible, in their 
opinion, to secure the longest period of peaceful development in 
Europe's history, have an interest in this. It may be argued 
what NATO's actual role in this was, but political leaders and 
the majority of the populace in the West are reluctant to take a 
risk, destroying a structure of the need for which they are 
certain. As we are unwilling to conclusively bring down the CIS, 
whoever might desire this. NATO will exist and will have its own 
interests, which do not in all things coincide with Russian 
interests, and there is no getting away from this. Russia cannot 
force NATO to dissolve itself, and the more stridently it seeks 
this, flexing its muscles, the more arguments there will be for 
the supporters of a strengthening of Atlantic solidarity. 
  But is it advisable for Russia to join the Partnership for 
Peace, as a kind of NATO locker room, which would be seen as a 
Russian "go-ahead" for the geographical expansion of its sphere 
of influence? The opponents of the PFP rightly observe that the 
arguments of the East European countries seeking via the 
Partnership a strengthening of their security in an explosive 
region and guarantees of their sovereignty and territorial 
integrity are absolutely unacceptable to Russia. The Russian 
Federation has no enemies from whom it could be protected by 
NATO, as, equally, the problem of securing the country's 
independence with the aid of outside forces is a non-issue. We 
cannot seriously see as the point of the PFP Russia's protection 
against the territorial claims of certain Baltic states. If, on 
the other hand, what is meant is NATO's assistance in the 
security of Russia's southern and Far East borders, the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization would never assume such 
commitments. In addition, the affiliation of the Russian 
Federation and the Central Asian republics to the Partnership 
could be perceived by China as the approach of NATO right to its 
borders and could signify a complication of relations with 
Beijing. The PFP completely disregards the Chinese factor. The 
interest in the Partnership on the part of NATO is 
understandable also. In the opinion of some of our experts, this 
is not only an argument for the geographical expansion of the 
North Atlantic bloc but also an opportunity to wait out the 
development of events in Russia and, depending on their outcome, 
to create either a system opposed to it or a system 
incorporating the Russian Federation. 
  There is also talk about a certain perfidy of the West, 
which 
is endeavoring with the aid of the PFP to fill the vacuum that 
formed in East and Central Europe following Russia's abandonment 
of the "Brezhnev doctrine," the withdrawal from there of Russian 
troops, the disbandment of the Warsaw Pact, and the Russian 
Federation's consent to the unification of Germany. The 
nonexpansion of NATO was a condition of a number of unilateral 
Russian steps. 
  But what does Russia need the Partnership for? 
  An answer to this question is, indeed, hard to find if we 
proceed from the interests of the prevention of direct and 
indirect threats to Russia's security. Although here also it may 
be said that Russia has an interest in NATO responsibility for 
the stability of borders in East Europe, where there are 
potentially a multitude of destabilizing focal points capable of 
creating a threat to the Russian Federation and its citizens. 
The answer should, rather, be sought from the rule of 
contraries: What would Russia get from nonparticipation in the 
Partnership program from the viewpoint of its overall 
geopolitical positions? 
  The idea of the PFP was born, as we know, as a result of the 
insistent demands of a number of East European countries for 
their direct membership of NATO. Not ready to receive them and 
encountering the negative reaction of Russia, Western leaders 
moved toward the formulation of a compromise, of which the 
Partnership proposal was the result. That is, it remains a fact 
that the question of the expansion of NATO was placed and 
continues to be placed on the agenda, primarily by the 
governments of East European states which have for this a stable 
public consensus within their countries. Membership of NATO and 
the PFP, as a step toward membership, is for them a symbol of 
the return to Europe and a reflection of the deeply rooted fears 
(it is pointless now saying to what extent they are justified) 
in respect to their powerful eastern neighbor. And the degree of 
attraction to NATO is not connected with the ideological 
particularities of this government or the other, what is more: 
The most assertiveness is being displayed by Lithuania and 
Poland, where former communists, in fact, are in power. The 
problems of NATO's expansion via the PFP will be resolved not by 
a "vacuum" but by specific countries of East Europe, the 
influence of Russia on which has diminished unswervingly in 
recent years. Were the Russian Federation to refrain from 
participation in the PFP, East Europe would not, for all that, 
follow its example. 
  Thus whether the Partnership is realized or not will not 
depend on Russia's position. It will be realized. Whether it 
exists with Russia or without it will depend on us. If without, 
it is highly likely that this will, indeed, be a partnership 
against Russia. Participating in the program, we could influence 
its realization. Not doing so, the Russian Federation would 
forfeit every opportunity for this and would achieve nothing 
other than splendid self-isolation from the rest of Europe. 
Counting on a development of Russian policy on the southern and 
eastern azimuths is unrealistic, to say the least, considering, 
in particular, that countries of the European continent account 
for half of Russia's foreign trade turnover and the lion's share 
of the overseas capital investments coming to us. 
  At the same time, not affiliating with the Partnership, the 
Russian Federation would be cutting off for itself the 
possibility of the achievement of a number of geopolitical goals 
of considerable importance: 
  postponing the question of the immediate expansion of the 
NATO bloc and deciding on a compromise formula, influencing its 
further realization; 
  strengthening military-political cooperation along East-West 
lines; 
  enabling countries of West and East Europe to feel more 
secure, which would help beat down the "post-Zhirinovskiy" wave 
of anti-Russian sentiment there; 
  undertaking in earnest for the first time a surmounting of 
the civilization barrier between East and West and contributing 
to Russia's integration in the world community. 
<H5>  II </H5>
  A large place in the discussion of Partnership problems is 
occupied by questions of the equality of the partners and of 
Russia's participation in this program on a par with the leading 
Western countries, not only with Lithuania or Romania. Truly, 
the Partnership program specifies the equal status of the newly 
admitted participants, but not the equality of the latter and 
the NATO graybeards. Having let slip the initiative of the 
creation of the PFP, Russia let through ahead of it several of 
what are not the greatest East European states and has now found 
itself standing in a long line for membership of this program. 
If the Partnership is regarded as NATO's backup team, should 
Russia be playing for it when, on the one hand, it is in terms 
of its playing possibilities good enough for the main team and, 
on the other, it is still not a fact that it will be accepted by 
this main team. It should be agreed that there is a large 
proportion of truth in all these arguments. 
  Russia, truly, is not an ordinary "partner." It is the sole 
potential participant in the PFP which possesses nuclear weapons 
and which has, in addition, most powerful army and naval forces 
and immense scientific and technological potential. There is a 
multitude of organizations in the world, from the United Nations 
through the International Monetary Fund, which make provision 
for the special status of the most influential states. Take if 
only the UN Security Council. Unfortunately, Washington and 
Brussels did not take Russia's concern at this problem into 
account. Our diplomats also, most likely, were in too much of a 
hurry to agree to the lack of special status for Russia, 
particularly considering the information, which NEZAVISIMAYA 
GAZETA has reported also (15 March 1994), concerning the 
readiness of NATO Headquarters and the capitals of the bloc's 
leading powers to make a curtsy in Moscow's direction on this 
matter. 
  A serious opportunity for full-fledged partnership was also 
let slip right at the outset, when the program was proposed on 
behalf of NATO. Partnership as an initiative emanating jointly 
from the United States and Russia and addressed simultaneously 
to the countries of the North Atlantic bloc and East Europe 
would undoubtedly have suited us. 
  The question of the prospect of Russia's membership of NATO 
is far from having been decided. As Andranik Migranyan observed, 
"were Russia to immediately become a full member of NATO, and 
this organization became a universal structure ensuring security 
in Europe, only a madman would not support such a development of 
events." The West's consent to Russia's membership of NATO 
cannot be ruled out, but this only in the long term. At hearings 
in the Foreign Relations Committee in the U.S. Senate on 23 
March, Assistant Secretary of State S. Talbott declared that 
this could happen "when many other things have happened." Such 
wording does not, I believe, need any translation from 
diplomatic into normal language. 
  Problems of Russia's participation in the leadership of the 
PFP and the mechanism of the formulation of decisions within its 
framework still remain to be clarified. Will the decisions be 
adopted by a consensus of all the participants or will this 
prove to be the prerogative of NATO? It is perfectly obvious 
that the latter would be simply unacceptable to Russia, 
especially when we have before us the recent graphic example of 
the NATO Bosnia bombing decision, which was not coordinated with 
the Russian Federation and which was contrary to its position. 
  Experts cite one further problem in this 
connection--peacekeeping operations within the Partnership 
framework and joint maneuvers of the participants to perfect 
them, in East Europe included. The uncertainties here are 
connected with whether NATO intends to take account of Moscow's 
opinion or not when planning the forms, timeframe, scale, and 
geography of such maneuvers. If not, a threat to stability in 
East Europe could arise. 
  But despite all the complexity of the questions concerning 
the role, status, and influence of Russia in the PFP, the 
possibility in principle of their relatively acceptable solution 
cannot be ruled out either. As we know, a universal Partnership 
formula does not exist. Each country will draw up an individual 
plan of its participation, which should take account of its 
interest in this aspect of cooperation or other and its actual 
possibilities. The members of parliament did not have a chance 
to familiarize themselves with the draft of this plan. But if 
this document stipulates specific and particular forms of 
Russia's participation not in the program itself but also in its 
leadership and in joint planning, the problem of status could 
largely be resolved. Ultimately Russia's actual role will be 
determined by its actual military and economic power, which is 
many times greater than the indicators of Lithuania or Ukraine 
even. 
<H5>  III </H5>
  Pointing to the undesirability of NAT0's territorial 
expansion as an instrument for securing primarily American 
influence, the opponents of the Partnership propose that this be 
counterposed by a strengthening of cooperation within the 
framework of European and more neutral structures. In his 
message to the Federal Assembly the president of the Russian 
Federation proposed the use as a leading instrument of the 
shaping of a new system of military-political partnership not of 
NATO at all but of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council 
(NACC), which could coordinate the activity of regional 
organizations--NATO, the Western European Union (WEU), and the 
CIS. Boris Yeltsin also noted the expediency of the countries of 
Central Europe being accorded long-term guarantees on the part 
of Russia and NATO, which would become utterly meaningless 
following realization of the Partnership. 
  But counterposing European to transatlantic security 
structures is not compulsory, in my view. A strict tie to NATO 
is possible only in the event of the Partnership being the sole 
program of military-political cooperation in Europe. But I do 
not believe that such a formulation of the issue would suit 
Russia or the majority of European countries either. 
Consequently, the Partnership should be supplemented by efforts 
for the creation of additional instruments of security and 
cooperation in Europe--via a strengthening of Russian ties to 
the WEU, a corresponding expansion of the mandate of the CSCE, 
and so forth. The Partnership, which is not without problems for 
us as the sole program, would prove more acceptable as one of 
many contributing to the maintenance of peace and stability in 
the Euro-Atlantic space. 
  Publications on the PFP have paid little attention to one 
further problem which is, from my viewpoint, of considerable 
significance in a solution of the question of Russia's 
affiliation to it: What is the degree of consensus in respect to 
the Partnership and the Russian Federation's participation in it 
in the Western countries themselves? Is it not the expression of 
the position of a certain stratum of elites which could change 
with a change in political winds, which would altogether 
undermine the program's prospects? It should be noted that the 
PFP has, truly, very many opponents in the West. And criticism 
is being heard from both the conservative and the liberal camps, 
what is more. The position of the first is clearly formulated in 
a recent article by Henry Kissinger in THE WASHINGTON POST, in 
which he wrote, in part: "It (the PFP) equates the victims of 
Soviet and Russian imperialism with the imperialists themselves 
and accords the Central Asian republics bordering Afghanistan 
the same status as Poland, which has been the victim of four 
divisions with the participation of Russia and which has served 
as a route via which Russia has historically invaded Europe." 
Liberals, however, on the contrary, see no great value in the 
existence of NATO under modern conditions and would prefer that 
it operate in an unenlarged composition and that security in the 
Old World be secured by way of a deepening of the all-European 
process. 
  Agreement to Russia's participation in the PFP in Western 
capitals is of a far from unconditional nature and reflects a 
certain compromise in their ruling circles and is supported 
grudgingly by the "silent majority" of politicians, who would 
prefer to see the Russian Federation outside of NATO structures. 
But does this mean that Russia should wait for the moment when 
it ceases to be summoned to the Partnership (which could happen 
quite soon) and the problem is resolved of its own accord? The 
opposite, I am sure: Russia should not let slip the integrative 
opportunity it has been afforded. When doors are slammed shut 
for it in the Partnership, they will also close, I fear, in many 
other European and international organizations which our country 
would like to enter. Entering them would be far more difficult, 
in any event. 
<H5>  IV </H5>
  The PFP evokes serious misgivings among the participants in 
closer rapprochement of the CIS countries. The Partnership would 
be realized on an individual basis with each state, regardless 
of its membership in this organization or the other. Russia, 
individually, Belarus, individually. The concern as to how in 
this situation account would be taken of the interests of the 
CIS as a separate organization and of the existence within its 
framework of the collective security system is appropriate. 
Crudely put, would the Partnership not pilfer the Commonwealth 
of Independent States? 
  On the one hand the answer to this question will depend 
primarily on the CIS countries themselves, on their desire to 
move toward a closer alliance with one another. The individual 
membership of NATO of some and the nonparticipation of others 
did not, after all, prevent the states of West Europe from 
creating the European Community, where the level and dynamics of 
integrative processes are superior to the corresponding trends 
in the CIS. On the other, the affiliation of countries of the 
Commonwealth to the Partnership has already begun--Georgia and 
Ukraine. If Russia has no real levers for influencing the 
decision of this former Union republic or the other concerning 
membership of the PFP (as would appear to be the case now), its 
own nonparticipation would threaten it with self-isolation not 
only from East Europe but from the CIS also, which would do the 
CIS irreparable damage. If, on the other hand, we proceed from 
the presence of such levers (the factors of economic, financial, 
and energy dependence), preventing a negative development of 
events for the CIS, having harmonized among all its members the 
common principles of affiliation to the Partnership which do not 
jeopardize the Commonwealth's system of collective security, 
should constitute no difficulty for Russia. 
<H5>  V </H5>
  Finally, the last bloc of problems, connected with the 
domestic political consequences of Russia's affiliation to the 
Partnership. 
  Unfortunately, our country has never had a tradition of the 
implementation of foreign policy with regard to the frame of 
mind of society and the opinions of the opposition (which, for 
the most part, has not existed either). And, following the 
emergence of political pluralism, this tradition has had quite 
an excruciating birth. I have no information about or sense of 
the adoption of the decision on participation in the PFP having 
been preceded by soundings of public opinion or evaluations of 
the possible reaction of the main political groups and the 
short-term and long-term influence of affiliation to the 
Partnership on the alignment of political forces or of the 
formulation of a set of measures to explain the essence of the 
program to the public. At the same time, I fear that Russian 
public opinion and the politicians are far from a consensus on 
the question of the PFP and that a purely apical decision on 
membership, on not the most advantageous terms particularly, 
could add to the antireform forces' arguments in their charges 
against the government of another national humiliation. If the 
president, the Foreign Ministry, and Ministry of Defense really 
consider the Partnership acceptable for Russia, they should be 
devoting far more attention to a justification of their position 
than they are at present. Otherwise this most important foreign 
policy action could introduce a serious split in society and 
weaken the positions of these state institutions themselves. 
  I am also unfamiliar with serious estimates of the cost of 
Russia's participation in the PFP. Foreign policy is not free. 
The Partnership specifies that the main expenditure shall be 
borne by the countries that have signed the agreement 
themselves. With the present strained situation as regards the 
state budget, the question of the actual amounts would seem far 
from idle, and the Federal Assembly could hardly formulate its 
position without an answer to it. 
  Responses to the arguments of its opponents concerning the 
negative impact of the PFP on the domestic military-industrial 
complex as a result of realization of the demands that the 
participants in the Partnership adapt to the military standards 
of NATO would be of great significance for an evaluation of the 
program. In this case, the former say, the markets of the East 
European countries would be closed to Russia's arms 
manufacturers, which would make the situation in our 
military-industrial complex even worse. 
  Truly, "standardization" is a central problem. As far as I 
know, it is a question of standards of military planning, not 
official NATO standards regarding specific types of arms, 
especially since in the North Atlantic bloc itself the 
standardization of arms remains an unattainable goal. But, in 
any event, the question of the future of Russian arms exports in 
connection with affiliation to the Partnership should be 
clarified unequivocally by the departments concerned. It would 
be unacceptable to Russia were the PFP to force it to 
restructure its own military production, to purchase arms in the 
West even more. 
<H5>  VI </H5>
  Proceeding from all that has been said above, the following 
basic conclusions may be drawn. 
  The Partnership for Peace is a far from impeccable program 
and in many of its parameters it does not entirely correspond to 
Russia's national interests. But our country does not have a 
practical possibility of preventing its realization. The Russian 
Federation's nonparticipation in the Partnership would threaten 
it with serious isolation in the international arena and with a 
narrowing of the possibilities of influencing the process of the 
formation of a new Euro-Atlantic space. It is my belief that the 
negative geopolitical consequences of Russia's estrangement from 
the PFP are more appreciable than the consequences of its 
affiliation to the program. It is from this, first and foremost, 
that the chambers of the Federal Assembly should proceed when 
formulating their approaches to the Partnership. The Federal 
Assembly should, on the whole, support Russia's participation. 
  But the adoption of a final decision will be possible after 
certain conditions have been met and a number of positions 
explained: 
  1. The Federal Assembly should have an opportunity to 
closely 
study the draft program of the Russian Federation's 
participation in the Partnership. 
  2. This program should make provision for questions of the 
parties' specific obligations and Russia's participation in the 
process of the formulation and adoption of decisions at the 
level of the PFP leadership in respect to all its possible 
actions, peacekeeping operations included. The adoption of 
decisions within the Partnership framework via the NATO 
mechanism is hardly acceptable for Russia. We are interested in 
equal partnership with elements of special status. 
  3. The Partnership must not determine standards of the arms 
of the participants. 
  4. Expenditure on Russia's participation in the PFP must be 
entered as a separate line in the federal budget and approved by 
the Federal Assembly. 
  5. In connection with possible affiliation to the 
Partnership 
the president and Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of 
Defense of the Russian Federation should take decisive steps to 
harmonize questions of the participation therein of CIS 
countries, stimulate efforts geared to a strengthening of ties 
to the WEU and an expansion of military cooperation within the 
CSCE framework, and increase contacts with the Asia-Pacific 
region for the creation there of a separate system of collective 
security. The Partnership for Peace should not be the sole 
instrument of the assurance of military security in Europe and 
throughout the Northern hemisphere. 
  6. An agreement on Russia's membership of the Partnership 
must specify its ratification by the Federal Assembly. 
  There remains, of course, one further question: Will the 
government take account of parliament's opinion? 
  Since it is of a mind to participate in the Partnership for 
Peace, the executive has two main paths of advancing this idea. 
The first is to subscribe to it, having ignored the 
external legislative authority. Technically this is possible, if 
the PFP is presented as an international program, not an 
agreement requiring ratification. But such a path could hardly 
be deemed correct politically, considering the need for 
subsequent approval for the financing of the program and the 
possibility of the legislators creating an extremely unfavorable 
reputation for the Partnership in public opinion. The 
second path--more complex, but more promising 
also--is to attempt to persuade both the Federal Assembly and 
the citizens of Russia of the correctness of one's position.

<F P=106> [Article by Natalya Kalashnikova: "The West Lifts Cold War </F>
Restrictions: COCOM Is Dead, but Its Cause Lives On"] 
  [Text] COCOM was established in 1949 at U.S. 
initiative for the purpose of restricting exports of the latest 
technologies, in particular military technology, to socialist 
countries, and was based on three lists: arms, nuclear equipment 
and materials, and industry (i.e. dual-purpose technologies). In 
1991 the industrial list was replaced by a "Core List" 
containing nine sections: electronics, materials processing, 
advanced materials, telecommunication and navigational 
equipment, data security devices, sensors and lasers, marine 
vessels and equipment, and engines. In July 1992 restrictions on 
telecommunications equipment were eased, as were restrictions on 
computer exports in October 1993. With the dissolution of COCOM 
all restrictions should now be lifted. 
  As of yesterday COCOM may be considered officially defunct. 
That means that more than 300 various restrictions have been 
lifted with regard to Russia alone. Specifically, the White 
House announced that as of Monday it will allow computers 
capable of performing 1,000 million theoretical operations per 
second (roughly 100 times less powerful than the most modern 
supercomputers) to be exported to Russia. This kind of 
"concession" holds out to Americans the promise of expansion of 
their potential market by $1.3 billion in the field of computer 
exports and another $15 billion in the telecommunications field. 
But problems still remain for Russia. 
  Back in October of last year Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher put it this way: "The greater portion of 
export-import architecture rests on an outdated Cold War 
foundation. It is clear that the time has come to rebuild it." 
That rebuilding began with little delay. On 6 November 1993 the 
NATO countries plus Australia and Japan conferred and agreed in 
principle to remove the cornerstone of that foundation -- COCOM. 
And by 17 November COCOM was already sentenced to die. 
  The money-conscious Americans long ago calculated that if 
all 
restrictions on exports to Russia and China were not lifted by 
the end of the 1990's the losses to U.S. companies would be as 
much as $250 million annually, with as many as 5,000 new 
unemployed joining the soup lines each year. Bill Clinton first 
referred to his intention of lifting COCOM restrictions at a 
meeting with Boris Yeltsin in Vancouver last year. That comment 
soon grew into the "New U.S. Export Doctrine," and specifically 
to the call therein for an easing of export restrictions on 
computer equipment, including exports to Russia. Exporters had 
complained that under new geopolitical conditions the COCOM 
restrictions were like a sieve anyway and did the most harm to 
exporters. It was not surprising that probably the most active 
proponent of eliminating this favorite child of the Cold War was 
the National Association of U.S. Industrialists. Resilient COCOM 
retreated but did not surrender, immediately agreeing to lift 
restrictions on the exports of computers to Russia and China 
with a capability of 67 million theoretical operations per 
second (MTOS). It also allowed exports of more powerful 
computers: up to 100 MTOS "on a discretionary basis" and up to 
194 MTOS "by agreement with COCOM." 
  But for fairness' sake it should be noted that the COCOM 
cause is alive and triumphant. Firstly, the former members of 
COCOM intend to replace the defunct committee with a body of a 
fundamentally different political orientation and composition. 
It will deal with multilateral coordination of control over the 
proliferation of high technology. They also intend to invite 
Finland, Sweden, Austria, Ireland, New Zealand and Hong Kong, as 
well as Russia and China, to join what was formerly virtually an 
all-NATO structure. Countries that have been found to have used 
or are suspected of using imported high-tech equipment for 
military purposes -- Iran, Iraq, North Korea and Libya -- will 
be left out for now. They are the ones that are going to be 
monitored. Incidentally, this blacklist, along with the list of 
members in the "new COCOM," remains open. 
  Secondly, it is still too soon to drink a toast to the 
lifting of trade restrictions against Russia. Specifically, 
during recent meetings in Moscow the attention of U.S. Secretary 
of Trade Ron Brown was repeatedly directed to the existence of 
the long-outdated and discriminatory Jackson-Vanik Amendment. 
Nor is the situation any better with regard to trade with other 
former COCOM members. Boris Yeltsin threatened Brown with 
bringing up the issue of lifting restrictions against Russia at 
this summer's G-7 summit in Naples. So even though the last 
hatchet of the Cold War may have been buried, Russia still has 
something to fight for.

<F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Khnychkin and Yuriy Katsman: "The First </F>
`Russian' Bank Opens in the United States: There Will Be Banks 
for Russians in America and Europe"] 
  [Text] Today in many countries around the world one finds 
"Arab," "Japanese" and "Chinese" banks -- i.e. financial 
institutions that serve their own national clientele 
exclusively. Soon Russian citizens will also have the chance to 
make transactions on the international financial market through 
"their" banks. Yesterday Washington was the site of a meeting of 
a committee formed to establish a new international network of 
banks to serve the needs of Russian entrepreneurs for 
high-quality banking services abroad. There are plans to open 
the first "Russian" bank in the United States this year. 
  The idea of establishing a network of "Russian" banks abroad 
was put forward by Aleksandr Konanykhin, former president of the 
All-Russian Exchange Bank, who has been in Washington since the 
widely-publicized scandal that erupted within that bank's 
highest-level administration the year before last. Taking part 
in the project along with Mr. Konanykhin are the heads of a 
number of Russian banks which have not yet been named publicly. 
The founders refused the services of foreign investors who 
offered to help finance the program. 
  On the whole, the idea of establishing a network of 
"Russian" 
banks abroad is quite justified. Many Russian entrepreneurs are 
still unable to find a bank that suits them from the standpoints 
of quality of service and reliability. For a number of reasons 
(the unpredictable political situation, the high crime rate, and 
a certain mistrust of banks) it has been extremely difficult to 
find the desired combination of qualities in Russia. As for 
foreign banks, they are clearly not eager to work with Russian 
clients. Among the serious obstacles to the establishment of 
stable partnerships between a Russian client and a foreign bank 
are differences in business standards and the language barrier. 
On the other hand, the return on deposits offered by foreign 
banks (in the United States or Switzerland, for example) as a 
rule does not exceed 4-6 percent annually. Furthermore, Russian 
companies are often unable to manage their funds abroad 
efficiently. 
  The new banking network, establishment of which will begin 
with the United States, England and Switzerland, is intended to 
solve precisely those problems. Firstly, even though a majority 
of personnel at the new banks will presumably be comprised of 
foreign specialists (who have a wealth of experience with 
banking in their own countries), the personnel who work directly 
with clients will know Russian. Secondly, Russian customers will 
be able to able to manage funds on account with those banks 
quickly and efficiently. The necessary instructions could be 
given by phone, telex or fax, and in the entrepreneurs' native 
language. Thirdly and finally, the new banks intend to offer 
their customers a relatively high interest rate on accounts (of 
course, not the same as in Russia -- 50-60 percent annually -- 
but at least two or three times higher than the world average). 
  As envisioned by the project's organizers, the operations of 
"Russian" banks will involve not only depositing Russian 
companies' fund and managing their assets, but also financing 
foreign business transactions, participating in investment 
projects and providing accounting services. Specifically, during 
the first stage in the operations of the "Russian" bank in the 
United States, according to Mr. Konanykhin everything possible 
will be done to help attract Russian investment in the American 
economy (ownership of property in the United States is one of 
the essential conditions for obtaining a residence visa in that 
country). True, at this point it is unclear how Russian monetary 
oversight agencies will feel about the appearance of a new 
channel for capital flight from Russia.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Knyazev: "Americans To Promote Their </F>
Technologies in Russia: Oil and Gas Center Opening in Tyumen"] 
  [Text] The governments of Russia and the United States 
attach great importance to international cooperation in the oil 
and gas industry, as demonstrated by an agreement between 
Vice-President Albert Gore and Viktor Chernomyrdin to establish 
a Russian-American oil and gas technology center in Tyumen. The 
agreement was reached in mid-December 1993 during a visit to 
Russia by Mr. Gore. Yesterday an American delegation headed by 
David Pamfry, head of the U.S. Department of Energy's Department 
of Energy Research, left Tyumen after signing a specific 
agreement on establishment of the center with oblast 
administration chief Leonid Roketskiy. 
  Both sides have an interest in establishing the oil and gas 
technology center, which should begin operating this summer. 
Russia needs investment in its oil and gas complex, as well as 
U.S. equipment and technology. The Americans, according to Mr. 
Roketskiy, "are forced to resort to `migrant labor'," as their 
oil production is declining due to market forces. According to 
projections by American sources, in 1994 the United States will 
shut down approximately 50,000 wells and an equal number will 
operate below capacity if oil prices remain at the current level 
of $14 a barrel. 
  According to the charter documents drawn up by 
TyumenNIIGiprogaz [Tyumen State Scientific Research Institute 
for Gas Industry Planning] the center will collect and collate 
information, draw up technical and financial plans for the use 
of Russian technology and equipment in the United States and 
American technology and equipment in Russia, and carry out joint 
projects and research in the field of oil and gas production. 
The U.S. Government has allocated $400,000 to set up the center, 
which as a non-commercial organization will have to operate on a 
cost recovery basis. During negotiations Mr. Roketskiy stated 
that the center's opening should be noted by a Russian 
government decree, which would give the center greater 
importance. As KOMMERSANT reported yesterday, the oblast 
administration has already drafted such a decree. However, Mr. 
Roketskiy denied that by doing so the oblast is attempting to 
induce Moscow to finance the center.

<F P=106> [Article by Natalya Kalashnikova: "Investment Cooperation </F>
Between the Russian Federation and the United States: Americans 
Want To Feel at Home in Russia"] 
  [Text] If you take into account that it is a 
statutory requirement of the American Chamber of Commerce not 
only to contribute to American business in Russia but also to 
"provide for communication with the Russian Government," 
yesterday's meeting (and it takes place once a month) may be 
considered to be program-defining. The board of directors 
invited Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin to speak. The 
meeting proceeded in the traditional American style: The 
negotiating table doubled as a dinner table. True, after Mr. 
Shokhin's 40-minute speech there were so many questions about 
Russian investment legislation that the deputy prime minister 
did [not] have a chance to "lunch." 
  The American Chamber of Commerce, which has been operating 
in 
Moscow only since January, has begun to work with a knowledge of 
its task. Which is not surprising: Its board of directors 
includes representatives of the largest companies--from 
Coca-Cola to Caterpillar, from Johnson &amp; Johnson to General 
Electric, from Philip Morris to Chase Manhattan. And the 
communication with Mr. Shokhin shifted from problems of Russian 
reforms and civil accord (he noted, in particular, that 
parliament's readiness to reach agreement with the government 
should be revealed as early as Friday--during the discussion of 
the draft budget)--to questions related to business in Russia. 
Here too, as the deputy prime minister noted, on the one hand, 
Russia cannot use the old Soviet laws, and on the 
other--business conditions cannot be changed frequently. In this 
connection he recalled Boris Yeltsin's September edict which 
introduced a three-year moratorium on changing legislation 
regarding foreign firms operating in Russia. Other laws will 
also have to wait their turn--in a couple of days the civil code 
("the most productive economic document") will be submitted to 
the State Duma, and the government's immediate plans include 
laws on the banking system and foreign investments. From the 
podium of the American Chamber of Commerce the deputy prime 
minister presented an initiative to introduce one more 
moratorium. This time regarding state structures that handle 
foreign investments and redistribution of duties among them: "Or 
else we will all be 'improving' the structures but the investor, 
in confusion, will not even know with whom he is dealing." 
  The questions from the businessmen showed one thing: 
Americans, even those who have firmly set their feet on Russian 
soil along with their capital, cannot understand precisely what 
it is here that does not coincide with their native laws. For 
example, why their commercial banks and insurance companies are 
not given freedom in Russia. Mr. Shokhin had to explain that one 
strong insurance firm from the United States is capable of 
crowding out practically all similar Russian ones in a year. And 
in response to the obvious desire to feel at home in Russia 
(from the standpoint of laws) the businessmen had to hear many 
reproaches against their own authorities as well. The laws of 
the United States, according to Mr. Shokhin's estimate, contain 
up to 260 discriminatory restrictions against Russia. Bill 
Clinton promised to abolish them back in Vancouver. In Russia 
they expected that this would be done by a single act 
("restrictions regarding the USSR do not apply to Russia"), but 
"in Congress they decided to study each case individually." 
One-third of them have been abolished, but the congressmen will 
have to work another couple of years on the rest of them. So 
Russian exporters to the United States will not soon feel that 
they are equal either.

<H5>  Some Information from U.S. Investment Legislation </H5>
  --The United States does not require special permission or 
preliminary registration of investment operations. The national 
conditions envisioned for U.S. firms, as a rule, apply to joint 
companies. 
  --Federal laws prohibit foreign investors from owning or 
holding a controlling block of shares in corporations in the 
spheres of television and radio broadcasting, telegraph, and

<F P=106> [Article by Marat Salimov: "Briefing of the Association of </F>
Joint Ventures. The State May Take Back Its Words"] 
  [Text] At a news conference of the Association of 
Joint Ventures, International Associations and Organizations 
(ASP MOO) held yesterday it was announced that foreign investors 
are raising doubts about the possibility of continuing to 
operate in the Russian market. This reaction followed the 
introduction by the State Tax Service of fees collected from 
joint ventures for the utilization of phrases that contain 
phrases with words derived from the word Rossiya [Russia]. 
  This financial obligation was placed on joint ventures by 
the 
State Tax Service on the basis of the Law "On the Fee for 
Utilization of the Names 'Russia,' 'Russian Federation,' and 
Words and Phrases Based on Them," which took effect in 1993. 
Initially the fees were imposed on enterprises using these words 
and phrases as a private name. But in a letter of 14 February 
the State Tax Service made it incumbent on regional tax 
inspectorates to collect the fee from all joint ventures, since 
their registration documents where it indicates the country to 
which the enterprise belongs contain words derived from the word 
Russia. Further, so that no confusion will arise, the State Tax 
Service explained after the fact (28 March) that the fees are 
being collected from joint ventures because the rule concerning 
the use of phrases including the words "Russia" and "Russian 
Federation" as a private name had been abolished by it. 
Moreover, in addition to payment of fees for 1993, a fine of 
three times the amount of the sum of the fees was imposed on 
joint ventures. Typically, all these actions of the State Tax 
Service were approved by the Ministry of Finance. 
  The leadership of the ASP MOO was able to arrange a meeting 
with representatives of the government in which they discussed 
the question of the legality and expediency of establishing the 
fees. As a result of the conference held yesterday in the 
government with the participation of representatives of the 
association, a decision was adopted to consider the 
justification for the collection of these fees. The instructions 
of the government commission that has jurisdiction over these 
questions was signed by Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin. 
Nonetheless, the time periods for overriding the decisions of 
the State Tax Service are still uncertain. At the news 
conference held by the ASP MOO after the government conference 
its leaders characterized the establishment of fees from joint 
ventures as "unprecedented and extortionate." In particular, 
after the directive from the Russian Tax Service, one of the 
largest joint ventures, Leninvest, was presented with a bill for 
a total of 600 million rubles. As the executive vice president 
of ASP MOO, Aleksandr Pavlyukov, said at the news conference, 
this kind of interpretation of the laws by the departments and 
the very nature of the application and introduction of executive 
acts "caused shock" among the foreign founders of all joint 
ventures. In his words, which sounded like the harshest warning, 
"If as a result of the deterioration of the investment climate 
in Russia the activity of the joint ventures is curtailed, this 
will entail a reduction of jobs and will completely halt the 
influx of foreign capital."

<F P=106> [Article by Natalya Osipova and Natalya Orlova: "Ted Turner </F>
Is Playing, TV-6 Is Showing"] 
  [Text] TV-6 Moscow is no longer content with the role 
of a Moscow company. By expanding its air space and planning to 
acquire the long-awaited status of a joint enterprise, TV-6, 
together with the Turner International company, wants to make 
itself known on the whole territory of Russia and in neighboring 
countries. A discussion will be held today at the board of the 
Council of Mayors of the Cities of Northwestern Russia on the 
idea of establishing a regional television studio on the basis 
of a TV-6 affiliate in Novgorod. 
  The condition of distressful expectation for TV-6 has been 
going on for more than a year now. However, in the words of 
Aleksandr Ponomarev, the general director of Moscow Independent 
Broadcasting Corporation (MNVK), the prolonged process of 
registering the Telecompany TV-6 joint enterprise can be 
concluded this very month. According to the contract, MNVK and 
Ted Turner Corporation (equal partners underscored by equal 
shares) are the founding parties. The Americans retain 
management, since they obviously have had more success in the 
business sphere than the Russian businessmen. However, the 
Russian side will establish program policy in that it is more 
familiar with the predilections of the viewing audience. 
Advertising policy remains as before; therefore, it is unlikely 
that large commercial breaks will disappear from the air. 
  But there is also pleasant news--Eduard Sagalayev will head 
the board of directors, and he will have the last word in all 
debatable situations. Stuart Loory, now a CNN vice president, 
will hold the post of general director. Mr. Ponomarev expressed 
the Russian position: "We are creating a Russian 
telecompany with the participation of Americans." 
  For a long time, TV-6's problem was the imperfection of its 
technical equipment, as a result of which the reception of 
programs on the channel was poor, even in Moscow. This question 
finally will be resolved in the near future, inasmuch as, 
starting on 1 April, TV-6 will lease a communications satellite 
that will cover the entire territory of the former Soviet Union 
((FSU)). After being transformed in this way from a local 
channel to an international one, TV-6 will spread out its 
television network from Vilnius to Almaty (and by the end of the 
year, to Vladivostok as well). For this, MNVK is concluding a 
contract with regional nonstate companies concerning the 
organization of ground-based receiving stations. (Already now a 
three-hour bloc of the television channel is being received in 
20 cities, and the satellite will help increase the number of 
broadcasting hours up to 10.) A new transmitter of the platinum 
series by the famous American company Harris Allied, which will 
begin to operate on the Ostankino tower starting on 20 April, 
will finally improve the reception of programs in Moscow and 
nearby rayons. 
  The work is not limited to technical improvements. The 
managers of TV-6 also promised that by this autumn viewers will 
see several new Russian production programs on the air. Changes 
are also expected in the showing of movies--not only American 
films, but also European films should appear on TV-6. 
  But the best feature, documentary, and television films 
produced by the leading American film companies will be shown on 
the screens of Russian movie theaters a day before they are 
shown on TV-6. At a news conference in the Cinema Center, 
representatives of TV-6 Moscow told critics and journalists 
about the first such project--the film series "History Through 
Hollywood's Eyes." In the words of Michael Pippi, a member of 
the board of directors of Turner International, famous American 
films were used in the project that portray difficult times and 
major battles--"Watch on the Rhine," "Mutiny on the Bounty" 
(with young Marlon Brando), "Doctor Zhivago," and "Ben Hur." The 
film series will be opened by the Moscow premiers of the 
four-hour film "Gettysburg," adapted from the book of Pulitzer 
Prize laureate Michael Shaar "Angels of Death." The premiers 
will be held in the Motion Picture Center (30 April) and in the 
Amerikom Theater (1 May). Ted Turner himself played in the 
picture about the war between the North and the South: He 
heroically perished on the screen for three minutes, and he did 
this, in his own words, absolutely free of charge. 
  Fears were expressed at the news conference regarding the 
rental fate "of the picture that is splendid both in content and 
in performance," but "which will hardly do well in a videofilm 
market that is filled with fair films." Mr. Pippi noted that the 
American side sees this danger. However, Turner International 
Corporation is not betting on commercial success in Russia, but 
on the opportunity to "tell the Russians as much as possible 
about the history of America and Americans."

<F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Simonov: "MFER Decision Could Lead to </F>
Bank War"] 
  [Text] According to a decision of the board of the 
MFER [Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations] of Russia, the 
accounts of all exporters of strategically important raw 
materials commodities must be transferred to 15 authorized 
banks. Special exporters received their list yesterday, and they 
are supposed to select their financial agent by 10 April of this 
year. Otherwise, their export certificates could be 
suspended. 
  [begin box] 
<H5>  List of Authorized Banks </H5>
  1) Alpha-Bank, 2) Vozrozhdeniye [Revival], 3) Inkombank 
[Foreign Commercial Bank], 4) Kredobank [Credit Bank], 5) 
Mezhkombank [Intercommercial Bank], 6) Mosbiznesbank [Moscow 
Business Bank], 7) MEHATEP [Interbranch and Scientific-Technical 
Program], 8) Mosstroybank [Moscow Construction Bank], 9) 
International Financial Company, 10) Nezavisimost 
[Independence], 11) United Export-Import Bank, 12) Stroyinvest 
[Building Invest], 13) Stolichnyy [Capital], 14) TOKOBANK, 15) 
Moscow City Commercial Bank of Industrial Construction Materials 
  [end box] 
  MFER justifies its decision with the need to strengthen and 
streamline control over the custody of the receipts of special 
exporters (only oil and oil products for the time being). For 
example, Vladimir Koshel, chief of the main administration for 
the protection of state interests of the MFER, declared that to 
control special exporters through a large number of banks was 
for him personally "a task beyond my strength," and, therefore, 
only several representatives among the major banks were 
assigned. The "fact of the concurrence of the banks to sign an 
agreement with the MFER was the criterion for selection." 
  Of course, as it turned out, only these same 15 banks were 
acquainted with the text of the MFER agreement, which, as a 
result, ended up on the announced list. But, at the very least, 
this looks strange. For example, several major banks that 
specialize in servicing enterprises of the raw materials 
branches were not acquainted with MFER's intentions (and, 
consequently, they did not get on the cherished list) (among 
these are the Promstroybank [Industrial Construction Bank], 
International Moscow Bank, Imperial, Yugorskiy, Russian Credit, 
Surgutneftegaz [Surgut Oil and Gas], Yurga, Neftekhimbank [Oil 
and Chemical Bank], Zapsikombank [West Siberian Commercial 
Bank], and Tyumenpromstroybank [Tyumen Industrial Construction 
Bank]. Also absent from the list is the Vneshtorgbank [Foreign 
Trade Bank], which handles the accounts of almost 30 percent of 
the special exporters. At the same time, the little-known 
Nezavisimost Bank, which was only registered on 2 March of last 
year, was among the authorized banks, and also the Moscow Alpha 
Bank, which has a rather remote relationship to servicing 
special exporters (if, of course, it is not taken into account 
that Petr Aven, the chairman of the bank board, headed the MFER 
at one time). 
  However, as Mr. Koshel assured a KOMMERSANT-DAILY 
correspondent, the list of authorized banks is not final in 
nature. Thus, at the present time, allegedly, the Vneshtorgbank, 
the International Moscow Bank, and Imperial have already been 
added. Nevertheless, the exporters who are supposed to determine 
the selection of a financial agent do not know about this. 
  There is also another problem. In the course of the next day 
or two, the clients that are "moving" are supposed to notify 
their partners about new payment requisitions and also pay off 
credit indebtedness to the banks that service them. The process 
of the shift of clients to other banks can also be complicated 
by the fact that frequently the following item is included in 
contracts on account servicing: The transfer is possible only 
after the complete payment of debt to the previous financing 
agent. 
  Finally, it cannot be ruled out that the newly-fledged banks 
will not be able to observe one of the main 
normatives--sufficiency of capital. It is possible that it was 
this fact that troubled the Central Bank, with whom the 
announced list was not coordinated. In an interview with 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY, representatives of the bank, in particular, 
declared that, if the MFER decision will not be revised, "they 
will publicize facts on some of their so-called authorized 
banks." To which Mr. Koshel responded that Dmitriy Tulin, a 
deputy chairman of the Central Bank, who led the discussions 
with the MFER, "either did not understand the employees of the 
ministry, or he is doing the bidding of banks that are not among 
those that are authorized." However, as became known, the 
Central Bank in principle is not against the idea of limiting 
the circle of banks that work with special exporters. Moreover, 
according to some information, the Central Bank is actively 
working on the compilation of its own list of their financial 
agents. 
  There is no doubt that differences exist among the 
departments, and also that the negligent attitude of the 
controlling structures toward legislation is stimulating yet 
another wave of bank wars for the right to service such a 
profitable clientele. In addition, there are a lot of volunteers 
for taking part in it and, probably, among the Russian 
officials, more and more of those will be found who give 
preference to one or another successful commercial structure. 
Understandably, the MFER made its decision under pressure no 
less than that which, in the words of Mr. Koshel, is being 
experienced today by Dmitriy Tulin. It is also understandable 
that lobbyist efforts of some banks will negate their appeals 
for a banking fraternity. 
  [begin box] 
  In the opinion of a high-ranking MFER employee, whom the 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent was able to contact, the adopted 
decision will not cause any serious damage to the development of 
exports and banking activity in Russia. All of the special 
exporters were notified ahead of time about the possibility of 
such a step by the government. As for the list of banks with 
whom the special exporters were authorized to interact, it, in 
the opinion of the MFER representative, is quite broad. 
Moreover, if any bank from among those that did not get on the 
list submits an application on the conduct of operations as a 
special exporter, the MFER will examine it without fail. The 
MFER representative also noted that the initiative for the 
adoption of the document did not come from the ministry, but 
from First Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Oleg Soskovets. 
  [end box] 
<H5>  Commentary </H5>
  A reduction in the authorized banks that service the 
currency 
accounts of special exporters constitutes a long-standing dream 
of Russian currency controllers--everyone is trying to make life 
easier for himself. On 30 March at the last meeting of the 
governmental commission on current questions, Viktor Kunya, the 
head of the Federal Currency and Export Control Service, 
complained that the special exporters of oil each have several 
currency accounts even in Russian banks. But the MFER, 
cherishing a unified automated currency control system, at one 
time nurtured the idea of reducing the number of authorized bank 
holders of accounts of special exporters to 10, and a pertinent 
draft even existed of an MFER agreement with selected banks. 
Later, it is true, the necessity for such an agreement 
disappeared, inasmuch as special exporters now, "at their own 
desire" submit information to the MFER concerning the movement 
of currency in their own currency accounts (which allows the 
ministry to get the right that is not given it by the law on 
currency regulation and currency control). However, considering 
the decision of the aforementioned meeting of the commission on 
current questions, which recommended to the Central Bank to 
establish by 1 May the authorized banks that will be granted the 
exclusive right to conduct currency operations associated with 
the export of oil and oil products, the MFER, apparently, 
decided to return to its old "compilation" and submit to the 
Central Bank an already preliminarily worked out list of banks. 
The final decision, of course, rests with the Central Bank. 
  In principle, the reduction in the number of authorized 
banks 
permitted to have the accounts of special exporters should be 
looked at in the overall context of reinforced currency control, 
which has been transformed, as KOMMERSANT-DAILY has repeatedly 
written, into a key element of foreign economic regulation. In 
addition, the administrative pressure that Russian exporters 
have long since felt on themselves, is now also being applied to 
commercial banks as well.

<F P=106> [Article by Tatyana Korotkova: "Importers Are Deprived of </F>
Yet Another Tax Niche"] 
  [Text] The Russian State Customs Committee's new directive 
"On the Application of the Special Processing Customs 
Classification," which the directors of customs agencies 
received yesterday, is aimed, first and foremost, at clearly 
defining the framework in which the special processing 
classification is to be applied, and at stopping potential 
attempts to apply it inappropriately. 
  The State Customs Committee's directive is a temporary 
normative act that remains in force, as indicated in the Customs 
Code, until comprehensive regulations regarding the processing 
classification are promulgated. The new document specifies, in 
part, that goods may be imported for processing only by 
enterprises at which processing operations are included in the 
normal production process. And goods subject to excise tax may 
not be considered goods for processing at all. Moreover, if 
goods imported for processing are placed into free circulation 
on the internal market (which is permitted), a duty, the 
value-added tax and a special tax must be paid. 
  In the opinion of experts, the special processing customs 
classification is not particularly relevant to Russia at 
present, given the present capabilities of its production 
branches. Experience indicates that Western partners are 
interested in processing goods at Russian facilities only when 
what is involved are hazardous production processes that are 
restricted or banned altogether in most developed countries. 
Therefore, when goods are brought into Russia for processing, 
what is usually involved is the importation of waste products of 
the chemical industry or nuclear power engineering. However, 
even without the special directive, operations to process such 
goods may be carried out only after special permission (a 
license) is received from the Ministry of Foreign Economic 
Relations. At the same time, it is no secret that the special 
processing classification has often taken the place of the 
temporary importation classification, especially since the 
introduction of procedures requiring mandatory advanced payments 
when various property is imported on a temporary basis (for a 
period of up to one year). On the other hand, in the absence of 
a normative basis, the special processing classification has 
been used as a niche for evading excess taxes when goods subject 
to excise tax were imported. For example, the ordinary decanting 
of alcohol from barrels into half-liter bottles was called 
processing. So now importers have lost the possibility of 
utilizing the processing classification, under which customs 
duties are not collected, in order to relieve their tax burden. 
<H8>  Some Mandatory Conditions for the Importation of Goods Under </H8>
the Special Processing Classification in Accordance With 
Directive No. 01-12/74 of the Russian State Customs Committee 

  -  Goods are imported into Russia for processing by the 
enterprises that directly carries out the processing operations, 
and are produced in accordance with the enterprise's usual 
production process. 
  -  The goods imported for processing are not subject to excise 
tax. 
  -  The level of customs duties on the goods imported for 
processing does not exceed 100 percent of their value. 
  -  The processing period is no longer than six months. 
  -  The enterprise submits a pledge to a customs agency that the 
products of processing will be re-exported in accordance with 
customs export regulations.

<F P=106> [Article by Vadim Bar[surname partially illegible]: "Agency </F>
for Supporting Investments Established"] 
  [Text] In accordance with a government decree "On the 
Organization of Work With Foreign Investments and on Consulting 
and Technical Assistance," which was received yesterday for 
official distribution, a federal project financing center is 
being established under the Ministry of Economics. Thus, there 
is now a federal agency that will assume the functions of 
translating Russian projects for attracting foreign investments 
into a language understandable to Western financiers. 
  Foreign investments are not enjoying good fortune in Russia. 
First of all, they entail very considerable political risk: 
events last September and October, the results of the 12 
December elections, and the reversals associated with the recent 
amnesty act are all things that do not dispose people to invest 
money in a "base" that has a "superstructure" of that sort. 
Second, Russian inflation and taxes are ardently competing with 
one another in rendering any investment activity altogether 
meaningless. Third, the country is not following any purposeful 
policy for attracting foreign investments, the lack of which is 
reflected in the absence of any economically backed priorities 
for attracting them, and of an appropriate organizational basis 
for doing so. It is no surprise that, according to data on the 
Russian balance of payments, the amount of direct foreign 
investments dropped from $800 million in 1992 to $600 million in 
1993. 
  For all practical purposes, the new federal center has been 
established in place of the Russian Agency for International 
Cooperation and Development (RAMSIR). For all the importance of 
pre-investment research and the expert review of proposed 
financing arrangements, the replacement is plainly not an equal 
one. Technically, RAMSIR has not been abolished, and no one has 
removed Aleksandr Shokhin, who has again become a vice-premier, 
from the office of the agency's chairman. In essence, the 
division of RAMSIR between the Ministry of Foreign Economic 
Relations and the Ministry of Economics has been completed: the 
Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations has formed a chief 
administration that is concerned with investment cooperation, 
i.e., with the construction of facilities in Russia (and that 
has no direct relation to foreign investments), while the 
Ministry of Economics has formed the federal center. And the 
investors themselves, while acquiring an agency for the 
"provision of expert consulting support for investment 
projects," have lost an official defender of their interests in 
the Russian government. 
  The establishment of the center also indicates that, under 
conditions in which the attraction of direct foreign investments 
has not been crowned with success, reliance can be placed on 
investment credits. If that is the case, the center possesses 
certain weaknesses, since it acts only as a state middleman in 
bringing investment projects up to the stage of implementation. 
But those same functions, in principle, should be performed by 
banks that undertake the financing of projects. In this 
connection, one may recall the postponed project for 
establishing a specialized project financing bank with a network 
of branches throughout Russia.

Development (RAMSIR), as an agency for the development and 
implementation of a policy for attracting foreign investments, 
headed by Vice-Premier Aleksandr Shokhin (the statute on it was 
confirmed by a 12 December 1992 government decree). 
  January 1994--RAMSIR, with the clearly reduced but 
little-understood status of a "state institution," is 
transferred to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Foreign 
Economic Relations (the 10 January 1994 presidential edict "On 
the Structure of Federal Agencies"). 
  March--the functions of attracting foreign investments, 
including pre-project studies, are assigned to the 
Ministry of Economics (a 28 March 1994 government 
decree). 
  April--the Project Financing Center is established 
under the Ministry of Economics (4 April 1994 government decree 
"On the Organization of Work With Foreign Investments and on 
Consulting and Technical Assistance").

<F P=106> [Article by Katarina Koivisto: "Neste's Natural Gas Unit To </F>
Become Gasum -- One-Fourth of the Firm Will Be Russian Owned"] 
  [Text] The Russian gas company Gasprom is paying about 250 
million markkas for a 25-percent interest in Neste's natural gas 
unit. The agreement giving Gasprom one-fourth of the natural gas 
unit, which will be incorporated at the same time under the name 
Gasum, was signed on Saturday [12 March] while Russian Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin was visiting Neste. An agreement on 
increased gas imports from Russia was signed at the same time. 
  Imatran Voima [IVO], the other state-owned energy company, 
also signed an energy agreement with Russia on Saturday. IVO 
signed a framework agreement to modernize and improve a total of 
16 thermal power plants and their related district heating 
systems in the area around St. Petersburg. The agreement calls 
for work worth close to 1 billion markkas. 
  The Russian gas company Gasprom is the world's largest 
producer of natural gas, and it has already bought shares in 
other Western gas companies -- in Germany, for example. 
Gasprom's purchase of Neste's natural gas unit is completely in 
line with the concept governing the firm's activities in the 
rest of the world, says Rem Vyahirev, Gasprom's chief manager. 
  The Gasum Corporation will begin its activity on 1 May this 
year and will operate as a subsidiary of the Neste Group. Plans 
also call for listing Gasum on the stock exchange, but that will 
not happen for at least a year -- after the company has produced 
its first balance sheet, says Neste President Jaakko Ihamuotila. 
  Gasum's balance sheet will total about 2.5 billion markkas, 
and its capital stock will amount to 40 percent of that amount, 
or about 1 billion markkas. Gasprom is therefore subscribing to 
25 percent of the stock. 
  Gasprom became a part owner of Gasum at Neste's initiative, 
says Ihamuotila, who says the fact that the gas supplier is also 
a partner in the sales and distribution firm represents a 
strengthening of the Finnish natural gas market. 
  "It guarantees us an uninterrupted supply of gas," said 
Ihamuotila, who pointed out at the same time that guaranteed 
deliveries have never been a problem in the past either. 
<H5>  New Transport Capacity </H5>
  Ihamuotila predicts that by the turn of the century, natural 
gas consumption in Finland will have increased 50 percent over 
its current level of just over 3 billion cubic meters per year. 
Under the import agreement signed on Saturday, imports from 
Russia will rise to just above 4 billion cubic meters per year 
over a 20-year period. 
  Increased imports mean that transport capacity from Russia 
and within Finland will also increase: A new compressor station 
north of St. Petersburg and a parallel pipeline from there to 
the Finnish border are planned. Planning is also under way for a 
parallel pipeline between Imatra and Lappeenranta and from the 
latter locality to Kouvola and Mantsala. 
<H5>  Door Open to Norway </H5>
  Neste estimates that Finland's annual natural gas 
requirement 
could rise to nearly 8 billion cubic meters per year if the 
Finnish gas pipeline is extended to the west coast and if 
natural gas is also used to produce electricity. An option on 
further imports from Russia is included in the agreement signed 
on Saturday, but Neste also wants to keep the door open for gas 
imports from Norway. The Finnish Government also says that a 
second source of natural gas is necessary if the gas network is 
to be expanded. 
  The Russian interest in Neste's Gasum does not markedly 
alter 
the Nordic gas picture. Both Finland and Norway are still 
waiting for Sweden to reach a decision on natural gas so they 
will know whether a pipeline can be built to Sweden's Uppland 
coast. That pipeline would then link up with the pipeline being 
extended to Uusikaupunki on the Finnish side. 
  No political decision is expected in Sweden before this 
fall's election, but Swedish industry may very well take the 
initiative in introducing natural gas imports from Norway. 
Industry wants to ensure its supply of energy even if Sweden 
goes ahead with plans to phase out nuclear power. 
  A Nordic gas pipeline would also suit Gasprom and the export 
firm Gasexport because it would open up the possibility of 
exporting Russian gas to Sweden as well. 
  The Norwegians and the Finns are both hoping for a 
relatively 
quick decision by the Swedes. The Norwegians must decide whether 
to extend their gas pipelines further south in the direction of 
Central Europe, where there is a big market. For their part, the 
towns on Finland's west coast, which are potentially big gas 
consumers, will soon have to make decisions about their future 
energy supplies. 
  The increased quantities of Russian gas that Neste agreed to 
on Saturday will be used mainly by combined power and district 
heating plants, where they will replace coal as an energy source. 
  Gasprom, which was formerly a state-owned Russian firm, is 
now a corporation in the process of being privatized. Some of 
the stock has been sold to employees, and some has been bought 
by the regional gas companies that all deliver their gas through 
Gasprom. Last year nearly 100 billion cubic meters of gas were 
exported, and the company plans to increase its exports beyond 
that. 
<H5>  IVO To Be Paid in Coal and Oil </H5>
  For its part, the agreement that Imatran Voima signed on 
Saturday to modernize Russian power plants will improve energy 
efficiency and reduce effluent at power plants in our near 
vicinity. IVO had previously participated in mapping out the 
possibilities for modernizing power plants in neighboring areas. 
  "Financing is always a tough problem, and we are doing what 
we can to help find alternative forms of payment," says IVO Vice 
President Anders Palmgren. Under the terms of Saturday's 
agreement, the Russian partner will pay for the modernization of 
the power plants using the energy raw material that is saved as 
a result of that modernization, meaning primarily oil or coal. 
The projects will also be paid for partly in electricity 
exports. Palmgren says that exchange or barter arrangements of 
many different kinds may be considered. 
  IVO's agreement to import electricity from Russia through 
the 
end of the century is not affected by Saturday's agreement. 
Palmgren says that a possible extension of that agreement will 
not be discussed before 1997.

<F P=106> [Article by Katarina Koivisto: "Nordic Natural Gas Network </F>
`Utopia'"] 
  [Text] Sweden will be able to develop its natural gas 
network only on the basis of strictly commercial principles, and 
if those principles are followed, it will not be possible to 
make natural gas pay its way. That makes Sweden the missing link 
in a Nordic natural gas network, and a network supplying Finland 
with Norwegian natural gas will not come into being. 
  That is the conclusion drawn by Danish researcher Niels Moe 
of the Trade and Technology Development Board (NUTEK) in 
Stockholm. 
  Moe has drawn up a report for the Nordic Council of 
Ministers 
on "energy policy as planned and in actuality in the Nordic 
countries." The views in that report are Moe's own, however, and 
were not discussed by the Council of Ministers. 
  And disagreeing with Moe completely is the Council of 
Ministers' information group on gas issues, which is to submit a 
report of its own to the council next fall. The attitude toward 
a Nordic natural gas network is more positive within that group. 
It feels that there is in Sweden a disguised energy requirement 
that is not yet being talked about because many questions 
surrounding the phasing out of nuclear power are unanswered. At 
any rate, more and more political initiatives in favor of 
natural gas are now appearing in Sweden. 
  Niels Moe also notes in his report that the political 
attitude toward natural gas has recently turned more favorable 
in Sweden. But while it is easy to show political will, it is an 
entirely different thing to actually implement a decision on 
natural gas, he says. 
  "As I see it, the matter has actually already been decided," 
says Moe. "There will not be a Nordic natural gas network. A gas 
network requires new infrastructure, Sweden is big and sparsely 
populated, and it is very hard to make gas pay today. It is not 
enough to express political will; one must follow up those 
expressions of will with other measures." 
<H5>  No Champion </H5>
  At the moment, there is no champion -- no company or 
combination of companies -- that would exploit natural gas in 
Sweden. Getting a gas project going in central Sweden would 
require such a champion, and if no Swedish champion can be 
found, there may be a possibility that foreign interests would 
step into the Swedish natural gas market. 
  The advocates of natural gas feel that the entire gas issue 
must be looked at from a longer perspective, even though 
concrete decisions are gradually becoming more and more urgent. 
The Norwegians will be forced within a couple of years to decide 
where to export gas from the new Haltenbanken field: to the 
Nordic Region or to Germany and Central Europe. 
  The possibility that the Nordic countries will join the 
European Union (EU) is also placing the gas issue in a new 
light. The EU is offering support for the construction of new 
infrastructure, meaning, for example, a gas pipeline. The same 
support may be considered for Finland when the decision on a 
pipeline from the Stockmanovskoye field in northern Russia is 
made. 
<H5>  No Market in Sweden? </H5>
  Niels Moe is very pessimistic about the Swedish market for 
gas. There is no market in Sweden that would be big enough even 
if electricity production were based on natural gas, he feels. 
In today's situation, a Nordic natural gas network amounts to 
unrealistic wishful thinking. 
  It is not just the Swedish market for natural gas that is 
too 
small, according to Moe. There is also a possibility that 
natural gas use in the network already developed in Finland will 
not be as high as expected. In a situation of free competition, 
there may be many suppliers in Finland offering cheap energy -- 
district heating plants and thermal power plants, for example -- 
to today's big users of natural gas. The government's policy of 
facilitating the market position of gas through environmentally 
motivated energy taxes may improve the position of gas, Moe says. 
  Moe also discusses Finland's other energy sources in his 
report, pointing out that Finland has an all-round supply with 
many different energy systems and a concentration on many 
different fuels that, combined with a well-developed district 
heating system, provide it with good opportunities for 
converting to environmentally friendly energy systems. But 
Finland's rejection of additional nuclear power will cause 
discharges of nitrogen, sulfur, and carbon dioxide to increase. 
  Finland has supported the use of domestic fuels such as 
peat, 
Moe notes in his report. But with a deregulated energy market in 
Finland, the danger exists that firms will choose the cheapest 
way to produce energy, and in today's price situation, that 
favors the use of oil and natural gas over domestic fuel 
production.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Russian Trade Revives"] </F>
  [Text] Over half of Finland's imports from Russia still 
consist of some form of energy, according to the Customs 
Department's trade statistics for last year. 
  Trade between Finland and Russia last year again rose above 
its 1991 level, and Finnish exports to the East consisted mainly 
of machinery, equipment, and means of transportation. Those 
exports exceeded 6 billion markkas in value and accounted for a 
total of 4.5 percent of our foreign trade. For its part, the 
value of Finnish imports from Russia was close to 8 billion 
markkas. 
  Exports of machinery and equipment to Russia were twice what 
they were the year before, accounting in total for nearly half 
of Finnish exports. The most important single export items were 
telephone and radio sets. 
  Food exports to Russia tripled last year, and one-fourth of 
all Finnish food exports go to Russia. Beverage and food exports 
exceeded 1 billion markkas last year, and nearly one-fifth of 
those exports consisted of fruit and vegetables. 
  The slowest growth last year was recorded by the textile and 
garment industry. Clothing purchases for Russia totaled just 
over 120 million markkas, while shoes accounted for nearly 110 
million markkas. 
  Energy continues to dominate Finnish imports from Russia, 
although petroleum quantities are below the levels achieved 
during the peak years in the late 1980's. Petroleum imports last 
year were at the same level as in 1992: approximately 3 billion 
metric tons, or about one-third of total imports. 
  Imports of natural gas have increased and account for 
one-fifth of total imports, while coal stands just under 5 
percent and direct electric current accounts for nearly 10 
percent of imports. Timber accounts for over 10 percent of total 
imports. Timber imports, mostly in the form of logs, are rising 
steadily.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Avdeyev, KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA </F>
correspondent: "Japanese Operating Illegally in Russian Waters. 
Lieutenant Colonel Oleg Petrov: The Kuril String Has Been 
Stretched to Breaking Point"] 
  [Text] South Kuril Islands--On the evening of 15 April two 
Japanese fishing schooners burst at terrific speeds into our 
territorial waters and, taking into account the power of 
additional mounted motors, rushed to the southern shore of the 
island of Kunashir. They penetrated five and seven miles deep 
into our territory. It was little more than a mile to the shore. 
The radar stations at border observation posts fixed the place 
of entry and information about the violators was sent to a 
patrol helicopter. 
  The commander of the helicopter crew turned his vehicle 
around and began to pursue the targets. On the radar monitoring 
lines there was a large amount of interference suddenly out of 
nowhere and a couple of minutes after entering the zone of the 
violation the helicopter crew saw only the rapidly moving 
targets headed back to the shores of Hokkaido and they were 
forced to report that, as always, the violators got off free. 
  Along the border in the Japanese territorial waters 15 more 
boats like these stood waiting under the protection of a ship of 
the UBM--Japan's administration of security in the sea. 
  On that same morning there had been another such entry of 
Japanese ships into our territorial waters. Again two 
helicopters from the South Kuril Border Detachment base flew out 
in response to the alarm. But they did not manage to apprehend 
the violators either. And through channels of Japan's diplomatic 
department came information about Russian helicopters firing on 
Japanese schooners. During the night the helicopters again flew 
out to make an arrest and again returned empty-handed. 
  During a meeting the detachment chief, Lieutenant Colonel 
Oleg Petrov noted in passing that the Japanese had made four 
such trips during the 24-hour period. "They wait us out until we 
are tired." He had almost no doubt that yesterday's violation 
was purely to provoke us. The radar interference, in Petrov's 
opinion, was most likely created by the ship's guard. "The Kuril 
string has been stretched to breaking point," he said. "And the 
problem will not go away of its own accord...." 
  The end of April marked the beginning of the fishing season 
in the South Kurils. The border guards scheduled their operation 
"Fishing Season-94" to coincide with that. And although 
protection of the fish stocks in Russia's economic zone is a 
part of the daily duty of our border guards, during this period 
they increase the number of ships and flight-hours in the 
"crime" zone and work practically without resting. 
  During the past year alone in the zone covered by the South 
Kuril Border Detachment 9,000 illegal crossings of the state 
border of Russia were registered. The damage from the "industry" 
of Japanese poachers amounted to $160 million. 
  It usually goes like this: The schooner goes two or three 
miles into our waters, drops nets during the night, and returns 
to get them at dawn. The fish inspectors take something out of 
the rigging, the border guards take something, but most 
frequently the poachers leave with their catch. And they fish in 
the preserves and spawning regions. After this the crab and red 
fish will not reproduce here for a couple of years. 
  In Krabovaya Bay on Shikotan I met the captain of the 
Japanese schooner Yukimaru-68, Mr. Keiichi Noto. Rather, he 
should be called citizen, since he was under investigation by 
the local procuracy, was wounded in the leg by a Kalashnikov 
during his arrest, and his ship is among 20 others of the same 
kind that were being held at the facility of the outpost. For 
the first time in the entire history of our relations, at the 
request of the city of Nemuro the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of 
Russia permitted him to meet with his relatives and a doctor 
from Japan. 
  The snow white ship of the "neighbors'" border guard dropped 
anchor in an out-of-the-way place in the bay and Noto's father, 
his wife, and his wife's brother boarded the border cutter to 
see citizen Noto. Our border guards transferred about a dozen 
and a half boxes of groceries from one vessel to the other. Noto 
was calm and self-confident. Even if our court were to sentence 
him for poaching and violating the State Border (which, for some 
reason, happens extremely rarely), Japan's legislation does not 
envision any punishment for such acts; they consider Russia's 
territorial waters to be alien territory. It is worse if they do 
their poaching at home--then they take away not only the fishing 
license but also the schooner and the fishing equipment. 
  In the district of Nemuro, which borders on Yuzhno-Kurilskiy 
Rayon, there are more than 5,000 small fishing vessels. And only 
39 of them have licenses to fish in our waters. They have 
exhausted their own fish stocks and prices have increased 
severalfold. And here the richest stocks have not been touched: 
The Russians are either dividing up quotas or looking for diesel 
fuel--but they do not fish at all. The free goods beg to be 
taken. The more so since one trip is quite enough to pay for the 
rental of a schooner and you can live for a whole year on the 
money you earn. A significant proportion of Nemuro's economy, 
according to our specialists, is made up of income from poaching 
in Russian waters. Practically all of this industry is 
controlled by the Japanese mafia--Yakuza. 
  Recently the border guards have been dealing with the 
overdue 
problem as never before. The government has issued them a little 
fuel, the law has more or less untied their hands and allows 
them to use force where needed. But what does force mean in this 
complex, not so much economic as political situation? We flew 
around the regions of the Minor Kuril Range in an airplane and 
helicopter and we saw one completely covered schooner--all the 
numbers and the name were covered up, and even the outline of 
the ship was concealed by a tent. It was clearly a poacher. He 
would defend himself to the death from the inspection group. If 
boarded, they would fight. 
  And in order to photograph it we barraged the sea for a half 
hour in hedge-hopping flight. Each hour of flying time, 
incidentally, costs almost 2 million rubles. Naturally, there 
are weapons on board. And every time as soon as our craft flew 
up to the border a pair of Phantom fighters would take off from 
the Japanese base and fly parallel to us. 
  Is it a long way from political standoff to 
military-political conflict... 
  "It is unreasonable to keep such large forces here just to 
fight against poachers," many sober-minded border guards said. 
"We could protect the border at a smaller price. We just have to 
reach an agreement with our neighbors. If they have no fish--let 
them fish here for now, but for money. Our fleet is standing 
idle anyway. So sell them licenses, assign them quotas, and 
designate the regions for temporary fishing. They will agree to 
this, believe me. And somewhere here we can look for a solution 
to the problem of the 'northern territories' as well." 
  As distinct from politicians, border guards also do work. 
They do not want to feed the Japanese mafia. Just because of 
their barrier the Japanese for the first time this year appealed 
to the Sakhalin administration to sell them fish. 
  Incidentally, when Japanese Foreign Affairs Minister Butomu 
Hata was in Moscow, poachers' schooners made no trips into our 
waters at all. And now they say that Mr. Hata is aspiring to be 
prime minister. Can we really not work something out?... 
  ...The day on which the ship carrying Captain Noto's 
relatives arrived in our waters in the Kurils was quite calm. 
But as soon as the ship departed during the night two 
helicopters again had to respond to the alarm: another raid in a 
manner traditional for poachers. We flew into the region where 
the violation was committed and after a couple of minutes of 
observation saw how two high-speed schooners were rushing out of 
our territorial waters. The border guards' ship was too late 
again.

<F P=106> [Article by Leonid Mlechin: "Kim Il-song Dreams of Getting </F>
Along With the Americans: And They Are Squeamishly Turning Their 
Backs on the Old Dictator"] 
  [Text] The Korean crisis has been engendered by the 
West's incapacity for understanding what is going on in the 
minds of the communist leaders. 
  The Korean nuclear crisis could be terminated in two 
instances: if Kim Il-song departs this life or if the United 
States conceives a desire to come to terms with Pyongyang. 
<H5>  What Is Driving the Great Leader? </H5>
  Being a dictator is good for the health. The great leader 
Kim 
Il-song was 82 on 15 April, and he is sound in body and mind. He 
has kept politicians guessing for almost a year: Does Kim have a 
nuclear bomb or not? 
  Meanwhile, the armies of both Koreas have been put on alert. 
A battalion of American Patriot air defense missiles, which from 
the experience of the war with Iraq in the Persian Gulf are 
considered the most dependable means of combating Scud ballistic 
missiles, is being transferred to the south of the peninsula. A 
Patriot battalion means approximately 200 missiles and 850 
service personnel. The missiles will be deployed so as to ensure 
cover for military airfields and ports, at which American ships 
with reinforcements would call, in the event of an attack from 
the North. 
  The appearance of the Patriot missiles is being perceived in 
Pyongyang as preparation for aggression. North Korea has 
declared that if it is threatened, war will begin. 
  The West is captive to false alternatives and is deciding 
what is more dangerous: permitting North Korea to create its own 
nuclear weapons or organizing a second Korean war. 
  Everyone is asking: What is driving Kim Il-song? To what end 
is Pyongyang making the whole world, virtually, its enemy? What 
does Pyongyang need an atomic bomb for? 
  Do the North Korean leaders believe that it is possible, 
finally, with the aid of a bomb to complete the great cause of 
the country's unification? 
  Or are the Pyongyang leaders driven by fear? And they need 
the bomb as a guarantor for their own survival in a world in 
which there are virtually no islets of real socialism left? 
<H5>  Blackmail </H5>
  Meanwhile, Kim Il-song's aim is obvious. He is blackmailing 
South Korea and in actual fact appealing to the United States. 
He needs full diplomatic recognition and, possibly, some 
material assistance. He wants to leave his son and heir, Kim 
Chong-il, a stable country in more or less favorable 
international surroundings. But Kim Il-song is not in a position 
to say plainly what he wants. 
  He retains the hope that Washington will succumb to 
blackmail, and for this reason everything moves in a closed 
circle. 
  The DPRK declared that it would withdraw from the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty, then stayed put, all the same, and is 
now once again threatening to pull out. IAEA inspectors were 
asked to leave the DPRK, then they were admitted, kicked out 
once again, and again invited back. The United States agreed to 
negotiations with the DPRK, then refused, agreed once again, and 
once again refused. 
  The United States, by all accounts, does not wish to soil 
its 
hands and conclude some agreements with Kim Il-song. North Korea 
is of no key significance for world or even regional policy, and 
Washington has decided, it has to be assumed, that it can 
perfectly well wait for the great leader to depart this world 
and for some changes in the country to begin. 
  The United States is setting prior conditions for Pyongyang: 
an exchange of envoys between North and South and agreement to 
the inspection of the nuclear facilities. When Pyongyang 
declined an exchange of envoys, the anticipated Geneva 
negotiations between representatives of the United States and 
the DPRK were canceled. 
<H5>  Is There a Bomb? </H5>
  All this notwithstanding, Kim Il-song is undoubtedly 
dreaming 
of his own nuclear bomb. In what way is he worse than Stalin or 
Mao, who saw the possession of nuclear weapons as the basis of 
their power and influence? 
  American specialists maintain that the DPRK already has one 
or two nuclear weapons. But there is no proof of this claim. 
China's composed attitude toward the situation on the Korean 
Peninsula is explained, possibly, by the fact that Beijing's 
leaders, who are better informed as to Pyongyang affairs than 
anyone, know that Kim Il-song has no bomb. 
  Pyongyang is refusing to admit experts of the IAEA to the 
radiochemical laboratory that, it is believed, is engaged in the 
enrichment of plutonium. This is giving rise to suspicions, but 
this is only indirect evidence. We know of the mania for secrecy 
characteristic of all socialist regimes. In addition, if it is 
ascertained that there is no bomb, Kim Il-song would be left 
looking like a fool. He would like to avoid this unpleasant 
affirmation. 
  It is hard to imagine that North Korea, where intellectual 
potential has been destroyed for decades, is capable of 
providing itself with nuclear weapons. Had a nuclear explosive 
device been created, Kim Il-song would be in a hurry to test it 
to convince himself of the success. And all nuclear tests are 
easily recorded. 
<H5>  Jealousy </H5>
  South Korea, which is jealously keeping an eye on the 
Pyongyang-Washington contacts, is not behaving all that 
prudently. Seoul does not want the North Koreans to come to an 
agreement with the Americans behind South Korea's back. 
  Amazingly, even the South Koreans harbor some illusions in 
respect to the Kim Il-song regime. Seoul completely 
misunderstands the mentality of socialist leaders. For example, 
Seoul is talking about an internal power struggle in Pyongyang 
and seriously expects that on 15 April, Kim Il-song's birthday, 
the DPRK will announce the start of economic reforms per the 
Chinese model. 
  Seoul is sincerely calling on Pyongyang to open up to the 
world in accordance with China's example. This, the southerners 
are urging on the northerners, could help them obtain the 
recognition of the United States and Japan and attract foreign 
capital investments.... 
  Some Americans believe that the DPRK needs to be threatened 
a 
little and that it needs to be shown that the United States is 
not afraid of war and will not succumb to blackmail. Any other 
behavior will merely encourage Pyongyang, creating among Kim 
Il-song and his entourage a false sense of success in the 
struggle against world imperialism. 
  The Americans like to recall that in 1950 the young Kim 
Il-song made up his mind to strike at the South after Dean 
Acheson, secretary of state of the United States at that time, 
had in a speech delivered on 12 January at the National Press 
Club withdrawn the Korean Peninsula from the territory protected 
by the United States. It was decided in the North that 
Washington would not intervene in a Korean war and would not 
come to the South's assistance. As a result the United States 
had to fight for three years to restore the lost territory to 
the South. 
<H5>  Seoul in Tank Pincers </H5>
  Memories of that war are still alive in Washington, and the 
American military is now discussing the possible course of a new 
war. 
  Two-thirds of the 1 million-strong North Korean Army are 
concentrated along the 100-km demilitarized zone separating 
North and South. The North's long-range artillery could shell 
Seoul. Lt. Gen. James Clapper, chief of the Pentagon's 
intelligence agency, gave the combat readiness of the Korean 
People's Army high marks, saying that it would attack the South 
before the latter was ready to repulse it. 
  The American military believes that Generalissimo Kim 
Il-song, promising to turn South Korea into a "sea of fire," 
intends to repeat the 1950 experience--throwing the 
American-South Korean forces into the sea before reinforcements 
can arrive in time from the United States. 
  Mobile units of the Korean People's Army, military 
specialists forecast, would attempt with a swift push to break 
through the South's defenses and capture Seoul and the ports in 
order to prevent the approach of reinforcements. The forward 
units of Kim Il-song's army are composed of an armored strike 
force of 3,500 tanks, 4,000 infantry fighting vehicles, 8,000 
self-propelled artillery pieces, and 2,500 missile launchers 
(Katyusha-type). 
  An attack would be preceded by artillery preparation, the 
purpose of which would be destruction of the South's defensive 
infrastructure. Aviation would strike at airfields, munitions 
dumps, and barracks. Having broken through the fortifications 
and having made use of the tunnels, which, it is believed, Kim 
Il-song's people are digging continuously beneath the 
demilitarized zone, North Korean tanks and motorized infantry 
would rush deep into the country. Phase two of the operation 
would be the encirclement of Seoul and the capture of the rest 
of the peninsula. 
<H5>  What Is Pyongyang Thinking? </H5>
  The success of the Korean People's Army could, however, be 
hampered by the low operational skills of the officers, who 
devote too much time to study of the ideas of chuche, and a 
shortage of fuel. 
  But all this is speculation. No one has any real information 
about the situation in the North Korean Army or knows the extent 
of its combat capability, mobility, and provision with 
ammunition and fuel.... And no one is giving any thought to the 
effect this debate is having on the North Koreans, who believe 
that they have for half a century been living in a besieged 
fortress. 
  The prolonged escalation of mutual military preparations 
could perfectly well lead politicians on both sides of the 
demilitarized zone, which has separated North and South since 
the times of the Korean War, to break under the strain and to 
decide to strike first. 
  The South Koreans are already demonstrating to the world 
that 
their patience is exhausted. 
  "We have no intention of debating indefinitely," Song 
Yong-de, head of the South Korean delegation at the negotiations 
with the North, declared. "I would not even want to say what 
will happen if the nuclear question is not properly resolved." 
  Yet it is not hard to guess the feelings with which 
Pyongyang 
read the reports to the effect that more than 2,000 radical 
South Korean students organized a demonstration in the center of 
Seoul against the deployment of the American Patriot missiles. 
What dreams are evoked by the antiwar demonstrations in South 
Korea among Kim Il-song's elderly associates, the majority of 
whom have never been abroad and who derive all their information 
from secret reports of the Ministry of Public Security? Does it 
not seem to members of the Politburo that the long-anticipated 
uprising in the South, which should be supported by a rapid 
armored strike, has, finally, begun?

<F P=106> [Report by Noyan Tapan: "Our Neighbors Are Opposed to the </F>
AES"] 
  [Text] According to the Baku correspondent of the "Svoboda" 
radio station, physicist Eldar Salayev, president of the 
Azerbaijan Academy of Sciences, stated in response to numerous 
questions from local and foreign journalists that the Armenian 
AES [atomic power station] is one of the first three Soviet 
AES's and there were numerous miscalculations in its design 
which increase the likelihood that emergency situations may 
arise. There are no conditions in Armenian territory for the 
burial of radioactive waste. Previously almost everything was 
taken to Russia. But what will happen today, when Armenian armed 
forces have occupied a substantial part of Azerbaijan? There is 
a danger that the waste will be buried in Azerbaijan's 
territory. Free access to reservoirs and rivers with the absence 
of control will lead later on to contamination of the Caspian, 
which is fraught with catastrophe for all countries in the 
Caspian basin. We are opposed to starting the AES, the political 
destabilization, and the endless chaos in the Transcaucasian 
region. For this reason, Salayev said, "when Armenia raised the 
question of allocating funds for renovation of the AES at the 
IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] session last year, 
Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey spoke out against it." 
  According to the Baku correspondent, the Azerbaijan MO 
[Ministry of Defense] is also concerned about this, assuming 
that radioactive raw material may be used not only for peaceful 
purposes under the conditions of a conflict.

<F P=106> [Report on statements by Armenian Vice Premier Vigen </F>
Chitechyan by Mariam Ogandzhanyan: "The AES Is Beginning 
Operation, But Don't Expect It to Get Brighter"] 
  [Text] As already reported, journalists were given the 
opportunity to visit the Armenian AES [atomic power station] on 
22 April. Gagik Markosyan, the AES' chief engineer, personally 
accompanied them on a trip around the station. Journalists were 
shown a mockup of the station in the technical office and 
provided with detailed explanations of the basic principles in 
its operation. It is known that the first of the AAES' [Armenian 
Atomic Power Station's] two units were put into operation in 
1976, and the second one was commissioned 4 years later. Both 
reactors are first-generation water-cooled power reactors, 
although unlike the standard units, they were designed by taking 
into account the region's seismicity. After the station is 
started, it is expected that 400 megawatts will be generated 
daily. But for the present, the station represents an additional 
load on the energy system by consuming 2.5 megawatts per day. 
Inasmuch as the second unit is in better condition and its 
restoration requires less efforts, it will be renovated first. 
  After an inspection of the station, a press conference was 
held, at which Armenian Vice Premier Vigen Chitechyan drew the 
journalists' attention to a report on the current status of the 
AES, as well as problems associated with the renovation process. 
The necessary explanations were provided by Mr. Avagyan, chief 
of the Armatomenergo Administration; A. Margirosyan, chief 
engineer of the AAES; and F. Arakelyan, director of the 
Armatomenergoprom Planning Institute. As Mr. Chitechyan pointed 
out, the status of the AAES changed after the collapse of the 
USSR. In this connection, independent Armenia had to conclude a 
number of agreements with international organizations and sign 
international conventions on the use of atomic energy. The 
question of Armenia's membership in the IAEA [International 
Atomic Energy Agency] was resolved successfully, and an 
intergovernmental agreement was signed with Russia on supplies, 
including nuclear fuel. The next step was establishment of the 
necessary infrastructure . An operating organ was formed--the 
Armatomenergo Administration, as well as a monitoring organ, the 
Armatomkontrol Administration. The regulations of the AES were 
revised and reapproved in conformity with international 
standards, and it was given the status of a special-purpose 
state enterprise. The concept was worked out and approved by the 
government, and a coordination plan was drafted on this basis. 
The working plans for each system and each unit subject to 
renovation were worked out in conformity with this plan. As Mr. 
Chitechyan noted, we can speak about completion of the 
preparatory stage today. The station's most important assemblies 
have already begun to be repaired in most sections. It is 
expected that the planned level of safety will be provided for 
by the end of this year. As far as additional steps to increase 
the station's safety are concerned, they require that additional 
sources of financing be found. On the whole, roughly $70 million 
are needed for the AES to resume operations. In this connection, 
there is a decision to establish a public fund under the 
Ministry of Energy to mobilize all the reserves and coordinate 
all the funds to put the AES in operation as soon as possible. 
For the present, the available funds are enough for a month of 
work. 
  Mr. Chitechyan noted in particular that the most favorable 
conditions possible had been created for the station's 
personnel. The wages of employees engaged in the process of 
resuming operations add up to roughly 20 established minimum 
wages (25 percent more than the president receives). Three 
houses which are being built will be provided initially for the 
specialists that have been invited, and after their departure 
they will be used to improve housing conditions for the AES 
employees. 
  Responding to journalists' questions, Mr. Chitechyan stated 
that the fuel needed for the station's operation is being 
obtained exclusively in Russia at present, although he added 
that there is a continuous search for alternate sources. 
  It was explained that the seismic stability of the station 
after its renovation will correspond roughly to 8 or 9 points on 
the scale. The operational service life of both units existing 
at the station is 19 years. 
  Mr. Chitechyan did not mention the periods for starting [one 
or two words illegible] and renovation of the first unit. They 
will become known only when the preliminary repair operations 
are concluded. However, even after the station is started, the 
people evidently will not observe any particular brightening in 
their everyday life. As the Armenian vice premier pointed out, 
the electric power being generated will be directed where its 
cost will be recovered the quickest. Only when a certain amount 
of profit is obtained will we able to think about lighting the 
streets and houses. Well, we are not accustomed to it anyway. 
  In conclusion, Mr. Chitechyan noted the special role of the 
press in shaping public opinion and he called upon the mass 
media for cooperation.

<F P=106> [Supreme Soviet Press-Center report from the "Official </F>
Chronicle" column] 
  [Text] A session of the Constitutional Commission headed by 
chairman of the commission President of the Republic of Armenia 
Levon Ter-Petrosyan was held on 20 April. 
  After a general review of additional proposals, the 
commission completed work on changes and additions to the draft 
of the Constitution based on proposals from the working group 
which had reviewed and studied international experience in this 
area. 
  As a result of the work accomplished, there has been 
considerable improvement in the document with regard to 
international law, the provisions on basic rights of citizens 
and the definition of the principle of separation of 
legislative, executive and judicial powers. The flexible 
principle of state administration which has been developed will 
allow the state to avoid possible internal political crises and 
to eliminate anarchy in the republic as a whole as well as in 
its individual rayons. The formulations and definitions of many 
of the articles have also been revised. 
  The revised and amended draft Constitution will be published 
in the press.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Official Chronicle"] </F>
  [Text] On 26 April there was a meeting of the government of 
the Republic of Armenia under the chairmanship of Prime Minister 
Grant Bagratyan. The results of the activity of the Ministry of 
Energy and Fuel and the Ministry of Construction during 1993 
were discussed. 
  A report on the work of the ministries during the 
aforementioned period was presented by First Deputy Minister of 
Economic Affairs Vardan Movsisyan. The ministers presented 
reports on the activity of their departments. 
  Minister of Energy and Fuel Miron Shishmanyan noted that in 
1993 the republic produced 68.5 percent of the planned quantity 
of electric energy. Because of the shortage of energy sources 
its production at heating and electric power plants decreased 
sharply. It amounted to 31.7 percent of the overall quantity of 
electric energy produced. 
  As a result of the transportation blockade in 1993 the 
republic received: 27 percent of the envisioned quantity of fuel 
oil, 11 percent of the gasoline, 23 percent of the diesel fuel, 
16 percent of the aircraft fuel, 27 percent of the lignite, and 
22 percent of the liquefied gas. Because of the constant 
explosions in the gas line the republic received 22 percent of 
the expected quantity of gas. 
  Work on creating small hydroelectric power plants continued 
throughout the year. 
  In spite of the irregular deliveries of fuel in 1993 a 
number 
of branches of the national economy continued to function, city 
transportation, the sphere of services, and partially the system 
of education continued to operate, albeit with interruptions. 
During the winter several rayons of Yerevan and a number of 
cities of the republic were supplied with heat. Within the 
framework of the Zima program, kerosene and liquid fuel obtained 
through humanitarian aid from the United States were distributed 
to socially needy segments of the population. 
  Preparatory, organizational, and technical measures were 
also 
taken to put the Armenian nuclear power plant back on line. 
  Minister of Construction Feliks Pirumyan noted that the main 
task for his department was to prevent further decline of the 
volume of construction work. Presenting the overall picture of 
capital construction, he reported that in 1993 a number of 
structures that are of great significance to the republic 
economy were put into operation. Capital investments totaling 
9,904.4 million rubles [R] were made with internal funds of the 
enterprises and organizations. 
  With state capital investments it was intended to put into 
operation 287,200 square meters of dwelling space. This program 
was fulfilled by 82.8 percent. With funds from the population 
and state subsidies, 97,100 square meters of dwelling space were 
put into operation, 15,700 of which were in the disaster zone. 
There was an exchange of opinions about the reports that were 
heard. Summing up the results of the discussion, Prime Minister 
Grant Bagratyan noted both the positive aspects of the 
ministries' work and their shortcomings and omissions.

<F P=106> [Appeal of participants in the workshop "Nationality Policy </F>
of the Azerbaijan Republic: Problems and Prospects" to Geydar 
Aliyev, president of the Azerbaijan Republic] 
  [Text] Today, when the Azerbaijan Republic is proceeding 
along the path of independence and, particularly, when an 
aggressive, ungrateful neighbor is encroaching on our 
territorial integrity and national existence, great significance 
is attached to the pursuit in the country of a prudent, 
farsighted nationality policy. The further regulation of 
interethnic relations and a comprehensive study of the problems 
and the shaping of a precise nationality policy in this sphere 
are, as a whole, a most essential factor conditioning the 
durability of the statehood of democratic Azerbaijan, national 
unity, and the civic solidarity of the peoples, national 
minorities, and ethnic groups that reside on its territory. 
  The course of the workshop, in which scientists, 
specialists, 
social anthropologists, and political scientists representing 
all the national formations that reside in Azerbaijan took part, 
showed convincingly once again that all peoples, regardless of 
their size and religious or national affiliation, are equally 
responsible for the fate of the fatherland--the Azerbaijan 
Republic--the liberation of our land from the Armenian 
aggressors, and the country's membership of the ranks of 
civilized states and sincerely approve the single-minded 
activity that you, esteemed president, are pursuing in this 
direction. 
  All these problems were the subject of wide-ranging 
discussion at the workshop. Well-known political scientists, 
sociologists, theologians, and representatives of individual 
parties and cultural centers operating in the republic took part 
in the speeches and the debates, and extraordinarily interesting 
and topical proposals connected with the present state of 
interethnic relations, the role of this factor in the process of 
the building of a democratic, secular state, the establishment 
of ties to compatriots living overseas, the reasons for national 
conflicts and their solution by civilized methods based on the 
rules of international law, the establishment of stability in 
the country, and so forth were advanced. We believe that these 
proposals will be taken into consideration in the realization of 
the nationality policy of the Azerbaijani state and that 
efficient use will continue to be made of the research potential 
of our scholars working in the sphere of national relations. 
  Azerbaijan is a unitary state, and we call on all citizens 
of 
Azerbaijan, regardless of religious, linguistic, national, or 
political affiliation, for close cohesion around this idea. We 
assure you that the scientific community of the republic at 
large condemns provocative actions sowing discord between the 
peoples and thereby adding fuel to the fire of the enemy, will 
fight such phenomena and mobilize all efforts for the 
establishment of stability in Azerbaijan and an end to the 
attempts to embroil the peoples, and will make a substantial 
contribution to the building of a society of national solidarity 
and free brotherhood. 
  Esteemed President! It was with a feeling of profound 
emotion 
and gratitude that we received your 12 April 1994 appeal on 
television and radio to our people and the world. The present 
social and political situation in Azerbaijan, the internal and 
external political atmosphere, and the historical realities that 
we have encountered were studied and explained to the world in 
this historic appeal with profound political expertise and wise 
responsibility. We wholly support your consistent and intensive 
activity and the policy you are pursuing in the name of the 
defense and preservation of the state independence and 
territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and call on the whole 
Azerbaijani people to render you the utmost assistance in this 
sacred cause and to rally beneath the banner raised against 
Armenian fascism. 
  Our salvation lies in unity!

<F P=106> ["Appeal of the Concord Republic Society of Solidarity of </F>
the Peoples of Azerbaijan to Deputies of the State Duma of the 
Russian Federation"] 
  [Text] Esteemed Ivan Petrovich Rybkin, chairman of the Duma! 
  We have been prompted to appeal to you and the deputies of 
the Russian State Duma by the recent visit by Lysenko and 
Pavlov, members of the State Duma, to Nagornyy Karabakh. They 
visited this region of Azerbaijan, bypassing Baku and meeting 
with no representatives of Azerbaijan. 
  You know that an undeclared war imposed on us by Armenian 
extremist circles because of the so-called Karabakh issue has 
been under way for more than six years in Azerbaijan. Many 
states, Russia included, are exerting considerable efforts for a 
peaceful resolution of this conflict. 
  At this time Lysenko and Pavlov, leaders of the National 
Republican Party of Russia, having visited only Armenia and 
having thence made for Nagornyy Karabakh, taking no account of 
the position of Azerbaijan and not having made an objective 
study of the entire history of the conflict that has arisen, 
appealed openly on 8 April 1994 on Radio Mayak's "The World" 
program for a new surge in the incitement of interethnic strife. 
They are manifestly proposing a recarving of the current borders 
and the allotment to Armenia of Nagornyy Karabakh, which is, in 
fact, occupied, promising the extremist forces that created the 
Karabakh problem the utmost support, and attempting by any 
methods to impose their position on the State Duma. 
  This openly inflammatory performance of the deputies of the 
State Duma evoked the just anger of the Azerbaijani and all 
other peoples who live in the republic and is doing tremendous 
damage to the peacemaking activity of Russia, which has 
repeatedly declared its interest in a peaceful resolution of the 
Karabakh conflict and the impossibility of a revision of the 
existing borders. 
  As you know, Armenia has long been a mono-ethnic republic, 
and Azerbaijan is, as before, international. More than 500,000 
Russian and Russian-speaking people, to whom also the fate of 
Azerbaijan, which has become their homeland, is not a matter of 
indifference, live here together with the Azerbaijani people. 
  A peaceful solution of the current problem, which had 
emerged 
as of late, was once again recently disrupted by the Armenian 
side. Evidence of this is the large-scale offensive of Armenian 
armed formations the length of the front, which has once again 
caused numerous casualties on both sides. Unfortunately, all 
this is happening in a period when a meeting of the heads of 
state of the CIS had been scheduled in Moscow and agreements had 
been reached on a meeting of the speakers of Azerbaijan and 
Armenia in Bishkek. 
  We Azerbaijanis, Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, Lezgin, 
Tatars, Jews, and representatives of other nations, 
nationalities, and ethnic groups have lived together on 
Azerbaijani soil for centuries. Our society was formed in the 
wake of "bloody January," when, at the call of their hearts, a 
group of Russian-speaking Baku inhabitants went to Moscow to 
tell the truth about the events of 20 January 1990, when the 
Soviet Army was committed to Baku and many totally innocent 
people died. It was necessary then, as it is now, to combat a 
news blockade and well-conceived disinformation concerning 
events occurring in Azerbaijan. 
  We are counting on you, as the leader of the parliament of 
Russia, endeavoring to contribute to a peaceful settlement of 
interethnic conflicts. 
  Nagornyy Karabakh, over which the undeclared war that has 
been foisted on us began, is primordial land of Azerbaijan, 
where the Armenian and Azerbaijani peoples had for several 
centuries lived in peace and harmony. The responsibility for the 
instigation of the war lies wholly with a small group of people 
in Armenia and outside, who have single-mindedly set the two 
peoples against each other for the purpose of annexing to 
Armenia primordially Azerbaijani land. 
  This war has already borne away thousands of lives in both 
republics. More than 200,000 Azerbaijanis living in Armenia have 
been driven out of their native parts and have become refugees. 
Over 20 percent of the territory of the republic, far beyond 
Nagornyy Karabakh included, has now been captured. Many villages 
and towns, cultural monuments, and industrial and agricultural 
enterprises have been destroyed, and more than 1 million 
Azerbaijanis have become refugees. It is six years now that the 
war has been fought on the territory of our republic. 
  The United Nations, the Security Council, and the CSCE Minsk 
Group have repeatedly adopted objective decisions pertaining to 
a peaceful settlement of the conflict, but the long-awaited 
peace has yet to ensue. On the contrary, combat operations on 
the part of the Armenian armed formations have been resumed time 
and again, blood has been shed once again, and increasingly new 
areas of Azerbaijan have been captured. 
  G.A. Aliyev, president of Azerbaijan, appealed recently on 
republic television to the people of Nagornyy Karabakh, the 
people of Armenia, and to the world community, calling for an 
end to the totally needless war, the liberation of the captured 
territories, and the return of the refugees to their homes, and 
asked Russia and other states to contribute to the establishment 
of peace. 
  Addressing the deputies of the State Duma of the Russian 
Federation, we are firmly convinced that the highest authority 
of democratic Russia will analyze the situation in depth and 
study the roots of the conflict, aspiring to a wise and 
objective examination of the Karabakh problem, and prevent 
damage to the legitimate interests of the Azerbaijani people. 
  Adopted at an enlarged session of the board of the Concord 
Republic Society for Solidarity With the Peoples of Azerbaijan 
  Baku, 13 April 1994

<F P=106> [Report of Makhmud Mamedov, chairman of the organizing </F>
committee, at constituent congress of the ADSP on 23 April 1994: 
"Equality Not in Poverty But Equality in Wealth"] 
  [Text] Esteemed Delegates and Guests of the Congress! 
  This is a notable day for us. The constituent congress of 
the 
Azerbaijan Democratic Property Owners' Party [ADSP] has begun. 
  As of today one more political organization enters the 
social 
and political life of Azerbaijan. We are aware of how difficult 
and responsible and at the same time honorable a mission we are 
undertaking. We are firmly convinced that as a result of our 
activity this day will be an important landmark in the history 
of sovereign Azerbaijan. But serious efforts, the concentration 
of intellectual potential, and the assertiveness of all members 
of the party will be needed for this. 
  At this moment the situation in the republic is 
extraordinarily complex. The economic, political, and spiritual 
crisis, a ruthless war, which has lasted six years now, the loss 
of thousands of young men and women in the struggle to liberate 
our land, over a million refugees forced to leave their native 
parts--all this is the reality of our present-day life. Various 
political forces have come to power in recent years in 
Azerbaijan and have attempted to extricate the country from the 
crisis. Unfortunately, these attempts have produced no results, 
and the crisis, intensifying all the while, has assumed 
wide-ranging proportions. We value the activity of the forces 
that contributed to the elimination of totalitarianism in 
Azerbaijan and to the enhancement of the role of national 
self-awareness. But we would like to note that the time has now 
come for people who are creators far removed from destructive 
activity and slogan-mongering. The period of revolutions is 
over, the time has come for new thinking and fundamental 
transformations. 
  The populism of past years must give way to professionalism 
and specific constructive activity. Proceeding from the urgency 
of new ideas for our republic, we deemed necessary the creation 
of the Azerbaijan Democratic Property Owners' Party. There can 
be no doubt that our society can be rescued from the present 
grim situation only by people in possession of the new way of 
thinking. The future of Azerbaijan will depend on the extent to 
which the idea of enterprise is realized. We are for this reason 
laying the foundations of a party far removed from any 
radicalism and extremes and intent on developing society by 
purposive reforms. 
  What do we mean when we speak of new ideas and relations, of 
new policies? The answer to this question may be gleaned from 
the very name of the party. The definition "Azerbaijan" 
symbolizes the party's devotion to the fatherland and its 
sovereignty. The party will operate in Azerbaijan and in the 
name of Azerbaijan. It will be based on the ideas of civicism. 
  The word "Democratic" in the name of the party is also of 
great symbolic meaning. We believe that the majority of the 
current problems have been engendered by the fact that we have 
failed to reveal to the proper extent the very concept of 
"democracy." Democracy is not anarchy, not arbitrariness. It is 
the supremacy of the law over the state, over the citizens, over 
political forces. Democracy is the political power of the 
people. A multiparty system and freedom of speech are its main 
attributes. 
  The supremacy of the law is a basic principle of our 
activity. And it is essential for this reason to replace with a 
new one the current constitution, which reflects the principles 
of the basic law of the Soviet period and which has undergone no 
fundamental revision. 
  The concept of a party of "Property Owners" reflects the 
directions of its activity. In our opinion, a property owner is 
not simply an owner of property and an estate but the true 
master of them, as, equally, of his knowledge, capabilities, and 
intellect. In this sense each citizen of Azerbaijan should be a 
property owner. And it is in this direction that our party will 
undertake wide-ranging activity. The ADSP will propagandize new 
ideas and a new attitude toward the means of production and 
property and the need for enterprise and proprietorship for 
society under the conditions of the market economy. And the 
entrepreneur will be preoccupied by a single goal, a single 
desire--manufacturing a product that is competitive, conforms to 
world standards, and corresponds to public requirements. Success 
in the market economy will in the majority of cases depend on 
man's creative, constructive capabilities and entrepreneurial 
experience. For this reason the "enterprise" and "property" 
concepts could consolidate all citizens, all strata of society. 
  We wish to see as property owners and masters the worker and 
the peasant and the professional. The ADSP will create all the 
conditions for the conversion of enterprises into stock 
companies, the distribution of the shares among the workers free 
of charge, and their enlistment in entrepreneurial activity in 
this way. 
  The main task for us at the present time is not a struggle 
for power but the concentration of the entire potential for the 
extrication of the republic from the present profound state of 
crisis. The economic situation in the republic is very grim at 
this time. In Azerbaijan, with its generous natural resources, 
splendid climate, and enormous production resources, the living 
standard of the people is declining by the day and the social 
protection of the citizens is deteriorating. National income is 
falling rapidly. In 1993 this indicator constituted 27.5 percent 
of that of the previous year. Twenty-five percent less basic 
industrial commodities were manufactured than the year before. 
Inflation is rising, and compared with 1992 the issue of money 
by the National Bank increased by a factor of more than 29.6 and 
continues to grow. The production of all types of industrial and 
agricultural commodities continues, in fact, to fall. The main 
reason for this is the severance of economic ties to the 
republics of the former Union. 
  But the state of crisis in which the economy has found 
itself 
has a number of subjective factors also. Thus, although the 
Azerbaijan Republic has acquired political independence and 
become a full member of the international community, its 
economic independence is still under serious threat. 
  Our republic has opted for the market economy path, which is 
characteristic of the majority of the world's developed 
countries and based on economic logic. But the measures 
pertaining to the adoption and engagement of a new economic 
mechanism are only being implemented slowly; the mechanism of 
the former economic system, now in its death throes, continues 
to operate. Owing to the counteraction of many highly placed 
retrograde persons cherishing a dream of "everything, perhaps, 
going back to what it once was," transition to the market 
economy is being impeded and artificial barriers are being 
erected. The failure to adopt the corresponding laws on the 
market economy, the absence of a working mechanism for some laws 
which have been adopted, but which exist merely on paper, and 
the activity of state and executive authorities not brought into 
line with the new conditions are graphic testimony to this. 
  In sum, economic destabilization has reached the point at 
which the economy has become the main factor of political 
instability. The indifference to the fate of the economic 
reforms and to the transition to market relations regulated by 
law represent a serious threat to the sovereignty of Azerbaijan. 
An acceleration of the reforms and the elimination of the 
asystemic approach in the shaping of the market economy are 
essential, therefore. The solution lies in the speediest 
establishment of the economic system proven by world practice. 
This means: 
  --denationalization of the economy; 
  --privatization; 
  --the development of enterprise; 
  --formation of the market and market infrastructure; 
  --the use of progressive methods in the creation of business 
relations; 
  --the elimination of administrative-command methods 
contradicting the market economy; 
  --price liberalization based on the evolved supply and 
demand 
ratios; 
  --the correct pursuit of financial, credit, and monetary 
policy; 
  --refinement of the customs and tax systems; 
  --an alleviation of the difficulties of the transition to 
the 
market economy by way of the creation of a system of guaranteed 
social protection. 
  The enumerated comprehensive measures encompass three 
stages: 
a halt to the decline in production, an immediate transition to 
the market economy, and provision for the development and 
protection of this system. A halt to the decline in production 
is connected with denationalization and the implementation of an 
anticrisis policy. Unfortunately, privatization and fulfillment 
of the conditions of the transitional period are being 
undertaken extremely inadequately, and an economic structure 
adapted to the new realities is not being created. For this 
reason many state-owned enterprises of the republic are standing 
idle. And this, in turn, is causing a decline in production, a 
shortage of goods, unemployment, a deterioration in the 
well-being of the public, and a disruption of normal monetary 
circulation. Privatization should be effected in the quickest 
way possible, it being necessary first and foremost to privatize 
facilities of trade, public catering, consumer services, and 
small production enterprises. 
  Fundamental reforms are needed in the financial, banking, 
and 
customs systems and in the sphere of foreign economic relations. 
The absence of the former in these spheres is impeding the 
transition to a market system, hampering a halt to the fall in 
production, and causing increased inflation. 
  The state's financial policy is still being implemented by 
the former bureaucratic methods. 
  This applies particularly to the work of the state banks. 
The 
activity, or rather inactivity, of the National Bank, which has 
become a stumbling block in the way of the development of 
enterprise and the formation of a market economy, is bewildering. 
  Speaking of the obstacles put in the way of the activity of 
private structures and entrepreneurs, mention has to be made of 
the flaw in the customs and tax systems. The red tape, relapses 
into bureaucratism in the customs system, and the high customs 
duty are by no means serving to develop the market economy and 
enterprise. 
  The party believes that it is necessary to elaborate and 
adopt new laws aimed at the democratization of the said spheres 
and to remove the shortcomings in them as quickly as possible. 
  The lagging of the agrarian reforms in the republic and the 
fact that a number of the adopted laws and decisions are not 
working are accelerating by the day the slump that has 
encompassed agriculture. It is more than two years now since the 
draft Land Reform Act was published, but it has yet to be 
adopted. The indifferent attitude toward the great public 
property--our land--and inefficient and negligent land tenure 
have caused the erosion of over 600,000 hectares of land. 
  Insuperable barriers have been erected between the land and 
the peasant. Hollow speeches concerning its lease and the 
creation of private farms are heard from time to time, but not 
even the minimum of the conditions necessary for this are being 
created. The peasant and, ultimately, the people are suffering. 
  The party deems essential the privatization of the land and 
its unconditional transfer to those who cultivate it. Every 
peasant should be the master of his land and foster in his 
children the feeling of a proprietary attitude toward it. Whence 
the conclusion: It is necessary to restore historical justice, 
give back to the peasant the land, which was taken away from him 
70 years ago essentially in the guise of nationalization, and 
thereby restore it to its rightful owner. But the intolerable 
procrastination over the reforms is leading to the loss of 
agriculture's material and technical resources. In the past 
three years alone there has been a steep decline in the numbers 
of livestock on the kolkhozes and sovkhozes, and the indicators 
of yield and productivity have fallen two- and threefold. 
  The harvests of cereals, cotton, vegetables, grapes, and 
other agricultural products are declining rapidly. Confirmation 
of this may be seen in the example of Shamakhinskiy and 
Dzhalilabadskiy districts. The grape harvests in Shamakhinskiy 
District fell from 243,000 tonnes to 6 tonnes, and in 
Dzhalalabadskiy, from 250,000 tonnes to 10 tonnes! Are these not 
terrifying facts?! Can Azerbaijan be extricated from the 
economic crisis by such mismanagement? Of course not. No sector 
of agriculture is operating profitably. The bankruptcy of the 
kolkhozes and sovkhozes is on the doorstep. Agriculture remains 
the most laborious part of the economy, the pay in it is the 
lowest, and the peasantry is the most socially unprotected 
stratum of our society. To emerge from the crisis we need first 
and foremost to seek the development of peasant enterprise. 
  Among the congress delegates there are many peasants who 
encounter daily the difficulties and problems connected with 
enterprise. Their speeches and proposals will be taken into 
consideration and will help refine our further activity. 
  We are drawing up specific proposals connected with a 
resolution of the above-mentioned economic problems with regard 
to the transition to a market economy and the development of 
enterprise, and this package of proposals will be presented to 
the government within the next few days. 
  Attaching great significance to science and education, the 
ADSP considers a solution of the problems in this sphere a most 
important task. We will contribute to an improvement in the 
material and technical resources of science and an improvement 
in scientists' work conditions and a rise in their living 
standard and thereby stimulate the development and progress of 
all sectors of the republic's economy. For an economy deprived 
of new scientific achievements is incapable of producing 
effective results. 
  The party believes that for the accomplishment of the 
impending tasks in the period of transition to a market economy 
there will be a need for personnel that have attended a school 
of private enterprise. A certain amount of work has been 
performed in this sphere in the republic, and dozens of 
institutes and centers of education have been created. But 
instead of ensuring conditions stimulating the activity of these 
private centers of training and introducing the young people 
being taught there to world science, they are being subjected to 
groundless pressure. 
  We believe that a state that has announced a transition to a 
market economy should not be demonstrating biased selectiveness 
but displaying concern also for this educational system, which 
is new in the life of Azerbaijan. 
  Each member of the party should know that a society that is 
indifferent toward science and education is poor both materially 
and spiritually. We will aspire to the cooperation of scientists 
and entrepreneurs and to the implementation of their specific 
developments. 
  The ADSP, appreciating on its merits the important role of 
culture and art in an enhancement of the living standard of the 
people, will contribute to the extrication from crisis of 
cultural institutions, whose physical resources have in recent 
years been undermined appreciably. Facilitate increased 
attention to figures of culture and art of the republic and to 
the creation of the necessary conditions for their creativity. 
We must revive the traditions of such patrons of the arts as 
Hajji Zeynalabdin Tagiyev and Musa Nagiyev and we shall call on 
all entrepreneurs and business people to take specific steps in 
this field. 
  Our party will perform a great deal of work on the 
protection 
of monuments of culture and art and also on the return of our 
national treasures taken overseas. 
  Azerbaijan is a multinational country. Representatives of 
various nationalities have lived on its territory as good 
neighbors of the Azerbaijani people for many centuries. The ADSP 
urges protection of the rights of the national minorities and 
ethnic groups and a solicitous attitude toward their customs, 
traditions, and language. 
  The ADSP is for the mutual noninterference of religion and 
the state in each other's affairs. By virtue of the fact that 
the ancient culture of our people is closely linked with the 
Islamic religion, the party will exert efforts for the 
affirmation of a respectful attitude toward this religion and 
contribute to the study at the proper level of religious 
sources, the opening of religious schools, and the restoration 
of the mosques. The party will display respect for other 
religions also and adopt a solicitous attitude toward their 
religious structures. The ADSP considers religious intolerance 
impermissible. 
  A legal basis for preferential conditions of the use of 
economic factors in health care, specifically, the channeling of 
capital from the private sector to this sphere, is a command of 
the times. A transition to health care for which a partial 
charge is made and the insurance medicine connected with it 
would undoubtedly bring our health care into line with today's 
economic system. The party believes that the treatment and 
improvement of medical services for persons who have been 
wounded and maimed in fighting to liberate our land should be 
the most important task of today's health care. 
  We will endeavor to direct our domestic policy toward social 
assistance to the population. Needy families, including the 
families of refugees, martyrs, the handicapped, participants in 
the war, retirees, and large families will sense our concern. 
  Speaking of social protection of the population, I would 
like 
to mention particularly the neglected state of housing 
construction and transport services in the republic. The 
profound crisis of the economy is being reflected increasingly 
palpably in this sphere. 
  The steep decline in housing construction in recent years 
has 
engendered particular strain in the satisfaction of the public's 
housing requirements. This is explained by the fact that 
approximately 1 million of our compatriots have as a consequence 
of the Armenian aggression been forced to abandon their native 
parts and make their home in tents, hostels, sanatoriums, 
schools, and other nonresidential facilities. Many of them have 
poured into Baku, where great social strain has arisen in this 
connection. 
  Attaching great significance to housing construction in the 
republic, the ADSP will endeavor to make full use in this sphere 
of the forces both of the state and the business world. It is 
necessary to this end to create the conditions for the 
entrepreneurs, allocate them the necessary plots of land, and 
make credit available to them. 
  We will at the same time operate actively in the direction 
of 
an improvement in mass transit services and the removal of the 
problems that exist in this sphere. 
  The extent of employment and joblessness is one of the main 
problems greatly worrying us today. The ADSP believes that the 
further development of enterprise, the emergence of new 
production divisions particularly, would signal a turning point 
in the resolution of this problem. 
  I would at the same time like to mention that the 
unemployed, 
as a reality of our present life, must receive assistance and 
sense concern not only on the part of our business people but of 
the state also. 
  We intend to display particular concern for the youth and 
adolescents. The defense of their rights and assurance of all 
the necessary conditions so that they might become worthy 
members of our society will always be at the center of the 
attention of the ADSP. 
  I would like to make particular mention of one further 
problem. The lessening of concern for our future, children, 
inadequate teaching and educational work with them, and the 
inattention to them. This was undertaken more or less in the 
bygone Soviet period by, aside from the family, such public 
organizations as pioneer and Communist Youth League groups and 
clubs. The ADSP believes that it is necessary to increase the 
attention paid to children on the part of the state and to 
prepare and implement comprehensive measures in this sphere. We 
will make use of all our opportunities in this cause. 
  The ADSP believes that a primary and sacred task currently 
confronting the whole Azerbaijani people and the state is the 
liberation of our land from the Armenian occupiers. 
  Thousands of heroic sons and daughters of the Azerbaijani 
people have been wounded and maimed in battle and have died the 
death of the brave in this struggle. Today also the sons and 
daughters of our people are fighting heroically for their native 
land and wholeheartedly believe in the victory of the just 
cause. At the same time we are seriously alarmed by the fact 
that the state cannot secure fundamental changes in this sector 
and that the current shortcomings are not being eliminated in 
timely fashion. 
  We believe that the leaders of the Azerbaijan state should 
create an army in which strict discipline rules and mobilize the 
people in the name of victory over the accursed enemy. Our party 
would render all possible assistance here. It is our profound 
belief that at a fateful time for Azerbaijan all political 
forces should unite in the struggle against the Armenian 
aggressors. 
  The ADSP believes that the machinery of state should 
primarily be perfected and restructured on democratic 
principles, an executive mechanism conforming to the 
requirements of the market economy created, and the 
bureaucratism and red tape hampering our development removed for 
the accomplishment of the set goals and tasks. And the 
legislature, executive, and judiciary should primarily for this 
be delineated fully. 
  We believe that the National Assembly does not represent the 
people to the full extent and has exhausted its historical 
mission. It is necessary, therefore, having secured stability in 
the republic as quickly as possible, to hold new elections to 
the supreme legislative body. 
  Persons who put the interests of the people above personal 
interests, who would serve to build a strong state, and who are 
capable of independent decisionmaking should be represented in 
parliament. 
  The executive should be formed from people who are creative, 
businesslike, just, and humane, who possess the new thinking, 
and who are capable of engaging in politics at the level of 
today's requirements. 
  The supremacy of the law and an understanding of the 
irreversibility of progress along the path of the market economy 
should be the main yardstick in the activity of the executive. 
We will strive for the restructuring of the executive 
authorities in accordance with these demands, an improvement in 
their structure, and the abolition of duplicative components. 
  It is necessary to carry out fundamental reforms in the 
administrative authorities and form the judiciary as the third 
branch of power in the true meaning of the word and ensure its 
complete independence. 
  Each citizen of the republic, regardless of the position he 
holds, should have the right to appeal to the judicial 
authorities with a demand for the restoration of his violated 
rights. 
  The law must not allow the groundless interference of the 
police and procuracy authorities in the activity of the private 
sector. It is necessary to clamp down on all factors leading to 
bribery, corruption, and arbitrary action in the administrative 
authorities. 
  The ADSP believes that the successful accomplishment of the 
impending tasks and the correct management of personnel policy 
are very important. In all areas, personnel need to be chosen 
only in accordance with businesslike and professional qualities. 
Unfortunately, these criteria were for many years disregarded in 
the selection of personnel, which permitted the principles of 
nepotism and personal devotion to come to the fore. 
  As a result positions in the managerial structures went to 
incompetent people devoid, at times, of the necessary moral 
qualities, which, as a whole, damaged the common interests of 
the Azerbaijani people and harmed the principles of its 
statehood. 
  The ADSP emphatically condemns the selection of personnel 
for 
directive positions in accordance with family and protectionist 
criteria and notes the impermissibility of this approach. 
  The party's activity in the field of foreign policy shall be 
based on international rules of law, the UN Charter, the 
principles generally accepted in the international community, 
and the constitution and the laws of the Azerbaijani state. 
  Taking as a basis national interests and statehood, the 
international activity of Azerbaijan should serve peace, 
security, and mutually beneficial cooperation. The party deems 
essential the creation of direct diplomatic relations with 
states of the world and supports the territorial integrity and 
sanctity of the borders of all countries, their noninterference 
in one another's internal affairs, cooperation and peaceful 
coexistence, and the solution of all conflicts within the 
framework of international rules of law exclusively by way of 
negotiations. It proceeds from the provisions of UN documents 
defending human rights and liberties. 
  The ADSP will endeavor to create close ties to overseas 
parties of a democratic persuasion and will broaden all-around 
cooperation with them in the interests of Azerbaijan. 
  In the sphere of economic reform the ADSP will strive to 
ensure that the experience of the world's progressive countries 
be studied and applied in Azerbaijan and will create closer 
contacts with Azerbaijani businessmen living abroad. 
  The party will facilitate the establishment of relations 
with 
all Azerbaijanis who live outside of the republic and also with 
the societies that unite them, support their activity in the 
interests of Azerbaijan, and contribute to the creation and 
development of the Azerbaijani diaspora in foreign countries. We 
call on other parties also to join in this initiative. We 
believe that there is now an even greater need for Azerbaijan to 
convey to the world community the voice of truth in the defense 
of its land. 
  Together with bilateral relations in foreign policy the 
party 
notes the significance for the Azerbaijani state of multilateral 
relations, particularly the need for cooperation with regional 
and international organizations, and believes that it is 
necessary to take advantage of their strength and authority to 
have Armenia, which has occupied land of Azerbaijan, recognized 
as the aggressor. 
  Esteemed delegates and guests of the congress! 
  As a result of the purposive activity of the organizing 
committee of the ADSP action groups have in a short space of 
time been formed in 23 districts of Azerbaijan. This process is 
continuing rapidly, and the number of the party's supporters is 
growing by the day. This is reason for us to conclude that the 
ADSP will shortly be a most authoritative party of the republic. 
  The draft program and rules of the party will be presented 
to 
you today. Your proposals, complaints, and criticisms will help 
perfect these documents. 
  Ours is a democratic, parliamentary-type party. Members of 
the party will work in a creative atmosphere affording an 
opportunity for a display of initiative. Granted all this, there 
must be discipline in the party. Our principle is discussion of 
the party's decisions until they have been adopted. An adopted 
decision is law for all party members. The party will defend the 
interests of each of its members. And they, in turn, are called 
upon to strive to enhance the party's prestige by their activity. 
  In view of the fact that ours is a constituent congress, we 
have not made it our purpose to express in the report our 
attitude toward all areas of the party's activity. 
  The directive party authorities, which will be elected 
today, 
will together with the organizations being formed in the regions 
involve themselves in an improvement of the party's strategy and 
tactics at the current stage. 
  We entrepreneurs must show graphically the benefit of our 
activity, implementing our ideas and striving for actual 
achievements. 
  In the Soviet period the people's consciousness was poisoned 
by malicious communist propaganda to the effect that 
enterprising people are exploiters profiting at the people's 
expense, that they are to blame for the poor life of society, 
and that they are building their prosperity on the misfortunes 
of poor people. The useful work and noble accomplishments of 
creative, active entrepreneurs, who themselves knew how to live 
and afforded the people an opportunity to work and earn, were 
slandered. Back at the start of the century forces of occupation 
under the banner of revolution wiped out the genuine 
entrepreneurs and did unprecedented damage to the spirituality 
and economy of Azerbaijan. Thus was the principle of general 
ruin and the equalization of all in poverty realized. 
  The party that we have founded advances the polar-opposite 
principle--equality not in poverty but equality in wealth. Its 
purpose is realization of the idea that all citizens are 
entitled to be and should be masters in the full meaning of this 
word. A nation that has failed to foster its own entrepreneurs 
will be forced to serve the entrepreneurs of other states. 
  In this sense we must ourselves become the masters of our 
national wealth. And for this reason it is the sacred duty of 
each of us to propagandize extensively the idea of enterprise 
and to create all the conditions for the development of market 
relations. We need to unite all efforts in the name of the 
elimination of the obstacles in the way of the development of 
the market economy and enterprise, fight jointly against 
conservatives and, ultimately, build an independent state and 
wealthy country with strong authorities. 
  We emphatically declare that only the entrepreneurs, that 
is, 
all of us, will liberate the republic from the present grim 
situation, from the economic crisis. The main purpose of our 
party is to achieve this and to act in the name of a strong and 
free Azerbaijan. 
  I call on all of you to struggle for these national 
interests 
and, of course, for the expulsion from the territory of 
Azerbaijan of the accursed enemy. 
  I thank you for your attention.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Draft Privatization Program Submitted </F>
to Parliament"] 
  [Text] The president of Azerbaijan has approved and 
submitted for the consideration of the National Assembly the 
draft privatization program for the year 1994 prepared by the 
republic's State Property Committee. 
  As an AZERTADZH correspondent was told in the State Property 
Committee, the draft envisages privatizing over the current year 
about 8,000 enterprises in the services sphere, trade, and 
health care, as well as a number of unfinished construction 
projects and enterprises engaged in production. Privatization of 
large and medium-size enterprises will be done through 
conversion to joint-stock holding; the rest will be sold into 
private ownership--individual or collective. 
  To distribute state property among the population it is 
envisaged allocating each citizen of Azerbaijan, regardless of 
age, a certain amount of money, or shares, through special 
accounts in banks, the amount of which will be indexed in 
keeping with inflation. The owners will be able to use them only 
for privatization purposes--buying enterprise stock. They will 
be able to purchase the latter both directly at enterprises or 
through state or private investment funds, which will be set up 
as soon the privatization program is adopted. 
  The State Property Committee staff expressed the hope that 
the deputies will speedily approve the privatization program, 
which will give an impetus to real reform of the Azerbaijani 
economy.

<F P=106> [Interview with Igor Giorgadze, chairman of the State </F>
Security Service of the Republic of Georgia, by Viktor Logachev; 
place and date not given: "Georgia's Path to the West Lies Via 
Russia"] 
  [Text] 
  [Logachev] You are by virtue of your official position one 
of 
the best-informed people of Georgia. How do you evaluate the 
situation in the republic? 
  [Giorgadze] Complex and ambivalent. We have negotiated the 
stage of civil war and conflicts in the zone of Tskhinvali and 
Abkhazia. I would like to hope that they will not resume. The 
joint statement of Boris Yeltsin and Eduard Shevardnadze and the 
agreement signed in the wake of this by the Council of Heads of 
State of the CIS instill hope that a settlement will be achieved 
by the political, peaceful path. 
  The economy of Georgia is falling apart, transport is 
paralyzed, and the financial and credit system is in a state of 
collapse. The vast majority of the population is eking out a 
semi-starvation, beggarly existence. Parliamentary and 
government decisions proceed from the fact that it is only 
possible to emerge from this state by developing cooperation and 
integration within the framework of the CIS. There is opposition 
to this viewpoint, of course, and the opponents' main argument 
is that the republic could be deprived of sovereignty on this 
path. But the country's present economic state would, in my 
view, deprive it, rather, of sovereignty and integrity. 
  Our opposition desires an orientation toward the West, which 
is not a sinful desire in itself, but under the present 
circumstances Georgia's path to the West lies via Russia. 
  [Logachev] The most serious political question for Georgia 
is 
the conflict in Abkhazia. Could it grow into even more serious 
forms? 
  [Giorgadze] I would like to hope that the joint efforts of 
the CIS countries, primarily the active mediating role of 
Russia, will help in the very near future--I stress this--to 
exhaust this conflict completely and return the refugees to 
Abkhazia. If the peacekeeping force of the CIS, and if we are to 
call things by their name, primarily Russia, joins in these 
processes and if this force does not passively observe the 
course of events but actively becomes a part of the process as 
an interested mediator, the problem will be resolved. Russia has 
already signaled such a position. 
  [Logachev] Nonetheless, in what form might the Abkhazia 
problem be resolved, for all that? 
  [Giorgadze] Undoubtedly as a compromise. A federal 
arrangement of Georgia would seem the most practicable. Those 
who believe that this would damage the statehood of the Georgian 
Republic are, in my opinion, wrong. We could perfectly well 
negotiate with both the Abkhaz and Ossetian sides specific 
mutually acceptable forms of statehood. I would not want to 
anticipate events, but any form of state arrangement that 
satisfies the population of Georgia and Abkhazia is at this time 
acceptable in principle. And the details could, after the guns 
have died down, be specified at the negotiating table. 
  [Logachev] Does Tbilisi understand that unless the Abkhaz 
problem is resolved in the very near future, Georgia, as a 
Christian state, runs the risk of a clash with its Muslim 
Caucasus neighbors? 
  [Giorgadze] I have been working in the system of the 
security 
authorities for 26 years now and have in this time been involved 
in such an area, atypical of us, as the study of public opinion. 
The head of the Georgian state recently instructed us to 
ascertain the extent to which the population of Georgia supports 
the steps being taken by the leadership of the republic. 
According to our figures, approximately 80 
percent--practically the entire population of Georgia--advocate 
a peaceful settlement of the Abkhaz conflict, realizing 
that its prolongation will mean the failure of the statehood of 
the republic. 
  [Logachev] How do you view the possible participation of a 
UN 
peacekeeping force in a solution of the Abkhaz conflict? 
  [Giorgadze] I value the status and authority of the United 
Nations highly. But, like any representative of the special 
services, I am accustomed to relying on facts and their 
analysis. Let us take a realistic look at the results of the 
activity of UN peacekeeping forces. They are ineffective, as a 
rule. On the other hand, Georgia is a participant in the CIS, 
and a UN peacekeeping contingent would hardly solve the question 
better than the Commonwealth's peacekeeping force is doing. 
  [Logachev] You have mentioned Georgia's desire to cooperate 
with the West. How do you see relations with the European Union 
and NATO? 
  [Giorgadze] Following the signing of the framework agreement 
with Russia, the leaders of our states declared that the 
strategic interests of Russia and Georgia coincide. 
Consequently, we cannot belong to different blocs and 
organizations. For me this is rudimentary. 
  [Logachev] Many people in Russia are arguing about 
participation in the Partnership for Peace program. What is your 
thinking on this score? 
  [Giorgadze] My first impression is that not everything has 
been fully thought through here. Why and to what end is it 
necessary to participate in cooperation with a prospect of 
association within the framework of NATO? I have a guarded 
attitude toward this idea, although many countries have latched 
onto it readily. 
  [Logachev] Much has been said in the Russian press about 
Georgia's drift toward the United States. There have been 
references to American advisers here.... 
  [Giorgadze] If there are, indeed, advisers, this is not a 
sign of some tilt. We have found ourselves in a difficult 
situation, and if the United States has extended the hand of 
assistance to us, this absolutely does not preclude more serious 
contacts with Russia. This also applies to cooperation along 
special service lines, incidentally. For some reason or other 
the press has made very one-sided mentions of the presence in 
Georgia of CIA advisers, but has remained silent about our 
traditional relations and contacts with Russia. 
  Georgia needs considerable assistance, in questions of 
personnel training included. A number of agreements with Russia 
along Ministry of Defense lines and between us and Russia's 
Federal Counterintelligence Service are currently being made 
ready for signing.

<F P=106> [Interview with Former Georgian Defense Minister Tengiz </F>
Kitovani, by CHELYABINSKIY RABOCHIY correspondent K. Voronin, 
under the rubric "Politics": "Georgia's Fate Is in Russia's 
Hands"] 
  [Text] It is not often that guests like this come to our 
city. Even on an unofficial visit, even a former defense 
minister, and not even of America but just of Georgia, still the 
figure of Tengiz Kitovani is significant. 
  In December 1991, the former dissident seized power in 
Tbilisi, drove out Gamsakhurdia, summoned Shevardnadze to 
Georgia, and then, due to disagreement with his policies, 
retired as minister of defense. This is basically all we know 
about Kitovani. Meanwhile, in his homeland the former minister 
is almost a national hero. The Caucasus in general respect men 
of strong character. Dzhokhar Dudayev, Suret Kusseynov, Tengiz 
Kitovani--the Chechens, Azeris, and Georgians take great pride 
in their heroes. Unlike the other two, Kitovani is not now in 
power; in fact, he is in opposition to the official regime. 
  [CHELYABINSKIY RABOCHIY] Tengiz, what brings you to the 
Southern Urals? 
  [Kitovani] My destiny is closely tied to this land. In my 
life as a dissident I learned the Urals well from the inside, 
but I was prevented from admiring your sights by . . . barbed 
wire. Now the goal of my visit is to learn the opinion of the 
Urals' inhabitants--the simple people, the businessmen, and the 
politicians--about Georgia, about prospects for collaboration. I 
would like the people of the Urals to have their say about 
closer ties with my people. 
  I was in Moscow for two months, meeting with deputies of the 
State Duma and members of the Russian government. It seems to 
me, though, that you have to look for the opinion of the real 
Russian people in the provinces, not in the capital. That is why 
I'm here. So much links Georgia the with Urals, with 
Chelyabinsk. Students from Tbilisi used to come here to study, 
and they did their field work in your metallurgical plants. Now 
it is essential that we restore the broken ties. 
<H5>  From the Biography of Tengiz Kitovani </H5>
  By profession, an artist, laureate of many prizes. During 
Khrushchev's "thaw" he got involved in political activity. A 
monarchist by conviction. After the end of the "thaw," in 1969, 
he was sentenced. At the time, dissidents were put in prison on 
criminal articles, so Kitovani was "set up" with a road 
accident: for a harmless DTP [highway traffic accident] he got 
15 years. That was how he ended up in the Urals: Katav-Ivanovsk, 
Zlatoust, Kasli, a "double" special regime prison at the ChMZ 
[not further identified]. . . . In Bakal the hot-headed Georgian 
called the camp warden a "red fascist," so another year was 
tacked on--for disrespect for authority. After serving 13 years, 
Kitovani was freed on an amnesty. He went back to Georgia, 
returned to his profession as an artist, and once again took up 
politics. 
  [CHELYABINSKIY RABOCHIY] What's going on in Georgia right 
now? 
  [Kitovani] Of all the former union republics, Georgia has 
suffered the most. Because of Zviad Gamsakhurdia's nationalistic 
politics, we fenced ourselves off from our neighbors and above 
all--from Russia. Right now the instability in the country is 
great and economic ties have been broken. We are suffering badly 
as a result. So far, though, some of our politicians feel that 
we don't need Russia, that it's better to collaborate with 
Europe and America. It doesn't seem that way to me. Georgia 
needs an alliance with Russia, firm ties with its regions. I 
have been saying this in the Georgian parliament for two years. 
At first they didn't listen to me. Georgia lost the war and only 
now is coming to its senses. Georgia has joined the CIS and is 
hoping for an improvement in relations with its neighbor to the 
north. 
  For us the CIS means Russia. Until our relations improve, my 
republic is going to have it bad: 99 percent of our population 
is living below the poverty line, and the ruble's rate against 
the coupon is very high--1:125. Our entire hope rests on Russia. 
  [CHELYABINSKIY RABOCHIY] How do you assess Russian policy 
toward Georgia? 
  [Kitovani] Recently the friendship and cooperation agreement 
signed by the presidents of Georgia and Russia was received 
negatively by Russian politicians, especially in the State Duma. 
I understand them, though. The "Shevardnadze factor" plays a 
role here. Russians have a bad attitude toward him, the former 
Soviet minister of foreign affairs. I met with Zhirinovskiy in 
Moscow, and he told me that he does not want friendship with 
Shevardnadze's Georgia because of his role in the destruction of 
the Soviet Union. Zhirinovskiy is wrong: Georgia is not 
Shevardnadze. And this is another reason for my visit to 
Chelyabinsk. I am meeting with local national patriots and 
trying to convince them of this. 
  [CHELYABINSKIY RABOCHIY] Recently the days of the first 
Georgian president, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, came to a tragic end. 
Many contradictory opinions have been expressed about his death. 
What do you think? 
  [Kitovani] Gamsakhurdia was a nationalist conducting a 
nationalistic policy, and that is why he lost. I don't believe 
that Zviad committed suicide, though. I think it was a murder, a 
purely political murder. It was disadvantageous to someone to 
see him alive. I cannot say more. Zviad was a dangerous enemy, 
he nearly came to power a second time, not when his brigades 
seized Lanchkhuti and prepared to storm Tbilisi, but on 3-4 
October. 
  If the Moscow putsch had succeeded, Gamsakhurdia would have 
been in Shevardnadze's place right now. Don't forget: he lived 
in Chechnya, near Dudayev, and Dudayev is Khasbulatov, so there 
is a direct link between them. Had a Chechen come to power in 
Moscow, then the Chechen protege, Gamsakhurdia, would have come 
to power in Tbilisi. But the putsch did not succeed, and the 
dangerous ex-president was removed. 
  He could not have killed himself, I know him well. We 
studied 
in the same school and knew each other since we were children. 
We participated in the dissident struggle together. After 
perestroyka, having headed up the national liberation movement, 
we came to power together. Zviad became president, and I became 
commander of the national guard. Our paths diverged on 19 August 
1991, however, when he supported the Communist putsch. 
<H5>  From the Biography of Tengiz Kitovani </H5>
  In August 1991, Kitovani, virtually the number two man in 
the 
state, accused Gamsakhurdia of aiding and abetting the GKChP 
(State Committee for the State of Emergency). Not waiting to be 
arrested, he took 12,000 guardsmen loyal to him out of the 
barracks and went off into the mountains. In a bold move he took 
the "Georgian Bastille," freed his comrades-in-arms from 
prison--Georgiy Chanturiya, chairman of the National Democratic 
Party, and Dzhaba Ioseliani, commander of the armed group 
Mkhaderioni ("Horsemen"). For five months he was a partisan in 
the forests. It was then that Tengiz Kitovani was given the 
nickname "the Georgian Che Guevara" in the Russian and world 
press. 
  In December 1991, the opposition stormed Tbilisi, firing 
cannons on the presidential palace and seizing power. Georgians 
call that storming the best work Kitovani the artist ever did: 
the city scarcely suffered from the cannon fire, and only the 
ideally exact block was destroyed--the president's. 
  Gamsakhurdia fled to Chechnya, and Kitovani headed up the 
Military Council--in fact, Georgia. His monarchist views were 
not meant to be, though, and he was forced to turn for help to 
Shevardnadze, to whom all power over Georgia transferred soon 
after. 
  [CHELYABINSKIY RABOCHIY] Tengiz, why did you give the power 
you had seized up to Eduard Shevardnadze? 
  [Kitovani] There were 400,000 Communists in Georgia awaiting 
his arrival. We could not go against our own people. Especially 
since he enjoyed an authority and trust in the world, and that 
was very important at that moment: after all, we had come to 
power by means of an armed revolt, and the world did not trust 
us. 
  Shevardnadze's coming to power, unfortunately, made sense in 
a post-Communist state. We have other examples--Azerbaijan, 
Turkmenistan, other republics. But Shevardnadze wanted to make 
great policy in a small state. When he was the Soviet minister 
of foreign affairs, Russia stood behind him. In little Georgia, 
his "great policy" brought the country to its knees. 
Shevardnadze did not take into account the processes going on in 
Georgia--that is, the Abkhazian and Ossetian issues. He placed 
the integrity of Georgia in jeopardy. I could not work with him 
so I left my post as defense minister. 
  Still, Shevardnadze is not Zviad. Therefore, I did not go 
into the mountains, I just went into the opposition. Chanturiya 
right now is with me, too, but Ioseliani supports the current 
head of the republic. Maybe Shevardnadze is a great politician, 
but Georgia has not benefited from his policies, I don't think. 
  [CHELYABINSKIY RABOCHIY] How do you assess the future of 
Russian-Georgian relations? 
  [Kitovani] Our tsars and forefathers concluded an alliance. 
They were smarter and more far-sighted than we are. We must 
follow their example. The two Orthodox Christian peoples must 
unite. I see Georgia's future only with Russia.

<F P=106> [Republic of Georgia Decree signed by Georgian Parliament </F>
Speaker Vakhtang Goguadze: "Georgian Parliament Decree on the 
Basic Directions of the Unified Monetary-Credit Policy of the 
Republic of Georgia for the First Quarter of 1994"; no date] 
  [Text] The Georgian Parliament decrees: 
  1. That the Head of State's Edict No 240 of 29 November 
1993, 
"On Certain Extraordinary Measures for State Monetary-Credit 
Regulation of the Republic of Georgia" be adopted as the basis 
of the basic directions of the unified monetary-credit policy of 
the Republic of Georgia.

  5. That account be taken of the credit resource needs of the 
republic's national economy and that the National Bank be 
authorized to auction to state-commercial and commercial banks 
50 percent of emission credits paid in the first quarter of 1994 
(except for the 50 billion coupons stipulated by the Head of 
State's Edict No 3, 10 January 1994). 
  6. That the Republic of Georgia Cabinet of Ministers be 
directed to advise state commercial banks to use credit 
resources at their disposal primarily the meet the needs of the 
national economy's priority sectors. 
  7. That the Republic of Georgia Cabinet of Ministers, the 
National Bank, the ministries and departments take decisive 
steps to ensure implementation of the measures stipulated in the 
Head of State's Edict No 240, 29 November 1993, and that the 
National Bank report the work done and the results achieved to 
the Georgian Parliament in April of this year. 
  8. That it be noted that the Cabinet of Ministers and 
relevant ministries and departments are doing virtually nothing 
to monitor the Cabinet of Ministers and National Bank joint 
Decree No 575, 24 July 1993, "On Declaring the Coupon of the 
National Bank of the Republic of Georgia the Sole Legal Medium 
of Payment in the Territory of the Republic of Georgia." 
  That the Cabinet of Ministers and the relevant ministries 
and 
departments are to work jointly to ensure effective 
implementation of the measures stipulated in this Decree and 
institute an effective monitoring system.

<F P=106> [Interview with State Tax Inspection Chief Davit Salaridze </F>
by Aleko Aslanishvili: "When the Treasury Is Empty. New Tax 
Legislation Goes Into Effect": place and date not given] 
  [Text] The level of tax discipline in a country, 
attitudes toward taxes, and the extent to which taxes are fully 
reported and paid, constitute an indicator of that country's 
economic stability, the strength of its government, and the 
effectiveness of its organized system and management. The 
creation of a tax service that is independent--or, rather, 
subject only to the law and free of all administrative or 
political pressure--is the aim of a package of laws which was 
recently passed by the Parliament. 
  We asked State Tax Inspection Chief Davit Salaridze to 
tell our readers about new features of the tax legislation. 
  Biographical sketch. He was born in Tbilisi in 1947. He 
majored in the law and at various times has worked in the 
Procuracy, the courts, and the Internal Affairs Ministry. He has 
been chief of the State Tax Inspection since September 1993. He 
is married and has one child. 
  [Aslanishvili] Recently, speakers have had words of praise 
to 
say about the chief of the Tax Inspection. I believe this 
department is a kind of "virgin territory" for you. 
  [Salaridze] Those words of praise belong to the Inspection's 
collective. I have found them to be people of excellent 
qualifications. The collective worked hard with the relevant 
Parliament commission to draw up the new legislation, which 
accounts for the first successful steps. 
  Eight new laws have been passed. Until now we have not 
really 
had tax laws. There was an interim statute that we had to work 
with. The basic thrust of the new legislation calls for 
relatively liberal tax rates; its principle is to encourage 
entrepreneurship, boost the country's economy, and put a halt to 
concealment of income. 
  Consider the tax on profit, for example. It used to be 35 
percent; now it has been reduced by 15 points. That 20 percent 
is also differentiated for industry and construction; it calls 
for only 10 percent. Not only that, but a newly created 
organization is totally exempted from taxes in the first year, 
and it only pays half the rate in the next two years. 
  Now consider value-added tax. The rate is set at 14 percent, 
which is much lower than in other countries. In the CIS 
republics, for example, it is 20 percent. 
  I believe these terms are quite acceptable to all. Of 
course, 
such low rates could result in losses to the budget for some 
time, but the state has done this deliberately. The payoff 
should come later. 
  [Aslanishvili] In drafting the laws, did you draw upon the 
experience of any particular countries? 
  [Salaridze] We didn't use any single pattern. We studied the 
laws of several countries, including members of the CIS. In 
drafting the legislation we got advice from the International 
Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and other international 
organizations. 
  [Aslanishvili] Taxes are one of the main sources of budget 
revenue. What will the State Inspection's contribution be this 
year? 
  [Salaridze] Last year the state budget's revenue portion was 
400 billion coupons. As far as possible, the deficit was covered 
by financial emissions, loans, and various aid contributions. 
The first quarter's budget for this year is now ready. Revenues 
will be 1.3 trillion coupons, and expenditures will be 1.5 
trillion. So the deficit should only be 200 billion coupons. 
There's a big difference compared with last year's--400 billion 
in all of last year and 1.3 trillion in one quarter of this 
year. To be sure, inflation has to be taken into account, but 
the difference is still significant. Here the state tax 
agencies' role comes into play--keeping track of taxpayers and 
taxes and other fees paid into the budget and taking part in 
forecasting the budget's revenues. 
  [Aslanishvili] Industry ought to be providing the biggest 
source of taxes, but our industry is in such sad shape that we 
can't pin much hope on them. Is there any other source? 
  [Salaridze] There are reserves which need to be activated. 
For example, petroleum products. Last year, commercial 
structures imported around a million tonnes of petroleum 
products into the republic. According to rough estimates, the 
state budget should have received about 500 billion 
coupons--almost enough for one full budget backup [rezerv], 
but.... When started focusing on that sector of commerce, we 
managed to collect 2.5 billion coupons in December alone. 
  We are supporting entrepreneurship and business in every 
way; 
we know that Georgia's salvation depends on business, which 
creates wealth for our budget and the nation. Everyone must 
realize that there will no longer be state stocks of gasoline 
and other products. The more gasoline the commercial structures 
bring in, the cheaper it will become. But the importer also has 
to know that he has to pay stipulated amounts to the budget. 
This is the rule of civilized relations with the state. 
  Another example: There are about 3,000 sales booths 
registered in Tbilisi, but last year we only got 100 million 
coupons from them in taxes. Consider also the currency exchange 
offices. According to statistics of the National Bank, as of 28 
December 1993, 745 such offices were registered in the Tbilisi 
area, and 385 of them were on the tax books. But only seven 
exchange offices paid money to the budget in the form of 
taxes--2.3 million coupons. And that's all. The others paid 
nothing. Yet every exchange office is supposed to pay 100 
dollars per month. 
  Travel firms are also supposed to bring in hard currency; 
after all, they actually provide services for foreign currency. 
There are about 200 travel agencies in Tbilisi, yet only seven 
of them have licenses. We warn them that all of the income that 
is earned without a license--that is, unlawfully--will be 
confiscated (this also applies to the currency exchange offices)! 
  [Aslanishvili] The city is flooded with "improvised 
markets"--that is, all kinds of buying and selling at subway 
stations and in other public places. Is anybody inquiring as to 
what is being sold? Besides the fact that the city's unique 
character is ruined and everything looks like one big bazaar, is 
the state getting anything out of this? 
  [Salaridze] Those citizens engaged in commercial activity 
are 
in fact operating without registration and, of course, the 
budget gets practically nothing from them. For example, every 
day there are about 5,000 citizens selling things at the 
Isanskiy Rayon swapmeet, and every day they pay the fair 
organizers 20,000 coupons. About 60 persons who have set up 
booths on the swapmeet grounds have been assessed income taxes. 
This problem is the result of the government's 4 May 1993 Decree 
"On Freedom of Trade," Article 7 of which exempts citizens from 
taxes on earnings from an unorganized, one-time retail trade 
deal. But the decree does not explain just what is to be 
considered "an unorganized retail trade deal." Hence, it is 
almost impossible to determine whether a man is doing regular 
business or just engaged in a "one-time retail trade deal." It 
is just as impossible to determine his earnings. In order to get 
all these "free businessmen" on the books and enhance budget 
revenues we think it would be useful for the Cabinet of 
Ministers to repeal Article 7 of the 4 May 1993 Decree and 
institute a trade tax for merchants at markets and swapmeets 
instead of an income tax, to be paid together with the fee for 
their place of business. In addition, we need to prohibit 
citizens from doing business outside of kolkhoz markets, 
swapmeets, and special places designated for the purpose. 
  There are other reserves as well. 
  As you know, due to developing entrepreneurship, coupon 
inflation, and other circumstances, residential buildings and 
other structures have become very costly. Most of the buying and 
selling is with Russian rubles and American dollars, but when 
agreements are notarized the amounts of the deals are mostly 
given in coupons, and usually at a lower price. Here are some 
examples: According to the records of Notary Office No. 5, in 
December of last year on Vazha-Pshavela Avenue a four-room 
apartment (47 square meters) was sold for eight million coupons. 
On Paliashvili Street a one-room apartment sold for four million 
coupons. According to Notary Office No. 1 a two-room apartment 
on Vazha-Pshavela Street (31 square meters) went for five 
million coupons; in Gldanskiy Rayon a three-room apartment (45 
square meters) went for three million coupons, and on Moscow 
Avenue a one-room apartment went for 500,000 coupons. These 
"cheap" deals are costing the budget considerable amounts of 
money, because the state fee is supposed to be 10 percent of the 
amount stipulated in the agreement. We believe it would be 
useful for the relevant agencies to determine actual prices and 
work out coefficients on the basis of characteristics of cities, 
rayons, and individual neighborhoods, so that when verifying 
deals, in order to calculate the state fee correctly, notary 
offices can raise the book assessment of these structures. 
  There have been many cases where entrepreneurs export large 
amounts of goods out of the republic but do not properly report 
their income and thereby avoid paying the budget what they owe. 
In June of 1993 alone 5.1 million dollars' worth of goods were 
passed through Poti Customs for export (including around 11 
tonnes of metal worth two million dollars). For example, a check 
of one firm, Merkuri, revealed that organizations engaged in 
foreign economic business are grossly violating tax discipline; 
Merkuri was assessed an additional 37,200 dollars and five 
million coupons to the state budget. This is just one example, 
the result of inspecting just one organization! 
  We have collaborated with the Justice Ministry to work out a 
new draft article for the Criminal Code providing for liability 
for concealing income. It calls for five years' imprisonment if 
the concealed income exceeds ten times the minimum wage. Severe 
financial penalties are also provided for. 
  [Aslanishvili] Businessmen complain that all kinds of 
inspectors and controllers are harassing them, that they are 
audited time after time, they get it both from the Tax 
Inspection and from the Chamber of Control.... 
  [Salaridze] Their complaint is not entirely groundless. We 
are now talking with the officials of the Chamber of Control in 
order to coordinate inspections. We have no quarrels with one 
another. Our functions are completely separate. The Chamber of 
Control is the supreme control body, and monitoring of the 
budget is also in its hands. It can check up on us as well, see 
how we are doing, whether we are treating taxpayers right, but 
taxes and taxpayers are the Inspection's prerogative; in that 
sphere it is the chief and only one. The businessman will soon 
sense the coordinated actions of these two organizations and can 
breathe easier. As for other authorities, when the legislation 
settles this matter the businessman won't have to deal with 
anybody else. 
  [Aslanishvili] There has been a lot of talk about forming a 
Tax Police. What was the final decision? 
  [Salaridze] The Parliament did approve the idea of creating 
an enforcement structure under the Tax Inspection, but it will 
be the Inspection's Detection Administration rather than a 
police force. We deliberately avoided having a police agency; 
there are already enough police agencies and the public is 
confused. The Criminal Trial Code will empower the agency to 
combat concealed income. 
  [Aslanishvili] Won't it be something like the notorious 
OBKhSS [Department To Combat the Theft of Socialist Property]? 
  [Salaridze] Not at all. As I mentioned, our purpose will be 
to combat concealed income and to merge control, auditing, and 
enforcement forms, for the use of up-to-date information; this 
will require the appropriate auditing and accounting 
inspections. It will all be combined under one roof. Under 
conditions where the tax inspector also has the professional 
rights of detection personnel, you have to agree, the results 
will not be slow in coming, and our efforts against concealed 
income will be much more effective. 
  By the way, Tax Inspections having their own tax police is 
not anything new. Services like that have been in existence a 
long time in many countries of the West, and Russia has a 
20,000-man service of that sort right now. 
  As for the Internal Affairs Ministry's Administration To 
Fight Economic Crime--known as the OBKhSS--I think that this 
service has a much more important task to perform, and it would 
be wrong to trivialize those tasks. But when it comes to taxes, 
it is necessary to think about an effective separation of the 
functions in order to make taxpayers once and for all understand 
both their rights and their duties with respect to the state and 
the budget. 
  [Aslanishvili] What structural changes have taken place in 
your department in accordance with the new legislation? 
  [Salaridze] New structural mechanisms have been established 
in Tbilisi--financial-auditing apparatuses/equipment. 
Record-keeping is being handled in a new way. We must say 
frankly that our record-keeping system is still in the Stone 
Age. We need to install a computer system, starting with 
personal computers. Most important, record-keeping needs to be 
improved not only in our department but with taxpayers as well. 
Without cash registers they will simply no longer be able to 
operate. There is already a draft Cabinet of Ministers decree by 
which universal conversion to cash registers must take place. We 
will do the monitoring. 
  [Aslanishvili] But do you physically have that many cash 
registers? 
  [Salaridze] On that matter the Trade Ministry has a relevant 
proposal. Taxpayers will have to buy them. If they don't, they 
won't be permitted to do business. 
  A draft has been prepared for a Head of State edict on 
measures to improve our service's functions. 
  [Aslanishvili] Batono Davit, there are three kinds of 
currency circulating in our republic now--the coupon, the 
Russian ruble, and the U.S. dollar. This is probably causing you 
some trouble. Do you think that if we join the ruble zone it 
will rectify the situation? 
  [Salaridze] One thing is certain: we must do everything to 
preserve the national currency. What has wrecked the coupon is 
that anyone can deal how he pleases. As far as the ruble zone is 
concerned, it depends on what terms they offer us. One way or 
another, however, we must have our own currency; once the state 
has the ability to convert the coupon, it will become strong. 
  [Aslanishvili] Will the state have that capability in the 
near future? Right now we are living on foreign credits. 
  [Salaridze] That's right, we're living on foreign credits 
(many people don't even know that these credits were obtained 
thanks to the Head of State's personal authority), but it's a 
disgrace--no, it's a disaster--when all kinds of people line 
their pockets with these hard-won credits and don't even settle 
up with the budget for the earnings they make with these 
credits. We are checking into things and will soon bring them to 
light. 
  [Aslanishvili] Which brings me to the next question, one 
that 
has been bothering the public for some time. I'm referring to 
the notorious billions in credits so generously issued by the 
National Bank.... 
  [Salaridze] There probably are criminal elements in this, 
but 
the ones least to blame are those who took out the loans. In all 
the hullabaloo people forget that if an organization receives 
credit and pays off the obligation to the state, it is in the 
right. 
  [Aslanishvili] But isn't it a betrayal of the national 
interest to grant billions in credits at a rate of 40 percent? 
  [Salaridze] Why call the businessman to account for this? We 
should call the National Bank to account. The bank was supposed 
to take account of inflation rates, so don't blame the 
businessman! If they get us involved in checking this out, we 
will only be concerned about their compliance with their 
obligations to the budget. But in this sensational affair, it 
seems to me, everyone is doing his job but the state is not 
getting what it has coming to it, therefore, I repeat, our 
service needs to get involved. 
  [Aslanishvili] A lot of organizations and companies are 
requesting to be exempted from taxes and are putting forth 
substantive arguments. What measures are you taking? 
  [Salaridze] According to the new legislation, only 
Parliament 
has the right to grant exemption. This is correct. Not just 
anybody can get involved in exemption from taxes. Taxpayers must 
understand that it is no use going from office to office; they 
can only appeal to the Parliament. And I hope Parliament will 
stand firm. 
  In short, our empty state treasury needs to be filled. The 
tax service is going to do everything it can, as we will show by 
our actions.

<F P=106> [Interview with State Property Minister Avtandil Silagadze </F>
by Otar Khutsishvili: "Where Did the Promised Vouchers Disappear 
To?"; date and place not given] 
  [Text] The things people say trying to explain the 
country's troubles and ruination! Some blame it on former 
communists who have come to power: "Their attempts to build 
communism didn't work, now they've jumped on the market economy 
bandwagon, but they've come up empty there also." Others blame 
the national movements, the leaders of all those political 
parties: "These sloganeers and populists don't know anything and 
never will." Still others blame everything on the government: 
"If so-and-so had instituted reforms and carried out 
privatization soon enough we wouldn't be in this fix today." I 
was interested in this latter and decided to meet with the 
republic's State Property Minister Avtandil Silagadze. Our 
conversation started with an unconventional question. 
  [Khutsishvili] Batono Avtandil, is the bickering with your 
opponents getting you down? 
  [Silagadze] I have to admit it sometimes does. Not because 
we 
have many shortcomings in our work and can't give an answer (I 
never try to conceal anything) but rather because our opponents 
mostly argue with me from populist sentiments and 
incompetence--they are so incompetent that sometimes it's 
ridiculous. For example, consider the sensational "incident" in 
which one fair-sized store on Rustaveli Avenue was sold for 17 
dollars. 
  [Khutsishvili] What really happened? 
  [Silagadze] What happened was that last year the Tbilisi 
Main 
Administration of State Property privatized three establishments 
on Rustaveli Avenue in compliance with all laws and procedures. 
  One of them was the Mukhura Wine Store (78 square meters) 
which a labor collective bought for one billion coupons (worth 
17,429 dollars at the rate then). Another was Footwear Reception 
Outlet No 1 (six square meters), which was bought for 688 
dollars at the current rate then, on a competitive basis, by the 
Mothers' and Children's Association. The third establishment was 
Footwear Reception Outlet No 11 (16 square meters) which was 
bought for 6,874 dollars by a labor collective. The collective 
couldn't pay that amount by the deadline and the results of the 
auction were annulled. Incidentally, it wasn't the space of 
these establishments that was privatized but rather the leasing 
rights and the assets in the stores, and for a period of 10 
years. 
  [Khutsishvili] I'm glad the "17-dollar deal" turned out to 
be 
just a rumor, but there have been cases where certain 
"influential" persons have acquired the people's property for 
peanuts. Last year in Rustavi, for example, 1.2 million coupons 
was enough to buy the Construction Mechanization Administration 
and its machinery and equipment. Now that amount wouldn't buy 
you one used tire, let alone the machinery. 
  [Silagadze] A number of things need to be clarified 
regarding 
that case. First of all, that establishment was not sold on the 
basis of our privatization law but in accordance with former 
all-union laws. Therefore, even if our country hadn't had the 
law on privatization of state enterprises, that establishment 
would still have been privatized. Second, the leasing agreement 
stipulated from the beginning the establishment's purchase price 
of 1.2 million rubles (compare how many tires could have been 
bought at that price then), which was set by the book value of 
fixed assets at that time. Third, the payment of the amount 
started with rubles and ended before 3 August 1993--the period 
in which the ratio of the ruble to the coupon was 1:1. 
  Let me add that the Ministry has not yet made a final 
decision as to the privatization of that establishment. In 
general we have come up against big difficulties in appraising 
establishments to be privatized. At the present rate of 
hyperinflation, it would probably be better to assess 
establishments first on the basis of some hard currency, for 
example U.S. dollars, and then sell them for coupons at the 
appropriate rate of exchange. 
  [Khutsishvili] But what about so-called "covert 
privatization"? People have the notion that all the industrial 
enterprises, construction establishments, and retail trade and 
service outlets in the republic are privately owned. If that is 
so, why do you need a government-approved list of establishments 
to be privatized? 
  [Silagadze] Unfortunately, that notion is not groundless. 
There are, in fact, persons who have taken possession of some 
establishment or other and acquired state property unlawfully. 
That, however, is not privatization; it is a crime, and anyone 
who commits it must be punished to the full extent of the law. 
We have studied the problem and turned the materials over to the 
Procuracy to deal with. We are going to step up our efforts 
along these lines. 
  [Khutsishvili] People say all the tea factories and wineries 
have been sold off. 
  [Silagadze] We in the Ministry have only registered the 
privatization of the Khoni Tea Factory, which was sold on a 
competitive basis. If any self-styled owners turn up for the 
others, they will answer to the law. I can say the same thing 
about the wineries, except for three or four which were leased 
in previous years with the right of purchase. 
  [Khutsishvili] What about the hotels of Tbilisi? 
  [Silagadze] The same as with the tea factories. Only one of 
them--the Achara [Ajaria] Hotel--was founded as a joint stock 
company, and if other people imitate that there's nothing wrong 
with it. In fact, we welcome it. In all the civilized countries, 
hotels are privately owned. 
  [Khutsishvili] Batono Avtandil, let me turn once again to 
the 
government-approved list of establishments to be privatized. 
According to it, 4,950 establishments were supposed to be 
privatized last year, but the actual number did not exceed 902 
(18.1 percent). What happened? 
  [Silagadze] A lot of factors: the prolonged war in Abkhazia, 
internal disarray, the terrible crime situation, the lack of a 
legislative base, and, of course, our inexperience. All of these 
had an impact on privatization, which basically only affected 
retail and consumer outlets. In the first stage, of course, that 
was the orientation. 
  [Khutsishvili] You have mentioned objective obstacles to 
privatization. Have any subjective factors been at work as well? 
  [Silagadze] Of course there have. One major factor is a 
mistrust of privatization (because it's such a new thing). This 
may be perfectly natural: establishments are being removed from 
higher-level jurisdiction and beginning a new, independent life, 
and this certainly has to influence the activities of state 
structures, their functions and rights and duties. 
  [Khutsishvili] At first many people thought that 
privatization in Georgia ought to take place lightning-fast, by 
the "shock therapy" method. But it didn't work. Why? 
  [Silagadze] It didn't work out because it did not fit our 
conditions. "Shock therapy" couldn't have worked for us because 
the privatization law did not call for selling property directly 
to labor collectives and other legal and physical persons. 
That's why the State Privatization Program, which encompassed 
the second half of 1992 and the first half of 1993, was not 
carried out. The timeframe has been extended to the end of 1994. 
  [Khutsishvili] The timeframe could be extended indefinitely. 
Do you really think that privatization ought not to be speeded 
up? 
  [Silagadze] No, I'm in favor of speeding it up, but it has 
to 
be done rationally, taking account of the republic's specifics. 
It is especially essential to do this because all foreign 
investors who want to invest capital with us prefer to work with 
privatized rather than with state enterprises. And there's 
another factor: the assets of state establishments are being 
looted and plundered savagely these days. Once they are 
privately owned, this process will stop. 
  [Khutsishvili] And despite the fact that enterprises are 
being looted, one might say that the privatization of the 
republic's industry has hardly started at all. Everybody is 
aware, in fact, that if private entrepreneurs don't show up and 
get interested, we cannot create the market economy that we are 
pinning our hopes on. 
  [Silagadze] I agree. If we want our economy to grow strong, 
privatization really will have to be speeded up in industry, 
although it is also a fact that most of the joint stock 
companies these days (19 out of 35 in the republic) were 
established in the Ministry of Industry (versus five in the 
Agriculture and Food Industry Ministry, three in the Ministry of 
Architecture and Construction, one in the Ministry of Trade and 
Material Resources, two in the Department of Transportation, and 
so forth). This is the ministry that has the best privatization 
program. If it is implemented, our industry will soon advance to 
the front. 
  [Khutsishvili] Exactly how many joint stock companies will 
be 
established in the Ministry of Industry system? 
  [Silagadze] Around two hundred. 
  [Khutsishvili] Does that mean you think it is possible to 
plan the number in advance? 
  [Silagadze] I believe it is justified to the extent that it 
enables the state to carry out its policy in the privatization 
sphere. That is why it has adopted the criterion of the book 
value of the enterprises' fixed assets as of 1 January 1993. If 
that value exceeds 30 million rubles, the enterprise will have 
to be made into a joint stock company. This only applies to 
enterprises whose privatization is permitted by the state 
privatization program. 
  [Khutsishvili] But why have we taken this figure as the unit 
of measurement? 
  [Silagadze] Because many people have shunned conversion to 
joint stock companies. If it hadn't been established, a small 
segment of the public would have very easily taken possession of 
all the assets, while the majority would remain empty-handed. 
  [Khutsishvili] That's understandable, but what are we to do 
with enterprises that are valued at less than that? 
  [Silagadze] They are to be privatized basically by auction 
and on a competitive basis. But even in the case of a 
competitive sale, the state can play something of a regulating 
role on the establishment. How? The establishment is obliged to 
fill state orders, maintain its profile, its workplaces and so 
on. 
  [Khutsishvili] It's good when the state plays a regulating 
role in privatization processes. But it also has its negative 
side. Because the state retains 51 percent of the stock package, 
many enterprises are refraining from privatization. 
  [Silagadze] This motive does exist, but let's also keep in 
mind that it enables the state to manage the country's economy. 
In this case, the state retains 51 percent of the stock package, 
one portion of which is turned over to the labor collective free 
of charge, a minimum of 35 percent is sold for privatization 
cards, and the rest is sold for money (including to foreign 
investors). As I have said, this is essential to manage the 
process, but I don't think the state needs to retain a stock 
package in so many enterprises (there are about 400 such 
enterprises on the list). The list ought to be shortened 
considerably. This kind of privatization should take place 
basically in enterprises in which strategic goods are produced. 
  Let me add that if the state wants to maintain its position 
in an enterprise it can sell a package of stocks on a 
competitive basis, the terms of which will be binding on the 
owner, and we will have to have the future owner submit future 
business plans. I am certain that the best program will be 
submitted by the enterprise's workers and that they will win the 
competition. 
  [Khutsishvili] Another question: we promised the public we 
would distribute vouchers to them back in January of last year. 
But then in September.... Where did the promised vouchers 
disappear to? 
  [Silagadze] I'm sorry I can't give a positive answer yet. 
Almost everything is in readiness to print the vouchers (the 
design was made some while ago), but we haven't been able to 
come to financial terms with the company in France that is 
supposed to make the privatization cards for us. In other 
respects, the work is proceeding rapidly, lists of residents are 
being drawn up, and if the finance problem is settled we will 
have the vouchers in hand in two months. 
  [Khutsishvili] If privatization is speeded up but we don't 
have the vouchers, what will be left to give for them? 
  [Silagadze] That just won't happen. A minimum of 35 percent 
of the shares of all joint stock companies are to be sold for 
vouchers alone. And so, the public is not going to be hurt; the 
portion of assets allocated to vouchers will never be sold. As 
far as the face value of the voucher is concerned, that will be 
announced prior to distribution. [end of Q and A] 
  This, then, is the minister's, and the Ministry's, 
position with regard to privatization, the problems which need 
to be solved promptly in order to implement reforms and revive 
the country's economy. But what can the Ministry alone do in 
this big effort if the government doesn't get busy; and the 
government (both the former and the present government)--let's 
be frank--hasn't accomplished much reform. Quite apart from real 
accomplishments, the government doesn't even have a specific 
program to bring the country out of the crisis. There is plenty 
of debate, plenty of discussion of these issues; but nothing is 
getting done. 
  Reforms aside, February is over and the amounts of 
goods that were supposed to have been issued to the stores in 
January are not there yet. Our only consolation is bread, but 
because we are not complying with retail bread quota terms (it 
is not being delivered to the stores according to stipulated 
schedules and amounts), it is being sold without ration coupons, 
there are long lines again, and all the while there are daily 
food commission meetings being held in the Cabinet of Ministers, 
and the public has had it up to here with their promises.... No 
country on earth can eat promises!

<F P=106> [SAKARTVELOS RESPUBLIKA interview with Vazha Lordkipanidze, </F>
head of the Apparatus of the Georgian Head of State: "Reforms 
Need To Be Carried Out More Radically": place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] 
  [Correspondent] Recently, certain political circles have 
been 
blaming particular problems on the fact that the Head of State 
does not have a team to help him carry out his course of action. 
What do you think about that, and can we say that the Head of 
State's Apparatus does constitute a team? 
  [Lordkipanidze] At first we didn't even know the concept of 
team and we paid no attention to that factor. Now we are 
swinging to the other extreme and link the solution to any more 
or less important problem to the existence of a team. First we 
ought to figure out what we mean by "team." If we think of it as 
a group of persons who work for just one man and have assigned 
functions--someone creates the image, someone does the 
biography, someone writes up the conception, and so 
on--Shevardnadze couldn't even have such a team, for it would 
take considerable time, traditions, and the right circumstances. 
If, however, we mean the people who think like Shevardnadze and 
are his comrades-in-arms, whom he asks for advice and uses it to 
make decisions, and through whom he tries to implement those 
decisions, then he has always had that team and it is 
numerically strong right now. 
  In my opinion, this fuss over whether Shevardnadze does or 
does not have a team comes from two causes: the first is the 
extreme that I already mentioned, the second is a more serious 
one. The fuss is a deliberate one, because if Shevardnadze does 
not have people who think like him, with whom he can assess the 
situation, if he doesn't have a laboratory where he can think 
through programs, strategies, and tools of implementation, in 
that case, of course, the Head of State will look powerless, 
there will be no government or even a state. Certainly the 
staffers of the Apparatus, along with other political and state 
figures, scientists, and specialists who surround the Head of 
State, do make up his team. The Head of State's Apparatus is a 
part of his team. One of the main principles governing the 
structure of the Apparatus derived exactly from that. When 
creating the Apparatus on the basis of the law passed by the 
Parliament we studied practically every country's experience and 
created the structure of the Apparatus on that basis. When we 
put it together we received advice from German and American 
colleagues and experts from the Euro-Association. They are still 
working in the Apparatus and helping us. Just as there is 
nothing exactly like the institution of the Head of State, the 
Apparatus as well is a vehicle of new content. It is a structure 
that serves analytical rather than executive functions. Its 
duties are defined such that there is no way it can take over 
the functions of the Cabinet of Ministers, much less the 
Parliament. It cannot be compared to any old structure of 
centralized administration; in the context of the necessity of 
carrying out a rigorous policy of decentralization, such 
centralization would be wholly unacceptable. The Apparatus's job 
is to help the Head of State work out his position with respect 
to the development of various spheres, sectors, and processes. 
This also entails the formulation of long-term conceptions and 
program documents, also local issues. However, our activity is 
in no way linked to the executive branch. I can state 
confidently that there has never been a single instance of 
interference in the old or the new Cabinet of Ministers or any 
ministry or their functions. We have never had a single quarrel 
with the executive branch, let alone a conflict. This is 
natural. Our jurisdictions don't intersect, nor could they. The 
guarantees of this are built into the structure of the 
Apparatus's task. No attempt by any private person can violate 
that. 
  [Correspondent] Does the Apparatus take part in cadre 
selection and appointments? For example, ministers and their 
deputies, factory directors, and so on? 
  [Lordkipanidze] The Apparatus only takes part in the 
selection and appointment of leadership cadres for bodies of 
local administration. The Parliament granted this right to the 
Head of State. In the Apparatus, essentially a specially created 
service performs this function. The final decision is made by 
the Head of State after consulting with leaders of the Cabinet 
of Ministers and taking account of recommendations by 
parliamentary commissions and factions. As for the selection of 
ministry leadership and other cadres, the Apparatus is not 
involved; that is not its function. 
  [Correspondent] By what principle do you choose members of 
the Apparatus? 
  [Lordkipanidze] We have posts of adviser, state adviser, and 
consultant; this in itself defines the criterion--high 
professionalism and high moral qualities. You often hear, to be 
sure, that the Apparatus is bloated, but compared to similar 
institutions in other countries the number of our staffers is 
modest; it is only a third as large as even the smallest 
apparatuses of heads of state anywhere in the world. We include 
academicians, professors and holders of the doctorate, 
candidates of science, and representatives of 16 parties and 
movements. 
  Any work with us goes essentially by the principle of 
agreement; on the one hand this enables us to avoid creating an 
entrenched bureaucracy, and on the other hand it enlarges the 
circle of membership. We work with all the scientific research 
institutions of the Academy of Sciences, the Tbilisi State 
University and its departments, almost all the sociological 
survey centers in Tbilisi, and representatives of both the 
traditional and modern schools of psychology. 
  [Correspondent] And does all this material come to the 
attention of the Head of State? 
  [Lordkipanidze] Shevardnadze's energetic industriousness is 
well known. This means that he himself works with all the 
services in the Apparatus. There are no hierarchical levels in 
business dealings with him. He is in direct contact with 
practically all the Apparatus's top officials, meeting with them 
regularly and listening to them. He has the same direct contacts 
with ministry and department officials, mayors, and local 
administrators. These contacts are basically made outside the 
Apparatus. You can argue with the Head of State and express your 
opinion. That is the main criterion of his demands--rigorous 
thinking, innovation, the creative and systematic approach to 
problems. He is a very good and courteous listener. He listens 
carefully to his advisers and correlates their opinions, but he 
always makes the decision himself. There is nobody who can force 
a decision on Shevardnadze. I don't mean cases where someone has 
confronted the Head of State with a short-sighted and 
thoughtless action and created serious problems for the country. 
Nor am I referring to compromise decisions dictated by some 
untenable predicament. 
  I flatly disagree with the notion that the Head of State 
places the Apparatus before Parliament. The Head of State, like 
every Apparatus staffer, understands the Parliament's crucial 
importance very well in its capacity as one of the chief and 
essential institutions and guarantors of independent statehood 
and democracy. 
  [Correspondent] We often hear charges that Shevardnadze has 
not figured out what kind of Georgia he is building. There are 
some who accuse him of trying to return to socialism, while 
others accuse him of wanting to build a Chinese-style socialism. 
What does Shevardnadze really want? 
  [Lordkipanidze] I don't agree with the notion that 
Shevardnadze has not worked out a program; he has, and he has 
announced it publicly many times. 
  Some people also accuse Shevardnadze of not even having a 
conception or orientation of a foreign policy. This charge is 
convincingly refuted by the Head of State's calculated system of 
official visits abroad in the past year. The past year and a 
half has been an active period of foreign policy formulation for 
Georgia. I believe this process is certainly continuing today, 
and I'm certain that the results of his official visit to the 
U.S. will constitute clear proof of that. 
  Is it mere chance that Georgia is the chair country of the 
Black Sea Basin Countries Commonwealth, entailing new forms of 
integration of relations? That Georgia is a member of the 
Euro-Association and Euroconference? That we have representation 
in NATO? Isn't our orientation reflected in the formula "a 
commonwealth of commonwealths," which Shevardnadze suggested 
some time ago and which the world community has already accepted 
and confirmed? Surely that was not said just for the sake of the 
phrase; rather, it embodies processes that are favorable to us, 
very specific and promising. In my opinion, that represents a 
global orientation. 
  Hence, on the one hand we are pursuing a Westward 
orientation, and I personally am in favor of that. On the other 
hand, certain vehicles of that orientation pay no attention to 
the opinion of the West and its political leaders specifically 
regarding Georgia, our state and our Head of State. The West has 
never had any doubt about Shevardnadze's policy course and its 
orientation. How could anyone assume that the West, the U.S., 
doesn't know where Georgia is heading and what its orientation 
is and still offer support and trust to Shevardnadze? 
  The charge of trying to turn back the clock is absurd, 
because the very process of turning back is absurd and 
inconceivable. It is impossible to stop historical development, 
progress, and civilization, to turn back the clock. 
  It is entirely natural and logical, then, that Shevardnadze 
cannot be nostalgic for the past, unlike certain opposition 
politicians who define the present by a Georgia of the late 
Middle Ages and are more inclined to embrace the concepts and 
orientations of that period than of a Georgia of the 21st 
century. 
  [Correspondent] Nevertheless, reforms in Georgia are going 
very slowly to say the least. Not only that but there are 
increasingly louder calls for restoring the old structures 
before creating new ones.... 
  [Lordkipanidze] It may be true that we were in fact too 
hasty 
to dismantle certain structures, but there is no way we are 
going to correct that mistake with a bigger mistake. There is 
absolutely no way we can begin to restore the old structures and 
then transform them later, because that will cause even more 
destruction. 
  I am in favor of carrying out reforms much more radically. I 
believe that the only realistic way out of our grave 
social-economic situation is to carry out radical economic 
reforms and establish market relations everywhere and in 
everything. But this will take a new system of thinking; 
everyone will have to understand the need for private property, 
development of the private sector, entrepreneurship and 
business. We have the chance to become a state having an 
independent economic system, and we must not pass up that 
chance. We already let it slip through our fingers. We must 
never repeat that mistake. Unfortunately, Georgia is not well 
endowed with highly qualified cadres of economists, so at the 
initial stage we will have to have help and advice from foreign 
specialists. The paradox of it is that the West is actively 
trying to help us in this, yet we keep on doing things our own 
way. No systematic work is being done in this regard. 
  [Correspondent] In my opinion, those who oppose the 
formation 
of a market economy aren't willing to make concessions. When 
some minister or big enterprise executive gives a speech you get 
the impression that either he has no conception of market 
relations or he is deliberately playing the fool. 
  [Lordkipanidze] Indeed, often they have only a hazy idea of 
the new relations. Let's keep in mind that we used to study 
economics in the Course of Political Economy. Some people really 
are fooling themselves, because market relations are in conflict 
with their personal interests. We also need to keep in mind that 
corruption still flourishes. 
  Of course, the principles of the market economy will 
diminish 
the rights of the ministries. When market relations are in 
place, the ministries will no longer have the economic functions 
they did in the era of the centralized, planned economy. In my 
opinion, the ministries should retain the function of policy and 
strategy formulation and, for example, the implementation and 
monitoring of two or three federal programs. Moreover, the 
process of decentralization and destatization must not be done 
at one stroke but in well-thought-out phases. In the initial 
stage we need to formulate new, mutually beneficial relations 
and principles governing the ministry and its subordinate links. 
This could be done by agreement or some other specific form. 
  [Correspondent] That makes all the more surprising the 
recently launched campaign against private structures.... 
  [Lordkipanidze] A lot of honest men have gone into business 
these days, because they want to realize their potential, and 
business gives them plenty of opportunities. The only thing that 
can regulate the private sector, again, is economic levers. Of 
course we cannot permit the looting of the state, but we must be 
very careful not to smother business just as it is getting on 
its feet. Unfortunately, we see the danger of this everywhere. 
  Unfortunately, we often make big mistakes which we then 
blame 
on other people's maliciousness. Instead of going through 
specific, phased periods, we dismantled everything that was old 
but failed to create anything new. In the late 1980s we faced 
specific economic problems which would have been much easier to 
find realistic and promising solutions to then, through joint 
efforts, than today. Instead of acting wisely, we are at each 
other's throats. All we do is yell, We'll tighten our belts and 
make it through.... Now that we have a ruined economy on our 
hands, we will have to start from scratch to find solutions, 
ways to restore the economy, essential and beneficial economic 
ties. It is probably due to excessive politicization that we 
have not yet appreciated Russia's economic market and its truly 
rich potential. At a time when the whole world was rushing to 
get in on Russia's market, we who were already there--at a time 
when we had more opportunities than ever before to take 
advantage of that market--we were in the process of abandoning 
it, and consciously or unconsciously we rejected 
everything--including things that objectively belonged to us. I 
think we didn't know then and possibly we haven't realized even 
today, that a totally new social-economic entity has taken shape 
in Russia itself: capitalism is developing vigorously in Russia. 
This opens prospects for completely new, mutually beneficial 
economic relations on a non-imperial basis. If we had realized 
this in time we wouldn't be in this predicament today. 
  How would this benefit us today? Well, Russia and Georgia 
would be dotted with joint enterprises founded on mutually 
beneficial terms. Economic partnership would not be linked 
solely to political and state relations between us, and changing 
them would no longer depend on the will and desires of just a 
few political forces. Production would be revived. Goods would 
be produced, a sure guarantee against inflation. We would also 
gain much in political terms: a very strong and influential 
segment of people in Russia, the segment basically in charge, 
businessmen, would be interested in Georgia and good relations 
with it. They would oppose, for example, the reactionary mafia 
that defeated us in Abkhazia. 
  Our relations with the West would also be different. In 
1990, 
I used to receive five or six solid foreign businessmen every 
day in the Council of Ministers; they were interested in 
economic cooperation with Georgia on new principles. Naturally, 
they also wanted to use Georgia to enter the Russian market, but 
if we had taken advantage, Georgia would have all kinds of 
operating Western-Georgian joint enterprises right now, and we 
would be linked to the West with economic threads. Then there 
would be many more people in the West who cared about Georgia 
and its fate, and Western aid and support would go beyond mere 
moral support. We suffered very badly from the absence of such 
support during the tragic days of Sukhumi. And if we are to be 
objective, the West's moral support was due to the reputation 
and world authority of just one man--our Head of State. 
  I am certain, though, that the most effective way to settle 
any regional conflict is to pursue a course of radical economic 
reform. I have no doubt that in the future, it is the activation 
of economic mechanisms that will prove to be the most effective 
and realistic way to finally settle the regional conflicts with 
Abkhazia and Tskhinvali.

<F P=106> [Article by National-Democratic Chairman Giorgi Chanturia </F>
under rubric "Point of View: The Way I See It. Discussion: How 
Can We Help Georgia?": "Argumentum ad Rem"] 
  [Text] This item derives from part two of 
National-Democratic Party Chairman Giorgi Chanturia's final 
speech at the National-Democratic Party's open conference in 
Tbilisi on 19 February 1994. 
  In brief, then, we can formulate what we have to do 
this way: begin to build statehood, convert to the market 
economy, establish law and order, create an army, restore 
Georgia's territorial integrity, stabilize the economy, convert 
to a national currency by strengthening the coupon, and 
establish a strong government. (This latter ranks first in 
importance, because without a strong government any restoration 
of statehood is out of the question). It is very difficult to 
accomplish these tasks, especially given our objective problems, 
but we declare in all seriousness that it is possible, and if we 
want to exist we have to accomplish these tasks. 
  As to the ways by which all the problems must be solved and 
how Georgian statehood is to be built are things we have our own 
view of, and it is already known to many, but we still deem it 
necessary to set forth a few of our ideas again, schematically 
at least: 
  A) THE ECONOMY. 
  CATASTROPHIC describes the situation in the 
national economy. Incorrect economic policies have brought it 
about that not only normalization of society's socioeconomic 
situation but also our statehood is in doubt. 
  The government has clearly failed to realize that the 
country's political safety and independence depend vitally on 
its economic security, whose foundation has to be an independent 
national economic system. Yet the creation of such a system has 
hardly even been started--in fact, what we see is the reverse. 
For a Georgia left without a system of economic security, state 
independence can only be symbolic. 
  Incorrect economic policies have also had an adverse effect 
in the country's social infrastructure. One might say that what 
is at work in Georgia today is not the "economic growth" 
principle but rather the "one-sided distribution" principle that 
is widespread in some developing countries. In order to realize 
the "economic growth" principle, the following stimulating 
factors are needed: the institution of private property, free 
enterprise, and competition. At a time when these factors are 
absent, when ownership by the "Reds" (which is called state 
ownership) holds a monopoly position, no real new national 
wealth is being created, and what there is is distributed in 
favor of a tiny segment of society in close contact with state 
structures and official or unofficial militarized groups. As a 
result, a very tiny segment of society is growing rich rapidly, 
while the standard of living of the majority is declining 
catastrophically, which creates a fine context for social 
upheaval. 
  The situation is further aggravated by uncontrolled 
inflation 
resulting from the government's mistaken monetary-credit policy. 
Inflation, of course, has its most devastating impact on the 
low-income and socially least protected segments of society. If 
the present economic system remains unchanged, great cataclysms 
can be expected, which, given the absence of flexible 
socioeconomic levers, can only be averted by the use of physical 
force, and this would make any democratic civil society in 
Georgia a mere fantasy. 
  Georgia's economic strategy should be oriented toward the 
creation of an independent national economic system, which 
requires the formation of a unified Georgian market, unified 
economic space, and an autonomous monetary-credit system. 
  At this point we must address the provocatively introduced 
theme of Georgia's entry into the so-called "ruble space." Quite 
aside from the fact that the advocates of the Russian "ruble" 
never bother to adduce arguments or any competent, scientific 
reasoning to persuade their opponents and the people but rather 
attempt to accomplish their aim through demagoguery and naked 
populism, the point lies elsewhere: there is no such thing as a 
"ruble" zone, there is only the ruble of the Russian Federation, 
used by the subjects of that Federation. All the countries and 
semi-countries which introduce the Russian "ruble" officially 
become de facto members of the Russian Federation. 
  The fact that the Russian ruble is unofficially in 
circulation here means nothing; we have dollars in circulation 
also, yet the state, if it wishes, can easily make the coupon 
the sole medium of payment (this can also be done by means of 
administrative organs) and solve the problem. 
  They are also ignoring the fact that the coupon and the 
ruble 
are qualitatively the same currency, the only difference being 
the rate of decline in value (this difference itself will soon 
disappear in connection with the virtual halt of reforms in 
Russia). 
  From the economic standpoint, then, there can be no 
justification for introducing the Russian ruble, and it will not 
improve the people's situation in the slightest. It will be 
solely a political move designed to destroy Georgian statehood 
totally and turn Georgia into a de facto part of the Russian 
Federation. (Similarly, some people think that instead of 
100,000 coupons in pay they will receive 100,000 rubles; in 
reality, however, they will get an amount in rubles 
corresponding to the exchange rate of 100,000 coupons, and our 
people's financial resources will remain the same as today--at 
best.) 
  Again, all this talk about "restoring old ties" is nonsense, 
because it is impossible to restore "old ties" without 
resurrecting socialism, and restoring socialism is 
inconceivable. We can talk about establishing ties with our old 
partners, so to speak, in Russia and the CIS countries, but 
these will be qualitatively new ties and will not give those who 
wish for the restoration of the "old ties" the effect they are 
hoping for. 
  Nobody is against such ties, but, we repeat, unless we 
establish our own economic system and implement the correct 
economic policy, these ties will yield no benefits. 
  The goal of an economic policy must be solid economic 
growth, 
a stable monetary system, solutions to problems of employment, 
and a balance in foreign economic relations. This will require: 
the advent of a reform government (no reforms can be carried out 
by persons who spent decades building a socialist economy and 
are still today talking about "old" ties, which is to say, a 
parasitical economy)--the kind of government which will carry 
out comprehensive reforms, in all spheres of life and, in 
particular, the economy, following the recommendations of the 
International Monetary Fund and other authoritative 
international organizations, with no populism and no toying with 
the public; 
  --it will require the transformation and rationalization of 
present management structures; 
  --a legal foundation for economic reforms; 
  --genuine property ownership reform in all sectors of the 
economy; 
  --implementation of a rigorous monetary-credit policy in 
order to stop inflation, form capital and halt the capital 
drain, and ensure a stable monetary system; 
  --implementation of a state policy fostering private 
enterprise and small businesses; 
  --liberalization of foreign economic ties--rationally--and 
measures to make Georgia a country having an open economic 
system. 
  Georgia used to be dominated by the myth that we could 
prosper by Borzhomi water and tea alone, which proved 
destructive. Now a second myth is coming into being, namely that 
we are doomed and that if Russia doesn't save us we will perish; 
this is no less dangerous to us. We have to realize that with a 
team of reformers and by converting to the market economy 
without populism, by making wise use of our resources, through 
purely economic contacts--including with the countries of CIS 
(but without any political subtext--and, most important, through 
honesty and labor we can bring the country out of its economic 
crisis and create the conditions necessary for a normal life. 
  B) LAW AND ORDER. 
  FIRST OF ALL, the structures of authority need to 
be cleansed of clans, representatives of bandit gangs, and dope 
addicts. 
  Certain types of narcotic substances ought to be legalized 
in 
order to strike a blow against the narcobusiness that is 
beginning to take shape. 
  Even though we are in principle against the death penalty, 
we 
believe it is acceptable, temporarily--for a span of two to 
three years--to make use of the supreme penalty against dope 
peddlers and distributors, terrorists, and kidnappers. 
  Of course, the appropriate changes will have to be made in 
the Criminal Code. 
  The Internal Affairs Ministry will have to change radically, 
stop being a politicized institution protecting the authorities 
and turn into a structure protecting citizens and their rights. 
  All parties, including those who support the authorities, 
must be disarmed. All unofficial military formations must be 
abolished. Any weapons held by security workers and persons who 
need protection must be registered in the Internal Affairs 
Ministry. 
  The war against crime must be more than just a campaign; it 
needs to be purposeful, and it ought to start "from the top" 
rather than "from the bottom," the way it is today. 
  There are other specific questions which also need specific 
approaches and solutions. 
  C) FOREIGN POLICY. 
  THE STATE must resume its pro-Western course, but 
it must be genuine rather than merely declarative. At the same 
time, we have to take account of Russia's geopolitical interests 
and be willing to compromise--though not at the expense of our 
own sovereignty and state interests--to establish normal 
relations with Russia (it also needs to be pointed out that not 
everything depends on us, and the most important thing, still, 
is just who is going to be in charge "up there." Yeltsin, who 
has already embarked on the path of derzhavizm and has even, in 
effect, buried economic reforms, will certainly share 
Gorbachev's fate if he carries out such a course, because it is 
not going to satisfy either the democrats or the extreme 
nationalists. We have to have an interest in seeing Gaydar and 
other true democrats come to power in Russia, but today's 
authorities there--specifically, Chernomyrdin's government--are 
objectively laying the groundwork for a quite different regime, 
and Zhirinovskiy will be at its head). 
  Georgia must cooperate actively with the UN, the 
Eurocouncil, 
and other international organizations. We need to have 
especially close ties with NATO's military-political bloc, and 
we must certainly join the Cooperation for Peace initiative. 
  Georgia has to work actively in the North Caucasus, but, at 
this stage, on the level of people's diplomacy. 
  Finally, any correct and fruitful foreign policy necessarily 
requires a top-to-bottom reorganization of the Foreign Affairs 
Ministry and substantial cadre changes (which should include our 
diplomats as well, with rare exceptions). 
  We need to work out a serious foreign policy conception, 
define our priorities, and work purposefully on the basis of 
that conception. 
  D) CERTAIN DIRECTIONS OF DOMESTIC POLICY. 
  THE MAIN THING is relations with the national 
movement, reports of whose demise are greatly exaggerated. Quite 
the contrary: if everything goes on as it has, the national 
movement will gain new forces, find ways to make use of social 
activism, draw the old, not-all-that mistaken, appropriate 
conclusions from the past, and take shape as a very solid and 
meaningful entity. 
  In the interests of statehood, it is essential that men of 
the national movement--in general, "new men"--come into power. 
It is a little embarrassing when the people who speak of the 
destructive force of the national movement are those who for 
years destroyed the country themselves, sold off the lands, and 
squandered state property, especially considering that the one 
year of Gamsakhurdia's rule which people have been harping about 
was not a year of national-movement government. In fact, 
Gamsakhurdia started his "deep statehood" activity by fighting 
the national movement's supreme organ--the National Congress (we 
could also mention Beso Gugushvili's ideas and decisions of 
convergence and other anti-national notions). The national 
movement has never been in power, and even if it did fervently 
desire to destroy anything it couldn't do so. There may be many 
who do not like the national movement, but at least its 
representatives have never given away credit. You may look at 
the national movement in various ways, but it wasn't the 
national movement which brought in one-dollar wheat at one 
dollar and thirty cents--it was the person who is the Vice 
Premier today. It isn't the national movement that has been 
eating up the humanitarian aid, and it did not lose Abkhazia. 
And, of course, admitting a few representatives of the national 
movement to power just to prettify the facade does not mean that 
the national movement has come to power. 
  The national movement has made mistakes--quite a few. But 
let 
him who has never done any wrong to his own people, and is 
infallible, throw the first stone. Hence, we have to stop laying 
blame, and entrust the nation's fate to those who are capable of 
building the state and, in particular, those who wish to. 
  Today, the authorities are on the brink of anarchy, while 
anarchy is ready to take power. According to Lichtenberg, order 
is the prerequisite of any good thing, but is anything leading 
us to order? Is it going to be necessary to give up on democracy 
and establish a dictatorship? No, it is not, because it is 
possible to achieve order through democratic structures as well. 
Almost every democratic country has gone through a "democratic 
Caesarism" phase--that is, a period in which the rulers, in 
order to create strong democratic structures, have resorted to 
certain restrictions and other temporary measures. But in such a 
case, as in the case of carrying out reforms, the rulers have to 
enjoy the people's trust, and they must not abuse that trust. 
"Democratic Caesarism" implies strong presidential rule, though 
with a strong parliament and, as we have stated, with a large 
store of trust. 
  We must never forget for a moment that the problems of 
Abkhazia and Samachablo are still unresolved, and until they are 
there can be no question of order and stability. The people are 
aware of our party's views on these matters, so we will just add 
one thing: we need a differentiated approach to both problems, 
because while it is possible to make effective use of peaceful 
measures in regard to Samachablo and preserve our territorial 
integrity through reasonable compromise, in the case of 
Abkhazia, unfortunately, we will have to first shift the 
emphasis to partisan warfare and then, after an army has been 
formed, resolve the conflict through large-scale military 
operations. 
  The business of building an army and military industry has 
to 
be turned over to civilians and politicians, while professional 
military men must be in charge of military operations and other 
specific spheres (as in all normal countries). 
  E) HOW SHALL WE BEGIN? 
  DESPITE objective factors, the government and all 
its component parts cannot dodge responsibility for the 
country's ruin and destruction. In order to escape 
responsibility, one ought to have to resign from one's position 
or, perhaps, even quit politics. If this does not happen 
voluntarily, we have stated repeatedly that it will happen by 
force, either through social upheaval or by mass actions, 
because the people have no other remedy, and there has been no 
light at the end of the tunnel for quite a while. 
  Georgia truly cannot stand such cataclysms, and this is why 
it is all the more urgent that our leadership be changed by 
peaceful means. 
  First of all, a new election law must be passed and 
extraordinary parliamentary elections scheduled (a Constitution 
can be adopted simultaneously with the elections, and no one 
will give us the time to put off elections until Abkhazia is 
regained). The elections must be organized on the basis of party 
rosters, and with a 5-percent barrier for the parties (a 
10-percent barrier for blocs). This way, we will have two or 
three really solid parties in Parliament. Then the winning 
party, or a coalition of parties, can put together a government, 
and, finally, a "new generation"--that is, persons of a 
non-socialist mentality--will come to power. 
  Election day must be announced quickly, but meanwhile 
(today, 
one might say) the Cabinet of Ministers ought to step down (and 
not on grounds of the budget). Instead of the old party hack or 
former factory director, the government should be headed by a 
politician who has the support of both the majority and the 
minority in Parliament. 
  Because the country's very existence is at stake, we must 
all 
rally our forces and share responsibility. A national-salvation 
government will have to be made up of representatives of both 
the majority and the minority in order to achieve a 
consolidation of political forces, ensure that reformers and 
honest persons are in charge and that in addition to personal 
and party responsibility there is an increase in collective 
responsibility of the sort that we are so sorely in need of. 
Such a government will have just one drawback: because of the 
diversity of its make-up it will not be a team; on the other 
hand, however, it can unite the country, ensure the 
inviolability of the country's sovereignty until elections are 
held and carry out reforms. 
  The national-salvation government is our common 
responsibility in the land we call Georgia, the land we all must 
save and build regardless of our party affiliation, creed, or 
social status. We have a choice then--to join together, to face 
together the numerous problems threatening to engulf our people, 
or to keep on tearing at one another and giving Georgia away 
piece by piece to the forces "which have been, are, and will for 
a while continue to be" the test of our faith and our strength.

<H5>  DECLARATION OF THE "GEORGIA'S FUTURE" SOCIETY </H5>
  1. The basic goal of the Society's activity is the country's 
political, economic, cultural, and moral revival, the basic 
prerequisite of which is the restoration of Georgia's 
territorial integrity and the creation of the political, 
material, and legal base necessary to meet the needs of the 
population. 
  2. We condemn chauvinism, local separatism, and every form 
of 
demagoguery and are guided solely by principles of true 
democracy, people's friendship, protection of human rights, and 
the political, economic, and creative liberties of the 
individual. 
  3. Georgia's internal state system and 
administrative-territorial division must take full account of 
historical traditions, specific regional characteristics, 
satisfy the needs of the native peoples and national minorities, 
and be in accord with universally recognized human rights. 
  4. Our economic program rests on the modern world's 
practical 
experience of the organization and management of production as 
well as Georgia's national, historical, and production 
experience and characteristics. Because we believe that there is 
no alternative to a market economy, our aim is to promote the 
kind of market relations which will ensure effective realization 
of the country's material, labor, and scientific potential and 
strengthen the foundations of the country's spiritual life. We 
believe that a multi-structural, socially-oriented market 
economy is most in keeping with the country's development 
interests. Equal economic, organizational, and psychological 
conditions need to be provided for the development of all forms 
of property ownership. The state should not intervene directly 
in economic management but only in the creation and regulation 
of the kind of economic, organizational, and psychological 
environment whose ultimate goal is a functioning, balanced 
national economy. A multi-structural, socially-oriented market 
economy will serve to prepare the groundwork promoting the 
interests of all social strata (groups) and, in this way, the 
attainment of social harmony in society, which is an essential 
prerequisite for any revival of the country. 
  5. We endorse private and state ownership of the land. Only 
household, vacation home, and garden plot lands should be turned 
over to private ownership; all other lands should be owned only 
by the state, which can transfer land to citizens on a lease or 
permanent-use (possession) basis with the right of inheritance. 
A land's owner as well as a land's lessee, whether physical or 
legal persons, may themselves determine the form of production 
and organization of labor (peasant farming, individual farm 
operation, cooperative, partnership, state farm, or other). 
  6. The country needs its own currency, the use of which will 
require the preparation of the necessary material, economic, and 
organizational foundation. We endorse efforts to attract foreign 
investment and the effective use thereof, initially through the 
sale of stock shares, the creation of joint enterprises, the 
acquisition and use of new technologies, and so on. 
  7. The privatization process is in need of state regulation. 
We endorse the development of private property and the creation 
of the legal, economic, and organizational basis as well as the 
nurturing of entrepreneurial proprietors for the purpose. The 
state must provide the protection of property and its owners. 
  8. The cornerstone of Georgia's political and 
social-economic 
development is the integrated development of the country's 
regions. We believe it is essential to work out and implement 
goal-oriented state programs for the social-economic development 
of the various regions. They must take full account of the 
specific character of local economic and cultural life, 
prospects for the effective use of available resources, labor 
traditions and customs, and so on. 
  9. In the interests of the various strata of society, a 
clearly defined state social policy needs to be carried out. It 
is essential to provide real guarantees of citizens' rights to 
an education, health care, and social aid for certain categories 
of the population (pensioners, college students, single mothers, 
and invalids). State responsibility for scientific, cultural, 
and educational development needs to be increased. And the 
criminal practice of reckless experimentation in schools and 
health care facilities must be condemned and stopped. 
  10. At the present stage, one of the most important tasks is 
for the state to take care of our countrymen who have been 
forced to abandon their homes and have become refugees in their 
own homeland, also citizens who were robbed during the Civil 
War. The state will have to create not only temporary, 
elementary provisions for normal living but also, eventually, 
pay for their lost property with appropriate material 
compensation, because the people should not have to be liable 
for the results of the adventurism of political circles. 
  11. The country needs to have a properly trained, properly 
equipped [lines illegible] army and internal troops. Considering 
the exceptionally difficult tasks (the disarming of [words 
illegible] units and banded gangs) we believe it is possible to 
enlist properly qualified citizens of other states for military 
service on the basis of a temporary contract. In order to avoid 
collusion between mafia-gangster and state structures, measures 
need to be taken to purge state administrative and law 
enforcement agencies of persons who have been besmirched by ties 
to criminal elements, and strengthen and renovate the 
material-technical and organizational base of state security and 
internal affairs bodies. 
  12. In foreign relations, we endorse a policy of active 
neutrality. At the same time, owing to the country's 
geopolitical, historical, and economic characteristics, the 
Russian Federation and the other republics of the former Soviet 
Union will continue to be our country's chief partners in 
political and social-economic spheres; naturally, this does not 
rule out close relations with the world's other countries, in 
particular those of the Black Sea Basin. Particular priority 
must be given to the development of good-neighborly relations 
with all the republics of Caucasia. 
  13. Our Society will actively cooperate with all 
social/civic 
or political organizations, promote the harmonization of the 
goals and tasks of political parties and movements, and share 
analytical information for the purpose of preparing shared views 
as to the accomplishment of the tasks of the country's political 
and economic development at the present stage, in order to 
protect the interests of every stratum of society and eventually 
attain social harmony.

<F P=106> [Interview with Andro Devdariani, chairman of the board of </F>
the Agroindustrial Bank by Maradi Anasashvili: "It Is the Bank 
That Will Save Georgia"; place and date not given] 
  [Text] The Great Ilia 
  [Chavchavadze] said, "Every year the banks shall be obliged 
to make public how well or poorly they are doing and allow every 
man to inspect and assess the length and breadth of their 
activities." 
  This is exactly the style and method favored by our 
guest today, Andro Devdariani, the chairman of the board of the 
Agroindustrial Bank. 
  He was born in 1956 in Tbilisi. He graduated from 
Secondary School No. 58. In 1973-1974 he worked in the Kirov 
Machine Tool Factory. He graduated with honors from Tbilisi 
State University's Economics Engineering Faculty, and later 
defended his candidate's dissertation. 
  He is a candidate of economic sciences and has written 
about 20 scientific works. 
  In 1985 he was awarded the Komsomol Prize in science 
and technology. After that he worked as a laboratory head in the 
University, as a teacher, as a docent, and as chairman of the 
party commission. He is now a doctoral candidate. He was the 
council chairman of the Golden Bank Commercial Bank. 
  Batoni Andro and his friends laid the foundation for 
the revival of the villages of Dzhavakhetia. Through the years, 
he worked with students to build the Georgian village of 
Kotelia. In various parts of Georgia they rebuilt and restored 
churches and monasteries that had been destroyed and virtually 
forgotten, and they also did much to save the Garedzhi 
Complex. 
  He is married to Maia Kvezereli-Kopadze, a university 
docent, and they have two children. 
  [Anasashvili] Batono Andro, what kind of problems did you 
inherit on first coming to the bank? 
  [Devdariani] Well, when you come to a bank you have to know 
very well what kind of responsibility to the people and the 
country you are assuming. So being appointed to this post is a 
great honor and a burden to me, one that is not easy to bear, 
especially under today's conditions. 
  I came to the bank from science and business, and I have my 
own ideas and vision as to the most urgent changes in the system 
to be anticipated in the near future. 
  It was Great Ilia, you know, who founded banking in Georgia. 
His banking efforts alone are sufficient proof of the role the 
banks play in building the country. 
  [Anasashvili] Indeed, Ilia devoted much time and energy to 
banking, and people often said of him that "the bank is making 
him neglect his calling as a writer." In fact, someone even 
wrote a little verse: 
  "Do not give up your steed, "put down your abacus, Ilia, 
"all 
of this will vanish, pass away, "what will remain is your 
[immortal poem] `The Hermit.'" 
  [Devdariani] These days, sad to say, Ilia's spirit in the 
banks is confined to hanging his portrait in the board room. 
  Remember that a bank's reputation is the foundation of the 
public's trust by which every bank prospers. Rumors and slander 
cost the country dearly. Anyone who is dishonest deserves 
reproach, but all this endless talk and carping are unseemly. 
The way we do business, a dishonest man is quickly exposed. 
  But let's get back to our problems. 
  Although the Agroindustrial Bank is one of the biggest state 
structures, I found that wages and salaries were very low. 
Paradoxically, the bank's staffers have the least social 
protection. 
  Our bank's building is also in sad shape. One floor is 
occupied by the city commandant's office and we haven't been 
able to get it back. They don't even pay their lease. 
  We also have cadre problems; there are many nonprofessionals 
employed in this system who are not even qualified. Most 
important, they totally lack the necessary knowledge, skills, 
and habits. 
  Our bank has lots of other problems too. The first thing we 
need to do is root out vices such as the misuse of funds and 
personal travel at the bank's expense. We will no longer permit 
the subjective approach in granting loans, the way we used to 
grant loans at low interest rates on flimsy grounds. There were 
absolutely no criteria for setting the rates. This gave 
dishonest persons many loopholes and caused a lot of talk. 
  To make a long story short, I found I had more than enough 
to 
do. I've only been examining the problems for a few weeks; soon 
I will work out plans and begin to take practical steps. The 
public will be fully informed about what we do. 
  One thing is certain: most of the bank's profit has to be 
spent on social needs. 
  [Anasashvili] The country's agrarian sector is in critical 
condition. How can the Agroindustrial Bank help the countryside, 
the peasant? 
  [Devdariani] Of course the bank and the banking system must 
play a crucial role in solving the country's crisis. 
  It needs to be in tune with the structure of the national 
economy and conduct a reasonable monetary-credit policy to boost 
the economy. 
  By its nature, the Agroindustrial Bank is a versatile 
institution, serving our economy's strategic sector--the 
agrarian sector--through more than 70 offices. Right now, up to 
80 percent of our credit investment (400 billion coupons) is in 
the form of loans to financially shaky partners in agriculture, 
and the recovery of these loans is doubtful. The recovery 
failure rate of loans given in past years is due primarily to 
the breakdown in state discipline in agricultural enterprises, 
massive theft and wastage of products, and general lack of 
control. 
  Given the present disarray, I think it is totally 
unacceptable to grant credit at "reduced rates" to agricultural 
enterprises that are in shaky financial shape. The fact is that 
most of them are practically bankrupt. This also has resulted 
from the fact that 70 percent of the 10-percent loans granted to 
agricultural enterprises last year have not been recovered. 
  Things are made worse by the fact that the mechanisms 
stipulated in the law on mortgages, which would have made 
relations with debtors easier, have not been activated. 
  In general I think that granting loans at reduced rates to 
unpromising enterprises fails to stimulate their financial 
performance. Managers of such enterprises are used to sitting 
around waiting for government handouts, waiting for the 
low-interest loans that are charged to them to be written off or 
deferred. 
  As for the countryside and the peasant, we hope to benefit 
them in many ways. I'm optimistic because there are many 
knowledgeable, industrious, professional, and--most 
important--honest people working in our bank. They are always 
doing their best to help the countryside; the country can count 
on that. 
  [Anasashvili] At a meeting of the government's Food 
Commission, as we know, the National Bank proposed that you be 
obliged to allocate 65 billion coupons from your own funds so 
the agricultural enterprises could complete their spring 
operations. You came out categorically against it. Why? 
  [Devdariani] Here's why. 
  The National Bank stipulates that loans can be granted using 
a bank's own resources only if it has a stable surplus. But a 
surplus is possible only if there are deposits. In the case of 
Agroindustrial Bank institutions, however, there are practically 
none. 
  We are against that kind of loan practice because it is 
quite 
possible that it will inevitably lead to granting emission 
credit, which is the government's sole prerogative. 
  Considering our inflation and market conditions, giving 
credit--at the rate of 120 percent annually--is totally 
unacceptable. 
  In short, Georgia's economy is in terrible shape. The 
situation in the sphere of monetary-credit policy, as well, is 
uncertain, to put it mildly. In my opinion, both the former and 
the present managers of the National Bank are not conducting a 
real monetary-credit policy, they are just making individual 
decisions which they think reflect the country's essential 
interests. 
  [Anasashvili] Everybody knows that the banks are the life 
blood of the economy, which depends on them to function 
normally. In your opinion, what shape is Georgia's banking 
system in today? 
  [Devdariani] Georgia's banking system is only in the 
formation stage today. It is developing rather slowly, owing to 
many objective and subjective factors. 
  All else aside, the formation of a monetary-credit system 
characteristic of a market economy is a complex process. The 
right kind of banking system is being created, and taking part 
in it is a crucial and complex business, because essentially new 
banks are being formed. It requires working in a new way, new 
cadres. 
  The system is having a hard time getting free of old 
stereotypes. The number of banks is increasing day by day, of 
course, but numbers alone are not going to help things. Another 
negative factor is that the process is not being analyzed. A 
bank, of course, is a specific institution, but it must not have 
the seeming of a clan institution. 
  Another reason for the banking system's many shortcomings is 
the fact that conditions in the country are unstable. 
Furthermore, political forces have ambivalent attitudes toward 
the banks. Today, unfortunately, at some stage or other, any 
particular bank's power is defined by whoever stands behind it 
and sponsors it. Another unacceptable practice is when high 
officials establish banks just to "secure their own future." 
  Banks are institutions full of bustling activity, where 
everything is done according to the law, and where, as in any 
other sphere, you can even get rich, but only while maintaining 
human dignity, complying strictly with rules and regulations, 
according to your talent and ability. But ordinary people do 
work in banks, and all the woes afflicting our society can be 
sensed there as well. It is essential, therefore, for us all to 
struggle to restore things to health. Most important, I think, 
is the fact that always, and especially today, the banks have a 
grand national cause to pursue, requiring not only 
competence but also clean hands and a clean conscience. The 
bankers who were appointed as board chairmen along with me are 
educated, knowledgeable, honest, and "still unblemished" 
persons. We have to do the people's business; the public, the 
press, and television must be informed of our every step; and 
the people must hand down the verdict--not the way it's being 
done now, with prejudiced notions, using campaign methods, and 
insinuating statements, but weighing everyone's virtues and 
defects. 
  Banks, and bankers, must work strictly according to the 
rules 
and laws. 
  It is urgent and essential to create banks of the Western 
type. The wheel has already been invented, and we can't do any 
better; what we have to do is pick up on everything advanced and 
progressive and adopt it in accordance with Georgia's interests 
and Georgian realities. 
  We must also keep in mind that our banks' computer equipment 
is very primitive, and transactions are being carried out using 
the old methods at the same old pace. The reason is that the 
system is backward. Everything needs to be changed as soon as 
possible. I repeat, it is essential to create a banking system 
that befits a civilized country. It is the banks that will have 
to save Georgia. I hope that a strong cadre of bankers will soon 
take shape in Georgia to serve as a guarantee of the 
irreversibility of the country's democracy. [end of Q and A] 
  It looks as if this new executive, who is dedicated to 
his cause, pays attention to every detail, and favors strong 
financial discipline, is going to have to thoroughly overhaul 
the banking business. 
  Meanwhile, the hullabaloo concerning the banks 
continues. There are some who are categorically rejecting the 
new people. There are those who are doubtful that the new 
people's experience is sufficient to rebuild the banks and solve 
their problems. 
  Whatever the case, the choice has been made, and a "new 
broom" is coming. 
  We would like to accost the Great Ilia once more and 
remind you of what he said: "The bank represents one of the best 
and most reliable aspects of our life. Therefore, anyone who 
cares about our country ought not to gleefully seize upon every 
mistake, failure of foresight, and other shortcomings of the 
bank--these are inevitable in any new endeavor--but rather take 
careful note of them and just as diligently try to correct the 
mistake and eliminate the defect."
