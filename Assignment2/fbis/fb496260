<F P=106> [Commentaries by Aleksandr Kinsburskiy of "Vox Populi" and </F>
Sergey Turanov of the Economic News Agency] 
  [Text] 
  [Kinsburskiy comment:] The VP-AEN Service, in 
accordance with NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's order and with its 
participation, begins its quarterly determination of the 50 
leading and most successful Russian businessmen, indicating 
their ranking (from 1 to 50) and the average rating which 
establishes each one's "economic weight." 
  A preliminary list of 100 names included the managers (as of 
15 April) of the largest commercial organizations--banks, 
exchanges, funds, joint-stock companies, trading houses, 
insurance companies, joint ventures, and so forth. 
  The extent of these entrepreneurs' influence was determined 
by 50 experts--economics commentators of the leading mass media, 
economists and analysts from scientific and information centers, 
the managers of public economic organizations, and analysts from 
a number of commercial structures. A 10-point scale, where "10" 
is the maximum and "1" is the minimum evaluation of each 
businessman, was used, taking into account their contribution to 
the buildup of Russia's new market economy and economic power, 
and the amount of capital under each one's control. A list of 50 
leading Russian businessmen was compiled, based on their average 
rating, in April 1994. 
  In analyzing the published list of leading Russian 
businessmen, it should be taken into account that among the 100 
"contenders" suggested for the experts' evaluation there were 
mainly managers of the so-called new economic subjects. In other 
words, in conformity with the intention of the survey, managers 
in the state sector were not included in the preliminary list; 
nevertheless, they continue to exert considerable influence in 
the formation of Russia's new economy and they have vast 
material and financial resources at their disposal. For this 
reason, primarily representatives of banking and financial 
circles, as well as trading and middleman capital, took part in 
the "economic Olympics." Managers of enterprises that could be 
included in the "production" category, such as S. Fedorov (9), 
N. Bekh (10), V. Kadannikov (11), and others, make up no more 
than 15 to 20 percent of the list. 
  At the very top of the "pyramid"--the first four places--are 
financiers and bankers. But on the whole, representatives of 
financial capital make up more than half of the most successful 
businessmen. About one-third are stockbrokers and contemporary 
traders. 
  Not all the experts were able to evaluate the economic role 
of each person. In this connection, it is interesting to note 
that V. Gusinskiy not only headed the list of leading Russian 
entrepreneurs, but he was the only one to receive an evaluation 
by the 50 experts--a unique case. The economic power of other 
businessmen was determined with difficulty by one to 18 persons: 
V. Vinogradov, M. Khodorkovskiy, V. Neverov, S. Fedorov, and K. 
Borovoy by one person and V. Guchnik by 18 persons. It follows 
from this that the role of those named above in building up the 
Russian market is quite well-known. 
  [Turanov comment:] Rating Russian businessmen is a 
very difficult task because of the lack of reliable information 
on their incomes and the financial status of the firms they 
head. The opinion of experts obviously was based mainly on the 
image of the entrepreneurs and facts about the enterprises' 
activity reported in the mass media, as well as on "lobby" 
information. Nevertheless, the experts were equal to the task: 
in my opinion, the results of the survey accurately reflect the 
rating of the elite of Russian businessmen, both by personnel 
and by firms. 
  The pattern of "elite" enterprises is completely in keeping 
with the boom in banking activity in Russia--over half of the 
leading businessmen are managers of major banks. Because of the 
lack of development of the commodity futures market and stock 
markets, just two commodity exchanges (the MTV of Yu. Milyukov 
and the RTSB [Russian Commodity and Raw Materials Exchange] of 
K. Borovoy and A. Vlasov) and two stock exchanges (the MMFB 
[Moscow International Stock Exchange] of A. Zakharov and the 
MTsFB [Moscow Central Stock Exchange] of B. Pankin) made the 
list. The number of stockbrokers in the next list may be even 
smaller--K. Borovoy is now engaged in the sale of commercial 
projects in the "Molniya" NPO [scientific production 
association]. 
  Aside from banks, exchanges, and production, trading, and 
diversified enterprises, the list also includes an insurance 
company (ASKO, G. Duvanov), a telecommunications firm (RELKOM, 
A. Soldatov), and an investment fund (A. Fetisov), as well as 
firms engaged in the art business (the Dyagilev-Tsentr of Yu. 
Lyubashevskiy), firms working in the financial markets 
(Brokinvestservis, I Safaryan), and real estate (S.I. Realty, A. 
Vulfov). Managers of the major auditing and advertising firms 
did not make the list, although several candidates were 
suggested for the experts' attention. 
  The three "whales" of Russian business were represented by 
several persons--"Menatep" (M. Khodorkovskiy, L. Nevzlin, and V. 
Surkov), "Germes" (V. Neverov and G. Keselman), and the RTSB. 
They and the overwhelming majority of leading entrepreneurs are 
in business in Moscow. Other cities are represented by six 
individuals (N. Bekh of"KamAZ," V. Kadannikov of "AvtoVAZ," I. 
Nakhmanovich of "AvtoVAZbank," O. Kantor of the "Yugorskiy" 
Bank, I. Baskin of "Garant," and R. Kadyrov of the "Vostok" 
Bank, although persons who were not Muscovites made up roughly 
20 percent of those in the initial list. Such a low evaluation 
of regional business is evidently objective and traditionally 
associated with the concentration of financial and production 
capacities in the capital. 
  It may be noted that the overwhelming majority of leading 
businessmen, including leaders in the list, are not investing 
large sums in building up their own image. It is acquired by the 
large advertising campaigns mounted by firms headed by them. 
  The published list indicates the current rating. An analysis 
of its dynamics will be no less interesting. Evidently, there 
will be fewer average changes in the businessmen's rating than 
the politicians' rating. They may be linked with the startup of 
important projects and major advertising campaigns.

<F P=106> [Article by Oksana Dmitriyeva, doctor of economic sciences, </F>
chair of subcommittee on the budgetary system and extrabudgetary 
funds of the State Duma: "Budgetary Federalism in Russia: 
Analysis of the 1994 Draft Budget Shows That Its Approval Will 
Lead to the Further Growth of Inequality Among Regions and Will 
Actually Facilitate the Growth of Disintegrationary Processes in 
the Federation"] 
  [Text] In recent months, the government has stated several 
times that relations between the center and the regions are 
built on the principles of budgetary federalism. Budgetary 
federalism presupposes the fulfillment of several conditions. 
First, allotment to the budgets of federation subjects of enough 
income to allow them to ensure the territory's viability. 
Second, budgetary federalism assumes the implementation of a 
policy aimed at evening out levels of economic and social 
developmen--if, of course, the federal government intends to 
preserve its integrity. 
  The 1994 draft budget provides for cuts in the income 
authorities of federation subjects with a one-time expansion of 
their expenditures, that is, the principle of correspondence 
between expenditures and income in territories' budgets has been 
violated. Thus, if in 1993 territorial budgets received 62 
percent of total taxes paid, in 1994 they are getting only 43 
percent. Cuts in the income of territories' budgets actually 
mean cuts in financing for urgent social needs, which account 
for 80-90 percent of local budgets' expenditures. Moreover, 
local budgets, unlike the federal budget, cannot take advantage 
of monetary emissions to cover the deficit being created and 
will be forced to cut expenditures on the region's social 
infrastructure, from teachers' salaries to financing passenger 
transport and upkeep on heating plants. 
  Moreover, the 1994 budget assumes an expansion in the 
expenditures' portion of regional budgets due to the transfer of 
housing and social sphere sites from enterprises' balance-sheets 
to the territorial organs, as well as several other expenses. 
Thus, if before perestroyka the local budgets financed a third 
of the investment in the construction of housing and social 
sites and two thirds of the costs for them, then due to the 
mounting crisis, enterprises do not have this opportunity. 
Financing of the social sphere rests increasingly on local 
budgets. 
  This combination--cuts in income authorities and expansion 
of 
expenditures for federation subjects--can lead either to a 
willful halt in the allocation of taxes to the center on the 
part of local authorities, which has nothing in common with 
budgetary federalism, or else to an increase in the already 
excessive tax burden on economic subjects, which will lead to a 
cut in entrepreneurial activity, and this process in turn will 
cut territories' income even more. 
  As for the second principle of budgetary federalism--evening 
out levels of economic and social development among federation 
subjects--in the last two years Russia has encountered a sharp 
increase in regional differences. In 1988, the gap between the 
territories in per capita income amounted to a factor of 3.5; 
today this index has reached a factor of 16-17. A country that 
is determined to preserve its state unity cannot permit this 
kind of sharp regional differentiation. Otherwise, it will have 
to reject federalism and democracy both and move from political 
to police methods for regulating conflicts in the federation. 
  Budgetary policy is above all a means for neutralizing 
regional differences. The amount of funds redistributed among 
the regions depends on the degree of differences and on what 
leveling mechanism society chooses at a given moment. Analysis 
of the 1994 draft budget shows that the share of funds 
redistributed through the federal budget has decreased by a 
factor of 2: if in 1993 the financial support fund (that is, 
total funds for subventions, subsidies, and transfers) came to 
13 percent of federal budget expenditures, 17 percent if the 
variation in the standard for allocating value-added tax is 
taken into account, then in the current year this index was a 
mere 10 percent. This kind of policy is scarcely justified on 
the backdrop of a sharp increase in regional differences. 
  Actually, it should be noted that the 1994 budget does 
include substantial accomplishments toward budgetary federalism: 
in it for the first time an attempt is undertaken to create a 
single source and unitary rules for financing the regions in 
place of the faulty practice of regional lobbying and systemless 
agreements. However, the transfer (subsidy) scheme proposed in 
the budget requires substantial changes in the principles and 
criteria for rendering financial assistance. 
  First of all, the method for determining transfers takes 
into 
consideration only current expenses. This provides virtually 
nothing for subsidies for investments in the social and housing 
spheres, the state of which is what determines regional 
differences. 
  Secondly, according to the proposed draft, 66 of the 89 
regions are subsidized. This result is possible either in the 
event of an inaccurate scheme for calculating needy regions or 
else is connected with the political state of affairs: the 
federal center is establishing clearly elevated standards for 
taxes going into the federal budget, which in the future will 
allow it to guarantee the political loyalty of three fourths of 
the regions with the help of subsidies from the center. 
  Thirdly, the proposed scheme of transfers allows for a 
change 
in the "rules of the game" with individual regions. Thus, the 
financial support fund is divided into two funds: a support fund 
for "needy" regions and a support fund for "especially needy" 
regions. Only the apportionment for the "needy" regions is 
subject to a precise algorithm; there is no such algorithm for 
the other, which has had an immediate effect on the distribution 
of funds for this part of the fund, half of which is sent to 
Kemerovskaya Oblast. 
  At the same time, the list of "needy" regions is made up 
based on the economic indicators for 1993 and does not provide 
for expansion at the expense of regions encountering an 
increasingly strong drop in the standard of living and 
production in the current year. We are witnessing a repeat of 
the story of 1993, when on the backdrop of a very strong decline 
in production, several oblasts in Central Russia (Ivanovskaya, 
Vladimirovskaya, and others) paid maximum taxes to the federal 
budget, calculated on the basis of indicators for the preceding 
year. This intensified the decline in production and the fall in 
the standard of living and predetermined the voting in these 
regions for Liberal Democrats. 
  Finally, the source from which the financial support fund 
for 
the regions is formed is the value-added tax, that is, financial 
assistance to the regions is not a defended article of the 
budget: a shortfall in taxes will lead to a cut in the financial 
support fund for the regions, which means on expenditures for 
the social sphere as well. 
  Budget, especially the relationship between the federal 
budget and the territories' budgets, plays a key role in 
maintaining a state's social stability and political unity. It 
is worth remembering that the break-up of the Union began with a 
budgetary war.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Semenov: "God Gave--God Took Away?"] </F>
  [Text] It is universally recognized that the mafia is 
a coalescence of state and commercial structures. When a 
businessman is dissatisfied with a competitor, the state-legal 
machine is turned on: Click--there is no competitor. 
  The subject of a MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS article, "Taras 
Bulba 
Goes on the Warpath," concerned the examination by a group of 
State Duma deputies of the legality of closing the check 
investment fund Neft-Almaz-Invest by Goskomimushchestvo [State 
Committee for Management of State Property] (GKI). 
  New facts in the scandal have become known to the editorial 
staff. 
  The license issued earlier by Goskomimushchestvo to the 
check 
fund was suspended on 5 March. The formal pretext--the 
leadership of the fund did not submit the annual report on time. 
However, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation 
postponed the date for submission of the annual report to 1 
April. 
  The second discrepancy--the fund is accused of stealing 
vouchers. This served as yet another pretext for invalidating 
the license. I personally saw a half million vouchers in three 
armored safes. 
  According to Mosaudit data, the fund's assets are shares of 
stock of 71 very large Russian enterprises, including oil 
extracting and gold mining, and the expected profit is $22 
billion. Large blocks of stock of the pillars of national 
industry cannot help but whet the appetite of potential 
competitors. In addition to everything else, in the event the 
fund is closed, 572,700 vouchers will shift to the control of 
the GKI, but from there... 
  In the opinion of parliamentary experts and the fund's 
management, a model of forced bankruptcy, approved at Tekh 
Progress, is being employed with respect to Neft-Almaz-Invest. 
The fund is being accused of "insolvency" in correspondence 
through "its own" journalists in the mass media. A wave of 
popular anger is growing among ordinary shareholders. The GKI 
has been swamped with "letters from workers." The license is 
being suspended on this basis, and an audit is beginning. During 
the audit the competitors get a "handicap," and they correct 
their affairs. The auditors are putting all their energy into 
digging for compromising material. The fund is being closed. The 
assets are being transferred to the GKI. Further, they are 
divided among the large check investment funds. To whom and how 
much is decided by Goskomimushchestvo officials. Afterwards, the 
obligations (stocks, certificates) are exchanged for obligations 
of its former competitors. The deed is done. 
  As a rule, people do not suspect anything. What difference 
does it make whose paper one holds. The main thing is that the 
dividends come in. What they would have been in a ruined fund, 
and what they will become after the division of the pelt of the 
killed bear, only those initiated into the mysteries of the 
property court can guess. 
  Aleksandr Ignatenko, an employee of the UEP GUVD [Economic 
Audit Department of the Main Administration of Internal Affairs] 
and a member of the GKI commission to audit the fund, said: "We 
have already been working for several weeks. We cannot bring any 
charges at present. But I think we will find swindlers..." 
  G. Khodakov, manager of the commission and a senior employee 
of the GKI, said: "The parliamentary commission for examination 
of our activity has not been established officially. The 
deputies, of course, can audit us, but does this make any 
sense..." 
  An opponent of Khodakov--Nadezhda Razuvayeva from Mosaudit, 
said: "Based on the `presumption of innocence,' the management 
of the fund had every right to involve the deputies in 
monitoring the audit. All the deputies are professional experts. 
But whether they are Chubays' expert employees... The audit 
method raises doubts about this. All documentation representing 
a commercial secret was confiscated. The commission has its own 
Xerox machine. Papers are copied and sent who knows where. 
Strangers who have no relationship to the fund or the commission 
are continuously encountered in the building where the auditors 
are working. Indeed, the commission staff is always changing..." 
  The commission continued its work yesterday.

<F P=106> ["Survey Prepared From Data of the Russian State Committee </F>
on Statistics": "Production Output and Price Dynamics As of 12 
April"] 
  [Text] PRICES OF CONSUMER GOODS AND SERVICES. Over 
the 5-12 April 1994 period, consumer goods and services 
increased 2.7 percent, including 1.2 percent for food products, 
2.4 percent for nonfood products, and 18.4 percent for paid 
services to the populace. 
  Higher than the average observed across Russia was the 
increase in food product prices seen in cities of the Volga 
region and Northern Caucasus (2.2-2.3 percent). Virtually no 
change in food prices was seen in the Urals, Western Siberia, 
the Far East, and Kaliningrad Oblast. Nonfood products rose 9 
percent in cities of the Far East, 2.0-2.5 percent in other 
regions. The most significant increases in rates for paid 
services to the populace were registered in cities of the Urals, 
Western Siberia, and Kaliningrad Oblast. 
  The following table reflects price indexes for goods and 
services in the consumer market:

  Since the beginning of the month, the overall increase 
in prices amounted to 4.5 percent, including an increase of 2.3 
percent for food products, 3.5 percent for nonfood products, and 
31.9 percent for paid services to the populace. 
  FOODSTUFFS. Over the 5-12 April period, the growth of prices 
in nonorganized trade amounted to 2.5 percent, somewhat higher 
than in organized trade--0.9 percent.

  In organized trade, as was the case the previous 
month, vegetable prices increased at accelerated rates. Onions, 
garlic, and beets increased 11-13 percent in price and fresh 
cabbage and carrots rose 4-5 percent. Rates of price increase 
greater than those in the ending weeks of March were observed 
for flour (2.1 percent), cereals and macaroni products (2.7 
percent). Virtually no change was seen over the week in the 
prices of meat, butter, vegetable oil, sugar, eggs, and vodka. 
  Prices rose 5-10 percent since the beginning of the month 
for 
macaroni products and cereals, salt, fruits, and vegetables. The 
price increase was 3.6 percent for milk and dairy products, 1.5 
percent for meat and fish products. The average level of prices 
for sugar and eggs changed insignificantly. Vodka decreased by 
2.2 percent. 
  In nonorganized trade, as in organized trade, the 
greatest price increases were registered with respect to 
vegetable output: 17 percent for onions, 13 percent for fresh 
cabbage, 3-9 percent for garlic, beets, and carrots. The rate of 
growth of prices increased somewhat for meat products in April, 
comprising 2.0 percent for the past week. Prices of dairy 
products did not change; eggs decreased 2.1 percent. 
  Cost of the selection of 19 basic food products rose 
1.1 percent over the week, totalling R46,000 on a monthly basis 
as of 12 April. A 4.4-fold differentiation factor was 
registered between cities under observation. Maximum cost of the 
selection was recorded in Magadan (R125,400); minimum cost, in 
Ulyanovsk (R28,300). Moscow and St. Petersburg occupied 33d and 
36th place, respectively, out of 132 cities under observation 
with respect to cost of the selection (R50,000 and R49,700, 
calculated on a monthly basis). 
  NONFOOD PRODUCTS. As in March, the rate of price increase 
for 
nonfood products was somewhat higher than that for foodstuffs. 
The high rate of price increases for certain varieties of 
medicines--8 percent--was maintained. Prices of garments, 
knitted wear, and footwear rose two to three percent over the 
week. Cultural and household products increased 1.5 percent in 
price, tobacco products, 0.7 percent. 
  The most significant price increases since the beginning of 
the month were seen with respect to medicines (18 percent). 
  PAID SERVICES TO THE POPULACE. A significant increase in the 
rates of paid services to the populace was observed in April, 
continuing the trend seen since the beginning of the year. Over 
the week, the cost of travel on long-distance trains doubled in 
70 percent of the cities under observation. In 13 cities and in 
Moscow Oblast, the cost of intercity and local phone utilization 
increased by a factor of 1.3-2.0. Housing costs rose 12 percent 
on the average across Russia. A more than 200-fold increase was 
observed in Perm, Krasnoyarsk, Sovetsk, Yaroslavl, and Kostroma. 
  PRICES OF MATERIAL-TECHNICAL RESOURCES. The increase in 
acquisition costs of basic material-technical resources by 
industrial enterprises slowed down in March of this year, 
amounting to 10 percent of the February level (February 
compared with January--13 percent), including material-technical 
resources from suppliers in Russia--10 percent, resources 
acquired at the exchange--21 percent, resources acquired from 
countries of the far abroad--32 percent. Costs to producers also 
rose 10 percent over the past month. Since the beginning 
of the current year, costs to consumers have increased 47 
percent (costs to the producers of industrial 
production--51 percent). 
  The rise in the cost of building materials was more 
significant. Material acquisition costs to contractor 
organizations increased 13 percent over the month, 71 percent 
since the beginning of the year. The costs of building 
materials to producer enterprises increased 13 percent and 59 
percent, respectively. 
  The dynamics of acquisition costs this year for basic groups 
of resources is characterized as follows:

  The increase in prices of basic varieties of 
material-technical resources used by enterprises of the oil 
industry amounted to 29 percent in March as compared with 
February of this year; electric power, gas, and coal 
industry--12 percent; metallurgy enterprises--22 percent; 
chemical and petrochemical industry--13 percent; timber, 
woodworking, and pulp and paper industry--10 percent. The 
main reason for increased costs of resource acquisition was 
price hikes by the suppliers. 
  Costs of acquisition of certain varieties of materials and 
raw materials differed depending on the suppliers. Thus, the 
costs of acquisition of energy-producing coal, oil, and 
synthetic textile fibers acquired from suppliers in the CIS 
countries were 15-20 percent higher than on the domestic market, 
while coking coal was 1.5 times more expensive. Fuel oil and 
synthetic fibers were acquired more cheaply outside Russia. 
  The differentiation of prices for the same material resource 
acquired within Russia remains significant. Thus, the cost of 
iron ore purchased by metallurgy enterprises in March amounted 
to R38,000 per tonne in Volgograd Oblast and R57,000 in 
Bashkiria. Surveyed enterprises of the chemical and 
petrochemical industry in Novgorod and Moscow Oblasts acquired 
caustic soda at costs 1.6 times higher than did enterprises of 
Samara Oblast and Krasnoyarsk Kray. For enterprises of light 
industry, the acquisition of a tonne of single-thread cotton 
yarn in Yaroslavl Oblast cost R1.062 million, in Ivanovo 
Oblast--R1.747 million, in Vladimir Oblast--R1.815 million, and 
in Moscow Oblast--R3.297 million. 
  Increased expenditures for the transportation of acquired 
material-technical resources exerted a definite influence on 
price dynamics. In March of this year, the proportion of 
transportation expenses in the cost of resource acquisition by 
industrial enterprises comprised 9 percent, by construction 
organizations--14 percent. Expenses to transport sand 
constituted more than half of its acquisition cost; crushed 
stone--about 40 percent; cement, asbestos-cement sheeting, 
keramzit gravel, roofing material, and wood-particle 
board--about 15 percent. 
  COMMODITY STOCKS. As of 1 April of this year, current stocks 
of consumer commodities on hand in retail and wholesale trade 
and industry were valued at R11.1 trillion. More than 80 percent 
of commodity stocks (R9.0 trillion) were concentrated in retail 
trade enterprises. 
  Trade turnover capacity of stocks in retail trade 
enterprises 
remained at the level of last year, as shown in the following 
table:

  The volume of commodity stocks in retail trade as of the 
beginning of April amounted to 44 days of trade (as of the same 
time in 1993--41 days). In enterprises of the state form of 
ownership, trade turnover stocks were on hand for 53 days of 
trade, in private enterprises--35 days, consumer 
cooperatives--56 days, and in other nonstate forms of 
enterprises--44 days of trade. 
  MONETARY INCOME AND OUTLAYS OF THE POPULACE. Monetary income 
received by the populace in the first quarter of this year 
amounted to R53.8 trillion. Some R31.5 trillion of this figure 
was money taken into account as wages of workers at enterprises, 
institutions, and organizations; R8.5 trillion--pensions, 
allowances, stipends, and other social monetary transfers; R13.8 
trillion--income to the populace for entrepreneurial activity, 
participation in the profits of enterprises and organizations, 
transactions involving real property, and other financial and 
credit transactions. The share of wages within the monetary 
income structure decreased, as compared with the same period of 
1993, from 65 percent in the first quarter of 1993 to 59 percent 
in the first quarter of this year, while a corresponding 
increase was seen in the proportion of entrepreneurial income. 
The share of social transfers remained at approximately the same 
level--16 percent. 
  Face-value monetary income of the populace in January-March 
of this year increased over January-March 1993 levels by a 
factor of 8.8. Its growth outpaced the rise in consumer market 
prices over this quarter by a factor of 8.0. Thus, real 
disposable monetary income (income after the withholding of 
mandatory payments and with index adjustment) increased by 
approximately 10 percent. In this regard, that portion of the 
population with the highest incomes saw an increase 1.2 times 
greater than did the populace with lowest incomes. 
  As compared with the first quarter of 1992, real disposable 
monetary income of the populace increased by 25.5 percent. 
However, this growth did not replenish its decline seen during 
the first year of liberalization of prices. As compared with the 
first quarter of 1991, the level of this income was 40 percent 
lower. 
  The population having income lower than the subsistence 
minimum numbered 25.2 million in first quarter of this year, or 
17.0 percent, as opposed to 51.7 million (34.7 percent) in the 
first quarter of 1993. 
  The role of hard-currency purchases and acquisition of 
securities continued to grow within the structure of use of 
monetary income of the populace, while expenditures for 
consumption purposes and cash on hand decreased.

  In first quarter of this year, the population purchased hard 
currency amounting to R6.3 trillion, as opposed to R0.1 trillion 
in first quarter of 1993; purchases of securities totalled R54.6 
and R1.4 billion, respectively; stock--R47.5 and R0.9 billion, 
respectively. 
  DELINQUENT INDEBTEDNESS IN ISSUING FUNDS FOR WAGES AND OTHER 
PAYMENTS TO ENTERPRISE WORKERS. Delinquent indebtedness in the 
issue of funds for wages and other payments to the workers of 
industrial enterprises and organizations, construction and 
agricultural enterprises (not including funds transferred to the 
bank accounts of workers) increased by 20 percent in March. The 
following table reflects data on the numbers of enterprises 
having delinquent indebtedness with respect to wages and the 
volume of this indebtedness.

  Indebtedness of longer than one month in the issue of wage 
funds as of 1 April 1994 in the three sectors of the economy 
totalled R1.0847 trillion, or 46 percent of the total 
indebtedness volume, including R508.3 billion (38 percent) in 
industry, R195.7 billion (47 percent) in construction, and 
R380.7 billion (61 percent) in agriculture. 
  The greatest amounts of funds not paid within the prescribed 
time frames are attributable to enterprises and organizations of 
industry, construction, and agriculture in Tyumen Oblast (R232.8 
billion), Krasnoyarsk Kray (R131.5 billion), Kemerovo Oblast 
(R118.4 billion), Chelyabinsk Oblast (R87.7 billion), the 
Republic of Bashkiria (R67.6 billion), Rostov Oblast (R66.6 
billion), Perm Oblast (R64.0 billion), the Komi Republic (R63.2 
billion), Tatar Republic (R59.8 billion), Irkutsk Oblast (R57.9 
billion), and Altay Kray (R52.3 billion). 
  STATE OF PAYMENTS DISCIPLINE. The credit indebtedness of 
surveyed industrial and agricultural enterprises, construction 
and transportation organizations, amounted to R63 trillion as of 
1 March of this year. Of this amount, R25 trillion, or 39 
percent, constituted delinquent indebtedness (as of 1 February 
these figures were R54 trillion, R20 trillion, and 37 percent). 
The proportion of total delinquent credit indebtedness of these 
sectors that was owed to suppliers constituted 70 percent (R17 
trillion), owed to the budget--17 percent (R4 trillion). 
  The largest share of delinquent credit indebtedness was seen 
in the microbiology industry and ferrous metallurgy (46 
percent), in the timber, woodworking, and pulp and paper 
industry, chemical and petrochemical industry, and nonferrous 
metallurgy (47 percent), in the coal industry (48 percent), and 
gas industry (68 percent). 
  The following table shows the dynamics of delinquent credit 
indebtedness for February:

  A significant increase was seen in delinquent credit 
indebtedness in February 1994 at enterprises in the construction 
(36 percent), transportation (39 percent), ferrous metallurgy 
(36 percent), flour and cereal grinding, mixed fodders (38 
percent), peat (46 percent), coal (50 percent), electric power 
(52 percent), and gas industries (82 percent). 
  The share of enterprises having delinquent credit 
indebtedness as of 1 March 1994 amounted to 50.2 percent, as 
opposed to 46.6 percent as of 1 February 1994. 
  As of 1 March of this year, the total amount of debts 
receivable reached R60 trillion, of which R26 trillion, or 43 
percent, constituted delinquent debts (figures as of 1 
February--R50 trillion, R21 trillion, 43 percent). In this 
regard, R23 trillion, or 90 percent of the total amount of such 
delinquent debt, was attributable to delinquent indebtedness for 
unloaded output, work performed, and services rendered. 
  The largest portion of delinquent debts receivable was 
observed in the electric power industry, building materials 
industry, timber, woodworking, and pulp and paper industry (49 
percent), ferrous metallurgy and the coal industry (53 percent), 
nonferrous metallurgy and the peat industry (54 percent), and 
the gas industry (71 percent). 
  Nonpayments among enterprises are holding back revenue 
payments to the budget. Indebtedness to the budget on the part 
of enterprises and organizations of industry, construction, 
agriculture, and transportation amounted to R9 trillion, of 
which R4 trillion, or 46 percent, constituted delinquent 
indebtedness (these figures as of 1 February--R8 trillion, R3 
trillion, 43 percent). 
  A significant share of delinquent indebtedness to the budget 
was observed in the oil industry (56 percent), coal industry and 
ferrous metallurgy (61 percent), and in construction (52 
percent). 
  Due to shortages of their own funds, enterprises were forced 
to take out loans. The indebtedness from bank credits afforded 
enterprises and organizations of the sectors under examination 
amounted to R13 trillion, of which R2 trillion, or 12 percent, 
constituted delinquent indebtedness. 
  The significant volume of nonpayments has exerted an 
influence on the financial stability of enterprises and 
organizations, on their solvency. 
  The following table reflects the dynamics of the correlation 
between monetary assets and delinquent indebtedness to suppliers 
in industry and construction in 1993 and 1994 (solvency):

  During the first half of 1993, monetary assets exceeded 
delinquent indebtedness to suppliers. By the end of 1993 they 
covered half this amount, and by the end of first quarter 1994, 
to the level of just 39 percent. 
  At enterprises of the flour and cereal grinding industry, 
mixed fodders, coal, microbiology, gas, chemical, and 
petrochemical industries, monetary assets covered delinquent 
indebtedness only to the extent of 11-16 percent. 
  PRODUCTION OF GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT. Gross domestic product 
(GDP), characterizing the cost of production, work, and services 
intended for final consumption, accumulation, and export, 
amounted to R96.9 trillion over the three months of this year. 
As compared with the same period of last year, the physical 
volume of GDP decreased 17 percent. The more significant 
reductions in this regard were seen in the sphere of commodity 
output:

commodities and 
imports 


  A sharp reduction was seen in the first quarter of this year 
(as compared with the same period of 1993) in the volume of 
industrial production output (25-percent drop) and construction 
work (24 percent). This led to a corresponding drop in 
value-added in these sectors, as well as in the net taxes on 
commodities (excise taxes, value-added tax) taken into account 
in the GDP. At the same time, the performance of services 
decreased at a significantly slower rate. In certain sectors, 
the volume of services performed even continues to rise. 
  As a result, the share of services--primarily market 
services--in the GDP structure continued to increase, especially 
noticeably in those sectors engaged in intermediary and 
financial transactions. The percentage of value added in sectors 
performing services increased in the first quarter of 1994 to 
47.8 percent of the GDP (including 36.4 percent attributable to 
market services, 11.4 percent to nonmarket services), as opposed 
to 34.8 percent of the GDP for the same period of 1993, where 
25.1 percent were market and 9.7 percent nonmarket services. 
  The increased share of GDP volume attributable to services 
is 
also related to a somewhat greater increase in prices and rates 
in these sectors. Thus in the first quarter of this year, the 
GDP deflation index was a factor of 7.5, while prices and rates 
for market and nonmarket services increased by a factor of 9-10. 
  CONSTRUCTION OF RESIDENTIAL HOUSING FACILITIES. The volume 
of 
capital investments in nonproduction construction decreased 11 
percent in the first quarter of 1994 from the level of the same 
period last year. The reduction in commissioning of main 
facilities is shown as follows:

Walk-in clinics--visits     2,000                37             19 
per shift 


  Some 59 percent of the total volume of housing was 
commissioned by enterprises and organizations of state and mixed 
Russian ownership, 16 percent--of municipal ownership. More than 
one-fourth of the housing, or a million square meters, was 
constructed by private owners. This is 9 percent greater than 
the level for the same period of last year. Of this amount, 
668,000 square meters (27 percent more) was the effort of 
individual builders, their proportion of the total volume 
increasing from 13.3 percent in 1993 to 16.9 percent at the 
beginning of this year. 
  Military servicemen and their family members obtained more 
than 5,500 apartments during the period since the beginning of 
the year, totalling 300,000 square meters of living space. It is 
expected these individuals will be afforded 60,000-100,000 
apartments in 1994. 
  STRIKES. The beginning of 1994 was characterized by 
increased 
strike activity on the part of laborers. In the first quarter, 
strikes took place at 288 enterprises, exceeding the number of 
enterprises at which strikes were conducted over the entire 
previous year by 24. More than 80 percent of the strikes took 
place in March. 
  Enterprises cited delay in the payment of wages as the 
foremost reason behind the conduct of strikes in all sectors. 
The number of enterprises in industry failing to pay timely 
wages to their workers in March almost doubled as compared with 
the beginning of the year. Among the other reasons for 
conducting strikes enterprises cited failure to comply with 
wage-scale agreements, and budget indebtedness for the financing 
of scientific research and preventive repair work, provision of 
technical equipment, acquisition of medical and school 
equipment, etc. 
  The following table provides data on strikes conducted in 
sectors of the economy in January-March 1993 and 1994:

  As a result of strikes over the period which transpired, 
enterprises estimate that production output totalling R8.8 
billion overall was not produced. Of this amount, R8.2 billion 
was attributable to the fuel and energy complex. As a result of 
the deliberate cessation of operations, 88 enterprises of the 
country failed to receive production output deliveries according 
to contract in an amount totalling more than R3.5 billion. 
  The greatest losses from the strikes were suffered by 
enterprises of the fuel and energy complex in the Komi Republic 
(R2.4 billion), Kemerovo Oblast (R2.3 billion), Rostov Oblast 
(R2.1 billion), and Tula Oblast (R0.2 billion). Strikes by coal 
miners in Perm and Chelyabinsk Oblasts are continuing.

<F P=106> [Article by T. Garmize: "Reform Will Not Be the Shock </F>
Kind--Promises Deputy Social Protection Minister Pavel 
Kaminskiy"] 
  [Text] The squabble on the pages of the mass media is mild, 
but the complaints against one another are serious--this is the 
way the relationships that developed last week can be 
characterized, but the question concerns only this temporary 
segment, between the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation and 
the Ministry of Social Protection of the Population. The 
publication by some newspapers on 11 and 12 April of information 
about an increase in the scale of pensions of separate 
categories of pensioners starting 1 May, based on the data of 
Saturday's news conference at the Ministry of Social Protection 
of the Population, evoked an immediate "refutation" on the part 
of the [Pension] Fund. But already on Wednesday, 13 April, the 
ministry came out with a denunciation of the Fund's announcement 
and with government guarantees. 
  Interested readers have very likely already become familiar 
with the text of this announcement and the arguments of the 
ministry on the pages of MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA. Without a doubt 
they have also read the specifically addressed advances: To 
whom, when, and to what extent earnings from which the pensions 
are calculated will be recounted. But although it is infinitely 
important today and tomorrow, a pension does not exhaust either 
the depth of the problem of pension security as a whole, or, 
what is more, urgent reforms in this sphere in the more distant 
future. 
  Meanwhile, confusion, turmoil, and other unpleasant 
consequences of haste accompany even the most charitable cause 
in our country--social protection of the population. Subsidies, 
indexation, the right to benefits, and nullification or changes 
in such rights follow one after the other like ball lightning on 
a graph, and with the same speed. Social security people are 
unable to calculate, and pensioners and persons with privileges 
are unable to grasp the text; therefore, they do not tire of 
complaining. Thus, the taste of victory perhaps goes to Hershey 
Cola, and not to the state, which is really continuously 
indexing the scales of pensions and benefits from a meager 
budget (the reasons for its meagerness are a separate 
discussion). 
  It is pleasant to report to the readers that the drawback of 
haste, it seems, is understood in higher governmental echelons. 
And although, to use army vocabulary, it is still far from an 
ideal societal structure, no "all hands on deck" jobs and false 
alarms are expected in the near future in the cause of social 
protection. Evidence of this is at least the order of priority 
of the recalculations of earnings from which pensions are 
estimated. The oldest pensions are subject to recalculation 
first of all, at least for the purpose of correcting mistakes 
committed in determining the scale of coefficients in bringing 
"old" wages up to date. 
  Sociological forecasts even in our society, given the 
conscientious approach to their compilation, are beginning to 
gain respect and enjoy serious attention. In speaking about 
forecasts of this type in relation to the need to change pension 
legislation, recognition should be given to their futurological 
value especially. One of the main reasons for reform, for 
example, is the very complicated, to put it mildly, demographic 
situation in the country. No offense intended, it is simply a 
reality: Today there are 360 pensioners and about 400 other 
social dependents for each 1,000 workers. Until the years 
2000-2003, the increase in the proportion of pensioners will be 
insignificant. But by 2010 such a sharp worsening of the 
demographic situation is forecast that from 2015-2020 the 
establishment of a new age pension standard is practically 
inevitable. The ministry, of course, did not set, nor will it 
ever set, the task of a barbarous, rapid destruction of the 
system that has developed. But there is a program that was 
stringently calculated and reasoned out, and it has to be 
implemented. 
  It is not necessary to be a Solomon to estimate how the 
demographic burden will grow on the workers of the 21st century; 
moreover, a burden not on some kind of Martians, but on today's 
youngsters. "We hope society will understand us." Commendable 
foresight. After all, all these liberalizations cause the 
confusion that literally manna is being strewn from heaven...but 
on unprepared soil. Well, that is what the harvest is like, from 
the "pot revolt," to putsches, to the results of elections. 
  Social policy is a system of two communicating vessels. 
Under 
current conditions there can be no question of any kind of 
smooth transition of time. On the contrary, at least the 
demographic elderly burden table in some countries of the world 
in 1990, which was presented for review by journalists, 
guarantees a seething of passions. The column "Russia," with its 
colossal dubious leadership in this respect, is higher than the 
United States, the Netherlands, and Spain together with France. 
And this, you will note, is in the year 1990! But given the 
birthrate in 1992-1993... It appears we will not cede first 
place to anyone for a long time yet. 
  Of course, we have heard enough about the reasons for 
longevity and, as a consequence, the possibility of "prolonged 
success in the work" of our Western intellectual fellow-beings 
The ecology, the quality and accessibility of food products, 
relaxation, everyday amenities... To this, which, by the way, is 
his own personal reminder, Kaminskiy is ready "to throw up his 
hands..." But to assert such a significant state of affairs in 
the country and "to drop one's hands" when the state of affairs 
is corrected is incompatible. Thus, now is also exactly the time 
to reason out a smooth transition to a new age qualification, to 
the retention of justifiable benefits, including age benefits, 
when going on pension, and the proportion of pensions and wages 
of working pensioners. And what is more, without draconian 
measures, and in accordance with common sense and public opinion. 
  Incidentally, public opinion right now does not diverge from 
common sense with respect to the tendency of the minimum and 
maximum scales to come closer together. It is now 1:4, but 
sociologists fear a proportion of 1:2, which for the many who 
have worked years longer than required for the assignment of a 
pension, or who were stuck in harmful production, is really 
unacceptable. What is more, no one plans to cancel compensation 
payments, and, in addition, the current indexation keeps them at 
a scale of 19,000 rubles [R]. As for the proportion, the 
ministry is inclined to a ratio of 1:3. But for the present, 
according to a statement by P. Kaminskiy, the minimum wage, 
which has remained unchanged for a rather long time, does not 
allow him to "change" the scale of recalculations. Thus the 
minimum pension today of R34,000 (with compensations) is really 
going nose to nose with the maximum... 
  Seasonal troubles have also not been ignored--camp vouchers 
for orphaned children, invalids since childhood, and children 
from poor and large families. According to a decree of the 
government of 4 April, parents pay only 10 percent of their 
cost, and the rest is handled by social insurance, trade unions, 
and local funds for protection of the population. Vouchers for 
invalid children from incomplete families and orphans are even 
cheaper. 
  The attitude toward pension funds was expressed. There 
should 
be no objection, of course, to nonstate, supplementary forms of 
protection of the population. The ministry even held a seminar 
with the participation of representatives of almost 160 funds 
that underwent expert analysis in this ministry. At the same 
time, concern was caused by the promises of some funds of 
guarantees that were almost state guarantees, which does not 
correspond to reality! But, Kaminskiy repeated, these are 
nonstate funds, and there can be no question of state guarantees 
for fund obligations. 
  Public opinion causes, accompanies, and mutually also helps 
or preserves any reform. The pension fund, like no other, must 
be optimally reasonable in order that old people and newborns 
can nevertheless survive together with all of society under 
conditions of changes that for us are necessary and perhaps even 
historic.

<F P=106> [Article by Vsevolod Orlov: "Yuriy Shafranik Is Haunted by </F>
the Fuel and Energy Complex"] 
  [Text] We all know that Russia has a fuel and energy 
complex (TEK) and the entire economy--which means our entire 
life--is "locked" onto it. At the sound of the word "fuel," 
hearts begin to ache with dread in Russia and the near abroad, 
because this word has long become a synonym for inflation. The 
problems associated with the TEK look different, however, from 
the angle of car owners and housewives, well drillers and 
geologists-prospectors, exchange speculators and VPK 
[military-industrial complex] brass. Following this line, it 
would be interesting to find out what the leadership of the TEK 
itself sees as a priority. 
  The minister of fuel and power engineering met with 
journalists a few days ago and told them that on one hand he is 
grateful, if not to all, then almost all, those who write about 
the TEK; on the other hand, they mainly write about the wrong 
things or place the wrong emphasis. As a sort of methodological 
aid, Yuriy Shafranik described three main directions--the three 
component parts of the TEK's problems. 
  First. We treat TEK output barbarically. The fuel 
and energy complex is the most "social" of all the sectors. One 
can somehow survive for two to three days without bread, but not 
without various kinds of energy. Nevertheless, we expend energy 
right and left, and expend it stupidly. Not a single product in 
Russia is produced according to Western standards of 
energy-intensiveness: For instance, we expend 400 kw-hours to 
produce a tonne of ammonia, while in Europe this indicator does 
not exceed 80. Another 25 percent is regularly lost in 
transportation: For 400 hecacalories produced, about 100 are 
"dissipated" in pipes. Next, losses during production: In the 
world more than 12 percent is considered a disaster; here, less 
than 30 percent is an occasion for celebration. 
  A counterquestion. Is it not the TEK itself that 
accounts for two out of three aforementioned factors in energy 
losses: production and transportation? 
  Second. Rate disparity hurts the fuel and energy 
complex, while in turn influencing all of industry. During 
the "stagnation" years physical persons paid 4 kopeks per kw-hr, 
enterprises--2. Approximately the same rate structure is used in 
the entire world. Today the average rate is 24 rubles [R] per 
kw-hr, but individuals pay an average of R5. At the same time, 
regional rate differentials today measure a factor of eight, 
which should be no more than 2.5 (the regional lobby, naturally, 
resists rate leveling). This rate disparity hurts industry, 
which is simply unable to pay. Hence, the insolvency crisis and, 
as a chain reaction, the TEK's dismal situation. 
  Counterquestion No. 1. Everybody feels sorry for 
industry, of course, but does this mean that ordinary citizens 
have to pay for everything--is it not enough that they pay their 
taxes? 
  Counterquestion No. 2. Leveling rate differentials 
between regions apparently assumes raising them for those who 
pay too little, and lowering them for those who carry an 
excessive burden. Does across-the-board resistance indicate that 
in the process of "leveling," the regions with low rates are 
simply being "pulled up" to the level of more costly 
neighbors? 
  Third. The fuel and energy complex needs money, for 
which there are no sources. The TEK includes mainly very 
capital-intensive productions. Money is needed not only for 
long-term programs and new technologies. Unless 12 planned 
construction projects are completed in the near future, the 
energy supply for eight krays and oblast will deteriorate 
substantially. At the same time, money is needed not only for 
the TEK's development, but also for the long-awaited 
restructuring--liquidation--of money-losing enterprises (the 
corresponding programs already have been drafted with respect to 
the coal, oil, and gas sectors; in addition, five mines in the 
Kuzbass [Kuznetsk Basin] need to be closed urgently). However, 
so far investment is not an option. 
  The TEK has practically no internal investment reserves. 
Consumers currently owe the entire complex more than R20 
trillion. True, now the money will be recovered faster: The 
recent government decree permits TEK creditors to withdraw money 
from accounts of debtor enterprises on a nonacceptance basis 
(immediately, without additional coordination and regardless of 
whether the debtor acknowledges the debt). But even after money 
is collected, because of the difficult tax situation only a 
small part can be reinvested. Ninety percent of the TEK output's 
price is comprised of items outside of the complex--that is, the 
price largely consists of tax rates, excise taxes, and 
reappraisal of fixed assets (the latter boosted prices by 20 
percent). Out of the remaining 10 percent they have to pay 
salaries, cover costs, and only after that invest in new 
programs. 
  They see as a solution, on one hand, creating a sensible 
structure of rates (read: individuals should pay more than 
enterprises--V.O.), and on the other--large-scale conversion to 
joint-stock holding. First, joint-stock companies, once they are 
set up, will not allow speculators to feed off them. Second, the 
mechanism of operation of joint-stock companies will make it 
possible to shift to internal clearing prices due to working 
with customer-supplied material. Third, value-added tax can be 
removed from the company's internal clearing. All of this will 
enable the TEK to reduce prices for their products, which as a 
result will undermine inflation at its roots. 
  Counterquestion No. 1. Is it not the citizens--who, in 
the minister's opinion, pay too little for energy--who in the 
final analysis pay for all the taxes, excise taxes, and 
reappraisal of fixed assets? 
  Counterquestion No. 2. Will the money for the 
completion of the aforementioned 12 construction projects come 
from the budget? If so, then on which expense line item and how 
will the TEK compensate for this new hole in the budget? 
  Counterquestion No. 3. Does not one of the reasons the 
TEK does not have any internal reserves have its roots in the 
somewhat strange position of heads of TEK enterprises: Instead 
of seeking a compromise with strike committees they immediately 
transfer all monetary revenue into salaries and other 
pay-outs? 
  A few counter- (and very arguable) contentions. The author 
doubts that he will live long enough to see anyone anywhere in 
Russia reduce prices for anything at their own initiative. The 
author has no doubt that many journalists in their search for 
culprits in some or other problems have formed a sort of 
personal image of the enemy. For some it is the directors' 
corps; for others--the defense sector; and for others it is 
probably the TEK. This is not very good, since it is not the 
defense sector or the TEK that are at fault--as Mikhail 
Zhvanetskiy used to say, "the faults of the entire system have 
started coming out..." Nevertheless, the author is doubly 
certain that in addition to the group of problems enumerated by 
Yuriy Shafranik, many other questions are no less important and 
significant: quotas, licenses, and other bribe-exports; poor 
justification of enterprises' and sectors' claims to budget 
means and budget preferences; unclear regulations regarding 
foreign investment (one day "put the squeeze on them," and the 
next day, on the contrary, "let them in"), and so on, and so on. 
It would be good, of course, to see these topics disappear from 
newspaper pages--but only as a result of a fundamental 
improvement in the situation.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Yakovlev, chief designer of the OKB </F>
[Experimental Design Bureau] imeni A.S. Yakovlev: "The New 
Yak-77 Model"] 
  [Text] The economic reforms and privatization under way in 
the country and the appearance of numerous nonstate enterprises 
and organizations resulting from these processes require new 
approaches to air transport problems. Our traditional system of 
air transport does not fully meet the specific demand for air 
service that is emerging. The inflexible scheduling and 
insufficient frequency of flights and the fairly low level of 
service create considerable inconvenience. This has a particular 
effect on businessmen from other countries because it forces 
them to look for alternative routes for trips or to ship cargoes. 
  Lately we have observed the emergence of numerous airlines 
which do not make regular, but occasional (charter) flights. 
However, the opportunities to select the most suitable aircraft 
for such flights are extremely limited: there are no aircraft of 
the appropriate class in the country today. The Yak-40 is 
utilized most often in the business version at present. There is 
no question that the aircraft is reliable and quite comfortable 
in versions with a "cabin" configuration. But strictly speaking, 
the Yak-40 is an aircraft intended for an entirely different 
purpose. And the main features it lacks for business flights are 
speed and range. 
  Taking this into account, work has been under way at the OKB 
imeni A.S. Yakovlev to study the potential market for 
business-class aircraft. As a result of research, we have 
determined the appearance of a prospective aircraft which has 
been given the designation Yak-77. The basic characteristic of 
the new aircraft which determines practically all its remaining 
parameters is its range of nonstop flight. A somewhat unusual 
path was taken in selecting the latter. Study of the typical 
routes within Russia and abroad--to the CIS countries, Europe, 
and Asia--showed that an aircraft for this purpose should have a 
range of no less than 5,000 to 6,000 kilometers with six 
passengers on board. 
  We know that domestic industry is not producing engines 
suitable for the aircraft planned. Although work on such an 
engine with a thrust of 4,000 to 5,000 metric tons has already 
been begun at the "Soyuz" Design Bureau under the supervision of 
V.K. Kobchenko. However, new domestic engines will not be making 
their appearance soon. We had to turn our eyes to the West. They 
have units of the dimensions and thrust needed here. Only we 
must pay for them with dollars. Will we find many here who are 
willing and able to pay for them? How do we proceed? We settled 
on what in our view is the best possible alternative: develop 
and sell the aircraft with imported engines installed in it in 
other countries to start with. And utilize the foreign exchange 
acquired in this way to purchase additional foreign engines. And 
install them in the aircraft offered to Russian consumers at 
acceptable prices. 
  It is no secret that it is very hard to sell a 
business-class 
aircraft abroad. First of all, the market for this kind of 
aircraft is quite limited and it was divided up among producers 
a long time ago. Secondly, it must be confessed that the 
reputation of our aviation industry is far from good. First of 
all because of its inability to reliably supply spare parts and 
other technical service for the aircraft it turns out. For this 
reason, entering the market to sell something similar to 
aircraft which have already proved themselves, such as the 
"Gulfstream" or the "Falcon," is an undertaking with hardly any 
prospects. We needed to find something which potential 
competitors are not in a position to offer at present. In our 
case, we counted on development of a business aircraft with a 
range of 10,000 kilometers or more. From Moscow to Los Angeles, 
for example. There is nothing like it in the world yet. 
  Afterward everything was relatively simple: the payload of 
six passengers and the range were determined by the takeoff 
weight and the required thrust of the engines. Calculations 
showed that a flight of 10,000 kilometers at a cruising speed of 
800 kilometers per hour would take over 12 hours. Such a lengthy 
flight requires very careful study to provide comfortable 
conditions for the passengers and crew. 
  As apparent from the configuration diagram of the Yak-77, 
its 
passenger cabin is quite large. It has "a great deal of air." 
The height of the ceiling makes it possible for even the tallest 
passengers to stretch their legs and walk about the cabin. There 
is a compartment with a sofa for the crew (three pilots, 
incidentally) to rest. 
  The specific nature of a long-range business aircraft also 
determines the approaches to selection of the on-board equipment 
complex. The important factor here is the high degree of 
automation; navigation support when flying over extensive 
unpopulated areas (water or ice); advanced radio communications; 
and redundancy of the main systems of vital importance. It is 
planned to determine the composition and types of on-board 
systems more specifically with participation by the aircraft's 
buyers. The OKB is prepared to provide the aircraft with 
domestic as well as foreign equipment. 
  It is planned to complete work on development of the Yak-77 
and its testing and to obtain an airworthiness certificate no 
later than 1997. Our venerable competitors intend to have their 
new aircraft ready by this time. I am referring to the three 
most prestigious manufacturers of business-class aircraft: the 
Gulfstream firm (United States) with the "Gulfstream-U," 
Dassault (France) with the "Falcon-9000," and Bombardier 
(Canada) with the "Global Express." 
  It is very hard to compete with such "opponents." Our 
advantages may be only the shorter production periods and 
comparatively lower price. But in order to lower the price of 
the Yak-77, we must produce it in a large series in addition to 
everything else. 
  We have a unique opportunity in this respect. Because as 
already pointed out, the dimensions of the Yak-77 fuselage are 
unusually large for a business-class aircraft. It makes it 
possible to install 32 standard seats in the cabin when 
necessary. And then it will not be necessary to reeinforce the 
construction or change the engines, inasmuch as the takeoff 
weight will be unchanged. We know that a higher payload means a 
reduction of the amount of fuel in the aircraft. But even under 
these circumstances the Yak-77's range with 32 passengers will 
be more than 5,000 kilometers. In this version it becomes a 
regional passenger aircraft for scheduled airline routes, 
according to European standards. Consequently, there may be 
considerable demand for different configuration arrangements in 
the Yak-77. Especially as our OKB intends to offer customers two 
more versions of this aircraft--to seat 50 and 70. With a 
lengthened fuselage, of course, but with engines of a single 
type. 
  These are the studies conducted by the OKB A.S. Yakovlev and 
the Saratov Aircraft Plant on the Yak-77. It remains to be added 
that its price for foreign customers will be no more than $20 
million. This is significantly lower than the price suggested 
for competitive aircraft. It will be less expensive for Russian 
customers, and paid for in rubles as well. 
  Before the Yak-77 comes out, which as I noted will be no 
earlier than 1997, the OKB imeni A.S. Yakovlev is offering an 
extensive "set" of modifications for the Yak-40 aircraft. Owners 
of the "forties" will be able to significantly extend their 
capabilities, including in business-class versions. By 
increasing the fuel up to 6 metric tons, the Yak-40's range will 
be increased to 2,000 kilometers. The Smolensk Aircraft Plant is 
prepared to modify the wings for the increased fuel tank 
capacity. 
  Another very promising modification, in our view, is 
provided 
by replacement of the Yak-40's power plant. The OKB plans to 
install two LF-507 engines made by the American Textron-Lycoming 
firm to replace the three AI-25 engines. The aerodynamics of the 
aircraft are improved and relative fuel consumption is reduced 
at the same time. It is sufficient to say that the cruising 
speed of the Yak-40TL [the designation with Textron-Lycoming 
engines] will be increased by 10 percent and the range with the 
same fuel will be increased by 25 percent. Operating expenses to 
maintain the twin-engine version of the Yak-40 are 15 to 20 
percent lower than the original version. But if a wing with fuel 
tanks for 6 metric tons is installed on the aircraft, the 
Yak-40TL will have a nonstop range of 2,500 kilometers with a 
payload of 1 metric ton. 
  The on-board equipment may be replaced altogether or 
individually by more advanced equipment--in any variation at the 
request of the buyer; the passenger cabin arrangement may be 
changed in accordance with individual requirements; and imported 
materials are used in its finishing. In addition, the OKB is 
prepared to extend the service life of the Yak-40 based on an 
individual approach in each specific case.

<F P=106> [Roundtable discussion by various officials involved in </F>
railroad electrification led by V. I. Kulik, deputy chief 
engineer of the Transbaykal Railroad, and reported by V. 
Pakulin, GUDOK correspondent in Chita; date not given: "...Plus 
Electrification"] 
  [Text] Either such is the time or we have forgotten 
how to be obliging. It's worth recalling how the program for 
completing the electrification of the Transbaykal mainline, 
planned for 1993, has turned out to be a complete fiasco. But 
the fact is that the decision was taken in the railroad, and in 
the Ministry of Railways, and in the government. And all the 
participants in the construction were focused on it, of course. 
It has fallen through. 
  To look into the reasons for the failure, to make the 
necesary conclusions, and to determine the tactics of 
actions--such was the goal of a meeting of leaders of the 
organizations, enterprises, and subdivisions engaged in the 
electrification. Its materials, as well as conversations with 
the participants in the construction staff, have served as the 
basis of an external (zaochnyy) "roundtable" on the pages of 
GUDOK. Valeriy Ivanovich Kulik, deputy chief engineer of the 
Transbaykal Railroad, leads the session. 
  V. KULIK. The desertion of the workers of the 
Nizhneangarsktreansstroy trust, who already at the beginning of 
last year abandoned the most important facilities at the Sbega 
station, must be considered one of the chief reasons for the 
failure. They left the poligon so hurriedly that we have lost a 
great deal of time in searching for a new contractor. Thanks be 
to Tsentrobamstroy, which has acquired these facilities. 
  On the other hand, the unsatisfactory work of certain 
subdivisions which remained on the construction project has had 
an effect. We placed great hopes on Bamstroyput. However, this 
once solid and reliable organization has not justified them: 
neither the plan for the contact system or for general 
construction operations has been fulfilled. 
  Construction administration No. 87 of Bamstransvzryvprom 
also 
has let us down very substantially. The pile-supported areas in 
Uryum and Ksenyevskaya have not been handed over because of 
what--a collapse at the boiler house and the contact system duty 
post building. We need to exchange opinions and determine our 
attitude to the plans for the current year. 
  First of all about finances. In the past year the 
construction project has run a fever not only from the fact that 
people have worked poorly but because of our inability to work 
under the new economic conditions. The situation has changed 
drastically. We--both the customers and the contractors--have 
proven to not be ready for this. One has had to reorganize 
oneself literally on the go. Financing has been a muddle. 
Although we also have settled up with the contractors 
satisfactorily. It has had an effect primarily on deliveries of 
building materials, structures, and equipment. 
  We all have had to learn to manage construction by purely 
financial methods. Something was received, something wasn't. In 
addition, even the banks made their own contribution--it would 
happen that their operations dragged on for months. We were 
forced to send money from the road to the supplier plants, 
detaching funds from needed operating costs. Thanks be to the 
mainline's leadership, which took several unpopular steps, 
realizing the difficult situation with electrification. Thanks 
also to the contractors, who have acted in the situation which 
has developed so that the work would not come to an end. The 
money was used basically for the solution of targetted tasks. 
  I will not undertake to forecast how the situation will 
develop this year. Nevertheless electrification has been 
financed in the first quarter; the money needs to be used. Of 
course, we will carry out mutual set-offs with the suppliers. We 
will obtain a portion of the building materials from other roads 
to cover their debts to the Transbaykal Railroad. However, the 
principal hope is that the ministry will not leave the 
construction project without funds. 
  V. KOVALENKO, General Director of the Tsentrobamstroy 
Joint-Stock Company. As far as our builders are concerned, 
we have no complaints against the customer. The road has helped 
us satisfactorily with fuel, materials and even with some 
advanced payment. 
  Ye. KISIMES, Technical Supervisor of the Klyuchi 
Joint-Stock Company. On the other hand we haven't managed 
to do much. We supplied all the facilities with builders in 
March of last year. However, the pre-payment for reinforced 
concrete, metal, and cement was moved to April instead of 
February-March and the brigades lay idle for practically two 
months. True, even some deliveries paid for were not made. Let's 
say that the Shimanovsk Building Structures Plant has disrupted 
our work at Ksenyevskaya station. It'll soon be a year since the 
money was transferred, but we are not able to furnish the 
foundation of the dwelling house with floor slabs. Now they 
state at the plant: "A cubic meter of reinforced concrete costs 
us 254,000 rubles"... Apparently one will have to solve anew the 
problem of supplying facilities with materials and structures. I 
consider this a top-priority task. 
  N. KOSHMAN, Lieutenant General, Deputy Chief of Railway 
Troops. Last year, at the request of First Deputy Minister 
of Railways O. Moshenko, the command adopted a decision to add 
two more sections (peregon) to the volumes of work previously 
agreed upon: Temnaya--Kendagiry and Kendagiriy--Ksenyevskaya. 
Even given the fact that we were not prepared for this and would 
not have been able to cope. Financing and shortfalls in 
deliveries of metal from Omsk put us in a difficult position. I 
think that this year one should determine precisely what 
directions are to be considered top-priority and to proceed 
along them, not scattering forces and funds. Each contractor 
ought to be aware of "his own shunting" and operate in 
accordance with the technological schedule. It is clear that an 
"electric locomotive" will not operate without a contact wire. 
That is why, when distributing funds, one needs to pay special 
attention to the soldiers engaged in installing the supports. 
One must consider that we will have to work practically only on 
rock faces, and this means additional expenditures of funds and 
time. 
  G. MADFIS, Chief of the Production-Technical Department 
of SU(Construction Administration)-87. The Transbaykal has 
fully settled up with us based on the year's results. On the 
whole our agreement is payment based on the operations actually 
performed. But now we are asking it to give us a 50-percent 
advance. This is approximately R100 million. The fact is that 
indebtedness to suppliers and payments that can't be put off 
amount to a half billion for the trust. People aren't receiving 
wages and it is difficult to send them to the poligon. One will 
have to borrow cash from the merchants. 
  V. KOZLOV, Chief Engineer of the Bamstroyput 
Joint-Stock Company. And it's difficult for us to dispatch 
people. If we had the money, we could have compelled them to 
work. 
  V. KULIK. I can understand Bamtransvzryvprom. 
However, more than R60 million were transferred to Bamstroyput 
at the beginning of last year. They didn't get to the 
construction project. Bamstroyput has spent them for its own 
needs: just what didn't they buy, right up to electric light 
bulbs... But your inertia in electrification costs the road 
billions in losses. Think about how to get people to the track. 
  V. DUDKIN, Chief of SMP(Construction-Installation 
Train)-868. Our signalmen were prepared to perform the 
entire volume of work last year. A little was left but the 
hold-up with the advance payment forced us to come to a stop at 
the end of November. However, I want to speak about something 
else. The losses at the facilities that people leave are great. 
In Arteushka there's a facility "with a beard." It's four years 
since we left there, having performed 95 percent of the work. 
Today everything is a mess there. A new estimate to restore 
everything must be compiled. Seven kilometers of cable were 
abandoned at the Ksenyevskaya station in '91. We'll return soon 
they thought. They signed a contract and paid for storage. But 
now you can't find any traces, as well as the large quantity of 
cable. And, you see, it's also a considerable amount of money. 
  A. SALOSHIN, Deputy Chief of Glavbamstroy, Operations 
Coordinator. Slightly more than R7 billion were allocated 
for 1994 for the completion of electricification through state 
capital investments. But not less than 20 is needed. One needs 
to expend the funds very judiciously, having eliminated all 
unproductive expenditures. 
  N. YAKOVLEV, Chief Engineer of the Mogochin 
Division. Indeed, the problem of financing is very acute 
and the agitation of the builders is understandable. But it 
turns out that we divide billions but forget about debts. The 
electrification participants owe the Mogochin Division more than 
R170 million for housing, electric power, and food, for electric 
locomotives and motor vehicle transport, for coal and for car 
demurrage... And one can't brush aside the debts on the 
pretext--"We're working for you." It's not the time. 
  Now the division no longer will be able to supply the 
subdivisions on the principle--who will ask for how much. I ask 
everyone to calculate their minimum requirement for fuel and 
lubricants and electric power and to conclude contracts for 
locomotives and cars. 
  V. KULIK. I think that the observation is correct. 
Financial discipline should be the same for all. We will help of 
course--one cannot keep an eye on all the enterprises. And no 
matter the uncertainty with financing, this year we must do all 
to complete the work properly. This depends on everyone. You 
understand. The pile drivers have been delayed and the circuit 
has been stretched. The builders come to a standstill and 
because of them the installers and the trouble-shooters are 
idle... The whole business suffers. 
  Ye. KISIMES. Here every contractor needs to turn 
over his facilities not only on time and according to the 
approved schedule, but also not to do slipshod work. What have 
we run into at the Sbega station? The underground portion of the 
water intake needs to be built but it turns out there are still 
no wells. They have flung people to the second lift pumping 
station, but there the piles have not been obtained. At the 
purification installations also the few piles are not enough. So 
no one has returned to finish his work. 
  There are important facilities in Mogocha. In the spring we 
dug out the foundation area under the locomotive brigades' rest 
home practically by hand--we furnished the frame, we furnished 
the joinery products. We have been in contact with the sanitary 
engineers and the electricians--and we have started. The 
customer also needs to act more promptly. 
  V. ZYRYANOV, Chief Engineer of Power Train No. 
705. I'm afraid that the installers may find themselves "in 
extremis" also this year. A tremendous amount of work awaits us: 
2,600 control panels need to be installed and almost 212 
kilometers of carrier cable and 240 kilometers of contact wire 
reeled out. Two traction substations, three sectioning posts, 
and much else are to be installed. 
  We have analyzed the situation and come to the conclusion 
that we will manage if the general construction work schedule 
will be precisely maintained. We are fully ready to begin 
installation at the substation in Uryum and we ask that it be 
handed over in the second quarter. In the second half of the 
year we will proceed to the substation in Sbega and we will have 
time now to do both. But if we fail with the first the second 
will be under question. One hasn't a choice in the installation 
of the contact wire of a facility: we work where we can. We have 
good contact with the military builders. We follow literally on 
their heels. However, one needs to accelerate the installation 
of supports and construction. With an adequate work front behind 
us there will be no delay. 
  A. KHEKILAYEV, Deputy Manager of the 
Bamtranstekhmontazh Trust. Today all are agreed that work 
needs to done on electrification. And, with all the 
complexities, we will work. Well, we will overcome the 
complexities by joint efforts. I think that we need to pass from 
mutual reproaches and complaints to mutual understanding and to 
find optimum solutions together. 
  We have been successfully collaborating with Tsentrobamstroy 
for a long time. I have no doubt that the facilities in Uryum 
and Sbega will be handed over on time. As yet there is no such 
contact with the Klyuchi company. We ourselves have also been 
guilty in certain conflict situations. We have often confined 
ourselves to shouts over the phone instead of working shoulder 
to shoulder and seeking compromise. And making concessions in 
something. 
  I would like to continue normal interrelations with the 
Bamstroyput Joint-Stock Company but the fact is that this 
organization offers us nothing. This causes doubt as to whether 
the builders will fulfill their obligations. However, we will 
try to find a common language even with them. 
  The main thing is that relations between the construction 
participants need to be legitimized. And work schedules and 
deliveries of material and equipment coordinated. I would like 
to come to an agreement with the customer that equipment be 
delivered directly to the sites. 
  G. GORYUNOV, Chief Engineer of SMP-764. Indeed, 
the participants in the electrification should coordinate 
operations and consider the interests of colleagues, who also 
need to live. I realize that it is more profitable for the 
builders to do more rapidly what is easier and what "lies 
closer." But give us installers a work front. Let's say that at 
the Nanagry station only one support in all has not been 
delivered. But they have brought us to a standstill. If it's all 
the same to you where to put the support up, deliver it to the 
station so that we could finish some portion of our own work. 
And a request to the soldiers that at the section you also 
randomly put up the supports where it's more convenient and 
where the foundation area is ready, but after that you return to 
what has been left out. We readjust ourselves to you and now and 
then are forced even to outdistance you. So, in returning, don't 
sever our lines, preserve our labor. 
  N. TUMASOV, Deputy Chief of the Electical Supply 
Service. It makes me happy that all the meeting 
participants firmly state: we will hand over the contact system. 
Indeed, there are all the possibilities for this now. However, 
one cannot, in speeding up construction, depart from the 
accepted standards. Delivery for installation of a contact wire 
suspension must be provided with a complete set of construction 
and installation elements. The omission of supports about which 
Gennadiy Andreyevich speaks can lead precisely to violations of 
this requirement. One needs to hand over the system with 
complete anchor sections. 
  A. SALOSHIN. This year the subdivisions will have 
to work according to the schedules which have been agreed upon. 
I think that there ought to be regular staff meetings--to 
identify deviations and to name the guilty. The absence of 
individual responsibility engenders irresponsibility. 
  V. KULIK. In winding up the conversation, I wish 
to note that the character of today's meeting differs from all 
the previous ones by the calm and business-like discussion of 
problems, and by unanimity and a common interest in finishing 
the construction as quickly as possible. 
  Since the past year has shown that the majority of the 
subdivisions are able to solve on a high level the tasks that 
have been set, there is complete confidence in success. Now, as 
has been correctly noted here, everything depends on we 
ourselves--how we adjust the collectives, how we supply them 
with everything necessary, from structures to bread, how we 
regulate interaction. I won't say that the final lap of 
electrification will be easy. However, we have chosen the road 
of agreement. It is not difficult to adopt a decision; it is 
much more difficult to carry out what has been planned.

<F P=106> [Interview with A. Zaytsev, chief of the October Railroad, </F>
by Ye. Chubasheva in St. Petersburg; date not given: "Under the 
`Roof' of the Road"] 
  [Text] Exactly three years ago the only just then 
created registration department of the committee for foreign 
relations of the Saint Petersburg municipal council registered 
the first joint venture. Now there are more than 7,000 of them 
in the city. 
  Some of them have become strong firms, others--are born 
and die like ephemeral butterflies, not having stood up to 
competition. Two out of 10 joint ventures have officially 
announced their own liquidation. 
  The October Railroad is one of the region's leaders 
with respect to the number of joint-stock company and joint 
venture institutions. A. Zaytsev, chief of the October Railroad, 
tells about this sphere of activity. 
  [Chubasheva] About 50 joint ventures and joint-stock 
companies are under the railroad's "roof." What will they give 
the mainline? 
  [Zaytsev] They will make it possible to survive. The 
railroads remain state enterprises in the Ministry of Railways 
system. However, they are forced to operate within the framework 
of market relationships. Previously the government always set 
the prices for the services of the roads but it also ensured 
their vital activity and supplied the cars and locomotives, 
cross ties and fuel... Now the Ministry of Railways has been 
left not only without funds but also without plants. We get 
nothing in a centralized fashion. The Riga Electric Car Building 
Plant, the Poltava Diesel Locomotive Repair Plant, and others 
have found themselves beyond the border. 
  The Russian High-Speed Mainlines Joint-Stock Company is 
building the high-speed Moscow--Saint Petersburg road. The 
Gelleflint Joint-Stock Company is engaged in work on the 
Vacha--Kochkoma border section, which will connect Karelia with 
Finland by the shortest route. Passenger cars are being made in 
the Tverskoy zavod Joint-Stock Company. The Torzhok Car Building 
Plant Joint-Stock Company has already created the first Russian 
Bylina electric trains... 
  The road participated in the financing and reconstruction of 
these and other enterprises and they are already producing. 
There are a number of commercial structures in which we have 
invested money with the sole purpose of getting income. 
Transport operations, especially passenger, do not yield a 
profit but on the other hand the road has millions of rubles in 
profit from ancillary activity, including from participation in 
various commercial structures. 
  And yet the main goal of this not typical for us activity is 
not the money but the necessity to preserve the highest volume 
and cheapest for the population form of transportation. This 
cheapness, although relative, is long since no longer a 
contribution of the government. Subsidies have been abolished 
and you won't get compensation payments to cover losses. Today 
life has compelled state enterprises to adapt to market 
relationships, and to enter into them through the commercial 
structures which have been created under their "roof." 
  Far from all the enterprises into which we have entered and 
which we have created ourselves are flourishing. One has had to 
take one's share out of 10 joint ventures and the work of 
several more doesn't justify our hopes. We have recently left 
the structure of the Russian-Italian Furniture Production 
Enterprise, which had promised to become highly profitable and 
to supply railroad children's institutions with its products. 
Here our compatriots have accused their foreign partners of 
dishonesty. 
  There are also positive examples. There is the work of the 
Raskom joint venture. The railroad workers, jointly with the 
specialists of several US firms, have created a new 
communications line, having run it along the supports of the 
contact system on the existing Moscow--Petersburg mainline. It 
will play a large role in the conducting of the Goodwill Games, 
improve the quality of communications in the region, and yield 
millions of rubles in profit. 
  [Chubasheva] The unsinkable "flagships" of our industry such 
as Kirovskiy zavod are suffering failure. Why are you, and not 
the general director of Kirovets, making an attempt to save its 
branch in Tikhvin, Transmash, from bankruptcy through attracting 
Austrian technologies there? 
  [Zaytsev] This is an attempt not to save Transmash but to 
protect the October road from collapse. Equipment is needed to 
maintain the quality of the tracks. It's time to produce it 
ourselves and not to purchase it for foreign currency. There are 
no plants in the CIS which produce heavy-duty track machines. 
However, there is the potential of the unutilized productive 
capacities in Tikhvin. There is the technology of the best in 
the world producer of such equipment--the Austrian firm Plasser 
and Toyrer [as transliterated]. We have acquired several samples 
from it and in the course of periodic talks we have proposed a 
variant of the collaboration with Transmash to the guests and 
have acquainted them with its possibilities on the spot. This 
plant, which previously worked for "defense," has, with the help 
of the road's investments, already reorganized a number of its 
shops to turn out component parts for the production of electric 
trains. We would like to utilize the potential of this 
enterprise also in future. 
  The industry of the region is so varied and developed that 
it 
is capable of turning out all the necessary technical facilities 
for Russian railroads. We look with hope at the Kirovskiy zavod, 
which could build general-purpose diesel locomotives. The Czechs 
made them previously. Now we have been left without passenger 
locomotives. This is not a railroad but a national problem. The 
government should intervene now: remove taxes and grant 
preferential credits to those enterprises which are being 
reconstructed for the needs of transportation--things should get 
going. 
  [Chubasheva] Payment for hauls with commodities is being 
used 
ever more widely recently. What do you think of this? 
  [Zaytsev] Payments "in kind" have entered firmly into 
practice, incidentally, in the interests of the very enterprises 
who are not able to pay for transport operations in money. 
  It's advantageous to us to receive crushed stone. It's 
needed 
for repairing the track bed. The Cherepovets Combine has paid 
with metal--it comes in handy for manufacturing electric train 
bodies. 
  The Apatit Production Association has owed us 6.5 billion 
rubles for transport operations. They propose settling with 
products. One would think, why fertilizers for a railroad? But 
we'll take it. Otherwise you won't get anything from them. And 
we will sell the apatites to the Novgorod Azot Association and 
the Voskresensk Mineral Fertilizers Production Plant. 
  Willy-nilly the railroad has become an unique "sales 
service" 
for many enterprises. The ties of the railroad people are 
extensive and one can find buyers. But who should be engaged in 
this? We don't have any specialists in sales. So we are looking 
for people and creating structures which would run all these 
commercial operations and would find materials the railroad 
needs in exchange for those that the non-payers offer us. 
  Today one can supply all the construction projects which are 
underway on the mainline with the materials and equipment being 
delivered by debtors. One can even obtain rails and cross ties 
not by direct contracts but by having formed a network of 
enterprises which have owed one another. For example, contact 
wire is already being manufactured at the road's order this 
way--our debtors supply the copper to the producer. 
  "Spin around as you are able. Only don't ask for 
anything,"--such has become the position of the Minstry 
recently. Quite recently they stigmatized the leaders of the 
October Railroad for the fact that we take "in kind" for a haul. 
Now they have authorized one even to register the debts 
officially as securities--bills of exchange (veksel). All the 
railroads are obliged to collect a debt from clients in their 
products. 
  Eurosib (Evrosib), one of the joint-stock companies 
organized 
on the railroad, is engaged, by the way, in selling metal. And 
rather successfully. The last operation yielded a R1.5 billion 
profit. Eurosib has contracts with foreign and domestic 
clientele engaged in the dispatching of freight. This is a 
purely market structure. It gets the money at once and is not 
bound by any moral obligations like the railroad, which is 
obligated to all to provide transportation, even if it is not 
paid for it. 
  [Chubasheva] But a road can "strangle" a debtor by not 
providing cars to the enterprise? 
  [Zaytsev] Yes, we have received a directive from the 
Ministry: conclude a contract with clients and don't provide 
cars for loading if the terms are not fulfilled, in particular, 
with respect to payment. However, for our actions to be lawful, 
it is necessary, at a minimum, to change the Charter of the 
railroads in which it is written that at the request of the 
enterprises one is to provide them with rolling stock for hauls. 
  The port workers, for example, are able to not take from us 
the cars they have ordered and to dictate whatever they like. 
The power engineering people threaten to cut off the 
electricity. They all are now bosses. The road has received the 
usual refusal of its being made a joint-stock company and cannot 
conduct a dialog with them "as an equal." The debts of the 
enterprises of the October Railroad have grown already to R100 
billion. 
  [Chubasheva] And in such a situation you are starting new 
construction projects and creating new structures? 
  [Zaytsev] We are electrifying multi-kilometer sections of 
the 
mainline, for example, Volkhovstroy--Svir, and we are erecting 
housing. 
  [Chubasheva] And the railroad workers ride in Japanese 
automobiles. They already know in the city: a Mazda has passed 
by--this means, almost for sure, a railroad worker has driven 
by. Are you cooperating with this firm? 
  [Zaytsev] The time when all will ride in automobiles remains 
a dream for the present. But we have gambled on one firm from 
economic considerations. The very same Eurosib is the official 
Mazda dealer in Saint Petersburg. They are selling the 
automobiles successfully and have opened a technical service 
station. There are about a thousand Mazdas now in the city and 
no more do their owners have problems with repair. By using one 
brand of machines, the enterprise has completely reorganized the 
service park for them. Yes, today we have spent money. But 
tomorrow it will be recouped. 
  I believe in common sense. In the fact that the recession is 
not eternal. I believe in the upsurge of the country's economy. 
It will come and will require an increase in the volume of 
transport operations from the railroads. We must be ready for 
this so as not to become a break on the development of 
production. That is why we are doing so much today for the 
future.

<F P=106> [Article by B. Chibisov: "One Good Turn Deserves Another: </F>
From a Selector Conference in the MPS"] 
  [Text] The railroad workers have always distinguished 
themselves by stability in both work and payment of wages. On 
some railroads, however, problems have recently arisen. They are 
permitting delays in their payment. In February, in particular. 
At the sector's plants --even in the first two months of the 
year. 
  After all, as O. Moshchenko, RF first deputy minister of 
Railways, emphasized yesterday at the selector conference 
devoted to this problem, this is social protection of the 
railroad workers, the creation of a normal psychological climate 
in the collectives, material ensurance for transport workers, 
fulfillment of the Tariff Agreement, etc. 
  At the preceding selector conference (at the beginning of 
April), G. Fadeyev, minister of Railways discussed this problem 
in detail. The reasons for the delays were analyzed: there was 
an increase, at the end of last year, in the growth rate of 
wages above the level specified by the Tariff Agreement -- over 
400 billion rubles [R] was paid out for this alone; the roads 
failed to carry out shipment of the advance financing limits of 
the transit mainlines; the proceeds for the shipping roads were 
not fully recovered as monetary sums. Underlying all this is the 
large debt for transport. At that time, specific deadlines were 
slated for settling with the collectives. For example, the wages 
for February were to be issued by 25 April, and issued for the 
normal payment periods in June. 
  What is the situation today? While by the beginning of 
April, 
the debt for February was 50 percent of the wage volume, today 
the indicator equals 14 percent. This is on the whole for the 
Russian network. The picture is different, however, for each 
road. Most of the mainlines have fully cleared off the debts for 
wages, but there is BAM [Baykal-Amur Main Line] which still has 
to pay out 30 percent of them, the Transbaykal -- 16, the Far 
Eastern -- 47, the West Siberian -- 25, and the Sakhalin -- up 
to 97 percent. 
  The situation among the workers in the social sphere looks 
somewhat better than among those in the production sphere, 
although even here not everything is running smoothly. For 
example, the workers of the sectorial medical institutions are 
being paid wages only for March, and those employed in the 
education system -- for February. 
  The state of affairs for the transport plants is 
particularly 
alarming. There are enterprises which have not yet even issued 
their January wages. It will take R23 billion to clear off the 
two-months debt. Even though the MPS [Ministry of Railways] 
administration had a preliminary agreement with the roads that 
they would settle with the plants, practically no steps have 
been taken to liquidate the debt. It is a question, not of full 
payment for the goods produced by the enterprises for railroad 
orders, but of wage payments. The sums here are by no means 
astronomical. For example, the Volga Railroad owes R400 million, 
the North Caucasus -- only R30 million, and the October -- R140 
million. Small amounts. The roads are holding back the 
transfers, though, and the plants cannot pay the wages. 
  The main reason for this, of course, is the customers' debt. 
The measures which the roads take to clear it off -- not letting 
the customers have rolling stock, appeal to higher courts, jobs 
according to contracts -- are so far not working in full 
measure. The indebtedness continues to grow. In the two ten-day 
periods of April, it increased by 16.2 percent, or by R116.3 
billion. It is the mainlines where delay in wage payment is 
observed that account for a considerable part of it. 
  What are the sources of getting funds for wages? As was 
emphasized at the conference, various ways must be used to exact 
money for transport. There are already positive examples in the 
work of the mainlines. Let us say, the Kuybyshev Railroad 
concluded a contract with BAM and the Transbaykal to receive 
payments through supplies of motor vehicles. The Transbaykal and 
BAM workers sell them, and the money earned is transferred to 
wages. There are examples of settling with petroleum products 
and timber materials, with their subsequent sale. At some 
enterprises of the Southeastern, wages are paid in products and 
other commodities. 
  In a word, every possibility must be utilized to get funds, 
so that by June we can make the break-through to paying wages in 
the normal periods of time.

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian Minister of Railways Gennadiy </F>
Fadeyev by Aleksandr Rybakov; date, place not given: "Ministry 
of Railways Outlines New Railroad Schedule. Interview with 
Russian Minister of Railways Gennadiy Fadeyev"] 
  [Text] 
  [Rybakov] Gennadiy Matveyevich, as minister, which form of 
transport do you use most frequently -- aircraft or the train? 
  [Fadeyev] The train of course. It is cheaper and more 
reliable. 
  [Rybakov] Why? 
  [Fadeyev] Take safety. Last year seven people died in 
accidents. Whereas 37,000 died on the roads, 222 died in the 
air, whereas the figures were nine and 30 for river and maritime 
transport respectively. You can direct a host of complaints at 
railroad workers bar one: Trains run despite the general crisis 
and the 25-percent decline in industrial production in the 
country. At the very least, every Russian citizen uses the 
train 14 times a year on average. Given the size of our country 
and the astronomical prices of air tickets, this is the only 
reliable means of transportation that people can afford. The 
"iron horse" fully meets the needs of the national economy -- it 
carries three-fourths of all freight and almost one-half of all 
passengers. If there were to be holdups owing to strikes say, 
there would be chaos. During the first quarter of the year we 
carried 267 million tonnes of freight and 470 million 
passengers. That is less than in the past. But nevertheless 
losses incurred from shipments in the first three months of the 
year totaled 200 billion rubles [R] and overall losses totaled 
R37 billion [figures as published]. In this period our 
enterprises were owed R1.87 trillion. Owing to nonpayments by 
customers the railroads are unable to pay for electricity, fuel, 
semimanufactures, and rolling stock. 
  [Rybakov] What is the solution? 
  [Fadeyev] At the moment the Ministry of Railways is finding 
barter to be the solution. During the first quarter we received 
coal, timber, cotton, food, and so on, worth R1 trillion to 
cover freight costs. This is tackled by a specially created 
financial-industrial group. But in principle I deem it 
necessary to revive a normal system of systematic, advance 
payment for freight shipment. 
  In civilized countries coal is not shipped more than 600 km 
from the place of extraction because it is not profitable. In 
our country the distance covered can be 10 times that. The 
Kuzbass and Vorkuta are particularly sensitive to this. It looks 
as though it is cheaper for the Far East to buy coal from 
Australia than to extract coal in the Kharanor pit near Chita. 
The government must sort out this matter (we have made our 
proposals). All the regions cannot be treated alike. And it 
does not pay us to carry 10 tonnes of freight 1 km for R160. 
  Today many existing and newly formulated statutory acts do 
not take into consideration the special features of our work. 
As federally owned enterprises, the railroads do not have the 
right to autonomously manage their property in order to enhance 
their effectiveness. The State Committee for the Management of 
State Property, which has been assigned these rights, does not 
bear responsibility for the sector's work and does not guarantee 
compensation for damage incurred as a result of the measures it 
takes. For instance, a section of the line of the Chusovoye 
Branch of the Sverdlovsk Railroad was confiscated without 
coordination with the Ministry of Railways. There are also 
cases of the State Committee for the Management of State 
Property leasing our nonhousing premises. 
  [Rybakov] What are your relations with the CIS countries? 
  [Fadeyev] Our payments with the CIS are sometimes described 
as something of a one-way traffic. Nearby foreign countries owe 
us around R600 billion for shipments. We are once again taking 
payment via barter. But as chairman of the CIS States' Council 
for Railroad Transport I can say that they are all guided by 
Russia in terms of the price of passenger freight. There is 
some trouble with Ukraine, particularly at maritime ports. But 
I think that we will eliminate that. 
  [Rybakov] There are a great number of complaints that 
freight is not kept safe. 
  [Fadeyev] We did indeed lose freight worth R5.5 billion 
during the first quarter, R3 billion of which is accounted for 
by Chechnya and Dagestan. Incredible things happen. Motorized 
cranes go up to the train and remove literally everything -- 
timber, coal.... One conductor was taken hostage and returned 
four days later, but she was unrecognizable, she was almost 
mute. Now trains carrying our crews do not go through Chechnya 
and valuable freight is not carried at night. I do not see any 
solution with regard to Chechnya. Azerbaijan, Georgia, Armenia, 
and Russia need to pool their efforts to combat looting. 
  [Rybakov] It is being said today that railroad workers are 
stifling people with their prices. 
  [Fadeyev] I do not want to have to justify myself, but let 
us look at the figures. Carrying 10 passengers 1 km costs 
R104.2 -- that is the price of three cups of tea in any canteen. 
But we do not only have to keep the locomotives, cars, and 
tracks in good repair, but also to maintain housing, the health 
service, and kindergartens. 
  Where is the money to come from? Some of the problems have 
been shifted on to customers -- 30 percent of the expenditure on 
freight shipment is "covered" by ticket prices because the state 
does not allocate the requisite funds. But that cannot go on, 
no railroad in the world survives without state subsidies, the 
sector's problems cannot be resolved by raising charges. And 
the Ministry of Railways has repeatedly told the government that. 
  Nonpayments are also taking their toll. We are owed a total 
of R3.5 trillion and we owe miners, power generation workers, 
and others R2.6 trillion, We are in effect providing our 
customers with credit to the tune of R1 trillion and delivering 
freight free of charge. 
  [Rybakov] The summer season is drawing near. For what 
should passengers be prepared? 
  [Fadeyev] The rise in the cost of output used by the sector 
is making it necessary to index charges in order to preserve the 
efficiency of railroad transport. But the Ministry of Railways 
has no intention of raising prices of long-distance passenger 
travel before the end of the summer season or of suburban travel 
before the end of the year. We now have 460 long-distance 
trains running every day, during the summer there will be 660, 
and 12,500 suburban electric trains compared with the 10,000 we 
have today. We have increased the number of conductors to two 
per car. 
  In order to improve the service the Ministry of Railways is 
outlining a new railroad schedule. The arrival and departure 
times of 24 trains at terminuses have been altered to suit 
passengers, while the normal traveling speed of 30 trains has 
been increased, seven trains have become fast trains by 
canceling stops at underutilized stations, and the number of 
trains has been increased by 15.5 pairs [na 15.5 pary]. 
  In order to reduce expenditure, the network of deluxe trains 
[firmennyye poyezda] (now 53) is to be expanded and flexible 
transportation schedules are being developed taking into 
consideration the change in demand on different days of the week. 
  We asked the government to exempt us from some taxes in 
order 
to reduce the amount by which charges are indexed, but this 
matter has not so far been resolved. Despite the five-fold 
increase in passenger charges in 1994, transportation is still 
extremely unprofitable. According to preliminary estimates, 
losses will rise to R1.5 trillion in the first half-year. Steps 
need to be taken. 
  [Rybakov] What are the sector's prospects? 
  [Fadeyev] Moving on to streamlining railroad transport I 
would like to point out that the regions have a large part to 
play here. For instance, the Moscow Government has allocated 
R22 billion for the procurement of electric suburban trains, and 
St. Petersburg will not lag behind. But other regions are not 
particularly getting moving at the moment. 
  Following the breakup of the USSR, Russia lost capacities 
for 
the production of passenger cars, electric trains, freight 
diesel locomotives, and tankers. The temporary drop in 
production is making it possible to redevelop Russia's transport 
machine building base. The Ministry of Railways, in conjunction 
with involved ministries and departments, has drafted federal 
programs entitled "Developing Freightcar Building in Russia" and 
"Developing Russia's Enterprises To Increase Production of 
Locomotive Passenger Cars," which are at present with the 
Ministry of the Economy and are to be adopted by the Russian 
Federation Government once they have been examined. 
  The implementation of these programs, along with the 
"Developing Locomotive Building in Russia in 1994-1995" Program, 
will make it possible to supply railroad transport with Russian 
equipment, stop foreign procurement, and work reliably to meet 
the country's transportation needs. The first step was for the 
Demikhovskiy Plant to assimilate production of Russian electric 
trains in just a few months in 1993. It is planned to produce 
at least 25 suburban electric trains by the end of the year.

<F P=106> [Interview with A. Fefelkin, chief of the Financial Service </F>
of the October Railroad, by A. Shchuchkin, GUDOK correspondent: 
"The October Railroad: Changes Are Coming"; St. Petersburg, date 
not given] 
  [Text] In March, the MPS [Ministry of Railways] 
Collegium heard the report of the director of the October 
Railroad "On Measures To Stabilize the Economic Situation on the 
Road." This subject was more than topical for the entire 
network. A. Fefelkin, chief of the road's Financial Service, 
answers our correspondent's questions. 
  [Shchuchkin] Anatoliy Nikolayevich, just why was the 
management of the October Railroad heard at the collegium? In 
relation to what? 
  [Fefelkin] We tried to predict in advance the development of 
the situation in the road's economy. Foreseeing the sharp slump, 
and not expecting any orders from above, we had already begun, 
by the start of the year, to take certain steps to avoid the 
blind alley or at least to ease the situation. As far as I can 
tell, the ministry tried to obtain, using the experience of the 
October Road, the initial material for an objective analysis of 
the situation, the results of which could be used on the entire 
network. 
  We decided to change the number of divisions on the road, to 
cut back the administrative staff and to reduce the expenditures 
to maintain it. Now, instead of ten divisions, we will have 
eight. The Moscow and Rzhev divisions are merging, as well as 
the Leningrad-Finland and the Leningrad-Moscow. 
  This is an interesting fact in this situation. In previous 
years any cut in the staff on the divisions was made with a 
terrible squawk. If we asked to cut 200-300 people, the 
management of the divisions found dozens of reasons for our not 
doing this. Now, when the decision on the merge is finally made, 
the divisions are ready not only to cut 200 or 300 people, but 
double or triple that number, if only we don't combine the 
divisions. That is, at the local level, we see a reluctance to 
change the existing structure. 
  For example, the management of the Rzhev Division, on 
finding 
out that it was being combined with the Moscow Division, 
presented the road administration with a document specifying a 
whole set of measures, allegedly making it possible to avoid 
combining. These measures included cutting the collective by 917 
people, which is 10 percent of its number, combining a number of 
stations, closing some of them and converting some subdivisions 
to single-shift work. All this indicates that we do have 
reserves, not only on this division, but also on others. 
  [Shchuchkin] Mechanically combining divisions, without 
structural reorganization of the management and horizontal 
communications system, though, can hardly solve all your 
problems in any major way? 
  [Fefelkin] Of course. All this should not be undertaken for 
the sake of a simple merger. That is just why we are planning to 
improve the entire management structure, not only on the level 
of the divisions, but also by changing the structure of the road 
administration. 
  [Shchuchkin] What will this look like? 
  [Fefelkin] Technical cost-accounting boards of directors 
will 
be set up on the divisions. For example, on the Rzhev -- a board 
of directors for cost-accounting conversions, on the Moscow 
division -- a board of directors for technical service of track 
installations, communications and power supply. For the time 
being, the innovations will be implemented as an experiment, and 
if the results are favorable, these boards of directors will be 
able to take their place on the road as partners with equal 
rights. 
  Experience in setting up these boards of directors abroad 
have fully justified themselves. In particular, our neighbors in 
Finland set up these boards of directors a long time ago and 
they have proven themselves. This experiment is incorporated in 
our concept of reorganizing the road management, which means 
replacing the vertical administrative relations with horizontal 
ones. This means creating associations of track, railcar and 
locomotive services. After these associations have been set up, 
the remaining division structures, which are the property of the 
NOD [Ministry of Railways Railroad Division Chiefs], should 
become cost-accounting boards of directors for transport and 
work with all the depots, stations and other independent 
subdivisions on contractual, equal-rights principles, in this 
case having no administrative command, but working on equal 
terms with everyone. 
  The road administration is now also drawing up a group of 
documents on its structural reorganization. Some of the 
departments and services are merging and some will be cut back 
or reorganized and given different or additional functions. 
  [Shchuchkin] In addition to creating radically reorganized 
structures, what other armament are you taking on? 
  [Fefelkin] In my opinion, we too hastily and unjustifiably 
rejected reliable methods such as planning and establishing 
quotas. The consequence of this was an increase in the 
overexpenditure of operating funds, a weakening of the role of 
operations workers in high-quality utilization of rolling stock 
and a reduction in the material responsibility of many workers. 
This will do tremendous damage to the entire road economy. We 
must therefore return to the former measures -- planning and 
setting quotas for all our needs. We have partially begun to 
utilize them. Today not a single division receives financing in 
the necessary amount, because of a lack of funds. Wages are 
planned strictly according to the quota system and financing is 
implemented on each division only for this quota. The divisions, 
of course, require more funds than the sums put down for wages, 
but there is nowhere to get them. This means that we must live 
according to our means. 
  In February we had 48 billion rubles [R] in monetary 
receipts, but the wages, allowing for deductions, were R62 
billion. There was nothing with which we could cover the 
difference. It turned out that all the monetary receipts were 
being spent on wages. There was simply nothing left for 
reproduction. The only thing that would alleviate our situation 
was mutual offsetting. 
  [Shchuchkin] From what funds do you cover expenditures to 
maintain divisions that are operating at a loss? 
  [Fefelkin] There have always been a few unprofitable 
divisions on the road: the Bologoye, Rzhev, Pskov divisions. 
After Karelia was given equal status with the regions of the Far 
North, the Petrozavodsk Division (one of the largest on the 
road) also began to be subsidized. Today it lives not only 
through its own allocations, but also those of the Murmansk and 
Volkhovstroy divisions. The expenditures for wages here, 
allowing for deductions, constitute R11 billion. The division is 
not in a position to earn these funds on its own. 
  [Shchuchkin] What is the road doing to increase monetary 
receipts and reduce its debts? 
  [Fefelkin] Here is an example. The other day we signed a 
contract with the management of the Cherepovets Metallurgy 
Combine. According to it, the Kostomuksa GOK [Mining-Enriching 
Combine] will supply the road with pellets, counting toward 
clearing off the combine's debt, and the Cherepovets Combine 
will supply metal for the road. We turn over this metal to the 
plants that do not have the funds to buy it, and there they use 
it to make the brake shoes which are in such short supply for 
us, and also spare parts for rolling stock. In addition, there 
is a possibility of selling metal on the foreign market and 
obtaining "real" money for it, which we need. 
  If our trade in metal and the barter based on it is 
successful in the next few months, we will draw the Kovdor and 
Olenegorsk GOK, which produce iron ore concentrate, into 
cooperation on similar conditions. There are already preliminary 
agreements on this. 
  The road intends to develop this sort of commercial activity 
for all types of goods produced by our debtors, be they pellets, 
iron ore or apatite concentrates. In order not only to survive, 
but also to keep the road economy in good operating condition, 
today we must simply become sensible businessmen. 
  [Shchuchkin] The road has its own bank -- the Baltic. What 
is 
its role in the stabilization process? 
  [Fefelkin] The bank has essentially accelerated the passage 
of payments, which, strictly speaking, we were trying to do, 
when we created it. Today the intra-bank transfers of the 
Lenuzel enterprises take place in an hour. Unfortunately, the 
development of branches of the Baltic Bank on the road is still 
going slowly. Their opening on the Bologoye, Petrozavodsk and 
Volkhovstroy divisions is planned for the near future. Then it 
will be possible to accelerate the passage of payments not only 
at Lenuzel, but also along the entire road. For the time being, 
we have decided to open a branch of the bank directly in the 
administration, in order to make it a unique standard, or if you 
want, school, where interested road specialists could learn to 
raise their level. In addition, this branch will also be used as 
a savings bank for the railroad workers, in order to draw their 
funds into the development of the road. This will benefit 
everyone. 
  [Shchuchkin] How do you intend to solve the problem of the 
unprofitability of passenger transport? 
  [Fefelkin] We have arranged with the St. Petersburg 
Municipal 
Council that, instead of paying taxes into the local budget, the 
road, by agreement with the authorities, will direct these funds 
into covering the losses from passenger transport and purchasing 
new electric trains at Torzhok. 
  In 1994, We plan to obtain R40 billion by reducing the NDS 
[VAT] deductions for the local budget. Part of these funds will 
go to cover the losses, and we will buy 10 Torzhok-produced 
electric trains for R16 billion. The total, as you can see, is 
quite sizable. We are counting on spending a small part of it on 
repairing our terminals. 
  [Shchuchkin] What contribution are commercial structures 
making to the road's financial support? 
  [Fefelkin] A considerable one. After all, we were not at 
first prepared to receive the tremendous flow of in-kind 
carriage charges which rained down on us one-and-a-half years 
ago. If it had not been for the commercial structures, we could 
hardly have been able to dispose of everything that was piled on 
us: after all, nothing like that had ever happened on the road 
before. Their activity was a great help to us. 
  True, not everything developed and worked out fully. Some of 
them began to die out, but some are working with a good return. 
These are the funds that we are using for construction. 
  For example, the Yugstroy Construction Organization was 
created, and is building a sanitarium for the road in Sochi. 
Through the profits from commercial structures, we completed the 
construction of an electric centralization post at the 
Kushelevka Station. In the near future we plan to rebuild the 
Olenegorsk Station. I am therefore convinced that the activity 
of the commercial structures is of appreciable help. 
  [Shchuchkin] Many people on the road today are talking about 
the major cuts in staff. Is there not a danger that many 
able-bodied people will find themselves thrown overboard and 
will fill the ranks of the unemployed? 
  [Fefelkin] This danger, in my opinion, is exaggerated. I 
don't think that the reduction in the contingent will hurt the 
interests of a large number of workers. The pensioners will 
leave first of all. When they retire on pension, they are paid a 
lump sum of six average monthly wages. Note, not salaries, but 
wages. Their situation will therefore not be serious or, 
moreover, hopeless. As for the rest of the age categories, I can 
say one thing here -- there will be no thoughtless cutbacks on 
the road. We are trying to do things so as to make this process 
as painless as possible.

<F P=106> [Article by V.I. Sinko, doctor of economic sciences, and </F>
B.S. Volder, TsENII [Central Economics Scientific Research 
Institute] "Giprostanok": "Prospects for the Development of 
Motor Vehicle Manufacturing"] 
  [Text] The market for motor vehicles, one of the largest 
commodity markets at present, will exert more and more 
substantial influence on the growth of their production and 
sales in the future. And the determining factor in this will be 
the expansion of demand for passenger cars as well as trucks for 
reasons of an economic, social, and scientific and technical 
nature. 
  First of all, under the influence of a certain increase in 
the size of the population and the effect of the objective law 
of an increase in their requirements, the consumer demand for 
passenger cars will increase. The need to increase the 
production and sale of trucks is being demanded and will 
continue to be demanded by the ever-increasing importance of 
automotive transport to carry mass-produced and specialized 
commodities, especially under the influence of the rise in 
containerization. 
  The expansion of road, bridge, and tunnel construction of 
international importance contributes to trends such as these as 
well. 
  It should be taken into account at the same time that the 
expansion of demand for the means of automotive transportation, 
primarily passenger cars, is not infinite. Even the possibility 
that a crisis situation may arise has not been ruled out. For 
example, uncontrolled expansion of the fleet of motor vehicles 
makes the conditions for their operation substantially worse 
(low speeds during peak hours and the increased difficulty of 
parking) and objectively leads to increased environmental 
pollution in spite of the steps taken. 
  All this produces negative socioeconomic consequences and 
may 
lead to a decline in the passenger car's prestige as a social 
symbol. Hence, a slowdown in demand for passenger cars is very 
likely, and important qualitative changes in the motor vehicle 
itself as a means of transportation are just as likely. 
  This is as far as world automotive manufacturing is 
concerned. Our situation is even worse. The decline of the 
public's ability to pay, the noncompetitiveness of vehicles in 
the foreign market (one-fifth to one-eighth as competitive as 
the United States and Japan), and the liberalization of foreign 
trade create exceptionally unfavorable conditions for domestic 
automotive manufacturing. Essentially, the domestic market for 
motor vehicles in Russia has not been protected from dumping by 
both Japan and the United States, which dominate production in 
the world market, sell their products in all parts of the world, 
and have reserves of technologically and technically advanced 
capacities and a highly skilled labor force (30 to 40 percent 
with respect to the number utilized in 1991). 
  Russia cannot avoid such an objective set of circumstances. 
Development of automotive manufacturing will be determined to an 
even greater extent by those far-reaching changes being brought 
into the world economy by scientific and technical progress. The 
utilization in practice of the achievements of science and 
technology is considered under current conditions as a decisive 
factor in a product's competitiveness and as the overriding 
problem facing all countries taking part in the market for motor 
vehicles. First of all, this means achievements in 
machinebuilding technology, roadbuilding, and the production of 
fuel, equipment, and materials, and so forth. The application 
of advanced methods in highly automated flow-line production 
oriented toward the use of flexible automated systems, EVM 
[computers], industrial robots and manipulators makes it 
possible to reduce the production cost of manufacturing a 
vehicle to a minimum. 
  At the same time, along with the big changes in the 
technology, forms, and methods of organizing production, the 
technical development of the vehicle itself has entered a 
qualitatively new stage, which is characterized by completion of 
the process of its refinement and the shift to fundamental 
changes in automotive equipment based on achievements in other 
sectors of industry. The principal directions of scientific and 
technical progress in the automotive industry are already being 
traced: decrease in fuel consumption through fundamental design 
improvements in engines and other components, development of new 
types of power plants and fuels, the use of new structural 
materials, the introduction of measures to reduce the toxicity 
of exhaust gases, and greater safety in operating ATS [motor 
transport vehicles] with the shift to automation in traffic. 
  One of the most important directions mentioned is reduced 
fuel consumption by the fleet of motor vehicles. The problem may 
be resolved, for example, by using alternative fuels, that is, 
fuels whose production excludes the use of petroleum and 
petroleum products. They include natural and artificial 
hydrocarbon gases such as petroleum gas and the gas which is 
formed in petroleum refining; the gases obtained from processing 
the by-products of industrial and agricultural production and 
other organic residue; and alcohol obtained from natural gases 
and other substances. 
  Compressed natural and liquefied petroleum gases are in 
first 
place among the alternative automotive fuels. They have already 
begun to be used in the engines of trucks and passenger cars. 
And compressed natural gas has already proved itself as a type 
of fuel which has the properties of the best brands of domestic 
gasoline. It has sufficient energy content; the octane number of 
its main component--methane--is 104, whereas the "Ekstra" 
gasoline is 95 octane. Moreover, this fuel, which enters engine 
cylinders in the form of a gas mixture, does not wash away the 
lubricant from the walls of the cylinder sleeve, including in 
cases where there is dry friction of components in the cylinder 
and piston assembly. At the same time, the lubricant retains its 
working properties and engine service life is increased by 1.5 
to two times as much. And what is most important, the amount of 
toxic emissions into the atmosphere is reduced when some motor 
vehicles are shifted to gas fuel. 
  A substantial reserve for fuel economy is provided by 
reducing the mass and overall dimensions of vehicles and 
installing less powerful engines, as well as by using lighter 
construction materials: high-strength steels, aluminum, 
plastics, composites, and ceramics. For example, substantial 
fuel savings have already been achieved by firms which 
manufacture passenger cars with plastic bodies and make bumpers, 
springs, frames, and other parts out of composite materials. 
  Electronic equipment also reduces fuel consumption, 
substantially improves the safety of vehicle operation, reduces 
the toxicity of exhaust gases, and simplifies maintenance and 
repair of vehicles, making them less expensive. It may have a 
very wide range of application--from electronic clocks to 
systems which control operation of the engine, transmission, and 
other units and systems in the vehicle. For example, the fuel 
consumption warning devices which are now being installed in 
series-produced vehicles ("ekonometers"), signals for individual 
movement parameters, the microprocessor fuel injection systems, 
ABS [antilock brake systems], automatic suspension control, and 
so forth. 
  There is no question that extensive use of electronic 
systems 
in domestic automotive equipment will become the task for 
tomorrow. Including (and this is almost the most urgent task) 
the maximum use of electronic equipment to improve vehicles' 
level of safety, which will make it possible to almost 
completely eliminate DTP [road accidents] in the future, in the 
opinion of a number of specialists. 
  The lack of automotive power plants at present which do not 
pollute the atmosphere forces us to take steps to reduce the 
toxicity of exhaust gases in existing engines. For example, by 
installing catalytic converters and direct fuel injection 
systems and by taking other steps to improve engines and fuel 
equipment aimed at reducing the toxicity from hydrocarbons and 
oxides of carbon and nitrogen. The experience of industrially 
developed countries as the result of such measures is 
persuasive: despite the increased number of vehicles there and 
the additional new vehicles equipped with more and more refined 
systems for controlling exhaust gases, pollution of the air, 
especially in large cities, has already been substantially 
reduced. 
  A trend characteristic of development of the motor vehicle 
market in the future is an increase in international trade in 
them. But as world experience shows, only a competitive product 
can enter the world markets. The principal element of 
competitiveness now is quality and consumer appeal. For example, 
according to data from research conducted in the United States, 
80 percent of consumers consider quality a more important 
indicator than price when they are selecting a commodity. By 
taking this very trend into account, Japan has been able to 
reach a dominant position in the world motor vehicle market. The 
quality control system which it developed is a mechanism to 
fully meet the requirements and demands of the consumer--it may 
be considered a model for scientific and technical organization 
of the work in manufacturing a motor vehicle, from development 
of a new model to testing of the finished product. In all stages 
of a vehicle's development, factors such as quality, market 
requirements, and national and international safety and 
ecological standards are taken into account. Quality control in 
the vehicle manufacturing stage calls for wide-scale production 
automation and mechanization, the use of advanced technologies 
and efficient methods of work organization, and refinement of 
quality monitoring. The main objective of production automation 
is to eliminate the effect of subjective factors, or to minimize 
their effect, on product quality, although the labor-output 
ratio is reduced at the same time, naturally. For this reason, 
for example, 97 percent of the welding operations in Japan are 
now being performed automatically, and laser units verify the 
accuracy of the geometric dimensions of a vehicle body, which 
eliminates the possibility that parts which do not conform to 
the design may enter the assembly process. 
  The tasks of ensuring high quality are also performed by 
robotization of the vehicles' assembly. At many Japanese motor 
vehicle plants, robots install the doors, the rear windows, and 
the spare tires. Then the conveyer is divided into three 
floor-type flow lines. In particular, as the body moves through 
one of them, the finishing line, robots install windshield 
wipers, the dashboard, the seating, and the bumpers, and they 
install them with an exceptional degree of precision. The hood 
and front fenders are protected from mechanical damage by 
special housings during their movement. 
  The engine, transmission, and wheels are installed on the 
other line. 
  In the process of all production the quality of all systems 
and every operation is regulated and carefully monitored. And 
finally, each vehicle is subjected to tests in a shower--to 
determine if the body is leakproof. 
  The Japanese system of universal personnel training 
unquestionably deserves special attention. First of all, this 
includes quality study groups which, aside from quality 
problems, are concerned with saving resources, increasing labor 
productivity, and improving work conditions. 
  The quality control system used by Japanese concerns, as we 
see, is quite thorough and it may be used in manufacturing 
domestic automotive equipment. 
  As already noted, a characteristic feature in development of 
a motor vehicle market in the future will be an increase in 
international trade in this means of transportation. In 
specialists' estimation, the proportion of exports in the output 
of the main producer countries in the year 2000 will reach 46 
percent for passenger cars and 41 percent for trucks and buses 
(42 percent and 34 percent, respectively, in 1985). The 
structure of international trade (from the viewpoint of the 
proportion of individual vehicle categories) will not undergo 
any specific changes and will basically coincide with the 
structure of their production as it does now. 
  Judging by the available data, the forms and methods of 
vehicle sales by the leading foreign firms apparently will not 
change substantially in the period being examined, either. 
However, it is assumed that the process of market monopolization 
will be speeded up by increasing the levels of production 
concentration and sales in the hands of several transnational 
firms. In particular, the practice of joint NIOKR [scientific 
research and experimental design work] and the production and 
sales of vehicles by the firms of various countries will be 
expanded considerably. In the final analysis, the logic of a 
competitive struggle will lead to the complete elimination of 
all national producers and the formation of truly international 
supermonopolies based on them. The initial base for forming such 
associations has already been established and is manifested in 
the form of mutual participation in joint-stock capital and the 
conclusion of agreements on the collaboration of various firms. 
A typical example is the interaction of General Motors and 
Toyota, Ford Motor Company and Mazda and Fiat, and Nissan with 
Volkswagen and others. It is possible that the international 
market may be redivided among them. 
  A second example is activity by one of the supermonopolies, 
the Volkswagen concern. 
  This is a very large transnational corporation which 
occupies 
a prominent place in the list of industrial corporations of 
economically developed countries in the West. About 270,000 
persons are employed in its enterprises, located in 12 
countries. As of today, the sales volume of Volkswagen accounts 
for more than 16 percent of total sales in the European motor 
vehicle market; this far exceeds the sales volume of other 
automotive firms, including Fiat, Peugeot, and Reno. In 1990, it 
exported 315,000 vehicles to Italy, 257,000 to France, and so 
forth. The baisc model--the "Golf"--is especially popular here. 
Every year the volume of deliveries to the United States and 
Canada is increased. And generally speaking, it must be said 
that Volkswagen has the ability to win more and more markets for 
sales ahead of the others. For example, it was the first to 
organize a joint venture to manufacture motor vehicles in China. 
  Volkswagen continues to work on motor vehicles of the 
future--as an example, on the design of a vehicle which will be 
able to "fit" in an available space between other vehicles 
parked on the street. The concern is also receptive to technical 
developments, many of which received their start at its 
enterprises or which were put into mass production for the first 
time at them. (For example, development of the first catalytic 
converter for a diesel belongs to the designers of this concern.) 
  Unfortunately, Volkswagen has no or practically no ties with 
our country. And such ties would not hurt, inasmuch as the 
export of our automotive products in the coming years can be 
actively developed only when there is close collaboration with 
foreign firms, international cooperation, the availability of 
foreign loans, and the involvement of foreign capital and joint 
enterpreneurial activity. Attraction of foreign capital may 
become the main element in increasing the foreign economic 
potential of automotive manufacturing and be realized in the 
form of joint ventures. (The advantages of a joint venture are 
that it does not return to the firm the funds that it invests, 
only the profit on them, first of all, and secondly, there is 
continuing collaboration with the foreign firm in improving 
production and searching for sales markets.) In this sense, a 
joint venture with Volkswagen for the manufacture of motor 
vehicles would be advantageous. Especially if it were overall 
collaboration embracing the entire production cycle, beginning 
with development of a design and ending with sales. At the same 
time, the concern's advanced achievements should be fully 
utilized: the high degree of mechanization and automation of 
production processes in all stages of the technological 
cycle--from stamping and welding elements of the body to 
installation of finished assemblies, as well as the use of 
highly productive equipment incorporated in the automatic and 
semiautomatic lines and the flexible production systems. 
  Joint ventures (not only with Volkswagen, of course) to 
produce motor vehicles for our country could also speed up the 
solution of many other problems, and not just the problems of 
producing and selling them. In particular, in training highly 
skilled domestic personnel; in modernizing automotive production 
at the level of current requirements for it (taking into account 
automatic assembly, which will compel us to reexamine the entire 
technological process); and in building up export potential 
based on domestic automotive manufacturing, which will make it 
possible for automotive products to compete successfully in 
world markets and for the country to become one of the principal 
producers.

<F P=106> [Article by Yelena Kotelnikova: "Brakov Gives an Ultimatum </F>
to the Authorities"] 
  [Text] The management of the Moscow joint-stock 
company "Plant imeni I.A. Likhachev" (AMO ZIL) has demanded that 
the president and the government "find an opportunity" for 
financing the enterprise annually (up to 1998); otherwise the 
enterprise faces the threat of "a social explosion." The 
question of financial support for the privatized enterprise is 
to be examined today at a meeting of the government's Committee 
on Strategic Matters under the chairmanship of First Vice 
Premier Oleg Soskovets. It is clear that concession to pressure 
from the ZIL administration will be a signal for a frontal 
assault on the budget by those directors who are not prepared to 
accept the market rules of the game. 
  The AMO ZIL (about 3 billion rubles [R] of charter 
capital), which manufactures trucks, as well as refrigerators 
and microwave ovens, was privatized in accordance with the first 
version of benefits, as a result of which 40 percent of its 
shares were acquired by the enterprise's employees (25 percent 
of them are preferred shares). After the checking privatization, 
the largest blocks of stock (about 20 percent of each) were 
concentrated in the ZIL administration and the "Mikrodin" 
Trading Firm. A block of similar size was reserved for 
investments and is under the jurisdiction of the privatization 
organs. 
  According to Vladimir Nosov, the ZIL chief engineer, the 
plant assembles 180 trucks per day at a price of about R14 
million each, and it needs state support so much that the 
enterprise's managers "stand watch at the telephone so that they 
do not miss a call from the government." At the same time, 
Yevgeniy Brakov, the "president and general director," 
personally is looking over the lists of those invited to the 
stockholders meeting which opens today in Luzhniki (the AMO ZIL 
has about 180,000 stockholders); a call from the government and 
the stockholders meeting may bring a fundamental change to the 
ZIL director's position. The productivity of the enterprise's 
principal output has dropped by 80 percent over the year and the 
number of industrial personnel has been cut back by 14,000 
(about 15 percent of those employed). Brakov himself links the 
slump with "the government's poorly planned domestic policy." It 
follows from this that President Boris Yeltsin and First Vice 
Premier Oleg Soskovets are in debt to the ZIL. Letters of 
ultimatum are being sent regularly to the Kremlin and the White 
House (Soskovets received the last one on 18 April) with the 
demand that "funds be found" to add to ZIL's working capital and 
for budgetary financing of its investment programs (over R100 
billion annually up to 1998). In addition, Brakov is insisting 
on tax holidays for the enterprise, as well as the introduction 
of a favorable investment exchange rate for the ruble against 
foreign currencies to pay for contracts. At the same time, the 
ZIL board of directors is not concealing the fact that the 
enterprise already has "a large debt to the budget and nonbudget 
funds" (from his February letter to President Yeltsin). However, 
the main obstacle to further subsidized financing of the 
enterprise by the state, in the opinion of the enterprise 
management, is "the connivance" of vice premiers Aleksandr 
Shokhin and Anatoliy Chubays "to abolish the domestic automotive 
industry and open a market for imported equipment" (from 
Brakov's April letter to Soskovets). 
  Indeed, in Chubays' department, which oversees the 
management 
of state proportions in the privatized sector of industry, they 
do not consider the ZIL claims to be justified, since they 
consider the reason for the crisis at the enterprise to be 
primarily "the inability of the enterprise's managers, who are 
accustomed to working 'under the government's tutelage,' to 
adapt to market conditions." In particular, Alfred Kokh, deputy 
chairman of the GKI [State Committee on the Administration of 
State Property], reported that the enterprise's capacities are 
designed for 200,000 trucks. In his words, however, the 
management "deliberately cut back" output to 34,000 vehicles, 
since it was "not in a position to restructure the system of 
product sales based on such a large batch of trucks (no less 
than 100 units)." The GKI believes it is precisely the 
enterprise management's policy which is adding to the 
unemployment. In this connection, the GKI plan for the ZIL's 
financial normalization is based on utilization of the 
enterprise's internal reserves and retention of the existing 
ownership structure. This differs not only from the plant 
management's proposals, which are totally oriented toward state 
support, but the plan of Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov, who is 
demanding 20 percent of the enterprise's stock in exchange for 
helping it. 
<H5>  Basic Proposals for Financial Normalization of the ZIL: </H5>
  --Pesident and General Director Yevgeniy Brakov: 
to provide for budget financing of the enterprise's 
investment programs until 1999 and to introduce tax holidays for 
the ZIL, as well as a favorable exchange rate against foreign 
currencies to pay for contracts 
  --The State Committee on the Administration of State 
Property: to introduce outside management of the 
enterprise, to add to its working capital through the sale 
of administration buildings (the plant management, in 
particular), and to form a dealer network 
  --Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov: to lease land to the 
ZIL for 49 years for mortgage operations in exchange 
for 20 percent of the enterprise's stock; to defer payment 
to the city budget until the end of 1994 (about R63 billion).

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Tikhiy under the rubric "Eurasia": "The </F>
President Looks Lonely"] 
  [Text] For several days now a couple dozen pensioners have 
been spending the night in the tent city thrown up in front of 
the building of the Supreme Council of the Crimea, where the 
administration of the peninsula's first president is now housed. 
It was with them that Yuriy Meshkov began his ascent to power 
three years ago. On the wall of the largest tent is a pencil 
portrait of Meshkov of an extremely impressive size with the 
inscription "Long live the president!" The rest of the 
decoration of the compound shows its inhabitants' lack of 
acceptance of Ukraine in all of its manifestations--from the 
Ukrainian language to Ukrainian salt pork. Anatoliy Los, the 
leader of the picketers, speaks at the small rally several times 
a day. In his words, the old men and women (with the latter 
clearly in the majority) have gathered here in order to protect 
their president from the intrigues of Ukrainian nationalists. 
  Incidentally, a situation is developing in the Crimea in 
which, most likely, Meshkov will have to be protected not from 
the persistent fighters for the Ukrainian idea, who are nowhere 
to be found here, and not from the opposition, who suffered a 
crushing defeat in the elections to the Supreme Council of the 
Crimea, but from his own advisers. It is true that the Russia 
bloc won an absolute majority--54 of the 90 positions that are 
occupied as of today (four mandates have not been won by anyone 
yet). But the unanimity with which representatives of sometimes 
diametrically opposed political forces speak both about Meshkov 
himself and about the qualitative composition of the parliament 
shows that if the president of the Crimea is fostering hopes 
that the Supreme Council will automatically rubber stamp any of 
his decisions, they are in vain. 
  This can be seen both from the deputy chairman of the 
Council 
of the Crimean Tatar people, Rifat Chubarov, and from Meshkov's 
former rival for the presidential elections, Sergey Shuvaynikov 
(Russian Party). Another former claimant to the high state post 
in the Crimea, the chairman of the Communist Party of Crimea, 
Leonid Grach, told a MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI correspondent: "I do 
not rule out the possibility that this Supreme Council of the 
Crimea in general will be unable to begin to function and 
realize itself as a parliament. And this could raise the 
question of repeat elections in the near future. The Russia bloc 
even today is coming apart at the seams. But if the deputies 
from it continue to refuse to take Ukraine into account, we will 
not give our consent. The Tatars, who have 14 mandates in the 
Supreme Council, will not go along with this either." 
  Moreover, Grach states that he is ready to consider the 
proposals (and Grach is convinced that there will be some) to 
nominate him as a candidate for the post of chairman of the 
Crimean parliament. True, the Russia bloc is considering other 
candidates, but Leonid Grach would suit many. If this election 
occurs, the confrontation within the "Russian type" along the 
lines of parliament-president in the Crimea will be more than 
likely. 
  Many of the president's advisers in the Russia bloc have a 
personal score to settle with him as well: He very blatantly 
failed to take their wishes and hopes into account when dividing 
up the portfolios. Moreover, having abolished the Council of 
Ministers of the Crimea, except for appointing Yevgeniy Saburov 
as deputy prime minister, the president has practically not 
distinguished himself in the field of state construction. 
  Workers of the Crimean SBU (Security Service of Ukraine) 
administration, in which Meshkov tried to change the leadership 
with his edict, adopted an appeal to the president requesting 
that he not involve them in political conflicts. In so doing 
they revealed an open secret: where the previously unknown 
people on Meshkov's team had come from. In their message the 
Chekists express their surprise that their former colleagues who 
are now in the president's circle do not understand such simple 
things. According to numerous pieces of evidence, Meshkov's team 
includes people who are directly linked to criminal structures 
who have served their term for various reasons. In any case it 
became unofficially known that Meshkov had prepared an edict 
which envisions a radical purge of the ranks of presidential 
advisers. 
  During the two months of his presidency Yuriy Meshkov has 
used up his extremely small reserve of strength in relations 
with Kiev. His statement to the effect that the present 
Ukrainian government is "the greatest threat to peace in Europe" 
practically rules out the possibility of businesslike contacts 
with this government. Yet Meshkov had every reason to count on 
the idea that with an indisputable victory of the left wing 
(inclined toward alliance with Russia) in the elections to the 
Supreme Council of Ukraine he would have a real chance of 
working with different leaders in Kiev. But here again he could 
not refrain from inciting passions by calling for a boycott of 
these elections. Even Crimean politicians who are far from 
sympathizing with the current Ukraine note that the fight 
against Ukrainian nationalism in the Crimea is beginning to grow 
into Russian chauvinism. 
  But one can see how the tension is growing from the example 
of the war of edicts between Kiev and Simferopol which broke out 
in the middle of March. First Meshkov, violating not only 
Ukrainian but also Crimean legislation, fired the chairman of 
the telephone and radio company of Crimea, Valeriy Astakhov. The 
president of Ukraine overrode this edict. Then followed the 
aforementioned firing of the chief of the SBU with an attempt to 
appoint "his own person" to the special unit. 
  At the same time the stirring up of passions causes harm to 
the sphere which could help the economy of the Crimea very much 
this year: It is difficult to imagine how many lovers of the 
Crimean sun and sea have rejected the president's invitation to 
come to the blessed peninsula this summer. It is impossible to 
understand what future awaits the three edicts Meshkov signed at 
the suggestion of Deputy Prime Minister Saburov: "On Currency 
Regulation and Currency Control," "On Taxation," and "On Banks 
and Banking Activity on the Territory of the Republic of 
Crimea." The purpose of these edicts was to step up the 
circulation of funds and encourage investment of money in the 
economy of the Crimea. But who will invest money in a territory 
where "it smells like thunder in the air"? 
  A special podium with a separate dais has already been 
constructed in the meeting hall of the Supreme Council of the 
Crimea for Yuriy Meshkov, who is keenly attentive to the 
presence and observance of a presidential environment and 
vocabulary. Eyewitnesses who have seen him sitting at his 
assigned place during the last session of the Supreme Council of 
the old convocation note that he looked very lonely there....

<F P=106> [Article by Vadim Fomenko under the rubric "Reflections </F>
After the Election": "Will Old Man Mazay Rescue Political 
'Hares?'"] 
  [Text] It is known that political games, which is what 
elections undoubtedly are, do not have logos like the Olympic 
Games. If political games did have a logo, Elections-94 would be 
personified by a scared hare caught on an island in high tide, 
rather than a likable bear cub, the mascot of Olympics-80. 
  Think of this: There are now 33 parties in Ukraine (the last 
one, the Human Rights Party, was registered one week ago), 
whereas just a few made their way to the "dry valley," that is, 
the parliament. More precisely, only the following will be 
represented in the new Supreme Council: the KPU [Communist Party 
of Ukraine]--about 100 seats, Rukh--about 30, the SelPU [Peasant 
Party of Ukraine]--18, and the SPU [Socialist Party of 
Ukraine]--15. They are followed by the URP [Ukrainian Republican 
Party] with nine deputies, the Democratic Party, with three 
deputies, the Christian Democrats, with three deputies, and the 
Social Democrats with two. The leaders of this latter group of 
parties, with the exception of the Democratic Party, have lost 
the elections personally. To be sure, there will also be several 
representatives of national-radical and pro-fascist forces in 
the parliament, but they will not play any particular role. 
  This sad arithmetic suggests only one conclusion: "Although 
before the elections radio and TV put on the air in turn 30 
political parties which we allegedly have, most of them do not 
have a single deputy in the new Supreme Council. Vociferous 
party declarations turned out to conceal a void, a complete 
absence of party structures at the local level. These dwarfish 
parties did not have enough cadres to put together a corps of 
deputies, nor did they have supporters to ensure the conduct of 
the election campaign. 
  "Meanwhile, in Churchill's words, parties are 'machines for 
winning elections.' So it turns out that the political activity 
of the people was bound like a river with ice, and the parties 
could romp on the ice. But high tide came (and it is high this 
year) and this showy tinsel was swept away. What are these 
parties to do now? Who should they expect to be rescued? Whether 
they want it or not, there is only one way out--to hop into the 
boat seeking protection from Old Man Mazay." 
  I hear the outraged voice of the pro-Rukh reader: "Here is a 
fine how do you do from the left. It is not enough for them to 
have rallied 120 deputies around themselves, they also covet 
other democrats! And in all this they humiliate--dwarfish 
parties, they say, lacking cadres, a void." 
  Let us make it clear: The above quote does not come from a 
presentation by the leader of the Communist Party, P. Simonenko, 
whose press conference we have promised to discuss, but from a 
report by...V. Chornovil at the recent Fifth Rukh Congress (you 
see, Sir Vyacheslav, how frequently PRAVDA UKRAINY quotes you!). 
This congress was far more sober than the previous forums and 
press conferences of Rukh following the elections. At the 
latter, triumphant trumpets were heard, whereas at the 
former--sad violins. Chornovil did not succeed in putting a good 
face on a bad situation. In particular, S. Odarich, member of 
the Rukh central leadership, stated at the congress 
straightforwardly that Rukh had failed to keep the status quo, 
as Chornovil was trying to prove, that Rukh had suffered a 
defeat, that it had pursued a bad cadre policy: Twenty-one 
chairmen of regional Rukh organizations had run as candidates 
for people's deputy, and only five had been elected. The 
chairman of the Kharkov regional organization, G. Altunyan, 
spoke in the same vein: Our candidates were unable to clearly 
explain the essence of Rukh's economic program to the voters. 
  The reader will stop me: "Wait a minute. You promised to 
tell 
us one thing, but you are telling us quite another. Why did you 
change the subject? Where is the report on the communist press 
conference?" 
  No, I have not changed the subject. It is just that this is 
a 
long lead-in. 
  The leaders of the Communist Party carried on in a calm and 
dignified although somewhat dry manner at their press 
conference. Instead of picturesque reports and victorious 
communiques they produced specific statistics and facts by way 
of a business card. Here they are. 
  "Despite the Communist Party joining the struggle for the 
credentials of people's deputies before completing the process 
of its establishment, it confirmed by deeds that it is the most 
influential political force. Almost 100 deputies are communists 
from among 168 people's deputies with a party affiliation (out 
of the 338 deputies elected). Of these, five are members of the 
Central Committee Presidium, five are first secretaries of 
oblast committees, 15 are members of the Central Committee, five 
are workers, four are women, 11 are enterprise managers, 14 are 
kolkhoz chairmen and directors of agricultural enterprises, and 
six are college instructors." 
  As far as age is concerned, may the statement about the 
aging 
of the party burden Chornovil's conscience: Only one of the 
elected communist deputies is beyond retirement age; the others 
are under 50. In Kiev alone the ranks of the communists grew by 
a factor of 1.5 during the election campaign. 
  Questions followed, which members of the Presidium and 
Central Committee secretaries, O. Grachev, A. Martynyuk, B. 
Oleynik, and KPU Representative at the Central Election 
Commission G. Kryuchkov fielded along with P. Simonenko. 
  [Question] Is it true that a meeting between President 
Kravchuk and First Secretary of the KPU Central Committee P. 
Simonenko will be held soon? 
  [Answer] Yes, Kravchuk solicited the meeting himself. 
  [Question] Specifically how does the Communist Party intend 
to proceed in the economic sphere? 
  [Answer] First of all, for the duration of this crisis 
situation we will regulate the key sectors of the economy. We 
will try to put taxes and the financial and credit system in 
order, and begin to combat crime harshly. 
  [Question] Many parties, in particular the socialists, are 
proposing to hold the first session of the new Supreme Council 
before 15 May. What is the attitude of the Communist Party 
towards this? 
  [Answer] We believe that there is no reason to hurry. We 
should prepare well. 
  [Question] How is this to be interpreted: The Communist 
Party 
is against the essence of the institution of the presidency, and 
yet you have nominated a candidate? 
  [Answer] We see fit to take advantage of the new election 
campaign to propagate our program and our ideas. 
  [Question] It has become known that Boris Oleynik was also 
nominated as a contender for the post of president, along with 
Simonenko, at the last conference of the KPU. Why did he 
withdraw? Did he obey party discipline? 
  [Oleynik] They say in our village: "One should do what one 
has been trained to do." [quote rendered in Ukrainian in the 
original] I would not cope with the presidency. I am a writer, a 
poet. 
  [Question] Will you be able to find a common language with 
the Kuchma-Grinev bloc? 
  [Answer] We will seek ways for a rapprochement with this 
bloc 
and other forces which are truly concerned about the good of 
Ukraine. We can promise one thing firmly: We will not be the 
first ones to seek confrontation. 
  There were many other questions--those just out of curiosity 
and those openly inflammatory. When the latter were voiced, the 
leaders, while bristling deep down, sought a way to smooth over 
the rough edges. This might be the reason why the sugary smell 
of incense which the members of the Central Committee were 
burning to themselves was clearly felt in the auditorium. Of 
course, they did not rejoice or embrace as soccer players do 
after scoring a goal, but nonetheless tried to prove that all of 
their affairs were proceeding as planned and that getting to the 
parliament was indeed a piece of cake. 
  But is this so? After all, it was no secret that out of 28 
communist candidates in Kiev and Kiev Oblast, only three 
qualified for the runoff election, and not one was ultimately 
elected. It is known that there was friction not only between 
the Rukh people and the Republican Party, but also between the 
socialists and the communists, and in particular, that the 
communist V. Trizna fought, in Pecherskiy District of Kiev, the 
socialist A. Bozhko, A. Moroz's first deputy. There were a lot 
of other snags and rough spots, to put it mildly. Why conceal 
them? Why did the official statement of the Communist Party on 
the results of the election which was approved at its first 
conference breathe not a word of self-criticism but rather 
consist of solid self-glorification? 
  G. Kryuchkov answered my question with a question: "And why 
should we make this into Yaroslavna's wailing?" 
  As if he did not know himself what happens when one fails to 
notice even a small splinter in time. Was the lesson learned not 
enough, all the more so because, by all signs, the leftist 
forces are preparing to play the role of Old Man Mazay in order 
to rescue our motley democracy?

<F P=106> [Interview with Vyacheslav Chornovil, chairman of People's </F>
Rukh of Ukraine, by Andrey Derepa and Dmitriy Ponomarchuk, 
Rukh-press; place and date not given: "During the First Round We 
Won Some Back But We Did Not Lose"] 
  [Text] 
  [Rukh-press] How do you feel about the accusations from the 
anticommunist camp that Rukh has violated the convention with 
its fellow democrats and struck out on its own during the 
elections? 
  [Chornovil] On the contrary. Each party nominated its own 
candidates. We are accused of ignoring the agreement and 
printing up our own list of candidates. That is not true. We 
looked for an agreement with each district and achieved one with 
some districts. In places where we did not reach an agreement we 
did indeed publish our own list. Many other parties did this as 
well. But our list included not only Rukh members but also 
Konstantin Morozov, Volodymyr Lanovyy, and certain members of 
the URP [Ukrainian Republic Party]... 
  From Vyacheslav Chornovil's speech at the Rukh meeting 
on 16 April: 
  "Our modest results seem more significant against the 
background of the collapse of other noncommunist parties. The 
URP, which ran almost as many candidates in the elections as we 
did, gained only nine mandates, the PDVU [Party of Democratic 
Revival of Ukraine]--five, the Democratic Party--three, Peasant 
Democrats--the same, and Social Democrats--two. And the leaders 
of all these parties except the Democratic Party lost. And if 
the loss of certain parties can be explained by the embryonic 
stage of their existence and their lack of ramified structures, 
the losses of the structurally stronger organizations with KNDS 
[Committee of National Democratic Forces] leanings must be 
attributed to the conciliatory policy of this party's leaders 
toward the ruling postcommunist nomenklatura." 
  [Chornovil] ...at the same time, for example, the nominee 
from the oblast URP conference ran against me. He did not even 
get 1 percent. This fact in itself is instructive because the 
Rukh conferences did not run candidates against either the 
chairman of the URP, Mykhaylo Horyn, or against the leaders of 
other parties included in the democratic association Ukraina. 
  It is clear to everyone today that this association was 
created out of one political force--the so-called KNDS, the 
nucleus of which is the URP. This party rallied around itself 
organizations which had no influence on the elections, but it 
wanted very much to create the appearance of a large association. 
  Demonstrating our desire for unity and hoping that common 
sense will win out over ambition, we too joined this 
association. But it turned out that this association needed Rukh 
only for financial aid. As soon as it received this aid, 
everything possible was done to isolate Rukh within the 
framework of this association. 
  The apparatus of Ukraina was formed mainly from URP members. 
They even accepted people we had fired from the Rukh secretariat 
because of their poor work. 
  There were simply scandalous things, such as when they asked 
us to withdraw our strong candidates in favor of certain very 
questionable people. That is, weak but ambitious organizations 
wanted to take advantage of Rukh's structures under the shield 
of the Ukraina association to campaign for candidates who were 
known to be losers. Sometimes URP simply took candidates off the 
street... 
  It was very insulting to see how the association's chairman, 
Levko Lukyanenko, forgetting about his "objectivity" and 
"freedom from party affiliation," traveled to the areas of 
Ternopol or Ivano-Frankov and campaigned for the candidates from 
the URP and against the candidates from Rukh, slinging mud all 
over me: Do not think about voting for so and so because he will 
be on Chornovil's team, and Chornovil is in favor of the 
collapse of the state and for two state languages. And what 
then? After this kind of "campaigning" the chairman of the 
oblast URP organization, who had a certain chance, lost to our 
candidate Andrey Zarudnyy. 
  [Rukh-press] Do you agree that Galicia produced almost 15 
votes from the extreme right? 
  [Chornovil] Not 15. The Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists 
[KUN] ran under right-wing nationalist slogans, thinking they 
stood to gain something from that. But the KUN has repeatedly 
announced its support for democratic nationalism. So barely 
seven deputies from the KUN can be regarded as at the extreme 
right. Actually, there will be only six extreme right-wingers in 
the Supreme Council--three from the UNA-UNSO [Ukrainian National 
Assembly-Ukrainian National Self-Defense] and two from the UKRP 
(Stepan Khmara and another Khmara supporter, and even he is 
fairly moderate). 
  On the other hand, Galicia produced a fair number of 
moderate 
candidates. The largest numbers of mandates were received by 
candidates from Rukh--Yaroslav Kendzyor, Mikhail Kosiv, Oleh 
Lavrinovich, Les Tanyuk, Bogdan Boyko, Boris Kozhin, Andrey 
Zarudnyy, and others. 
  Both Ihor Yukhnovskyy and Viktor Pynzenyk were elected in 
Galicia along with other centrist politicians. 
  [Rukh-press] Repeat elections will be held in 112 districts. 
Do you hold out the hope that the democratic forces will still 
unite in order to acquire approximately 10 more mandates? 
  [Chornovil] We must look at things realistically. What are 
"democratic forces"? If democracy is a matter of bringing one 
another to our knees then I am against it. We have already 
exhibited that kind of "democracy".... 
  [Rukh-press] Radio Liberty and UTN have reported that you 
supported Ivan Plyushch's candidacy for the post of president... 
  [Chornovil] This "gift" was foisted off on us by the 
Ukrainian service of Radio Liberty without checking the 
information received from Russian sources. We have not supported 
anyone yet. Rukh did not nominate its own candidate since it 
considers presidential elections unnecessary until the functions 
and status of the president are determined. Incidentally, it is 
apparent from the elections to the Supreme Council that we can 
significantly influence the course of the presidential campaign. 
We not only put through 30 of our own candidates but also 
stopped several dozen of the most odious communist candidates, 
sometimes at the price of allowing our own candidates to lose... 
  From Vyacheslav Chornovil's speech at the Rukh meeting 
on 16 April: 
  "I think that today the most dangerous enemies of the 
Ukrainian state and hence enemies of Rukh are not even the 
communists, who are living out their historical age through 
inertia, fed by the blind social protest of the eastern regions. 
Our biggest enemy today is the Interregional Reform Bloc [MBR] 
headed by Kuchma-Grinev, who are not yet very well known to 
everyone. 
  They are closely linked to the local nomenklatura, they 
have funds and support, including propaganda, from Russia, and 
they exploit pro-Russian slogans, which are very popular in the 
eastern part of Ukraine today. Finally, they have a leader who 
knows what he wants: to seize power. And when it comes to this 
they have no concern about either methods or people, surrounding 
themselves with people who are not without talent but who are 
cynical and greedy and who would sell not only Ukraine but even 
their own mothers for the sake of Mammon and power. 
  In a year or two this political force, which is not 
very appreciable today (incidentally, its leader is bucking for 
the presidency...) could become the strongest anti-Ukrainian 
grouping in our state. And we must oppose this MBR wave, like 
the communists, today, since tomorrow will be too late." 
  [Rukh-press] Many people accuse you of being on the side of 
Leonid Kravchuk, who is also against early presidential 
elections... 
  [Chornovil] Is it not possible for our positions to converge 
at some point? This still does not mean that we are not in 
opposition to the president. It is simply that Kravchuk is 
thinking correctly in this case. His motives are another matter. 
He does not want to leave his chair and we do not want to fight 
for an empty chair. Nobody has abolished the laws of formal 
logic. Either for Kravchuk or for Chornovil. 
  ...But--it is not the same for me.

<F P=106> [Article by Oleh Shmid: "Ivan Plyushch Is Forced To Choose </F>
Between a Tomtit and a Crane. Both Birds Are in the Sky.* The 
Bloc of Communists and Socialists Intend To Elect Their Own 
Candidate to the Post of Chairman of the Supreme Council. This 
Could Be Ruslan Bodelan or Borys Oliynyk or Oleksandr Moroz"] 
  [Text] The leftist forces have ultimately agreed to form a 
single faction in the new Supreme Council. This became clear 
from the consultations held throughout the week following 
elections among the initiatory groups made up of newly elected 
members of parliament from the Communist, Socialist, and Peasant 
parties. Former Agriculture Ministers Tkachenko is responsible 
for organizing the agrarian faction. This means that the two to 
three dozen collective farm chairmen, who by tradition were 
being sorted out in political circles as one of the branches of 
the "party of power," will be hammered together in parliamentary 
style into a collective-state-farm tractor designed to ram 
through the decisions of Communist-oriented deputies. If the 
agrarian lobby is persuaded to do the same work it did in the 
last Supreme Council, the faction of ideologically committed 
Communists, which numbers 120 members, will be short of only 20 
votes in their attempt to squeeze the whole country back into 
the same tube from which it has just begun to slowly emerge. 
  The Red bloc is openly set on revanche. While in the 
preceding Supreme Council, the Communists were prepared to 
retreat step by step and gradually give up their symbols, 
command-administrative system, councils, and laws, their sole 
desire now is to bring all these things back. For the near 
future, the situation in the country will depend on their 
appetite and the pace at which this revanche is carried out. The 
simplest solution would be not to stand in the way of the 
Communists' passion to return to 1991 at one stroke -- the 
objective laws of economics would inish the Marxist movement 
within half a year. The problem is that these same laws could 
just as easily finish the state. 
  If, however, the leftist forces have among them a few 
politicians capable of dragging out the extinction of the 
communists as a class over a longer period of time, they will 
urge their group to agree to a broad-based coalition government 
and even invite several national-democrats to join this 
government in order to divide equally with them the 
responsibility for the collapse of the state. This could be a 
mosaic cabinet of ministers, headed by a compromise figure (for 
example, Roman Shpek, the current minister of the economy), in 
which the reformers will sparkle like ornaments on a dried-up 
Christmas tree. It would be a fatal mistake for the democrats to 
agree to such a government. Compromises of this sort are the 
ones that result in the greatest disillusionment for the people. 
The electorate must understand that a Red parliament -- if it is 
not impotent -- cannot elect a national-democratic government. 
  However, the mood among Communists attests to something 
else: 
the Leninists want revanche rather than to discredit anybody. 
They feel strong enough to seat their own man in the chair of 
the chairman of the Supreme Council, to elect their own 
Presidium, to appoint the head of government, and to put forward 
their own candidate for president. While Petro Symonenko 
promises to use his candidacy as a means to advertise the 
incompatibility between the institution of the presidency and 
the platform of the CPU and at the decisive moment to renounce 
the fight for the office of the president in favor of an 
ideologically likeminded claimant, the other potential 
candidates from the leftist camp -- Borys Oliynyk and Oleksandr 
Moroz -- have yet to say the same. Although the latter two are 
also among the claimants to the Supreme Council chairman's 
microphone. Under the present laws and existing trends, the most 
powerful person in the country for the near future will be the 
speaker. And the Red members of parliament have the best chance 
to seat their own man in this chair. 
  Orthodox Communists will not forego the opportunity to 
remind 
Ivan Plyushch of his passivity when the Presidium of the Supreme 
Council banned the CPU. The most exacting counts show that today 
Plyushch can obtain only 160 votes in parliament. This number is 
insufficient to allow him to regain his favorite chair. Ivan 
Plyushch's closest associates are urging the former 
parliamentary leader to try his luck in the presidential 
election. Thus, even as I write these words about Ivan 
Stepanovych, Ivan Stepanovych is probably making up his mind. 
His decision will unquestionably be in favor of running for 
president. On 15 May, when the deputies gather for their first 
session, all of them will already know that Ivan Plyushch is a 
candidate for the office of president of Ukraine. Should the 
former chairman of the Supreme Council be tempted to put up 
another fight for his "microphone," his new status will lose him 
an additional 20-30 votes. 
  I am far from believing that one of the ideologically 
committed "Reds" will succeed in winning the speaker's chair. 
They will be chronically short of about 15 votes. However, after 
Oleksandr Moroz and Borys Oliynyk are defeated, for want of 
anyone else, someone will propose Ruslan Bodelan, the chairman 
of the Odessa Oblast Council -- a man of openly leftist 
orientation, albeit not a member of either the CPU or the 
Socialist Party of Ukraine [SPU]. Bodelan will be able to pick 
up the 10-15 votes that the Red faction lacks in order to elect 
their own candidate. The danger of this prospect lies in the 
fact that today the speaker is half the parliament. If the 
speaker's job goes to a candidate of the leftist forces, Ukraine 
will be rid of the institution of the presidency, and parliament 
will probably form a "Red" government headed by former Prime 
Minister Vitaliy Masol and take over the National Bank. And 
everyone will become equal again. Just like before... 
  But there are also other, more optimistic prospects. These 
involve the national-democratic camp and consist in the fact 
that the democrats have no prospects of their own. They must 
therefore link all their prospects with the "party of power." 
This is somewhat embarrassing in light of the image of the 
latter. The democrats are compelled to stake all their chances 
for success in parliament on one person -- Plyushch, who, 
moreover, will probably want to make an attempt at winning the 
presidential throne. All candidates from the democratic front 
for the office of chairman of the Supreme Council are doomed to 
failure, if only because the national-democrats will find it 
difficult to agree on a compromise candidate. The best solution 
for the democrats in this ituation would be to form an alliance 
with that segment of the "party of power" that supports Ivan 
Plyushch, or even Kravchuk, and try to seat Ivan Stepanovych in 
his old chair, first persuading him that he would be better off 
with the "first microphone in the land" than with the status of 
the English queen. If this proves successful, they could try to 
play their own game in the presidential election. Past 
experience in such matters, as well as the unpredictability of 
action and differences among the democrats give us reason to 
conclude that up to now the democratic forces have found it 
easier to agree to support a political figure from outside the 
democratic camp than to reach a compromise amongst themselves. 
However, the periodic nature of repeating the same mistakes over 
and over again should finally lead them to realize that such 
compromise figures could be found among economists who are not 
overly involved in politics. There are not many such people in 
Ukraine: they are Volodymyr Lanovyy, Viktor Pynzenyk, and 
Volodymyr Pylypchuk. Standing aside from politics, these 
reformist economists, who are prepared to assume responsibility 
for economic changes, could become a bridge between the two 
disparate halves of Ukraine and take many votes away from Leonid 
Kuchma. This would be an ideal solution for the 
national-democrats. Otherwise, they will have to trail in the 
wake of the "party of power," singing in tune with either 
Plyushch or Kravchuk, which could end in a total fiasco for the 
national-democratic idea in Ukraine if neither wins the election. 
  P.S. An unfortunate error occurred in issue No. 11 
of POST-POSTUP (15-21 April). In an article entitled "The 
Supreme Council. A Spectral Analysis," Mr. Smyrnov, the newly 
elected deputy from the Tulchyn Electoral District in Vinnytsya 
Oblast, was included among the predicted parliamentary faction 
of Communists. In reality, Mr. Smyrnov is an independent deputy, 
who is an anticommunist and a former political prisoner. 
POST-POSTUP apologizes to Mr. Smyrnov for any moral damage he 
may have suffered because of this article. 
  * [This title is a play on the Ukrainian proverb "a tomtit 
in 
hand is better than a crane in the sky" which is analogous to 
the English "a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."]

"Cuckoo, Cuckoo, How Long Will I Live?..."] 
  [Text] Something bad must be in the wind for the fate 
of the newly elected parliament if Larisa Skoryk does not want 
to subject herself to a repeat vote. Instead, she intends to try 
to catch the pernicious bird. 
  Regarding the bird (the cuckoo, in particular)--this is a 
quote from the angry verbiage unleashed by Larisa Pavlovna at a 
postelection press conference in Lviv. As most of those who lost 
personally, she is firmly convinced that elections were lost by 
the democratic forces, completely and wholesale. And the party 
at fault for this is the same, in the former deputy's opinion, 
as the one that is always at fault for everything--Chornovil's 
Rukh. With a far-reaching hint at behind-the-scenes intrigues, 
she proposed to "figure out" who was the cuckoo who slipped an 
egg into the friendly democratic nest, which later produced a 
nasty chick who pushed everyone else out of the nest--the Rukh 
Party... 
  The scandal continues in the electoral district where L. 
Skoryk and A. Gudyma (a Rukh candidate) ran. As already 
reported, the district electoral commission invalidated the 
elections. The Central Electoral Commission [CEC] has not yet 
handed down a decision. The Rukh oblast organization adopted a 
statement of no confidence in the head of the district electoral 
commission and is protesting against electing him as commission 
chairman at the upcoming elections of local bodies of authority. 
Meanwhile, Larisa Skoryk and the district commission insist that 
propaganda in favor of the candidate and a put-down of his 
opponent were conducted on television during pre-election 
Saturday, and they are ready to defend this opinion in the 
Supreme Court. Meanwhile, Aleksandr Gudyma has turned to the CBU 
[Ukraine Security Service]: He says that during his absence 
(attending the Rukh congress in Kiev), unknown persons called 
his home and threatened him and his family. 
  The "burp" from the recent elections may add a few unsavory 
details to the above. A claim has been filed in court against 
People's Deputy Mikhail Kosiv. The same district commission of 
the same district believes that he publicly accused it of 
dishonesty. Thereby insulting its honor and dignity. The KUN 
[Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists], meanwhile, is appealing to 
the CEC, questioning the results of elections in another 
district... Rukh's ill-fated television broadcast has brushed a 
KUN candidate as well. The most interesting part is that there 
actually is a winner in this district, and not just anybody, but 
Rukh's deputy head Aleksandr Lavronovych. 
  Based on the above, it seems questionable that any real bloc 
of more or less centrist, more or less democratic forces will be 
fielded at the local elections. Nevertheless, right now the need 
for this is being proclaimed rather loudly. People who have 
tried so hard not to quarrel with extremists have finally 
stooped to using phrases like "extreme right danger," and so on. 
The local Rukh and oblast authorities said this. They said it 
frankly. There are reasons, they said: imperial-communist, 
national-democratic, and extreme right. And while in the eastern 
part of Ukraine the situation is defined by the confrontation 
between the first and the second, in the western part it is 
between the second and the third. It has been said. Albeit a 
little late... 
  The "heroes" of UNA-UNSO [Ukrainian National 
Assembly-Ukrainian National Self-Defense], who acquired 
legitimacy thanks to breaking into the deputy ranks, called up a 
rally a few days ago. They exhorted the voters to come to the 
local elections under the juicy slogan: "UNA to power, UNSO--go 
storming, traitors to be impaled on a spike!" Rallies are not in 
fashion today. So this one, much like the others, only featured 
a gathering of a small group of, to put it mildly, customarily 
unbalanced persons. But that is not the point. The authorities 
of our fantastic state are still doing something 
incomprehensible. For instance, law enforcement organs of 
Zhitomir and Lviv in tandem whipped up a case: A year ago UNSO 
member Pavlyuk knocked off some protruding parts from Lenin's 
monument in a factory garden in Zhitomir. Now he is being 
extradited with fanfare from Lviv to the site of commission of 
the crime. Here he is, a ready hero-martyr so much needed by the 
Bolshevik movement; here it is--a case one can milk emotionally 
for a long time... The funny part is that numerous 
transgressions by these goons that do indeed require punishment 
have gone unpunished. While a semi-anecdotal, outdated both in 
terms of timing and subject, is being blown out of proportion. 
Complete stupidity? Or, on the contrary, design? 
  The local elections in Galicia promise to be tense. As to 
the 
second round of elections in three "open" Supreme Council 
districts, there is one almost-sensation. At the aforementioned 
press conference Larisa Skoryk suddenly said that she would not 
run for a second time even if she were granted such right in the 
event the elections in her district are deemed invalid. She is 
so unhappy with those already elected that she decided to follow 
the Bible: Blessed is he who does not go to the council of the 
profane... There is a temptation to explain this away as a 
woman's emotional outburst, but would such an explanation not be 
too frivolous? Lady Larisa is a person who is extremely close to 
presidential circles. Just yesterday she conducted her campaign 
with energy and drive. What has changed? Has someone made the 
decision that the new Supreme Council is stillborn anyway?...

"Results of the `President-94' Survey: In Choosing the President 
of Ukraine, Oblast Workers Give Preference to Simonenko and 
Kuchma"] 

    [Text] Of survey participants, 24.1 percent, that is, one 
out of four, are ready to vote in the presidential elections for 
Leonid Kuchma, the former prime minister and currently a 
people's deputy of Ukraine. 
  Another 20.7 percent have firmly decided to vote for making 
Petr Simonenko, head of the Communist party of Ukraine and 
Ukraine's people's deputy, the head of state. 
  People's Deputy of Ukraine Vyacheslav Chornovil ranked third 
in popularity among voters who participated in the survey. He 
got 13.8 percent of the vote. 
  Yefim Zvyahilskyy, acting prime minister and a people's 
deputy of Ukraine, also received a rather high rating (11 
percent). 
  Vladimir Grinev, former deputy chairman of the Supreme 
Council and currently a people's deputy of Ukraine, is supported 
by 10.4 percent of the voters. 
  Seven percent of the voters see the socialists' leader and 
People's Deputy Aleksandr Moroz as the future president of 
Ukraine. According to survey results, 3.4 percent of respondents 
give their preference to the current President of Ukraine Leonid 
Kravchuk. 
  The same percentage of respondents wrote in People's Deputy 
Viktor Pynzenyk, who was not included in the main list... 
  What was the main factor in the readers' choices? To answer 
this question, let us look at the opinions expressed in letters. 
Naturally, newspaper space does not permit us to quote all the 
mail we received in connection with the "President-94" survey. 
But the letters we quote below will probably be indicative 
enough for the voters and politicians to draw conclusions. 
  (In quoting from the letters, we have retained the authors' 
style and spelling.) 
  "We are pensioners; our life is not that sweet; we follow 
the 
situation in independent Ukraine, read the press, although it is 
very expensive, and follow the work of politicians and the 
parliament. In our choice of candidate for president we will 
give our vote without hesitation to Leonid Danilovich Kuchma. He 
is a worthy candidate of his people. He is honest, fair, and is 
not stained with stealing. He attempted to unmask thieves, such 
as enterprise directors..., for which he was punished by 
President Kravchuk. We believe that L.D. Kuchma will be able to 
lead Ukraine out of the crisis, impose order and discipline. 
Respectfully, pensioners Tvardovskiy, Dzerzhinsk." 
  "I talked to the residents of our apartment building, dear 
comrades, and the majority of them said that if there are going 
to be several names on the ballot in the Ukrainian presidential 
elections, then people said that I should write to you that we 
would vote for Leonid Kuchma. When I asked them why Kuchma, they 
could not answer. So it is for Kuchma. His idea was, and he 
tried, to change everything for the benefit of the people, using 
his powers. Respectfully, N. Babenko, Kirovskoye." 
  "I do not have time, I am in a hurry, but I will reply. I 
vote for Leonid Kuchma or Vladimir Grinev. Why? They represent 
the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, are the only 
sensible people of all the ones listed. Had the Supreme Council 
consisted of sensible people, perhaps we would not need the 
institution of the presidency. And if we had a competent, 
farsighted president, he would have governed the Supreme Council 
well, directed them along the right course. T., Donetsk." 
  "We, pensioners from Shakhtersk, are answering your survey. 
We will vote for Leonid Kuchma. Why? Because he advocated unity 
with Russia and we have nothing to quarrel with them about; our 
brothers, children, and parents are there; we do not need 
bloodshed like Karabakh. Not like one fool who spoke on the tube 
for the Ukrainian language, cut one's finger--he should have his 
tongue cut out, this is better. We do not know his name. Our 
state needs to have a president, to protect our interests, but 
not like L. Kravchuk protects... interests. We do not need to 
divide the fleet, it is all people's property. This is our 
opinion." 
  "Dear AKTSENT! I did not want to write, but I am sick and 
tired of watching and listening to all sorts of nonsense. You 
are asking about presidential candidates. And this Chornovil 
from Rukh yells right away: Do not let the communists into 
power. Why? How long can we listen to them? They do not pay any 
attention to our hardworking Donbass [Donetsk Basin]. All one 
hears is: Canada, Poland, Romania; as to Russia, it is as if it 
does not exist. We are fingers on the same hand. Our children 
are in Russia. So how can we not vote for the communists? Let it 
be Simonenko. But no way "bandery" [Ukrainian nationalists]. For 
Simonenko! Because we want to live in peace and for our children 
to have a future. L. Kravchuk. L. Kuchma, V. Chornovil, I. 
Plyushch, S. Khmara, and Ye. Zvyahilskyy should not be placed on 
the list of presidential candidates under any circumstances! 
They should be kicked out... If there is to be a presidential 
system in our state, I personally can only trust P. Simonenko 
and A. Moroz. Only communists are capable of leading the country 
from the dead end--the deep economic crisis. I have always 
trusted and will trust communists. Our state does not need a 
president. It is quite enough for us to have a Supreme Council 
and a Cabinet of Ministers. We do not need an additional staff 
of presidential loafers. Respectfully, L.N. Granitnoye, 
Telmanovskiy Rayon." 
  "If the names you listed are put on the ballot in Ukrainian 
presidential elections, our sympathies are on the side of Petr 
Simonenko and Leonid Kuchma. We do not need a president like 
Kravchuk. We need to bring back the Soviet Union. We are waiting 
for this. I., Donetsk Oblast." 
  "Dear editors. Forgive me for my illiteracy, I only attended 
school for a year and a half. Dear editors, I and all my 
relatives and my whole family we only recognize as future 
president-94 and will vote for Simonenko or Kuchma. Kuchma 
always was and is for people, while Kravchuk is for America and 
we do not need people like him. We need those who are for Soviet 
people. Simonenko we respect because he is a real communist not 
like other candidates, who said I am not a party member. Had he 
not been a party member, he would not have reached such a 
throne. We will vote for these people, and all others are not 
worthy to be president, they took a wonderful life away from us 
and instead gave us a concentration camp, the only difference is 
that we are not behind barbed wire but like this. Real leaders, 
all the dirt they did they dump on Kuchma. Without Kuchma we do 
not have such prices as bread for 28 kopeks and milk for 20 
kopeks. Why did they not give us back without Kuchma everything 
that had cost kopeks. They are shameless bazaar women. Soviet 
power gave them free education and such jobs. And they have 
fouled it up. Stalin was right that he sent to Kolyma all 
"bandery." They are afraid of communists. Ts., Kuchayevsk." 
  "If there is a God in this world, the president's job, if he 
is to be elected, should go to a truly honest man, 
patriot-communist Petr Simonenko. Respectfully, not a party 
member but in my heart with the communists, Vasiliy Vasilyevich 
Frostal, Donetsk." 
  "I want to take part in the survey because I am not 
indifferent to the fate of my motherland--Ukraine. I am writing 
in Russian so that our brothers--the Russians--can read this. 
Dear people, what have we come to--we have walked into a dead 
end, into a labyrinth, and do not know how to get out, although 
there seem to be smart people in Ukraine. Why was it necessary 
to destroy the Soviet Union, one big friendly family? Who is now 
our "father"?--President Leonid Makarovich Kravchuk. He is a 
good man. But he is cunning, and when he begins to dodge in his 
speeches--beware. I have a been a Komsomol [All-Union Leninist 
Communist Youth League] member since I was 18; I have been a 
member of the Communist Party since 1976. I have not surrendered 
my party card, and all good communists have remained in its 
ranks, those who are communists at heart; it is not our fault 
that former leaders of our party turned out to be traitors, and 
now they have become turncoats and live in clover. At the 
election meeting I asked candidates for deputy to resolve in the 
parliament the question of reunification with Russia and 
Belorussia. They are Slavic peoples. The language is 
understandable for everyone, we are of the same faith, or at 
least let us make one ruble zone, because one cannot even buy 
mineral water in Ilovaysk from speculators for our coupons, they 
demand Russian rubles. This is how it is. If the people you 
listed are to be put on the ballot, I would vote for Petr 
Simonenko, because under the communists bread cost 24 kopeks, 
and an envelope--6 kopeks, not 430 karbovantsy. Anyway, dear 
comrades, maybe we do not particularly need a president, this 
will create dual power, I think. We have elected a parliament, 
the people elected it, so let the parliament decide everything, 
carry out the will of the people. I am 57. A pensioner. A 
communist--posthumously [as published]. Your newspaper is very 
good, I mean it. I am a regular reader, S.G.G., Aleksandrovskiy 
Rayon." 
  "I would very much like to see Vyacheslav Chornovil as 
president. Here is why. A president must love Ukraine and then 
he would do everything so that Ukraine would be rich and its 
people would live well. What is happening now is that the people 
we have elected expend their energy (like Charodeyev) on 
symbols, on two state languages. For us, ordinary people, it 
does not matter what kind of flag we have, just let us live 
decent life--by the way, the yellow and blue flag is pretty. 
Since there is a state, let there be our own flag. And also, do 
not offend other nationalities: Why do some deputies insist on 
Russian as a state language, there are many Greeks, Jews, and 
others living in Donbass. How are they worse than Russians? 
There should be one language--state language, Ukrainian. And all 
the deputies should be able to speak it, they are smart, instead 
of creating clashes and inciting interethnic strife. We all want 
to live in peace and live well. As to the president, we need 
one. Goodbye. S.A. Tregub, Donetsk." 
  "Although I am not knowledgeable about politics, I decided 
to 
take part in the survey. Of the names you listed, I consider V. 
Chornovil the most appropriate candidate. I voted for him in 
previous elections, since he was the only candidate who insisted 
on disbanding the parliament, and the appropriateness of this 
demand has been confirmed many times with the passage of time. I 
cannot judge whether the office of president is needed, since I 
have not read the draft of the constitution and do not know what 
powers are vested in him. Everything depends on what powers he 
will have. We do not need a "ceremonial" president as Kravchuk 
was. By the way, tell us about the powers of the proposed 
president--this would be very useful. And also: If there is no 
president, who will have more power--the prime minister or the 
parliament? A., Donetsk." 
  "In the previous survey you joyfully, on the front page, 
printed the results of the survey, in which Donbass said "No to 
Nationalism" and "Yes to Socialism." This is exactly what 
transpired in the elections on 27 March and 10 April. And what 
good is there in this? Our Donbass has disgraced itself in front 
of the whole world. That we said "no" to nationalism is good. 
But let us look at who our people gave their votes to. To 
communists-fascists. Why do I say this? Everybody remembers the 
events of 3-4 October in Moscow; they walked there shoulder to 
shoulder in closed ranks--Nazis, communists, and fascists. So I 
ask you: "Who was it our people voted for in the final 
analysis?" For those who fooled us for 76 years and are still 
fooling us; those who have destroyed millions of innocent 
people. This criminal communist regime deserves a second 
Nuremberg trial. I will vote for Vyacheslav Chornovil, because 
in my opinion he is the person who can launch a market reform. 
Until our people learn to separate the truth from dirty lies, 
there will be a dark night over Donbass for a long time. V.I. 
Shostak. Miner, 37 years old. Ukrainsk." 
  "I would elect V.V. Chornovil to the job of the head of 
state, Why? First: Everyone else, with the exception of S. 
Khmara, is of a communist orientation, communists, whom I do not 
trust. Second, Chornovil is a brave and decisive person when it 
comes to implementing market reforms, and please do not label 
him "nationalist" in the bad sense of this word. Does our state 
need a president? Yes, it does! As to the soviets, they need to 
be liquidated. V.P., Russian, Konstantinovka." 
  "I am answering your survey. Of this list, I would vote for 
Yefim Zvyahilskyy and Kuchma. Behind them is a classic schooling 
in Donbass--the hardest region in Ukraine. They raise the issue 
of stopping the downward slide. They occupy priority directions 
and will be filled [as published] with positive solutions. They 
raise the issue of implementing reforms for the sake of the 
people, not at the expense of impoverishing citizens, and 
especially implementing reforms in the coal industry. 
Peace-loving foreign policy, primacy of human rights, solid 
protection of citizens from criminals, and many other things we 
associate with the notion of normal life. P.D. Melbrod, Torez." 
  "I would vote for Yefim Zvyahilskyy. He got the economy 
moving for the better. My thanks to him! As to our state, it 
needs a president. I like presidents of capitalist countries and 
their senate (parliament), and I want so much for them to live 
for the country instead of their own shirt, as our president and 
the former parliament did. Galina Mitich, Yenakhiyevo." 
  "Dear editors! I would like Ye. Zvyahilskyy to become 
president, because this man does not just talk--he acts; because 
of all the people who have been in power in independent Ukraine 
after Shcherbitskiy, he is the only one who has been able to 
sharply bring down the rate of inflation. I understand that the 
next necessary step is to stimulate truly needed and important 
and vital enterprises of all forms of ownership. I think 
Zvyahilskyy understands this too. To the best of my knowledge, 
he is not at all a fool. Of course, he is, as they say, not a 
charismatic leader at all (that is, to put it simply, he lacks 
charm). Well, so what, Thatcher also was like this and this did 
not keep her from pulling England out of the crisis. I do not 
know whether this is appropriate in answering this survey, but I 
want to say that in Kravchuk, too, I see not only negative 
traits. He is intelligent and flexible; he is not a chauvinist 
and not dogmatic, which one could easily expect of the second 
secretary of the Communist Party of Ukraine. He does not react 
fast enough to the fast-changing reality. And this has 
contributed--wittingly or unwittingly--to the impoverishment of 
Ukraine and all of us. Respectfully, G.I. Chizhina, 61 years 
old, Donetsk." 
  "I personally will vote for Leonid Makarovich Kravchuk. 
During the first elections I voted for Kravchuk without 
hesitation. I believe that we need only a strong presidential 
authority. Let it even be a dictatorial form in the beginning. 
Our people need to be taught to work and be responsible for 
their actions. So far our people are a pack, and they need a 
strong leader. At this point I do not see a better president for 
us than Kravchuk. I personally am against early presidential 
elections. Why throw away money? Better invest this money in 
health care and science. With all my respect, Valentina 
Vasilyevna Zhdanova." 
  "I believe that V. Chornovil should become the president of 
Ukraine. This man and politician has integrity, is honest, and 
is a man of action. The intelligentsia supports his position. 
Although for some reason I am convinced that Ukraine, especially 
the communist Donetsk Oblast, Lugansk Oblast, and Crimea, will 
elect such a candidate that the whole world will laugh at 
Ukraine. I believe that we need a president. We cannot place all 
the authority in the hands of our unprofessional Supreme 
Council. N.K., Gorlovka." 
  Well, another readers' survey is behind us. The results of 
political contests in the oblast completely confirmed the trends 
revealed by our two previous surveys. How will it be this time? 
  One may say that AKTSENT already has held its presidential 
elections. The political leaders and their teams are just 
launching their election campaign. We can already see the gap 
between what readers-voters confidentially tell us in their 
letters and what is happening these days at enterprises and 
organizations. Despite-- judging by the results of the 
survey--the extremely low current rating of Ivan Plyushch, he 
was nominated as a presidential candidate in the proletarian 
bastion of Donetsk--Kirovskiy Rayon, at the Imeni Abakumova 
mine. Time will tell whether the results of our survey will burn 
up in the flames of miners' hot love for the speaker. President 
Kravchuk said last week that he does not wish to participate in 
the elections--he believes that working people do not want to 
elect a head of state if they are given such a compressed time 
frame. On Tuesday this week, however, he was nominated as a 
presidential candidate in Slavyansk. Local collectives took the 
initiative, in particular, the Farko production-cooperative 
association. It is not known whether or not the elections will 
be held on 26 June, but just in case, as they say, it does not 
hurt to be nominated in a timely fashion. Political reserves do 
not burden the pocket. And this is considering that the 
popularity of the current president--again, according to the 
survey--in our oblast is extremely low... 
  The nomination of candidates, the actions of politicians and 
their teams are proceeding along the old blueprints, which is 
quite normal for our land of workers and peasants... Everything 
repeats itself: Apricots are in bloom in Donbass, and socialist 
democracy is blossoming again in all its splendor. Before you 
know it, harvest time will be here...

<F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Economic Sciences Yelena Shkanova </F>
and Yuriy Nikolayev, associates of the Management small research 
and implementation enterprise, under the rubric "The Trade 
Sector: Across the Borders": "Ukraine: The Exchange Is Like a 
Barge--It Will Drift Somewhere"] 
  [Text] According to data from the Ministry of Statistics of 
Ukraine, the number of exchanges fell by 20 percent in 1993. At 
present, there are 72 of them, but only 41 exchanges are 
actually in operation. The number of brokerage offices also 
diminished. At the beginning of the year, 90 brokerage offices 
were registered at each exchange on the average whereas by the 
end of the year--only 60. 
  Based on the results of the [as published] nine months of 
1993, the volume of transactions concluded on the exchanges of 
Ukraine exceeded 300 billion karbovantsy. Products, goods, 
services, and real estate worth 6.8 trillion karbovantsy were 
put up for sale. The liquidity coefficient came to 4.6 percent 
during this period. 
  If we characterize the structure of the exchange trade in 
the 
republic, real estate, transportation vehicles, quotas 
(licenses) to export products out of Ukraine, and fuel accounted 
for the largest proportion. The growth of the volume of 
transactions involving transportation vehicles was due to the 
fact that the exchanges were granted the right to sell the 
assets of state enterprises, including used motor vehicles. For 
this reason, transportation vehicles worth a total of 46 billion 
karbovantsy were sold through the exchanges in the third quarter 
alone. 
  A fuel shortage and the regulatory influence of the 
government caused a change in the dynamics of transactions 
involving these products. In the first quarter, the greatest 
volume of transactions was effected--approximately 30 billion 
karbovantsy worth. In the second quarter, virtually no fuel was 
sold because of rigid restrictions on its exportation beyond the 
borders of Ukraine and a sharp rise in wholesale prices for 
energy resources in May. In the third quarter, the sale of fuel 
through the exchanges went down by a factor of five (in value 
terms) compared to the first quarter. In 1993, 10 times less 
coal than during the corresponding period of 1992 was sold on 
one of the largest exchanges of Ukraine, the Donetsk "South" 
Regional Commodity, Raw-Material, and Fuel Exchange. 
  In the third quarter, the volume of transactions on the 
Ukrainian exchanges increased by a factor of 2.8 compared to the 
first quarter. In particular, 22 times more transportation 
vehicles (in value terms), 17 times more chemicals, seven times 
more construction materials, four times more metal and metal 
products, two times more nonferrous metals, 3.5 times more real 
estate, and three times more consumer goods were sold. Yet, 40 
percent fewer transactions involving credit resources were 
concluded. However, does this indicate a pickup in exchange 
trading? Of course, it does not. The point is that this is due 
solely to an increase in the exchange prices for products. By 
the end of the year, prices had increased by a factor of 12 for 
a comparable assortment of 42 key exchange-traded goods. The 
volume of exchanges in natural units declined several fold 
compared to 1992. In the immediate future, an increase in the 
volume of sales may apparently be expected only in the cases of 
the sale of real estate and state enterprise property. The 
exchanges have selected real estate as the main area of their 
specialization in the environment of hyperinflation, proceeding 
from the desire of the population and commercial structures to 
invest monetary funds in real estate. 
  Exchanges operate in virtually all oblasts of Ukraine, with 
the exception of Zhytomir and Sumy Oblasts. However, the bulk of 
the transactions are concluded on the exchanges of Kiev (69 
percent), Poltava (10.7 percent), Kharkov (6.5 percent), Donetsk 
(4.6 percent), and Dnepropetrovsk (2.2 percent) Oblasts. Trading 
on other exchanges is not large and accounts for 7 percent of 
the entire volume. The exchanges of Kiev are mostly geared 
toward noncommodity transactions. Thus, between 87 and 100 
percent of transactions involving credit resources, quotas 
(licenses), real estate, and securities are concluded on the 
exchanges of Kiev. Transactions involving nonferrous metals, the 
volume of which ranges between 72 and 75 percent of the volume 
of exchange transactions in the republic, are the exception. At 
the same time, 93 percent of transactions involving foodstuffs, 
67 percent of transactions involving computer and office 
equipment, and 50 percent of transactions involving cable 
products are effected on the exchanges in Donetsk Oblast. 
  Few exchanges facilitating an increase in the turnaround of 
merchandise remain in Ukraine. As a rule, an overwhelming 
majority of companies trade in real estate and other 
noncommodity stocks--quotas, licenses, credit resources, 
securities. This is a direct consequence of hyperinflation. The 
current status of exchange trading reflects the overall 
situation in the economy of Ukraine: Markets for sales are being 
lost; enterprises have excessive inventories; the payment and 
energy crises are not dying down. Under the circumstances, only 
a few exchanges can retain the specialization they selected.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Babenko, TORGOVAYA GAZETA correspondent, </F>
under the rubric "Ukraine": "Prices Are Not Stinging Any More, 
They Are Murderous"] 
  [Text] Dima the hairdresser, whose client I have been for 
many years, finished his fancy manipulations on my head and, 
with many apologies, asked me to pay 50,000 karbovantsi for a 
regular haircut. 
  "What can you do?" complained the hairdresser with a touch 
of 
melancholy. "Such wild expenses for rent, water and sewage, 
electricity..." 
  Generally speaking, the March prices in Kiev defy all 
description. I made a tour of the neighboring food stores and, 
within some 30 minutes, dropped 100,000 karbovantsi. Here it is: 
300 grams of bologna-type sausage for 25,000; the same amount of 
butter for 30,000; 10 eggs for 24,000; five kilos of potatoes 
for 15,000; a liter of milk for 10,000; and two loaves of bread 
for 6,000. 
  The average salary, meanwhile, equals now 763,000 
karbovantsi 
a month in the federal sector, or from 587,000 to 362,000 in the 
fields of trade, municipal services, education, and health care. 
The prices in Kiev are simply murderous. But even then groceries 
may not cost all that much if we recalculate the prices in 
Russian rubles at the rate of 1 to 23. But in Ukrainian terms 
this is just a nightmare. 
  It is true that prices are terrorizing everybody. At the 
Kiev 
railroad terminal you had better stay away from porters if you 
have less than 100,000 karbovantsi. A ride in a taxi cab used to 
cost five Soviet rubles four years ago, but now it costs 300,000 
karbovantsi already. 
  One can easily guess that the reasons for all this lie on 
the 
surface. According to the official data of the Ukrainian Cabinet 
of Ministers administration for the economy, the amount of 
consumer goods manufactured in January and February of this year 
was 36 percent lower than in the same period of last year, the 
volume of manufactured goods dropped by 41 percent, etc. 
  When she heard about my haircut problems, a friend of mine 
who is a doctor with a candidate's degree in medicine offered to 
perform this service free of charge. Her hair-cutting skill was 
duly appreciated by my relatives and neighbors. A doctor of 
technical sciences whom I had known since our student years told 
me, not without a certain degree of smugness, that he has been 
repairing shoes for a year, and he promised to teach me this 
very profitable trade. 
  Generally, like the people of the besieged Oriental city in 
the legend, the residents of Kiev are not crying any more. They 
are laughing. But very, very bitterly.

  [Text]As Ivan Yehanov, head of the Odessa Regional 
Department of the State Property Fund, stated on 9 April, in the 
first quarter of this year 24 objects in the Odessa region were 
privatized. He also stated that the privatization of the Port 
Plant, of the "Merkuryy" commercial house, and the fishing 
association "Antarktyka" has been announced, and that the 
preparation for the privatization of over 100 other objects is 
going on. 
  In all, in the oblast in 1994, it is planned to privatize 
1,817 objects of minor and 100 of major privatization, belonging 
to municipal property, and also 262 and 250, respectively, 
objects of general state property. 
  The state privatization program for 1994 in the Odessa 
region 
has the highest control indicators in comparison with the other 
oblasts of Ukraine.

"The Ukrainian Government Is Threatened With... Legal Action"] 
  [Text] It is not the first time that the Cabinet of 
Ministers of the republic has declined a Trade Union Federation 
offer to work together to summarize the results of last year's 
pay rate agreement. The Cabinet has cleverly unloaded this work 
onto its commission, which has not been given any authority. It 
is easy to understand this trick: Many of the provisions of the 
agreement have not been honored yet. Among other things, double 
pay for working overtime has not yet been introduced. It is true 
that this issue is not particularly critical for people employed 
by woodworking plants, as they are either idle now or working 
shorter hours. But the fact remains. The mechanism for adjusting 
the minimum pay (which is ridiculously low in Ukraine--just 
60,000 karbovantsi, which is the price of one kilo of 
bologna-type sausage) and pensions to the price index has not 
been introduced either. Last year prices grew by a factor of 60, 
but salaries only 24. 
  Neither was any mutual decision made concerning regulation 
of 
consumption funds. The Government of Ukraine also failed to 
honor other obligations stipulated in the General Agreement on 
pay rates. It does not wish to sign a new agreement for 1994 
either, thus practically paralyzing the work of local trade 
union organizations. 
  This is the reason leaders of associations of trade unions 
representing the timber industry, railroads, Armed Forces, 
Academy of Sciences, and others decided to conduct, together 
with the Cabinet of Ministers, immediate confirmation of the 
agreement results. If the government declines their proposal 
once again, the trade unions will initiate two parallel legal 
actions against it: for failure to implement the agreement and 
for evading a discussion of its results. They will also appeal 
to the International Labor Organization to analyze the actions 
of the Ukrainian Government.

"The Hryvnya Will Replace the Karbovanets"] 
  [Text] Printing of the hryvnya, the Ukrainian national 
currency, has commenced in Kiev. President of Ukraine Leonid 
Kravchuk, acting Prime Minister Yefim Zvyahilskyy, National Bank 
chairman Viktor Yushchenko, and representatives of various 
ministries and agencies attended the opening of the Kiev 
money-printing plant. The hryvnya was issued, as the national 
currency, in Kievan Rus as early as the 10th century; so, one 
may say that it has been reissued in Kiev after quite a 
considerable interval. 
  The Ukrainian president personally opened the ceremony which 
started the technological line. "Only a country with its own 
national currency can be truly independent. Otherwise it becomes 
a branch of some other 'bank,'" the president said during the 
ceremony. 
  It is rather obvious which "bank" Leonid Makarovich had in 
mind. It is also obvious that nobody wants to attract Ukraine 
into the ruble zone even with its new money instead of the old, 
valueless coupons and its state of hyperinflation. So, even if 
Ukraine becomes a branch of another bank, it is not going to be 
the Russian one and no hryvnya will help there. Basically, we 
are talking about replacing, under the conditions of the current 
economic crisis, one piece of paper with another, even though it 
has 20 levels of protection.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Children Among Us: There Are Fewer </F>
of Them"] 
  [Text] The birth rate of our population in the last ten 
years has had a general tendency to decrease. For 1990-1993, it 
went from 12.7 births per 1000 inhabitants to 10.8. This is a 15 
percent decrease. In particular, in Kiev it has been 28 percent, 
in the Crimean Republic 25 percent, in the Kharkivska oblast 21 
percent, in the Donetska oblast 20.3 percent, and in the 
Zaporizka and Dnipropetrovska oblasts, 19 percent. 
  The highest birth rate last year was in the western oblasts. 
  As the numbers show, the tradition of having many children 
has been lost in Ukraine. Since 1964, each woman has given 
birth, in the course of her lifetime, on the average to only 
about two children; this does not assure even a simple 
replacement of the population, for which 2.2 to 2.4 children per 
woman are needed. This is one of the lowest rates in the world. 
Among developed countries, Ukraine ranks only 26th in birth 
rate, and it is in last place among the countries of the former 
USSR.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Kolinko: "Kravchuk Gives Up the </F>
Missiles, but Chernobyl Is Still Usable"] 
  [Text] Kiev--Although one of the latest presidential acts 
was not completely odious, it has prompted a response in the 
form of a collective letter from three ministers, as well as a 
"roundtable" of 19 state, public, and political organizations in 
Ukraine. The act in question is the Ukrainian president's edict 
"On Immediate Measures Aimed at Development of Nuclear Power 
Generation and Building a Nuclear Fuel Cycle in Ukraine." 
  The edict outlines the way of accelerated development of 
nuclear industry and of Ukraine building its own nuclear fuel 
cycle, from the production of uranium ore to the processing of 
nuclear waste. The Ukrainian Government is instructed to put on 
line over the next two years four power generators at Ukrainian 
nuclear stations, including the damaged No. 2 generator at the 
Chernobyl AES [Nuclear Electric Power Station]. 
  In the opinion of jurists, the edict contains several 
serious 
"flops." First, it assigns administrative oversight of the 
nuclear industry to the Goskomatom [State Atomic Energy 
Committee of Ukraine], including such a sensitive part of it as 
radioactive waste disposal. This is in fundamental contradiction 
to the principle of state regulation of safety and 
administration of nuclear industry, which separates the 
competence with respect to exploitation of nuclear facilities 
and radioactive waste disposal. Second, the edict envisages 
creating a medical-hygienic administration in the Goskomatom 
system, which is a violation of Ukraine's health care 
legislation. Third, keeping the text of this edict secret from 
the Ukrainian population is in violation of Articles 9-11 of the 
Ukrainian Law on Environmental Protection. 
  In addition to legal shortcomings, the edict also presents a 
number of logical puzzles. For instance, it is difficult to 
reconcile the decision on export of electric power, which is a 
part of the decree, with statements about catastrophic shortage 
of power in Ukraine. Especially considering that it is because 
of the alleged shortage of electric power that the development 
of the nuclear industry is being considered in the first place... 
  The "roundtable" participants (among whom, in addition to 
the 
"greens," were representatives of the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet, 
the leadership of the National Commission for Protecting the 
Population From Radiation, the Ukrainian Peace Council, and the 
All-Ukraine Human Rights Committee, and others) demanded Leonid 
Kravchuk repeal the edict. An identical appeal came from the 
ministers of health protection and environmental protection, and 
the minister for protection of the population from the 
consequences of the Chernobyl disaster, as well as the chairman 
of Ukrainian State Atomic Industry Oversight. 
  By the way, a few days ago IAEA General Director Hans Blix 
[name as transliterated] informed Leonid Kravchuk of the 
conclusion reached by experts of this international 
organization: They concluded that Chernobyl AES does not meet 
international safety norms.

<F P=106> [Article by Leonid Bilyy, head of the Control Commission on </F>
Privatization Issues of the Supreme Council of Ukraine: 
"Advances and Debts"] 
  [Text]According to the data obtained by our Commission from 
the Ministry of Statistics of Ukraine, privatization in Ukraine 
proceeded at a rapid pace, in accordance with the legislation of 
Ukraine. 
  The share of non-state property increased in all branches of 
the national economy; and the share of production (services) by 
non-state enterprises also increased. 
  Certain data on the activity of non-state enterprises are 
presented in the table. 
  The particular characteristic of privatization in 1993 in 
industry was the transition of several hundred large and middle 
sized enterprises to the non-state form of property; this is 
shown by the rapid growth of the share of industrial production 
by non-state enterprises, from 17 to 29 percent. 
  In construction, non-state enterprises increased their share 
in the total number of enterprises, and in the scale of 
production. It is expected that in 1994, the share of 
construction and repair work carried out by non-state 
enterprises will exceed the work carried out by state 
enterprises. 
  In retail trade, the share of non-state enterprises has 
reached 60 percent. Now the task is to unify small state 
enterprises into commercial companies, and trading houses, to 
create a wholesale chain for private commerce, for the 
intensification of the interregional exchange of goods in 
Ukraine, to improve the activity of the commodity exchanges, and 
to introduce the changes in legislation necessary for their 
activity. 
  The number of joint ventures in Ukraine is rapidly 
increasing; at the end of 1993, they reached 2,530, and continue 
to grow, despite the statements about the supposed worsening of 
the conditions for their activity as a result of the curtailing 
of certain untenable benefits. 
  The amount of privatized state housing is steadily 
increasing. At the end of 1993, more than 900,000 apartments had 
been privatized by citizens. 
  The farmers' movement in Ukraine is gaining strength. More 
than 27,700 farms have already been created; 558,200 hectares of 
land have been allotted to their use, of which 504,600 hectares 
are arable. The farmers are experiencing great difficulties 
because of the absence of targeted credits from the state, the 
absence of specialized technology, and of other means of 
production. 
  Privatization by initiative from the enterprises themselves, 
from their labor collectives, has proceed in the most organized 
way. After the change in the form of property, such enterprises 
work stabilely, and use internal reserves for resolving 
production and financial problems. 
  The basic economic obstacles to the process of the transfer 
of the property of state enterprises to non-state forms of 
property are the serious financial situations of the majority of 
state enterprises; their indebtedness to other enterprises of 
Ukraine, to banks, and to enterprises of other states increased 
by the end of the year to 127 trillion karbovantsi, which is 
almost twice their claims on their own debtors. Thus, for every 
employee, the state enterprises have an average of more than 
five trillion karbovantsi of pure debt. This significantly 
limits the possibilities of their activity, and the transition 
to leasing and auctioning. 
  The second most important factor making the privatization of 
enterprises more difficult was the great number of normative 
acts, which mostly do not correspond to the laws of Ukraine on 
privatization, and which were published by agencies of the 
executive branch, with the goal of hindering privatization; as 
well as similar decisions by government structures concerning 
particular facilities, when initiatives for privatization 
appeared. This shows that officeholders in government structures 
do not sufficiently understand the great political significance 
of the process of privatization, as an important economic means 
for increasing the effective utilization of the national wealth 
of Ukraine, which was created by the hard work of several 
generations of our nation; of the transfer of property into the 
diligent hands of owners, who will increase it and preserve it 
from being stolen and ruined, and will utilize property for the 
profit of our national and the Ukrainian state.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Barbashev, executive secretary of the </F>
Ukrainian Nuclear Society, laboratory manager at the Odessa 
Polytechnical University, and candidate of physical-mathematical 
sciences: "A Sore Subject--To Whom To Entrust Reactors: 
Personnel Problems in the Nuclear Power Industry of Ukraine 
Demand Immediate Resolution"] 
  [Text] The nuclear power industry is almost the only branch 
of the national economy of Ukraine that ended 1993 and the first 
quarter of 1994 with an appreciable increase in the volume of 
production. Fourteen Ukrainian AES [nuclear electric power 
station] units in 1993 produced 75.2 billion kilowatt-hours, or 
32.9 percent of the total output of electric power in the state. 
The plan task, set at the beginning of 1993, was fulfilled by 
111 percent, and in addition, the price of a nuclear 
kilowatt-hour was the lowest. 
  In the winter of this year the AES's of Ukraine were 
producing up to 40 percent of the total production of electric 
power in Ukraine. These results are even more meaningful in that 
they were achieved under conditions of a growing economic 
crisis. They indicate the great potential of the nuclear power 
industry and its great vitality and stability. 
  As calculations and even life itself show, without nuclear 
energy the formation and development of all industry, which also 
means the economy of Ukraine, is impossible, and a rise in the 
standard of living of the 52 million people of Ukraine is 
impossible. President Leonid Kravchuk with complete 
justification and accountability announced recently that nuclear 
electric power stations are the salvation of Ukraine today. 
  Nevertheless, the situation in the nuclear industry of 
Ukraine is very difficult. All AES's are in a very serious 
economic position. Starting with the second half of 1993, 
practically no fresh fuel was bought because of a shortage of 
resources, spent fuel was not removed to prolonged storage, and 
a breakdown occurred in contractual relations between many 
plants, institutes, and AES's for equipment, spare parts, and 
scientific service for the industry. 
  The problem of the highly qualified personnel drain is 
severe, and a system to provide personnel for the industry in 
Ukraine has not yet been established. Comprehensive scientific 
and information tracking is absent, all of which has a negative 
effect on AES safety. If the problems of the nuclear power 
industry are not faced and urgent measures undertaken, in a 
short time it could cease to exist as an economically effective 
and ecologically safe industry. Traditional (thermal) power 
engineering, especially the revived types of power engineering 
(wind, solar, hydro, etc.), will not be able to cope with the 
requirements of the national economy of Ukraine. But this could 
lead to a crash of the whole economy of our state. 
  A serious discussion about all this transpired at a meeting 
of the president of Ukraine with AES directors held at the 
beginning of March. Its result was the presidential edict 
concerning urgent measures for the development of Ukraine's 
nuclear power industry. 
  In the context of the outlook for the development of the 
industry, something should be said particularly about the 
problem of providing it with qualified personnel. This question 
is being addressed by the Commission for Nuclear Policy under 
the president of Ukraine. Inasmuch as I am a member of the 
working group for the creation of a national personnel training 
system, which works under the commission, I would like to share 
some ideas in this regard. 
  The number of AES personnel in Ukraine is now on the order 
of 
40,000, of which 25,000 are industrial-production personnel. 
Personnel turnover has reached 10-12 percent per year, which is 
explained mainly by the departure of highly qualified personnel 
for Russia, where wages and the standard of living of atomic 
scientists is much higher than in Ukraine. 
  The training of young engineers for the AES's according to a 
small list of nuclear specialties is conducted in Ukraine only 
three times a year--in the Kiev and Odessa polytechnical 
universities and the Sevastopol naval institute. Considering 
that the Sevastopol institute just began training students in 
1993, and that the Kiev and Odessa VUZ's [higher educational 
institutions] can graduate only about 130 persons (and, indeed, 
will all of them go to work in an AES?), a catastrophic level of 
specialist shortage can be observed. 
  Analysis of the personnel requirements of the AES'S of 
Ukraine indicates a need for the immediate establishment of a 
Ukrainian national system of personnel training for nuclear 
power enterprises and organizations and for the industry of 
Ukraine. 
  The draft of such a program has been created by specialists 
of the Committee for the Use of Nuclear Power [Goskomatom]. It 
contains a complex of studies that in a compressed timeframe 
(three to five years) will permit ensuring the maximum possible 
effectiveness of the personnel training system within the scope 
of the traditional structures of the Ministry of Education of 
Ukraine. Thus, the preliminary elaborations of the group of the 
Commission on Questions of Nuclear Policy show that as early as 
1995 the nuclear industry of Ukraine can receive on the order of 
400 nuclear engineers according to a broad list of specialties. 
But for this it is necessary to unite and coordinate the efforts 
of all interested departments and organizations, from the AES's 
to the Supreme Council and Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. 
  First, it is necessary to have immediate special purpose 
financing and technical support of the Ministry of Education and 
its institutes, which will train personnel for the nuclear 
industry. Second, it is necessary to train highly qualified 
teaching personnel, who in their turn will be able to train 
professional nuclear scientists. 
  Are there such people in Ukraine? In my view, there are. 
However, because of a distortion in the assessment of spiritual 
and moral values in the direction of the commercial side of 
life, normal work and the existence of such people have become 
impossible, and many of them were compelled to seek other, more 
"profitable" jobs. The search for qualified teachers and their 
training is a complicated process. It can be successfully 
resolved only given appropriate material support of teachers on 
the part of the state. 
  The problem of training science teachers for the nuclear 
power industry of Ukraine, in my opinion, is the key to the 
development of the nuclear power industry. Whether the 
VUZ's--the principal executors of the program--are ready for 
this will be shown by the results of their work in the 1994-1995 
academic year.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The National Bank of Ukraine Tries </F>
to Recover Its Stabilization Credit: It Will Be Interesting to 
See What Comes of This"] 
  [Text]In February of this year, the National Bank of 
Ukraine made a credit of approximately 10 trillion karbovantsi. 
The credit was to play a stabilizing role (to be turned over 
once for carrying out mutual settlements), and to be returned to 
the National Bank of Ukraine by 27 February. In any case, this 
is what Viktor Yushchenko planned... 
  Viktor Yushchenko said in February that the problem of 
mutual 
indebtedness among Ukrainian enterprises was having a paralyzing 
effect on the economy in general. Thus, it was decided to put 10 
trillion karbovantsi into circulation for stabilization. In the 
plan of the National Bank of Ukraine's leadership, the credit 
did not have any inflationary character; but it seems that 
Yushchenko's fears that the money could be used for other 
purposes have been been realized. The National Bank of Ukraine 
has not made public the data on the movement of the money from 
the stabilization credit, but during March and April the Bank 
was constantly getting indications, the basic content of which 
led to reminders that the credit had to be returned on time. 
  Among the actions which the National Bank conducted with 
this 
goal have been: 
  control over the deposit accounts of the debtors. The credit 
provided by the Bank can (and must) be redeemed with funds which 
the debtors have in another bank; 
  the establishment of priorities for the banks in carrying 
out 
settlements, in this order: settlements for energy, payment of 
wages, execution of the instructions of state taxation 
inspections concerning the assessment of payments not made on 
time, and the financial sanctions for this. 
  The National Bank is now preparing changes in the order of 
the formation of reserve requirements for commercial banks.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers </F>
Takes Extreme Measures: The Valves Will Be Shut for Those 
Institutions Which Willfully Fail To Pay for Imported Gas"] 
  [Text] Several forewarnings from the Ukrainian 
government with regard to introducing sanctions for non-payment 
for imported gas have been put into effect. In accordance with 
the government's decisions, beginning on 10 April 1994, those 
enterprises which have failed to pay for energy sources will not 
receive a single cubic meter of gas. 
  Decree No. 196 of the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers "On 
Settling An Enterprise's Accounts for Natural Gas" may be 
summarized as follows. 
  The gas-supplying enterprises of Derzhkomnaftogaz [State 
Committee on Oil and Gas]--Ukrgazprom and Ukrgaz--will become 
the organs responsible for carrying out this decree. The reason 
for applying such harsh measures lies in the fact that previous 
demands by the government regarding the introduction of 
prepayment for delivery of natural gas supplies and restriction 
on the distribution of gas to those consumers who fail to pail 
their gas bills on time have not, in fact, been carried out. And 
it was only in March 1994 that organs of the Ukrainian 
Derzhkomnaftogaz implemented a series of measures which 
compelled enterprises of the Ministry of Industry and the 
Ministry of the Macine-Building Industry--the greatest consumers 
of energy for production purposes--to begin paying back their 
debts. On the other hand, the Derzhkomnaftogaz cannot stop gas 
deliveries to many of its consumers (even to those which 
chronically fail to pay their gas bills) without thereby risking 
a complete disruption of the technological processes at these 
enterprises--something which could cause breakdowns or even 
accidents. 
  The latest government decree on putting a stop to gas 
deliveries allows the Derzhkomnaftogaz to proceed to completely 
shut off the supply of gas if the debtors fail to settle up by 
10 April. Moreover, the responsibility for the consequences of 
applying such measures shall be borne by the leading officials 
of the debtor-enterprises involved. In such situations the 
enterprises' leading officials will have to draw on their own 
hard-currency accounts, including those in foreign banks. 
Shutting off gas deliveries does not apply, however, to 
enterprises of the public-utilities sector, which are financed 
on accounts of the state budget. Moreover, the above-mentioned 
decree is the latest step in the government's consistent program 
for compelling Ukrainian enterprises which produce goods 
suitable for export to take part in paying for the import of 
Russian energy sources. 
  In the opinion of representatives of Ukrgazprom and Ukrgaz, 
the latest change in the system of settling consumers' accounts 
(partly or sometimes by consumers making prepayments for 
deliveries on a contractual basis) and accounts for gas-93 will 
allow the Derzhkomnaftogaz to accumulate funds for settling 
accounts with Russia within quite a short period of time. All 
the more so in that its own previous decrees had already 
demanded that bills be paid in hard currency from those of our 
country's enterprises which have it in their bank accounts. 
  The new scheme set forth by Ukraine's Cabinet of Ministers 
for settling accounts with Russia could be called "a la Nordex." 
  In order to speed up the introduction of a mechanism of 
reciprocal clearing accounts with the Russian gas-suppliers, the 
Ukrainian government has adopted a schem for covering its debts 
by means of bartering goods through a fully authorized middleman 
or intermediary--the Ukrzakordonnaftogaz Association. According 
to this scheme, the consumer-enterprises will be able to pay 
their bills into the Ukrgazprom account, using Ukrainian 
karbovantsy to do so; and the Gazprom will immediately channel 
these karbovantsy into an account of the Ukrzakordonnaftogaz. 
The latter will buy a certain quantity and assortment of goods 
in Ukraine (those on a list approved by the above-mentioned 
decree) for karbovantsy and then sell them to Russian 
enterprises for rubles, thereby obtaining funds to pay for 
Russian gas. Formerly the Ukrgazprom on its own had to buy 
Russian rubles or hard currency at the exchange rate set by the 
National Bank; moreover, it was far from always successful in 
finding the necessary sum. 
  To a large extent, the scheme adopted by the government 
repeats the previously approved scheme, which--however--turned 
out to be rather ineffective. The fully authorized 
organizations--Ukrnaftogazzabez and Rosnaftokomplekt--were 
unable to sufficiently provide the material and technical 
elements to cover the Ukrainian debt for energy sources. In the 
case of the Ukrzakordonnaftogaz, the operating principles will 
be similar to the scheme under which the well-known 
Austrian-Swiss firm Nordex operates in Ukraine. But it is still 
too early to judge the effectiveness of the scheme which will be 
implemented by the Ukrzakordonnaftogaz. 
  The decree issued by the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers "On 
the Price of Natural Gas To Be Released to Enterprises of the 
Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of the Machine-Building 
Industry in 1994" may be summarized as follows. 
  This decree was adopted by the government on 4 April. It 
supplemented the list of government measures with regard to 
setting up and regulating a system of settling accounts for 
energy sources. According to the decree, the accounts for 
imported gas will be managed by enterprises under the Ministry 
of Industry and the Ministry of the Machine-Building Industry in 
Russian Federation rubles or in hard currency at a price 
equivalent to 65 U.S. dollars per 1,000 cubic meters of gas. 
Furthermore, this sum will also include the cost of transporting 
the gas by the transport organizations of Ukraine's 
Derzhkomnaftogaz--computed at 4.1 U.S. dollars per 1,000 cubic 
meters. These prices shall not apply to the cost of gas for 
enterprises producing fertilizer and other items for protecting 
plants and ensuring the success if springtime field operations. 
A decree previously adopted by the government "On Settling 
Accounts for Natural Gas by Enterprises Under the Minsirty of 
Industry and the Ministry of the Machine-Building Industry (No. 
23, dated 3 January 1994) stipulated that these enterprises must 
pay in karbovantsy for transporting gas through the territory of 
Ukraine. The revocation of this point attests to the 
government's decisive intention to achieve from the 
gas-consumers of the above-mentioned ministries compliance with 
the conditions set forth by the Cabinet of Ministers--Ukrainian 
enterprises must take part not only in paying for imported 
energy sources, but also bear the expenditures of entailed in 
delivering them directly to the consumers. 
  It is anticipated that the Derzhkomnaftogaz transport 
organizations will be ensured by the government's decisions 
against late payments by the consumers for the delivery of gaz 
being imported--for the most part--from Russia. The government's 
January decree also indicated that the above-named ministries 
and Derzhkomnaftogaz must make sure that contracts are drawn up 
by the sub-departmental enterprises for purchasing from each of 
them an additional 6 billion cubic meters of gasfor the needs of 
the national economy. At that time the price of gas was not 
indicated, and the industrial enterprises were in no hurry to 
come to terms on this matter, as had been stipulated in the 
decree. 
  It was precisely for that reason that the decree issued by 
the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers on 4 April mandated not only 
the signing of contracts (to be sure, the terms were not 
indicated), but also the payment from the account of 52.4 U.S. 
dollars per 1,000 cubic meters of gas. As has been previously 
provided for, the Derzhkomnaftogaz is to pay this amount to the 
enterprises in Ukrainian karbovantsy "at the official exchange 
rate set by the National Bank of Ukraine on the day that the 
payment is made." The decree does not indicate whether this 
obligation pertains to those enterprises which came to terms and 
paid the amount owed prior to 4 April, or whether they must make 
additional payments. But if, indeed, there are any such 
enterprises, they can only be envied. 
  Obviously it is by this means that the government is 
attempting to compel Ukraine's industrial structures to pay a 
greater share of the energy costs for consumers in the budgetary 
sphere. And certainly the chairman of the Derzhkomnaftogaz, 
Mykhaylo Kovalko, back at the end of 1993 noted that state 
financing for providing energy sources to the budgetary spheres 
was insufficient for paying for even half of the raw material 
being imported. Together with this, the Cabinet of Ministers 
obligated the Derzhkomnaftogaz to fully provide for the needs of 
the national economy's budgetary sphere. 
  Because of the differences in the currency exchange rates, 
the industrial structures will, obviously, have to cover the 
shortfall in budgetary financing. However, such decisiveness on 
the part of the government does not mean at all that the 
enterprises subordinate to the Ministry of Industry and the 
Ministry of the Machine-Building Industry will be in any 
immediate hurry to pay for imported energy sources. Moreover, 
the gas-transport organizations of the Derzhkomnaftogaz will be 
in an advantageous situation. If they previously had to extend 
credit--whether they wanted to or not--to the enterprises 
involved and had no possibility of settling accounts for 
imported energy sources, nowadays the situation has changed 
fundamentally. 
  The leading officials of Ukrgaz and Ukrgazprom have already 
had occasion to state that if the domestic Ukrainian gas 
consumers pay their debts and will regularly make their 
prepayments, at least in part, the gas-transport organizations 
as early as June would be able to return most of their debt to 
Russia. And by October they would be able to settle their 
accounts with the RAT [expansion not given] Gazprom and be able 
to purchase gas in any amounts required. 
  Let's point out here that--by using this method--Ukraine 
managed to settle its accounts with Russia for gas deliveries 
during the first three months of the current year--to the extent 
of approximately 110 million U.S. dollars. However, paying back 
its debt for 1993--amounting to approximately 700 million U.S. 
dollars--still remains a serious problem.

Agency): "A Union for the Barefoot and the Naked: Some Thoughts 
Regarding a Unified Economic Space on the Eve of the New Supreme 
Council's First Session"] 
  [Text] Ukraine's integration into the CIS common market has 
long ceased to be a purely economic problem. 
Politics--particularly the matter of nationality--has moved to 
the head of those items which are urgently important in this 
matter. The southeastern part of Ukraine--the Russian-speaking 
and Russified portion of our country--has put forth many, many 
politicians and politicoes who with wearisome intrusiveness, and 
almost daily, have been using the mass media to advise that 
Ukraine should quickly join the CIS economic union. The more 
ethnically homogeneous western part of Ukraine crosses itself 
and draws back from such a prospect, regarding such a union as a 
significant step toward the utter loss of independence. And this 
is what is interesting: It is not only the obvious 
pseudo-pragmatists of the Kuchma-Hrynyov type and not only the 
directors of state enterprises who have declared themselves to 
be supporters of unconditional integration (read: capitulation), 
but also all the leaders of the communists and socialist, whose 
positions--as demonstrated by the very recent elections to the 
Supreme Council--are quite strong in the Donets Basin, as well 
as in the Kharkov, Sumy, Dnepropetrovsk, and other regions.... 
Under pressure from these "formers," local "referendums" were 
held in Donetsk and Lugansk oblasts--posing the question of 
Ukraine's full-blooded participation in the CIS. And a 
predominant majority of the population answered "Yes" to this 
question. Also obtaining support was the idea of according the 
Russian language the status of a second state language in 
Ukraine. 
  Here it seems that everything is understandable: The 
"Russian-speaking population" fears total Ukrainianization 
and--thereby--an infringement upon its own rights. Moreover, the 
transparency of the borders ensures--as everybody knows--more 
freedom in the movement of persons and goods, a factor which is 
particularly urgent for the inhabitants of those territories 
adjacent to Russia. The paradox lies in something else: The 
communists and socialist, who regard Ukraine as some kind of 
temporary, unreliable creation, yearn with all their hearts to 
shelter themselves under the wing of Russia--a country which is 
now headed by that fighter for a bright, capitalistic future, 
that anti-communist No. 1--Boris Yeltsin. 
  This paradox requires a further, detailed, and profound 
study 
because it has certainly become clear nowadays that the 
underestimation of the national or ethnic factor in politics 
could lead to fatal errors, to a transformation of social 
tension to national-social tension with all the consequences 
which would stem from that.... Something else is likewise clear: 
An active, openly shameless formation of a "fifth column" is now 
taking place in Ukraine; Yu. Meshkov and his team have emerged 
as the colossal stimulators of this process. By taking 
absolutely provocatory steps with regard to Kiev, this 
pocket-sized Crimean president is testing the strength of the 
Ukrainian state every day, and he is disseminating an 
anti-Ukrainian attitude. Moreover, by setting this attitude in 
motion he is ready to undermine the Crimean Peninsula itself. 
Sensing the utter impunity of his own actions, as well as the 
utter incapacity of official Kiev to "put its foot down," he 
will--perhaps--go as far as he desires. Furthermore, Yu. Meshkov 
feels the moral support of the communist, Russian-speaking 
leaders of the eastern and southern parts of Ukraine, for whom 
the "Meshkov experiment" in the Crimea is a model for further 
actions. They will not even have to find their own model, but 
simply follow--step by step--this little Crimean Napoleon until 
Ukraine is smashed to smithereens and "subsequently rejoins the 
great, mighty...," and so on and so forth. 
  The left-wingers marched into the elections under the 
slogan: 
"Restore the disrupted economic ties with Russia!" One candidate 
for the office of deputy from Odessa waged his campaign under 
the slogan: "For reunification with Russia, for independence 
from anyone who attempts to block this." In order to make this 
slogan more substantial, the left-wingers organized meetings in 
work collectives and cobbled together some appropriate 
resolutions. Amid the pressure of political passions their 
slogans sounded like incantations, like a road map for leading 
the country out of its economic crisis. They endeavored to 
create the illusion among people that Yeltsin and Kravchuk were 
about to sign an important document to renew the above-mentioned 
ties, and that a new, happy life would begin on the morrow. A 
short time ago I asked one such advocate of the "renewal" idea 
to cite for me at least one document--a decree of the Supreme 
Council, an edict of the president, or a decree of the Cabinet 
of Ministers--which would prohibit the ministries or enterprises 
from instituting and developing mutually advantageous ties with 
any state whatsoever. That person merely shrugged his shoulders. 
And what can be said in this regard? Certainly such documents 
simply do not exist, but neither Yeltsin nor Kravchuk are to 
blame for what happened. Ties were broken by themselves where it 
made no economic sense to do so. And they will be renewed where 
such a sense manifests itself again--without decrees or edicts. 
  There are innumerable speculations about Ukraine's 
"anti-integrationist" position. All kinds of reproaches are 
being poured down on the heads of the national-democrats, as if 
they somehow do not want to come to an agreement on resuming 
normal relations with the Russians. In point of fact, however, 
everything seems both simpler and more complicated. Whereas 
Belarus is being called Russia's warehouse, Ukraine is being 
called its semi-finished goods annex. Only 15 percent of 
Ukrainian industry is operating nowadays to produce finished 
goods, i.e., end products. The decline in production within the 
Russian Federation, along with the conversion process, has 
temporarily jolted Ukraine's entire building and repair complex; 
it cannot exist without Russian components. But Russia has lost 
interest not only in Ukrainian repair facilities, but also in 
its machinery, motor vehicles, coal, and metal. The energy 
capacity of Ukraine's manufacturing facilities has been hit hard 
by the sharp rise in prices for energy sources, which--in 
turn--has led to a precipitous increase in production costs. And 
nowadays even those products in which the Russian market is 
interested cannot be sold there because they are from 30 to 50 
percent more expensive than their foreign counterparts. Add to 
this the galloping inflation, the crisis in non-payments, the 
decline in trust in the karbovanets--and the picture becomes 
relatively complete. In the economies of both Ukraine and Russia 
the ball is controlled--first and foremost--by all the 
crisis-type processes, and then by the ambitions of the 
politicians. 
  Thus, with regard to the pace of reforms, Ukraine differs 
significantly from Russia. Becoming more and more widespread is 
an administrative game in accordance with which the ministries 
in Kiev pretend that they are directing the enterprises, whereas 
the enterprises pretend that they are turning out products. 
Hidden unemployment is increasing. Wages are either not being 
paid out at all, ot they are being paid in purely token amounts. 
The growth of social tension has already produced its first 
"eruptions." Meetings and demonstrations, as well as the 
picketing of state institutions, have occurred in Kharkov, 
Dnepropetrovsk, Lvov, and other Ukrainian cities. The state has 
demonstrated its inability not only to adminster state industry, 
but also to shore up an effective financial policy. Therefore, 
many economists consider that help should come from the 
collapsed privatization program. But this would be 
extraordinarily difficult to do within the disrupted Ukrainian 
political system--the uncertainty concerning the stances to be 
taken by the newly elected parliament, the presence of what is 
essentially a temporary government, and the decline in the 
president's popularity.... 
  The prospects for Ukraine to sign the documents on joining 
the CIS economic union are likewise uncertain. Only one thing 
can be said without ambiguity: The Belarusian variant will not 
work in Ukraine, regardless of who is in power--the 
right-wingers or the left-wingers. The key questions of the 
union--inclusion within the ruble zone, the abandonment of our 
own currency, the conversion of the National Bank of Ukraine 
into a branch of the Moscow Bank, the elimination of customs 
duties, and other such things--have now evoked an allergic 
reaction not only among the national-democrats, but also in most 
of our state's population. No less protest has been evoked by 
the attempts to issue shares--along with Russia--for several 
Ukrainian enterprises, first and foremost, on facilities in the 
oil-and-gas complex. In the opinion of serious politicians 
(unlike such persons as Kuchma), all these things threaten 
Ukraine with a complete loss of sovereignty and its 
transformation into one of the non-state provinces of the 
federation. And steps in this direction could lead to unforeseen 
consequences; they could place this country on the brink of a 
civil war. And one will hardly find in Ukraine any political 
force which would assume the responsibility for such a 
precipitous historical step. Thus, "Meshkovism" has released 
deep roots, dreams about some miraculous, communist-sausage 
past, and gladdened the hearts of thousands of people in our 
marginal country. It is one thing to be gladdened by dreams, but 
quite a different matter to take up Kalashnikov automatic 
firarms in order to put such dreams into real life. Leonid 
Kuchma is the only person who thinks that he can thus "subdue" 
Ukraine peacefully without sweeping it away. He is mistaken in 
this because certainly the two years of independence were for us 
not merely years of mistakes and disillusionments. A new type of 
person--a Ukrainian citizen--has come to replace the faceless 
owl. 
  Aside from national-political aspects, the problem of 
sharing 
a single economic space with Russia also has essentially 
practical aspects. Some people are proposing that we integrate 
ourselves into the economy of a state which--to put it 
mildly--has not demonstrated itself to be a model of prosperity. 
It has the same decline in production, the same non-payment 
crisis, strikes by miners, along with gradual disintegration of 
the oil-and-gas complex, electric-power engineering, 
transportation.... What will happen to such an economic space? 
What kind of economic union would that be? Perhaps, a union of 
the barefoot and the naked.

<F P=106> [Article by Tatyana Shchebet: "Privatization Voucher in </F>
Belarus Has Eight Degrees of Protection From the People"] 
  [Text] Privatization in Belarus has begun. Back in 
1991. Citizens of the country, however, received their first 
vouchers designated "Property" only in April of this year. This 
was the peculiar feature of Belarusian privatization: First, 
some state property--almost free, in the form of a lease--was 
made available to some citizens of the country (as a rule, 
employees of small enterprises who had the opportunity and 
connections to formalize buy-sell papers); then, in 1994, the 
Ministry of State Property [MSP] counted the remaining property 
and is now distributing vouchers to everyone. 
  The value of a voucher is 25,000 Belarusian rubles [R]. 
According to the terms of the "Council of Ministers lease," 
Belarusian state property could be sold to foreigners and 
persons without citizenship. Now the vouchers are issued only to 
those who were living in Belarus at the time they became 
citizens (November 1991). 
  There are no lines in savings banks where certificates on 
the 
quantity of vouchers are issued. People are in no hurry to take 
the vouchers, because they do not know what to do with them. At 
this point there are no investment funds in the country; the 
first 30 enterprises will put their stock on the market only in 
June. Property in Belarus is divided into republic and municipal 
ownership. Well, in Minsk the list of municipal property (which 
until now belonged to local bodies of authority) subject to 
privatization includes only 400 entities. The choice is not 
extensive: several public restrooms, as-yet-unprofitable shops, 
stores on the outskirts. This is not much for the private sector 
in the capital of an independent state, but quite enough to 
serve as a cover for an illegal sellout of state property. 
Nobody in Belarus would undertake today to count how many 
prestigious entities have been sold "under the table": The 
process of privatization has been stretched out too long, and 
there has been confusion in processing and reprocessing of 
documents, caused by legislative chaos. This works for those who 
know how to turn on the green light giving the right of way to 
structures implementing privatization: Supreme Soviet 
commissions, the Council of Ministers, and the MSP. The best 
state property bringing dividends has already been bought up. A 
new scandal is in the making. The parliament commission on 
economic reform proposes to make an amendment to the Law "On 
Leasing" which will enable the state to take property back at 
any time "in the interests of the state." If this "reform" is 
implemented, bureaucrats will get a substantial windfall both 
from those who will try to keep the lease and those who will 
want to acquire new property. 
  My neighbor, pensioner Maria Nikitichna, does not plan to 
take her vouchers at all. She has calculated that getting a chit 
confirming her labor record (officially) will cost her R14,000; 
the document on the status of her account in the Savings Bank as 
of 1 January 1991 (which also is required in order to have 
"Property" issued to you) will cost between R7,000 and R24,000; 
add the 15-percent tax for processing the certificate on the 
quantity of vouchers owned, and it will pretty much equal the 
value of these same vouchers. 
  Privatization vouchers in Belarus are nominal. This makes 
them different from the Russian ones. One can only use them 
through a personal account in the Savings Bank, keeping only the 
certificate of the quantity. There are rumors that this document 
has eight degrees of protection, but an acquaintance of mine--a 
specialist with the MSP--confessed to me that it is useless to 
steal vouchers: There will be nowhere to invest them in small 
quantities anyway. One can give vouchers as a gift or sell them. 
The transfer procedure is simple: Vouchers are transferred from 
one personal bank account to another. 
  The quantity of vouchers issued is predicated on labor 
record 
and age. Persons over 35 years of age will get 50 vouchers; 
between 30 and 35--40; between 25 and 30--30, and between 16 and 
25--20; and parents of youngsters will receive 10 vouchers. For 
those who have died waiting for their vouchers, "Property" will 
be issued to relatives--provided, of course, that the "dead 
soul" was on the lists put together in August. One voucher is 
issued for each year in the labor record. It has been calculated 
that those who will be entitled to the greatest number of 
vouchers are disabled veterans of the World War II (up to 30 
extra vouchers) with up to 30 years' labor record. 
  The state has reserved R260 billion worth of property to be 
sold for vouchers. There are 1,800 enterprises that will not be 
privatized. Nobody has yet seen, however, the list of entities 
that will be for sale.

<F P=106> [Article by Leonid Tsegelnikov: "Belarus: Road to Nowhere"] </F>
  [text] By comparison with the events in the former 
Yugoslavia, the Caucasus region, and Central Asia, the events in 
Belarus remain in the background. Almost no light is thrown on 
them in the Russian press, but if something does appear, it is 
with great distortions. In addition, the reasons for the drop in 
production and the lowering of the standard of living in the 
republic are not explained. 
  I am Belarusian; I periodically visit my homeland, and I see 
that life there is becoming worse and worse. But, after all, it 
was not long ago that Belarus was considered the most stable and 
reliable republic of the USSR, and after its dissolution the 
starting conditions of the new state were better than in 
neighboring former republics of the USSR. In 1991-1992 half of 
the former Union exported industrial and food commodities from 
Belarus that were bought at cheaper prices than in other 
regions. Our Lithuanian and Latvian neighbors proved to be 
smarter. With a premonition of the quick end of the ruble in 
their countries, the Balts bought up and exported everything 
they could. Indeed, the Belarusians themselves haphazardly took 
cattle to neighbors in the hope of earning money. The dashing 
Dzhigits-Caucasians also did not lag behind the Balts. Trains 
with conquering hucksters left from Moscow for Minsk, Brest, and 
Gomel. 
  Belarus's proclamation of its independence in August 1991 
did 
not change anything in its economic activity. Independence Day 
was established without taking the history of Belarusians into 
account. As if there had been no Belarusian People's Republic, 
which was proclaimed on 25 March 1918, no uprising of 1794, no 
uprising of Kastus Kalinovskiy in 1863, no Grunwald Battle, and 
other remarkable events. The coupon-ticket system of protecting 
the consumer proved to be weak in the face of intensifying 
corruption, wholesale accumulation of commodities at bases and 
warehouses, and given the practical absence of customs offices 
at the borders. 
  Continuously increasing inflation in Russia caused an 
enormous shortage in the supply of money with the picture of the 
leader of the proletarian revolution. Discontent and strikes 
started with demands for payment of wages that were being 
withheld in various regions. On airliners to hot spots in 
immense Russia, Yeltsin and his companions-in-arms scattered 
money that had just come off the printing press. Russia accepted 
foreign handouts. The whole Western world jabbered about 
rendering Russia humanitarian assistance. Many former republics 
of the USSR hurriedly introduced national money. Intimidated by 
the April strikes of 1991, the Government of Belarus, fearing 
that it would not get its lot of all-Union money coupons, 
introduced its own monetary surrogate--the "hare," which was 
printed at the Perm Goznak factory. All-Union notes of the 1991 
version, Russian notes of the 1992 version, and "hares" were 
simultaneously in monetary circulation in the republic. In 
addition, a distribution coupon system that protected the 
Belarusian consumer from his foreign colleague was operating. 
Food commodities were sold only for "hares," with presentation 
of a citizen's consumer card of the republic. Payment with 
coupons of the two systems was allowed for transportation, 
municipal services, and public catering. Such a system made it 
possible to avoid a sharp drop in production and to maintain 
relative stability in the republic for a short time. V.F. 
Kebich, chairman of the Council of Ministers of Belarus, 
declared at the end of 1992 that the republic was successfully 
overcoming the first stage of a smooth transition to market 
relations, that the slump in production had been stopped, and 
that a slow rise had begun. We will add that S.S. Shushkevich, 
chairman of the Supreme Soviet, had refused humanitarian 
assistance. The first sprouts of national independence began to 
appear at that time: Independent newspapers and journals began 
to appear in the Belarusian language, a number of schools began 
to teach in the mother tongue, discussions flared up in 
parliament about whether the Belarusian language should be the 
only official language, and the Belarusian Army began to be 
formed. Diplomatic relations were established with many states, 
comparatively good arrangements were made with the closest 
neighboring states, and it was possible to avoid serious 
disputes on territorial questions with Lithuania, with whom 
Belarusians lived for several centuries in one state--the Grand 
Duchy of Lithuania. The much higher standard of living in 
Belarus by comparison, for example, with Russia can be judged by 
the psychology of the consumer of food. Thus, on 4 January 1993 
in Gomel I ate a glass of sour cream, drank a cup of tea, and 
ate two small pieces of bread for 12 Russian rubles [R]. Such a 
meal would have been several times more expensive in Russia. 
  The relative prosperity in Belarus in 1992 and the awakening 
of national dignity were achieved in a fierce struggle of the 
parliamentary opposition with the communist majority. In 
contrast to the unsound Russian shock programs of transition to 
the market--"400 days" and "500 days"--the Government of Belarus 
did not have official programs. At the same time, the 
opposition, in the form of the BNF [Belarusian People's Front], 
worked out its own program of privatization and transition to 
the market, calculated for 20-25 years and consisting of several 
stages. In addition, the transition to each successive stage was 
to be implemented only to the extent the previous one was 
realized. This would make it possible to avoid chaos and tension 
in the country. The communist parliament of Belarus rejected the 
proposals of the opposition. 
  The opposition called for the introduction of our own 
currency--the taller--the withdrawal of Russian troops from the 
territory of the republic, a restructuring of the Belarusian 
Army, and the development of real programs for the creation of a 
market economy. The opposition indicated that the inactivity of 
the government and parliament, the marking time in place, and 
the temporizing policy of Shushkevich, who was trying to 
reconcile two opposite political directions, will lead to a 
crash in the economy and loss of the republic's independence. At 
the beginning of 1993 the BNF and other democratic forces of the 
republic collected 442,000 signatures (according to the 
Constitution of Belarus only 350,000 are required) for a 
referendum on immediate parliamentary elections. The parliament 
boycotted the constitutional demands of the people. S.S. 
Shushkevich, taking a compromise position, passed a resolution 
in parliament on ahead-of-schedule elections (by one year) to 
the Supreme Soviet. These elections were supposed to have been 
held in March 1994. 
  A big crack occurred in the economy of Belarus in the spring 
of 1993, when not enough cash "hares" were available and coaches 
with new batches of "hares" "got lost" in the labyrinth of the 
railroad lines of the Moscow rail junction. The government 
passed a resolution on the "temporary" circulation of the 
Russian ruble in the purchase of food commodities. Prices began 
to rise sharply in the republic. Products disappeared from the 
shelves. The "hare" began to be quoted lower than Russian money. 
  The second blow against the economy of Belarus was delivered 
in July 1993, when Russia, in a unilateral procedure, conducted 
an operation to remove from circulation rubles with the image of 
a silhouette of the leader and the introduction into circulation 
of the 1993 version of bank notes of the Russian Bank. According 
to an existing agreement of Russia with states that were in the 
ruble zone, Russia was obligated to notify its colleagues within 
six months about the conduct of such an operation. The current 
notes of the national bank ("hares") remained in circulation. 
The financial system of the republic was broken. The economy of 
the state, which relied mainly on the Russian consumer, began to 
drop sharply. For two years the Government of Belarus 
practically did nothing to reorient the economy toward other 
countries, a Black Sea-Baltic economic union was not 
established, which the opposition had insisted on, and the 
question of the construction of a Ukraine-Belarus-Baltic oil 
collector for the reception of oil from the Near East was not 
resolved. Under pressure from the communist majority in 
parliament, S. Shushkevich began to yield small gains anyway: 
Activity of the Communist Party was authorized, Kebich's 
government concluded an agreement with Russia on extending the 
period of stationing Russian troops on the territory of Belarus 
for another eight years, and Belarus joined the collective 
security system. 
  We will note that Belarus was compelled in the course of 
seven years to overcome by itself the consequences of the 
Chernobyl accident, when 70 percent of all radioactive emissions 
fell on its territory. One-fourth of the territory of the 
republic was exposed to radioactive contamination. The republic 
expends 20-25 percent of the national budget on elimination of 
the aftereffects of Chernobyl annually. At the same time, 
Belarus is the most militarized state in the world: In 1991, of 
each 1,000 persons, 43 were servicemen. 
  Belarus did not sustain the repeated increase in prices in 
1993 for Russian energy sources: There was not enough meat or 
other agricultural products, which were delivered to Russia at 
cheap prices. A number of enterprises came to a halt, and many 
began part-time operations. Lack of our own policy, and 
corruption in the upper echelons of power, which involved even 
the family of the prime minister, led to a crash of the 
financial and economic system of the republic. Inflation reached 
50 percent a month, the exchange rate of the "hare" with respect 
to the ruble fell by a ratio of one to four. Kebich's government 
led the country on a road to nowhere. Striving to hold onto 
power a little longer, first two powerful ministries (internal 
affairs and state security) were sent into retirement, and 
afterwards also S.S. Shushkevich, chairman of the Supreme 
Soviet, and the activity of the social military union BZV 
[Belarusian Union of Officers] was banned. The elected speaker, 
M. Hryb, is striving for dictatorship, declaring the need to 
introduce the institution of the presidency, and postponing the 
elections of a new parliament until the end of the year. 
  The inclination of Kebich's government to avoid 
responsibility for the inactivity and corruption is now being 
covered by joining a unified ruble zone with Russia. The 
responsibility is thereby transferred to the Government of 
Russia, and all material losses--to the Russian taxpayer. 
However, Russia's infusions into the existing economy of 
Belarus, considering the composition of the current government, 
will be squandered and embezzled.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Babayan: "Should a Man Love His </F>
Motherland If It Does Not Love Him? Armenia Actively Votes for 
`New Life' With Its Feet. One Out of Five Inhabitants Has 
Recently Left the Country"] 
  [Text] Yerevan--It is probably old-fashioned to bring 
up the topic of emigration. And especially to brand those who 
leave in search of bluebirds and sweet pies. For goodness sake! 
The entire country is sitting on suitcases: We have become 
strangers to each other, we are being driven out from 
everywhere--either for our faith, or for the color of our hair, 
or for our language, or, God forbid, for all of the above. In 
the past, emigration in its geographical sense meant Europe and 
the United States. Now you just step outside the neighborhood 
and you are in the near abroad. It does not matter that it is 
near--the important part is that it is abroad. 
  Official statistics tell us that one out of five inhabitants 
have left Armenia recently. This is only part of the problem, 
though. A recent sociological survey showed that a further 2 
million citizens are ready to follow these 600,000-700,000. 
Which means that only those who cannot move will remain in the 
homeland. Truly, had it been my choice, I would nominate a man 
with a suitcase as Man of the Year. 
  Is this a dangerous trend, this curve that resembles the 
trajectory of an aircraft taking off? Let us refrain from 
nervous monologues. The best cure for phrase-mongering dandruff 
is the guillotine of facts. And they go as follows: In 1920 the 
population of the republic numbered 720,000. During subsequent 
decades, up to the population exodus of our times, this figure 
reached its current level--3.5 million. Now let us permit 
ourselves a cynical question: Is this a lot or a little? For 
China--I do not have to tell you; as for Armenia, some 
sociologists believe that its optimal population should be 
2.2-2.3 million. It turns out that the democratic capacity is a 
sensible balance between the number of consumers and the number 
of producers. To put it simply, those who eat must be fed by 
their own workers and the fruits of their own land. This is all 
fine, except that those who leave are mostly the workers, not 
the eaters. 
  One independent sociologist suggested at a "roundtable" on 
the subject of migration that we should resign ourselves to it 
and accept that blockades, the energy crisis, migration, and 
other ills are an "eternal given" and try to adjust to these 
conditions, as was done, for instance, in Japan during the times 
of crisis: grow quails at home and consume their meat and eggs; 
build miniature hydroelectric power stations--in short, set 
microgoals for ourselves. 
  I can foresee a reasonable question: How then did our 
republic live before? In the last normal year of its life--1987 
(that is, before the earthquake, the Karabakh events, and the 
blockade)--the volume of gross national product in Armenia 
exceeded consumption by approximately 1.3 billion rubles [R]. 
Academician Yuriy Khodzhamiryan of the International Engineering 
Academy comes to the conclusion that Armenia did not in any way 
live at Russia's expense and made a substantial contribution to 
the country's central fund. The proportional share of national 
income utilized in the national income produced between 1980 and 
1987 is within the range of 90 percent. The scholar believes 
that Armenia can feed itself, provided that transportation and 
energy communications function normally, and relations with 
other states--first and foremost our neighbors--are normal. 
  What does it mean, however--feed itself? There is no country 
in the world that produces everything it consumes. Even the 
United States exports [as published] petroleum products, metals, 
and a number of foodstuffs, not to mention machine-building, 
electronics, and light industry products. 
  Yes, our current situation is extremely difficult in the 
socioeconomic and political sense. But the demographers made the 
forecast not for the present but for the future. Which says that 
Armenia is doomed to have a 2-million population. One wants to 
ask what there is more of here--pessimism, or the desire to 
somehow justify the migration by presenting it as a blessing and 
refusing to analyze the real causes of the outflow of 
inhabitants? Meanwhile, they, these causes, are quite puzzling. 
Their basis is psychological fear of the present, extreme 
hardship of life, and everything that stems from the 
Azerbaijan-Karabakh confrontation. Add to this list discontent 
with the current authorities and their methods of governing. 
After all, flight from domestic reality is voting with one's 
feet. Is this not so? 
  A few months ago the sociological research center of the 
National Academy of Sciences conducted a survey aimed at 
identifying more precisely society's attitude to current 
processes. Its results show people's strikingly high degree of 
alienation from the social sphere, social indifference of 
different strata of society. To the question: "Do you believe 
that you personally can influence public life?" slightly more 
than one-quarter of the respondents answered positively, 73.4 
percent--negatively. Among those who answered negatively were 75 
percent of students, school pupils, and young people polled, 83 
percent of workers, and 93 percent of nonworking housewives. By 
the way, a little more than a quarter of the respondents 
consider Armenia their "homeland forever." And about 18 percent 
believe that "Armenia does not have any future, and even if it 
does not disappear from the map of the world, most Armenians 
will leave." 
  Uninformed people may get the impression that Armenians are 
a 
nation on the go. This is not so. Resettlement of compatriots 
abroad began in 1915, when the Ottoman Empire subjected to 
genocide a million and a half Western Armenians. In the 1920's, 
however, the biblical mountain began to accept into its bosom 
the first repatriates. Convoys of wanderers began coming to the 
ancient homeland from everywhere--Greece and Iran, France and 
Syria, Lebanon and Cyprus. Repatriates from all continents came 
together at the hospitable table of the homeland. This was noted 
by Mikhail Koltsov, who visited at the time at the foot of 
Ararat: "One has to resort to speaking with an Armenian drama 
actor from Paris in French, finding a common--English--language 
with an Armenian novelist from New York, and arguing with a 
music critic from Vienna in German. And also recalling at least 
a few Turkish words for the owner, who brings fresh cups to the 
debaters in such a fatherly manner." 
  Repatriation became truly large-scale after the war. People 
were coming back not just to their homeland--they were coming 
back to a victorious country. By the way, from the Syrian city 
of Aleppo with a convoy of refugees also came the family of the 
future president, Levon Ter-Petrosyan. 
  Repatriates were called "brothers"--"Akhpars." The top 
echelons, however, distrusted blood brothers who had escaped the 
Yataghans by fleeing to foreign lands, had for decades cherished 
the dream of the holy mountain, and had finally come back to 
native parts. Strangers or not, they were the first to 
experience the hellish machine of Stalin's terror. 
  One way or the other. It seemed that the West Armenian 
mirror, fragments of which flew over all five continents, put 
itself back together. Alas, today it has cracked again, and 
again there are convoys, except now in the reverse direction. 
Away from the motherland. 
  Let us look the truth in the eye: Emigration has been, is, 
and will be. The point is why people leave the motherland, and 
this reason could be legitimate. Famous compatriots 
abroad--Charles Aznavour, Michel Legrand, the artist Garzu [as 
transliterated], member of the French Academy, and the famous 
director, Henry Verneuil, are emigrants, and it was not the 
sweet life that made their forebears leave the cities of their 
childhood. I will never forget how in Washington an Armenian 
physician was upbraiding a young immigrant who had just moved to 
the United States. 
  "What kind of an Armenian are you? You left behind your sick 
mother; the motherland is strong because of loyalty and the sum 
strength of its sons." 
  The other hunched over and mumbled something as an excuse. 
  "Here is an Armenian!" exclaimed the doctor, pointing to a 
reproduction of Saryan's famous painting on the wall. "He was 
always with Armenia in its dramatic hour. He is a real patriot." 
  Many compatriots whom I happened to meet on my foreign 
travels told me frankly: "We will come to Armenia to live out 
the last years of our lives." My God, can the motherland have 
functional significance only as a cemetery? 
  There is no question that it is quite uncomfortable right 
now 
on this rocky land. A Frenchman opens his eyes and sees the 
Louvre and the Eiffel Tower, a warm and comfortable life, the 
kindness of the motherland; a citizen of Armenia is haunted from 
his very first steps by a tragic past--the genetic code of 
sadness and tears. Is it not strange that the same songs are 
sung at our weddings and funerals--the sad tunes of our distant 
forebears... 
  Those who returned were subjected to apprehension and 
mistrust. I knew a mathematician in Yerevan who worked at a 
secret facility. In the 1970's his sister came to visit from Los 
Angeles as a tourist. He was summoned to a certain competent 
organization and sternly warned: "Do not seek a meeting with 
your sister--remember, you have been entrusted with state 
secrets." As if his sister had come for the single purpose of 
fishing out her brother's secrets. "How can this be," the 
bewildered mathematician was saying, "they entrusted me with 
secrets but do not trust me to meet with my own sister." 
  Several years later he moved to the United States, to join 
his sister. 
  It is all true: Ararat is not always hospitable to us. 
But--to be angry at one's motherland? What if Yerevan trees got 
upset that they are being chopped down, folded their branches 
like wings and flew away to warm parts? What if Sevan got angry 
at some malfunction in the works and quietly, perfidiously, by 
an underground route known only to it, moved to foreign 
countries? 
  This is the bitter truth--it is not easy to be an Armenian 
today, it is not easy to live in the paternal home. That is why 
the attitude toward emigration among the public is ambiguous. 
  I talked once with Genrikh Ignatyan, an art critic, a former 
USSR people's deputy. 
  "There is no question--this is a painful topic. People like 
Saryan, Tamanyan, Spendiarov, and Kodzhoyan started coming here 
at a time of hardship. I have met many times the people who left 
several years ago, and I can tell you for certain--they all 
think about Armenia. I met a young man once in Spain, who told 
me with tears in his eyes: "Why do I need a Sayat-Nova 
restaurant in Madrid--I want to open one in Yerevan; I will make 
it better there." 
  Do we need to moralize? Foreign Armenian parties and 
organizations have an unequivocally negative attitude toward 
emigration. But here, in Yerevan, many have began to treat with 
understanding those leaving for foreign lands: "Why should I 
love my motherland if it does not love me?" And really, why? 
  Then answer this question: Why should the motherland love 
you 
if you do not love it? Everything gets so complicated when the 
mind and the heart are at odds! On the other hand, only he who 
lives by his conscience has peace of mind. 
<H5>  Shakespeare's Prayer: </H5>
  Leave me, but not at the last moment, 
When I grow weak from small troubles. 
Leave me now, so I may learn right now 
That this tragedy is greater than all other troubles. 
That there are no troubles but one-- 
To be deprived of your love forever. 
  The poetic verse flies high into the sky; train routes and 
tracks go by land. This is the point.

<F P=106> [Report by N. Sadraddinbekov: "Civil Aviation Development </F>
Program Set"] 
  [Text] "The Decree `On Development of Azerbaijan's Civil 
Aviation,' issued by the republic Cabinet of Ministers, 
envisages the appropriation of credit to further improve the 
quality of the republic's civil aviation and bring it up to 
world standards," Maksud Asadov, director of Baku air 
transportation company (BTA) AZAL-AVIA, said in an interview to 
EKONOMIKA AZERBAYDZHANA. He said that the development program 
covers the period through the year 2005 and includes, in 
particular, upgrading AZAL airline flying stock by adding such 
new airliners as the Boeing-707, Boeing-757, and Tu-154M. An 
agreement has been reached with the American aviation company 
ALG (Aviation Leasing Group) to deliver aircraft of the Boeing 
family to Baku. Flight crews and technical personnel of the AZAL 
company are currently undergoing internship training in Dallas 
and Miami (the United States). The training is conducted by 
specialists from the Buffalo Airways airline. 
  M. Asadov also reported that from 5 May to 6 June AZAL is 
planning to implement the Hajj-94 program, which envisages 
taking pilgrims to the holy places of Jeddah and Mecca. The 
expected profit from this is about $1 million. 
  "The problem of nonpayments between the AZAL airline and 
partner enterprises in CIS countries is aggravating the problem 
of deliveries of spare parts, components, and systems needed for 
aviation equipment to function normally." Maksud Asadov noted an 
increased frequency of instances of delays in money transfers. 
According to M. Asadov, the airline's existing clearing accounts 
in a number of CIS cities also operate unsatisfactorily. In 
addition, in airports of some CIS cities where the Azerbaijani 
airline's aircraft fly, payment for technical service of the 
aircraft is sometimes demanded in cash, which is practically 
impossible. 
  There are also a number of problems with respect to capital 
construction. For instance, construction work has been suspended 
on a new airport complex and a new take-off and landing strip, 
which is being rebuilt by specialists from the German concern 
Wirtgen. With respect to the latter project the airline owes the 
German company 3 million German marks.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sagaredzhoyskiy Rayon Head Lado </F>
Markhvashvili by Dzhemal Kurkhuli: "I'd Like To See Garedzhians 
Smiling Again, Or, About What's Bothering Us"; place and date 
not given] 
  [Text] I met Lado Markhvashvili about 15 years ago. 
At the time, the young man seemed to have taken on a hopeless 
task: in prosperous, bustling Sagaredzhoyskiy Rayon, a little 
village called Udabno had been built. And Lado was elected the 
village's first mayor. The village leaders and their 
subordinates had to do a lot of heavy, day-and-night labor, but 
they got a lot done. Now a couple of months ago, Sagaredzhoyskiy 
Rayon elected its new head--Lado Markhvashvili. At such times we 
journalists usually say, he's a seasoned worker. Often, the 
particular individual does not deserve it, but in this case Lado 
really is an excellent choice. His biography tells us that he 
has served as a Sagaredzhoyskiy Rayon official at various times, 
and was chairman of the agroindustrial complex. Most important, 
he is still the same hearty and industrious man he was when he 
was elected mayor of the newly founded village. Things to do? As 
the Great Ilia says, there's plenty to do; all it takes is a 
sharp sickle. 
  "It will take major, unstinting toil to save Georgia. 
Literally or figuratively, it will take a sharp sickle to save 
us." These were the words Sagaredzhoyskiy Rayon's head began our 
talk with. 
  [Kurkhuli] Batono Lado, since you mentioned sickles, just 
how 
much of a crop will you have to harvest? 
  [Markhvashvili] In late October we only had 1,200 hectares 
of 
fall crops sown. Then we got behind on cropping schedules. But 
we got busy, and by now we have sown 7,200 hectares. We will be 
harvesting spring crops on 1,700 hectares. It goes without 
saying that we have a lot of work to do tending the crops in 
spring; we'll have to figure out a way to get gasoline and 
diesel fuel. 
  [Kurkhuli] Recently, the head of Udabno visited you and 
asked 
for help getting diesel fuel and other things. You gave it to 
him readily. Don't you think you're still paying more attention 
to "your" village and letting the others go? 
  [Markhvashvili] People are probably kidding you. In my own 
hometown of Patardzeuli I always had an "oppositioner"--my 
father. He was a machinery operator, and if I failed to give 
their farm a ballbearing, he would give me such a hard time I 
was afraid to go home. What do you think happens to me now, when 
Potardzeuli and the whole rayon is in trouble, and everybody 
knows me? But I do have to admit that a lot of people, many sons 
of the land, put a lot of sweat into Udabno. I'm nobody special. 
But I do truly believe that we did a good thing to build a 
village in our forefathers' sacred place, and that was Udabno. 
No matter what happens to us now, that foundation is going to 
stay, or else what kind of patriots would we be? Probably that's 
why I pay so much attention to Udabno, but as for the others 
getting left out, Udabno is having as hard a time as the rest of 
Georgia. 
  [Kurkhuli] Kakhetia is a land of bread and wine, and 
Sagaredzhoyskiy Rayon is the gateway to it. How are the 
vineyards doing? 
  [Markhvashvili] Most of the vineyards have been privatized, 
but the results have not been beneficial. Do you think most of 
the Kakhetians don't care about vineyards anymore? God forbid, 
but we haven't been able to take care of them... we haven't had 
the fuel, chemicals, and sulfur. These are things we have to 
take care of starting now. The sulfur has been brought in. 
People are hungry, we cannot deny it. The situation is truly 
deplorable and disastrous. An abundance of agricultural products 
will help us. We must also point out that although we have 
received agricultural credits, we can't survive with 
high-interest loans. 
  [Kurkhuli] Sagaredzhoyskiy Rayon always had plenty of sheep 
and cows. The Giorgitsminda Hog Complex had lots of animals, and 
Patardzeuli had its poultry plant. Now, nothing seems to be left. 
  [Markhvashvili] That was a time of terrible mistakes and 
shortsightedness for all of Georgia. Naturally, the trouble 
spread to Sagaredzhoyskiy Rayon too. The kolkhozes and farms 
were dismantled, people stole the livestock. There used to be 
over 5,000 cows in the rayon, now there are only 1,605. The 
number of sheep and hogs has also gone down. Our aim is to do 
everything we can to build up our livestock. Useful steps have 
been taken in the poultry plants. We have to do what we can to 
straighten things out, we have no other choice. 
  [Kurkhuli] Sagaredzhoyskiy Rayon also has highland 
districts, 
the villages of the Gombori and Kochbani. Our editors received a 
critical letter from some anonymous readers demanding the 
restoration of the Gombori and Kochbani farms. I know that 
district, I'm personally acquainted with every person there. In 
that letter, which I showed you, a lot of workers are being 
blamed unfairly. I realized that when I went to those villages 
yesterday and the day before. What interests me, however, is 
whether the Gombori and Kochbani farms can be restored as the 
anonymous letter writers want. 
  [Markhvashvili] How can we restore them to what they were? 
That would be turning back the clock! We would have to take away 
people's orchards and crop fields. It simply can't be done. 
Those farms no longer have cattle or other livestock. It would 
only be possible to create agricultural links to take care of 
the workers' own farms. Another thing is that a lot of grain was 
stolen from the Kochbani farm. The Procuracy is looking into it, 
and it will all be clarified. 
  [Kurkhuli] Sagaredzhoyskiy Rayon used to be the biggest 
industrial district in all of Kakhetia. In the past 10 or 12 
years, not counting three or four disastrous years, the millions 
generated by industrial goods greatly exceeded the millions 
generated by the supposedly traditional agricultural sector. 
  [Markhvashvili] Yes, that was true, but what used to be is 
now no more. We no longer have electrical power, or gas, and the 
big industrial plants have shut down--the reenforced concrete 
products plant, the tire repair plant, and the auto repair 
plant. The rayon has also been hurt bad by the closing of the 
wine bottling plant. The recent economic agreement between 
Georgia and Russia has made us hopeful. These industrial 
facilities will resume operation and our economy will probably 
get back on its feet. 
  [Kurkhuli] Batono Lado, you said that all this has to be 
done. There is no other choice. Could you say a bit about what 
you have managed to do? People are hurting. 
  [Markhvashvili] Not one emergency medical vehicle was 
working, but we managed to provide one emergency vehicle with 
gasoline, and we know that we can get help to someone in 
trouble. The bus that connects the city of Sagaredzho with the 
railroad station is operating again. We have focused all our 
effort on providing people with bread. We have an emergency 
there too. One thing that makes me feel a little better is that 
in the highland districts, the villages of the Gombori, where 
things were supposedly the worst, the situation is actually 
better. 
  We have made up a list of people who are alone or sick and 
we're doing what we can to help. 
  [Kurkhuli] In conclusion, what wish do you have? 
  [Markhvashvili] I'd like to see Garedzhians smiling again.

<F P=106> [Article by Ewald Stein: "The Estonians Do Not Want To be </F>
Sacrificed for a New Friendship"] 
  [Text] Juri Luik apologizes politely. He is almost 10 
minutes late for the breakfast appointment. His program is 
rushed, the night was a bit short. 
  Juri Luik has been foreign minister of Estonia since the 
beginning of this year. Together with his colleagues from the 
two other Baltic states, Latvia and Lithuania, he was recently 
invited to Bonn by Federal Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. That 
this invitation was gladly accepted is obvious. A visit to 
Germany is for Luik more than mere diplomatic routine, for he 
believes that in the Bonn government he will find especially 
committed support in the solution of the multifaceted political 
problems of his still young independent country. 
  Luik's homeland needs intercessors above all vis-a-vis 
Moscow. In Estonia, which became independent in 1991, now as 
before Russian troops are stationed--the legacy of the Soviet 
past. And in Tallinn people rightly fear that they will not have 
been completely withdrawn by August 31 as originally agreed. 
  At any rate, this is at present the biggest political 
problem 
for Estonia's government. And thus for the young foreign 
minister as well. Juri Luik is just 27 years old. At first 
glance, his full beard can easily be deceptive in this regard. 
He is among the guard of young politicians who today steer the 
political destinies of the most northern of the three Baltic 
states. His prime minister, Mart Laar, is just 34 years old, in 
the entire government team no one is over 40 years old. Only 
Lennart Meri, the state president enthroned above them, is among 
the seniors. On March 29 he celebrated his 65th birthday. 
  In spite of his youthfulness, Luik, who was born on August 
17, 1966, in Estonia's capital Tallinn, already has a notable 
career to his credit. After studying journalism at the 
University of Tartu, he worked beginning in 1989 initially as a 
political editor at the cultural weekly VIKERKAAR, to change 
from there as an expert for Anglo-Saxon studies at the renowned 
Estonia Institute. As director of the political department of 
the Foreign Ministry, Luik, who speaks splendid English and, of 
course, Russian and Finnish as well, in 1991, the year of 
independence, moved into the political career. 
  The stages were short: In September 1992, after the first 
free elections, he was elected deputy of the coalition party 
"Pro Patria" to parliament; a month later, as minister without 
portfolio, he then directed the delegation of his country in the 
delicate negotiations with Russia. In August 1993 he became 
minister of defense, and since January of this year has held the 
office of foreign minister. 
  This evolution makes it clear that he regards the withdrawal 
of the Russian soldiers as the center and pivotal point of the 
current foreign policy of his country. This is all the more so 
because Moscow only at the beginning of March let it be known 
that Russia no longer feels bound to the deadline of August 31 
and will decide on the return as it sees fit. "This date, after 
all, was proposed by the Russians themselves," the foreign 
minister observes with irritation. Now one can only hope that 
they will keep to this date, he added with anything but 
confidence. 
  For Juri Luik there is no doubt that the Russian hesitation 
tactic has its source exclusively in the will to demonstrate 
power. In his view, you see, the danger for his homeland does 
not emanate from a direct threat. "The Russians, after all, 
today have no more than about 2,500 active soldiers stationed in 
Estonia. Technically, they would, therefore, be in the position 
to order the return of such a limited contingent any day." But: 
"It is nothing but a political question. Russia wants to exert 
permanent pressure on the Baltic states." 
  And in this delicate situation his country is betting on 
Europe, in particular on Germany. No, it does not have to be 
pressure that Bonn and the European Union [EU] should exert on 
Russia, the diplomat believes. However, gentle, but constant 
influence should be exerted. It should be made clear to the 
Russians again and again, he said, that they must observe their 
own obligations and bring their soldiers home by the agreed 
deadline. This type of support, he indicated, is "very, very 
important" for his country. 
  But the minister from Tallinn cannot or will not conceal his 
scepticism completely. So he agrees completely with his 
president, who not long ago complained about the German 
appeasement policy towards Russia. "Yes," Luik says seriously, 
"that is so, at any rate to a certain degree." But immediately a 
slight correction follows: "If we are asked whether a 
German-Russian axis means a danger for us, we say first of all 
that we do not presume such an axis." Actually, he let it be 
known, people in Tallinn welcome the friendship between Bonn and 
Moscow. But, and now again unambiguously: "We do not want to be 
sacrificed for this friendship." 
  The Estonians, too, if Luik had his way, would like to be 
friends of the Russians. In his view it looks quite as though 
the Russians themselves are interested in an integration in 
Europe. But for this, he pointed out, there are clear criteria 
after all. "In Europe there are certain rules of conduct, which 
must be accepted by all countries, large and small. And these 
norms also apply to the Russians." Of this they must be reminded 
again and again, and specifically in their own interest: Such 
admonitions, you see, would also mean a strengthening of the 
democratic forces in Russia. 
  Luik, of course, knows the thesis that the political key to 
this does not at all lie in Europe, but rather in the United 
States, that there can indeed be an accord between Washington 
and Moscow in staking out their own spheres of interest anew. 
  But in his view it should not terrify. He believes that 
especially the strong European states, like Germany, have an 
interest in there not being any new two-power policy: "Such a 
policy, after all, would be a swindle. After all, there is no 
longer a second superpower." But even if it would be so, he 
pointed out, the Europeans are certainly politically and 
economically strong enough to be able to prevent "a game over 
their heads." In any case, he does not believe that "the 
European Allies would allow Washington to do this." 
  For him, the thesis of new spheres of interest is ultimately 
equivalent to the "sacrifice of border states." Moreover, for 
the diplomat, this would only be the first step: "History has 
taught us, after all, that a first sacrifice, as a rule, is 
followed by others." For him, this would be a genuine policy, 
for which he understandably sees "absolutely no reason." 
  Luik is firmly convinced that the Western community holds 
all 
the cards vis-a-vis Russia, politically, economically, and 
psychologically. But: "It must only play its hand." That is to 
say: In an energetic policy vis-a-vis Russia. And here he again 
emphasizes the positive effect of such a policy for Russia: "We, 
too, after all, want people like Boris Yeltsin to be supported." 
At the latest here the inflammatory word Zhirinovsky must fall. 
Luik: "In the West there must be no inclination of any kind 
toward the view that (the right-wing radical) Zhirinovsky is 
something like a good boy, with whom one can perhaps make 
political deals." And: "Whoever appeases to that extent is a 
fool!" According to Luik, this is the basic line that one has to 
follow. 
  What does a young Balt think when he hears from Moscow that 
all Russians must be protected, therefore also the Russian 
minority in Estonia? Luik corrects: "After all, Yeltsin said in 
a speech before the parliament that Russia will protect all 
Russians, whether they live in the near or the more remote area 
abroad." 
  For the Estonian, such words are, on the one hand, "quite 
clear imperialist policy," but, on the other, he does not know 
precisely what in the final analysis they are supposed to mean: 
"Does Yeltsin mean by this also Russians who have emigrated to 
Israel? Are they also his compatriots?" For Luik, the answer to 
such questions is simply a test case for all of Western 
democracy. 
  This is all the more so because Moscow links such claims 
propagandistically with the aspects of human rights and minority 
rights for the Russians in Estonia, who constitute close to a 
third of the approximately 1.6 million inhabitants. The foreign 
minister again takes up Yeltsin's speech before the parliament. 
To be sure, he talked about Russian interests, but not about how 
these interests could be pursued by democratic means, by the 
means of consensus, including with smaller neighboring 
countries. Luik: "This was completely missing in his speech." 
Luik further: "Yeltsin says that Russia belongs to Europe, that 
the Russians do not want to be guests." But for Luik, this, too, 
is not the point: "No one wants to keep Russia out of Europe. 
What we want is for Russia to follow the European norms." In 
Luik's words, those who argue that people want the Russians in 
Europe, even if its troops are still stationed in the Baltic 
states, are making a mistake: They ignore, after all, "the rules 
which those had in mind who formulated the fundamental values of 
the Council of Europe." 
  That, in view of these grand political atmospherics, Estonia 
and the other two Baltic countries want to see their future in 
the EU and in NATO is an entirely logical consequence for Luik. 
With a view to the EU, he is quite realistic. As he sees it, the 
first priority here is to bring to completion the so-called 
Europe Agreement for association by the end of this year. Quite 
different, by contrast, his opinion about a close linkage to the 
Western defense alliance. The joining of his country, too, in 
the so-called "Partnership for Peace," which NATO at its summit 
meeting in January offered to the East European states as 
substitute for membership in the alliance, to be sure, he does 
not wish to be understood as resignation, but "of course, we are 
not satisfied with that, we want much more." Surely, he 
suggested, this concept is a sign that NATO is not indifferent 
to the security interests of the Balts. On the basis of the 
missing security guarantees in the concept, however, it is not 
known "what NATO will do if things become dangerous for us." 
Joint maneuvers in the Baltic Sea, he observed, are after all no 
guarantees. 
  "Perhaps," so Estonia's foreign minister consoles, "this is 
even a helpful instability." For him it is certain in any case 
that the "Partnership for Peace" is an empty cover, which was 
accepted only because of its political significance. 
  "Totally disappointed" is Juri Luik by the fact "that there 
is no awareness either in NATO or in other European 
organizations that time is running." In his view, there have 
already been excellent opportunities for the preparation of a 
firm inclusion in NATO and for a reorganization in Europe: "When 
Yegor Gaidar and Boris Fedorov governed in Russia, when Russia 
still conducted itself like a democratic country, this all would 
have been much simpler." Today it would have to be stated that 
"we have lost a lot of time to change Europe." 
  The young minister from Tallinn evidently tries to ignore 
the 
question of why then especially the Americans in the matter of 
NATO membership of the Baltic states, too, show so much 
consideration for Moscow. "We have always told the Russians that 
it would be useful for them if the Baltic states were members of 
NATO." Then the mutual relations would be much more relaxed. If 
we felt secure, both sides could also quite easily reach 
compromises, including on border questions." But, in the words 
of Estonia's chief diplomat: "We do not feel secure."

<F P=106> [Article by Jorma Rotko: "Estonia's Inflation Accelerates: </F>
Prices in March Rose Nearly 9 Percent"] 
  [Text] Tallinn -- A common sight last summer around Tallinn 
harbor was a happy Finnish family carrying aboard their ship 
inexpensive food purchased in Estonia. This coming summer this 
sight will perhaps not be as usual, since Estonia's economy has 
slipped into exploding inflation. 
  For all of last year inflation was 35 percent, which is 
small 
in comparison with other other former socialist countries. 
Inflation in January of this year was 5.5 percent, in February 
5.2, and in March already 8.9 percent. 
  In Estonia it is estimated that the first three months of 
this year have brought a rise in the cost-of-living index of 
around 21 percent. 
  Research Director Marje Josing of the Estonian Business 
Institute says that wages in the private sector have kept pace 
with the inflation rate. 
  "Last year in September the mean wage in Estonia was 1,168 
kroons (around 550 Finnish markkas); by February this year the 
mean wage was 1,365 kroons (around 640 markkas)." 
  Josing thinks inflation is hitting hardest retired persons 
whose pensions have not risen at the same pace as prices. 
  Josing does not believe inflation will continue at the same 
8.9-percent pace experienced in March. 
  "The great demand for food products from Russia caused the 
rise in prices in Estonia. In mid-February, Russia placed an 
average 30-percent tariff on Estonian food products, and exports 
collapsed completely. For this reason, Estonian producers are 
being forced to act on prices in order to get their products 
sold in the domestic market," Josing said. 
<H5>  Finnish Goods Still Inexpensive </H5>
  As Estonia's prices have risen, Finnish goods have become 
more competitive. Indeed, the general lifting of prices has been 
tempting merchants to raise their prices also for Finnish goods. 
  The price for good-quality Estonian cheese has risen this 
year from 15 to 25 markkas per kg, but 400 grams of a Finnish 
butter-margarine mix still gets around four markkas. The Finnish 
taxpayer subsidizes the greatest portion of this price. 
  In March, Estonia's inflation rate even exceeded that of 
Russia. Housing costs rose during March by 18.5 percent, 
services by 15.5 percent, and food by 7.5 percent. 
  The dizzying inflation has set many to pondering whether the 
Estonian kroon's firm tie to the German mark at the rate of 1:8 
will be long sustainable. The German mark is already beginning 
to be so cheap that it is becoming interesting to Estonian 
investors. 
  Kroons are beginning to be exchanged for hard currency. In 
March the Central Bank's hard currency reserves backing the 
kroon dropped for the first time since the kroon came into use, 
even though by only 1.5 percent.

<H5>  Public Employment and Income </H5>
  At the end of February around 2 million people in the 
Commonwealth countries were seeking jobs with the aid of 
employment services, and 1.4 million of them were registered as 
unemployed. The correlation of supply and demand in 
the labor market in the different countries changed in the 
following manner in January and February this year (thousands of 
people at the end of the month):

---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  There were disparities between the demand for manpower and 
the supply in most of the states in February, just as there had 
been in preceding months. In Azerbaijan there were 4.8 jobless 
individuals for each vacant position in February 1994, as 
compared to 3.1 in February 1993. The respective figures for 
other countries were 92.2 and 74.8 for Armenia, 6.6 and 2.9 for 
Belorussia, 3.3 and 1.8 for Kirghizia, 4.6 and 3.5 for Russia, 
and 1.3 and 1.1 for Ukraine. In Uzbekistan the correlation 
displayed virtually no change and was 1.1. In Tajikistan the 
lower number of jobless individuals per vacancy (15.5 in 
February 1993 and 8.2 in February 1994) was due to migration and 
the resulting increase in the demand of enterprises for workers 
(to fill the vacated positions). 
  The data below indicate the number of unemployed individuals 
registered with employment services in January and February 1994:

  The proportional numbers of jobless individuals qualifying 
for unemployed status in February 1994 were 42.1 percent in 
Azerbaijan, 92.7 percent in Armenia, 100 percent in Belorussia 
and Moldavia, 37.3 percent in Kirghizia, 78.1 percent in Russia, 
17.6 percent in Tajikistan, 52.1 percent in Uzbekistan, and 67.5 
percent in Ukraine. 
  The proportional numbers of unemployed individuals 
collecting 
unemployment benefits in February were 23.3 percent in 
Azerbaijan, 20.8 percent in Armenia, 52.6 percent in Belorussia, 
38.2 percent in Kazakhstan, 58.8 percent in Kirghizia, 25.2 
percent in Moldavia, 64 percent in Russia, 18.4 percent in 
Tajikistan, 52.1 percent in Uzbekistan, and 46 percent in 
Ukraine. 
  The average amounts of unemployment compensation in February 
were 67.2 drams in Armenia, 12.1 lei in Moldavia, and 147,800 
karbovantsy in Ukraine. 
  The proportional numbers of unemployed individuals assigned 
to vocational training courses by employment services at the end 
of February were 1.7 percent in Belorussia, around 1 percent in 
Kazakhstan, 19 percent in Kirghizia, 6 percent in Moldavia, 5 
percent in Russia, 20 percent in Uzbekistan, and 7 percent in 
Ukraine. 
  The rise in the average monthly nominal wage (including 
material assistance and social benefits) in January-February 
1994 in comparison with the same period last year is illustrated 
by the following data:

  In Azerbaijan the nominal wage was 5.4 times as high as the 
official minimum wage in February this year (3.8 times in 
February 1993), in Armenia it was 4.7 times as high (1.7 in 
1993), in Belorussia it was 8.6 times as high (5.7), in 
Kazakhstan it was 10.8 times as high (6.6), in Russia it was 
10.9 times as high (9.0), in Uzbekistan it was 3.3 times as high 
(2.6), and in Ukraine it was 13.8 times as high (4.4). 
  In all of the states but Russia, the rate of increase 
in consumer prices for goods and services (calculated on 
the basis of changes in the cost of the total consumer needs of 
a family) exceeded the rate of increase in the nominal wages of 
the population:

<H5>  Consumer Market </H5>
  Inflationary processes continued in February in the consumer 
markets of virtually all of the Commonwealth states. The prices 
of food, non-food items, and paid services for the population 
continued to rise, both in the organized and unorganized sectors. 
  The following data illustrate the dynamics of the 
retail trade prices of consumer goods in the Commonwealth 
states in January-February 1994:

  The rise in food prices was relatively restricted in Armenia 
(an increase of 11 percent in comparison with January), in 
Russia (9 percent), and in Uzbekistan (8 percent). Food prices 
in Tajikistan decreased by 11 percent. Meanwhile, food prices 
rose 21 percent in Belorussia, 25 percent in Azerbaijan, and 28 
percent in Moldavia in the past month. 
  In Kazakhstan the rise in food prices in February was 32 
percent, and the prices were twice as high as they had been in 
December. This was a result of the centralized cancellation of 
earlier price controls on sales of the main food products to the 
population (meat of all types, butter and vegetable oil, milk 
and dairy products, eggs, noodles, sugar, and salt). 
  The highest increases in food prices in the organized trade 
network in Russia in February were for milk and dairy products 
(20-25 percent). The prices of bread and baked goods, cereal 
grain, fish, and vegetables increased by 15-20 percent, and the 
prices of meat and meat products rose 8-12 percent. The average 
prices of milk, dairy products, bread, baked goods, and 
vegetables in Russia were 1.4-1.5 times as high as in December 
1993. 
  The retail price index for non-food items in February was 
110 
percent of the January figure in Russia, 116.2-117.1 percent in 
Armenia and Azerbaijan, 125.5-128.5 percent in Moldavia, 
Belorussia, and Kazakhstan, 131 percent in Uzbekistan, and 
virtually the same as the earlier figure in Tajikistan. 
  The prices of agricultural produce in urban markets 
continued 
to rise. The following data illustrate the dynamics of prices in 
this sales channel this year:

  Prices in urban markets in Belorussia in February this year 
in comparison with prices in February 1993 were 20.7 times as 
high for meat products, 11.8 times as high for potatoes, 19.4 
times as high for vegetables (including 11.7 times for fresh 
cabbage and 43.8-47.0 times for onions and pickled cucumbers), 
and 30.2 times as high for dairy products. 
  For citydwellers in Kazakhstan, potatoes cost 23.7 times as 
much in urban markets this February as they did last February, 
vegetables cost 35.8 times as much (40.6 times for fresh 
cabbage, 58.9 times for onions, and 78.5 times for fresh 
cucumbers); beef in republic markets cost 19.3 times as much, 
pork and lard cost 22.9-27.0 times as much, dairy products cost 
29.4 times as much, and honey cost 53.9 times as much. 
  Although the average increase in prices in Russian urban 
markets in February 1994 in comparison with February 1993 was 
6.4 times, the prices of vegetables were 18 times as high, 
potato prices were 7.3 times as high, fruit prices were 5.1 
times as high, the price of fresh milk was 8.3 times as high, 
and egg prices were 7.4 times as high.

1. Including the turnover of urban markets, according to the data of a sample survey for 
January-February--160.6 billion sum-coupons, with 86.8 billion sum-coupons in February. 


  Commodity turnover in Russia, including expert estimates of 
the sales volume of unregistered (and therefore unrecorded) 
enterprises and the unorganized imports and sales of goods from 
other countries by private individuals, amounted to 23.8 
trillion rubles in the past two months, or 7.5 times as much as 
in the same period last year in current prices and 2.3 percent 
more in comparable prices. 
  The private sector's share of the consumer market is 
growing. 
In Russia, for example, it represented (including consumer 
cooperatives) 56 percent of all commodity turnover in 
January-February 1994 (40 percent in January-February 1993), in 
Turkmenistan it represented around 40 percent, and in Kazakhstan 
it represented 49 percent. 
  In spite of the general reduction of 2 percent in the 
physical commodity turnover of officially registered enterprises 
in Russia in February 1994 in comparison with the same period 
last year, food sales decreased by 3 percent, including 
decreases of 9-17 percent for meat and poultry, canned meat, and 
vegetable oil and of 24-30 percent for canned fish, eggs, and 
sugar. 
  The organized trade network in Uzbekistan sold almost a 
third 
less meat and meat products than last year, sales of eggs and 
cereal grains decreased by more than half, sales of sugar and 
salt decreased by around 20 percent, sales of woolen fabric 
decreased by 30 percent, and sales of clothing and linens 
decreased by almost 40 percent. 
  Supplies of goods entering the retail trade network in 
Turkmenistan were 16 percent smaller than last year's for meat, 
34 percent smaller for sausage, and 56 percent smaller for 
canned meats; deliveries to the retail network decreased by 41 
percent for cotton fabric, 65 percent for woolen fabric, 44 
percent for hosiery, and 22 percent for leather footwear. The 
retail trade network in the republic did receive 1.4 times as 
much lard as last year and 1.6 times as much tea, sugar, and 
cheese. 
  The slowdown of sales of consumer goods increased commodity 
stocks in retail trade. On 1 March, for example, the retail link 
of the Armenian trade network had reserve stocks for 72 days of 
trade, in comparison with 54 days on the same date last year. 
The respective figures for other states were 60 and 48 days for 
Belorussia, 73 and 53 days for Kazakhstan, 114 and 78 days for 
Kirghizia, 53 and 47 days for Ukraine, and 43 and 41 days for 
Russia. Supplies were approximately the same as last year in 
retail trade in Azerbaijan (100 days), Uzbekistan (71 days), and 
Moldavia (44 days); reserves in Turkmenistan decreased from 100 
days on 1 March 1993 to 80 days of trade on 1 March this year. 
  The state of the market for paid services in 1994 in all 
Commonwealth states was distinguished by a continued dramatic 
decrease in physical volume accompanied by an increase in volume 
in terms of cost. 
  The data below illustrate sales of paid services by 
officially registered enterprises in different Commonwealth 
states in January-February 1994:

1. Including services performed by private individuals--2.6 trillion rubles, representing 1100 percent 
of the previous year's figure in actual prices and 54 percent of that figure in comparable prices. 


  The personal service sector is in a particularly 
unsatisfactory state: The number of personal service enterprises 
is still declining, and the reduction of the physical volume of 
many types of personal services is sizable. In Belorussia, for 
example, the number of studios and workshops decreased by 11 
percent in the past year (and by 18 percent in rural areas); 
shoemaking services decreased by 39 percent in comparable 
prices, and tailoring services decreased by 45 percent, with 
corresponding decreases of 60 percent in the repair and 
maintenance of privately owned motor vehicles and 63 percent in 
cabinetmaking services.

  The average reduction of industrial production volume in the 
Commonwealth in the past two months was 26.8 percent, and the 
prices of producer-enterprises displayed a more than tenfold 
increase. Industrial output in February was the same as in 
January this year, and producer prices increased by 18 percent 
during that period. 
  The output of electric power in January-February 1994 was 
smaller than the output for the same period last year by 11 
percent in Kazakhstan, 14 percent in Belorussia, and 21 percent 
in Armenia. 
  The output of finished rolled ferrous metal products in 
January-February 1994 was smaller than the output for the same 
period last year by 22 percent in Russia and 36 percent in 
Kazakhstan. The output of steel pipe in Russia decreased to 
around half of the previous figure. 
  In machine building the output of several of the main 
products was much smaller than in January-February 1993. The 
output of metal-cutting lathes decreased by 46 percent in 
Belorussia and by half in Russia during the two months. The 
Russian output of forging and pressing equipment was 71 percent 
below the figure for January-February 1993. The number of motor 
vehicles produced in Belorussia decreased by 56 percent; the 
number of trucks produced in Russia decreased by two-thirds, and 
the Russian output of passenger cars decreased by 41 percent. 
Tractor production decreased by 45 percent in Belorussia, by 
three-fourths in Kazakhstan, and by 81 percent in Russia. 
Tractors almost ceased to be produced in Uzbekistan.

  The average reduction of consumer goods production in the 
Commonwealth states was 29 percent, including reductions of 21 
percent in the output of food products and 30 percent in the 
output of non-food items. 
  The output of the main products of the food industry 
decreased. The industrial output of meat in Russia, Kazakhstan, 
and Belorussia was smaller in January-February 1994 than in the 
same period of 1993 by 26-28 percent, in Azerbaijan, 
Turkmenistan, and Moldavia it was smaller by 41-46 percent, and 
in Kirghizia it was twice as small. The output of whole-milk 
dairy products decreased by 17-18 percent in Russia and 
Kazakhstan, 21 percent in Azerbaijan, 38 percent in Moldavia, 
and 50 percent in Kirghizia. In comparison with the output of 
January-February 1993, flour production decreased by 17 percent 
in Russia, 20-22 percent in Moldavia and Belorussia, and 38 
percent in Azerbaijan; the output of cereal grain was 16-19 
percent smaller in Belorussia and Kazakhstan and 34 percent 
smaller in Russia. 
  In most countries the output of the main products of light 
industry decreased. Data on changes in production in 
January-February 1994 in comparison with January-February 1993

  The productivity of cows continued to decline in most of the 
Commonwealth states. In January-February this year the average 
milk yield at agricultural enterprises of Moldavia, Russia, 
Kirghizia, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan was 20-30 kilograms less 
than the yield in the same period of 1993. In several 
Commonwealth states (Armenia, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine) the 
total output of milk decreased while the productivity of cows 
increased, signifying a dramatic reduction of the herd in these 
regions. 
  The total output of the main animal husbandry products in 
February this year in comparison with February 1993 decreased in 
all Commonwealth states, which is confirmed by the following

<F P=106> [Article by Anna Ostapchuk: "Reintegration as a Higher Stage </F>
of Dissolution; Seminar at the Gorbachev Foundation"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Expert Opinion </H5>
  The Gorbachev Foundation conducted a seminar devoted to an 
analysis of the prospects and forms of reintegration processes 
in the post-Soviet space. Political scientists from Ukraine, 
Russia, and Belarus laid out their vision of reintegration as a 
global problem for the countries of the former USSR. Mikhail 
Gorbachev himself led the seminar. Aleksandr Tsipko, Igor 
Klyamkin, Mikhail Malyutin, Dmitriy Olshanskiy, and others took 
part in the discussion. 
  The concept "reintegration," as the next political craze, 
needs interpretation. What is this--a new mythologem that is 
being inculcated in the mass conscience by the very same groups 
that were inculcating the idea of sovereignization three to five 
years ago?. Their aim, moreover, remains what it was 
before--holding or seizing power. Or is this a real possibility 
of revival? And, if revival, then of what kind of a state or 
what kind of a community? And are the costs bearable? Or, 
perhaps, integration is one and the other, simply at different 
levels? The seminar was quicker to raise questions than to 
answer them. 
  Why did the republics--the inheritors of the Soviet 
Union--not move ahead very far in the sphere of economic 
reforms? But then "attribution" eclipses all other aspects of 
their state construction. The initial cause of such a state of 
affairs, analysts believe, is that independence to many of the 
republican leaders was by no means happy or desirable news about 
liberation, but rather a notice that is delivered to an 
addressee regardless of his own wishes. And they were compelled 
to "simulate" state construction. That is, sovereignization is 
first and foremost a product and the next stage of 
disintegration of the Union. And not the opposite, as we got 
accustomed to thinking. Mikhail Malyutin expressed this 
figuratively: "A knock on the door. Who is there? It is I, 
independence. Summary: We are not to blame, it came by itself." 
  Thus, it (independence) found them (the republics) 
unprepared. In a certain sense, some of them were ready 
"morally," but no one was prepared "physically." Three years 
have not added much orderliness and reasons for their existence. 
Judging by the accounts of Ukrainian and Belarusian political 
scientists, life in the sovereign states is "apocalypse today." 
Thus, the population of Ukraine is convinced that its 
politico-economic situation is determined first and foremost by 
the mafia, and only after this by the president and Council of 
Ministers. But one-third of the population of Belarus thinks 
that their state is not independent, and another third leans 
toward such an opinion. And Russia is no exception in the parade 
of "broken off sovereign pieces," but simply the largest body 
with its own specific character. If the new states have been 
suffering up until now "with a childhood illness of statehood," 
then Russia, in the opinion of political scientists, has once 
again gotten sick with "imperialist tendencies" as a specific 
Russian form of capitulation to the difficulties of state 
construction. However, does this mean that the results of the 
three-year experiment was only a realization of the 
impossibility of forming "sovereign" national 
self-identifications--be it Russian, Ukrainian, or Belarusian? 
  All agreed on one thing: Reintegration is not only 
necessary, 
but it is also inevitable. But whether it should be started 
immediately, while institutions have still been retained that 
facilitate joining, or in two or three years, when all of the 
centripetal tendencies reach their very logical end--this served 
as a subject for discussion. 
  The scheme for integration was considered. Some of the 
seminar participants expressed points of view that were not 
trivial, that succeeding unions in the post-Soviet space will be 
concluded not on principles that are traditional (within the 
spirit and framework of the USSR), and even not according to 
principles that are exotic (Pan-Slavic, Romantic, Pan-Turkic). 
But, for example, on the international principles of a 
"technological chain." As Dmitriy Olshanskiy noted, if the 
Dniester Region has sales markets and other economic interests 
in the "Siberian Agreement," this can be enough of a reason for 
the conclusion of an economic union. However, statehood under 
conditions of such geopolitical promiscuity will inevitably 
begin to melt and will lead to the appearance of a number of 
"vague" state formations. However, this is only one of the 
possibilities of the self-development of the post-Soviet space. 
There is no end to configurations of separate elements that 
mutually attract and mutually repel each other. 
  The necessary element of reintegration is its components. 
All 
of the speakers noted that the left-wingers and the big power 
supporters in the former Slavic republics of the USSR are 
calling the loudest for a necessary speedy reunification--each 
on the strength of his own ideology. However, the real executor, 
as always, will be the "party in power." A very skeptical 
interpretation is possible: There was a time when the 
newly-fledged bankers created their own first capital on the 
breakup of the USSR, and now those are longing for power who 
intend to make capital on reintegration. It may be that these 
are one and the same people. A pessimistic interpretation is 
possible: The new rulers aptly wrote off their shortcomings to 
the difficulties of economic reforms, and now a wonderful 
opportunity has appeared to justify their mistakes, because of 
the burdens of reintegration. 
  The list of interpretations is open. The myth about the 
reunification of the peoples is taking on eschatological 
features.

<F P=106> ["Extracts From Materials for a Discussion Sponsored by the </F>
State Duma Committee for CIS Affairs in Late March 1994" 
published under the rubric "Document": "The Duma Is Still 
Discussing Principles Concerning Support for Fellow Citizens 
Residing Abroad"] 
  [Text] 1. ...As the legal successor of the USSR, Russia is 
fully responsible for the fate of and ensuring the rights of 
noncitizens-former citizens of the USSR wherever they may 
reside. It is necessary to introduce the status of PERSONS 
EQUATED TO CITIZENS of Russia in order to ensure that this 
responsibility be discharged. 
  Individuals who are deprived of an opportunity to become 
citizens of their country of residence or do not wish to do so 
for a particular reason, but who in view of circumstances have 
not applied to become citizens of Russia, should enjoy the 
protection and patronage of Russia and the rights of citizens of 
Russia, except for the right to participate in elections to 
organs of state power, the right to a proportion of privatized 
property in Russia, and probably certain other rights. The 
status of persons equated to citizens shall cease automatically 
once citizenship arrangements are made (the person opts for a 
particular citizenship). (...) 
  2. First of all, it is necessary to strive to sign 
agreements 
on dual citizenship with all states-former republics of the 
USSR. In the event of becoming dual citizens, the Law on 
Protection of Russian Citizens and Persons Equated to Them 
Abroad would apply to this category of persons. 
  However, the patronage of Russia should apply to a broader 
community of people, that is, those who have become citizens of 
the new state and who do not have an opportunity to obtain a 
second, Russian citizenship. Direct legal protection and other 
protection for such people will be quite justifiably viewed as 
interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states. In 
this case, Russia can only proceed from the principles of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and see to it that human 
rights are upheld in all countries regardless of a person's 
cultural or ethnic affiliation, origin, and citizenship. (...) 
  Russia must look for a way to provide economic support for 
both the Russian-language educational system in the new foreign 
countries and the development of the cultural life of the 
Russian-speaking population. To this end, provisions should be 
made for preferential procedures for receiving education at the 
colleges of Russia (citizens and equivalent individuals should 
receive an education in Russia on the same terms as citizens 
permanently residing in Russia). It is necessary to develop a 
program for scientific and cultural exchanges and training in 
production, as well as a program for investment in the 
educational system abroad. (...) 
  Russia should also facilitate the self-organization of the 
Russian-speaking population by encouraging, for example, the 
creation of national-cultural societies, supporting the creation 
of economic structures affiliated with such societies, and 
granting customs or other preferences to such structures. In 
this case, the "titular" population would also be interested in 
the preservation and development of such enterprises and, 
consequently, in support for the Russian-speaking population. 
  3. Joint ventures in which the Russian-speaking population 
would become the main partner from the side of the new states 
must become a particularly important form of support for the 
Russian-speaking population abroad. It would be necessary to 
invest state funds in such enterprises, including the property 
of Russia abroad, and to provide incentives for capital 
investment by nonstate enterprises of Russia. 
  The creation of trilateral companies in which enterprises 
from the traditional foreign countries would appear as the third 
side could be the least painful path. It is also possible to 
support joint Russian-foreign enterprises, whose cofounders from 
the traditional foreign countries (for example, France) would 
create mixed companies in the new foreign countries (for 
example, French-Estonian companies). 
  Protection of the Russian population is not provided by way 
of economic pressure or blockades of countries behaving in an 
uncivilized manner but rather by way of developing cooperation 
that provides an incentive for the proper attitude of the 
government toward the Russian-speaking community. 
  4. The above points have referred solely to the 
Russian-speaking population. However, it is necessary to also 
support the same measures for the ethnic groups of residents of 
Russia that have preserved their national originality, for 
example, Chechens in Kazakhstan. 
  Germans, Meskhetian Turks, and Crimean Tatars--ethnic groups 
whose destiny has been associated with the forced resettlement 
of the 1940's--should also be supported. 
  In carrying out this program it is necessary to take into 
account the fact that a large number of people coming from the 
new foreign countries whose national and cultural interests are 
not satisfied reside on the territory of Russia. Improvements in 
the area of upholding the rights of ethnic minorities in Russia 
should be an integral part of the program of support for the 
Russian-speaking population abroad. This approach will testify 
to the sincerity of Russia and will deflect the charges that 
Russia is exploiting the slogan of upholding human rights for 
political purposes.

<F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Vydrin, director of the International </F>
Institute for Global and Regional Security, Kiev, under the 
rubric "Expert Review": "The Russian Bear and the Ukrainian Fox"] 
  [Text] As early as 1992 the Ukrainian prime minister 
said that Russia was waging a "cold economic war" on Ukraine. 
The economic and sociopsychological situation in Ukraine is 
indeed largely reminiscent of wartime. 
  The rate of inflation in the country has reached 70 percent 
per month, which comes close to the "world record" held by 
Serbia, which is at war. The average wage of about $10 is the 
equivalent of monthly earnings in the besieged Sarajevo. The 
20-30 percent a year fall in production is greater than in 
Azerbaijan. The vocabulary of many Ukrainian politicians and the 
mass media is close to that of the military. 
  Any war raises two main issues: "Who is the main culprit?" 
and "Who will win?" It is hard to answer these questions 
unequivocally. However, much can be understood and foreseen by 
comparing the complaints and mutual accusations of the parties 
to the conflict. 
  [Boxed item] 
<H5>  Ukraine's Key Economic Complaints About Russia: </H5>
  --it sells fuel and raw materials to Ukraine at prices that 
are destroying the Ukrainian economy, 
  --it has taken over the lion's share of the all-Union wealth 
(gold and diamond reserves, property abroad, and so on), 
  --it steals away the best skilled personnel--research, 
engineering, and technical--from key production sectors: the 
nuclear power industry, transportation, and so on, 
  --it buys up property on the territory of Ukraine in order 
to 
make the latter first economically and then politically 
dependent, 
  --it is neither punctual nor honest as far as payments for 
Ukrainian deliveries are concerned, and is indebted to Ukrainian 
enterprises. [End boxed item] 
  [Boxed item] 
<H5>  Russia's Key Economic Complaints About Ukraine: </H5>
  --it resells inexpensive Russian resources to other 
countries, 
  --it fails to coordinate its export policy with Russia and 
drives down prices for important Russian goods (metals, weapons, 
chemical products), 
  --it pursues an isolationist policy and hampers the natural 
processes of reintegration and the establishment of joint 
ventures, companies, and financial-industrial groups, 
  --it is neither punctual nor honest as far as payments and 
deliveries are concerned; its debt to Russian enterprises is 
immense. [End boxed item] 
  It cannot be determined who is right and who is wrong: The 
pitch of mutual reproaches is too high, the politicians and 
experts of the two sides too prejudiced and incompetent. Most 
probably, both parties are guilty to some degree. The 
politicians of Kiev are guilty of attempting to foist on Moscow 
a naively sly, unacceptable model of relations: Ukraine is 
completely independent of Russia politically, but receives raw 
materials and resources from the latter at domestic Russian 
prices. Russian politicians are guilty of failing to perceive 
Ukrainian independence for a long time and trying to foist on it 
the "suzerain-vassal" model of relations. However, practice has 
indicated that there is a natural limit to the deterioration of 
economic relations between the two countries. It turned out that 
neither country is capable of dealing to the economy of its 
neighbor a blow of such a force as to make the "cold economic 
war" grow into "hot" economic skirmishes. Apparently, 
politicians on both sides were mistaken in evaluating their 
forces. 
<H5>  The Mistakes of Ukrainian Policy </H5>
  In their calculations and plans, Ukrainian politicians have 
overstated the opportunity to strike retaliatory blows at the 
Russian economy. In the corridors of power and public opinion it 
was believed for a long time that Kiev is capable of coming up 
with a powerful "mirror-image" response to each of the punitive 
economic actions of Russia, in particular by waging a "guerrilla 
war" against enemy communications. It was expected that the 
threat of shutting off energy and transportation systems that 
pass through the territory of Ukraine and connect Russia to 
Europe would prompt Moscow to be more tractable. 
  This was a very dangerous concept from the outset. It posed 
the threat of an unavoidable escalation of economic, political, 
and military confrontation. First, the ambitious Russian 
leadership and public opinion, which were accustomed to the 
superpower position, are poorly equipped for a quiet search for 
a compromise. Second, Russian politics is markedly extrovert in 
nature and responds very sensitively to any attempt to isolate 
the country. The Russian establishment is prepared to pay any 
price and make any sacrifices in order to punish those who 
encroach on Russia's connections to the outside world. 
  The Russian bear would rather die than allow itself to be 
locked up in the Asian lair. However, fortunately for Ukraine 
and the entire world, Russia quickly found a way out. Kiev did 
not succeed in creating a Baltic Sea-Black Sea "buffer" or 
"exclusionary" zone: The Belarusian corridor was found in this 
space. Russia will attempt to shift its trans-European 
communications there, taking advantage of the pro-Russian 
sentiment that exists there, reinforcing it, and connecting the 
Belarusian economy to its own more closely. This is precisely 
why Russia is proceeding to create a unified ruble zone which is 
economically disadvantageous for it. Besides, Russian 
specialists quickly groped around for a new model of 
transactions with European partners. Now it is these countries 
rather than Russia that have conflicts with Kiev over blocking 
Russian-European communications. 
  As a result, by 1994 Moscow ceased to fear the threat of 
direct isolation from Europe, and therefore threats by certain 
Ukrainian politicians are hardly able to provoke the Moscow 
authorities to commit acts that are dangerous to the world 
anymore. 
<H5>  The Mistakes of Russian Policy </H5>
  Russia has overestimated its potential for economic pressure 
on Ukraine. First, Russian officials have already lost the 
monopoly on resource deliveries. The former state sector has 
rapidly converted to the commercial mode; for this reason, an 
ever increasing volume of refinery products is delivered through 
private channels which the government controls with difficulty. 
The government cannot manipulate prices, either: Despite the 
threats, many types of raw materials, including refinery 
products, are delivered de facto to Ukraine at prices below 
world market. It has turned out that Russia is incapable of 
quickly switching to other markets. The prediction that an 
abrupt deterioration of the economic situation in Ukraine would 
bring about a social explosion and a sharply stronger sentiment 
for reintegration did not come true, either. 
  The economic situation is truly as bad as it gets, but 
neither a powerful social explosion nor a tumultuous renaissance 
of the processes of integration has occurred. Why? Western 
Ukraine, for which the independence and sovereignty of the 
country have self-contained if not semi-religious significance, 
is prepared for any hardship. In turn, Eastern Ukraine lacks the 
full-fledged institutions of a civic society (with the exception 
of strike committees) due to which dissatisfaction with the 
economic decay is reflected in political demands only very 
slowly. No matter how bad the situation becomes, the likelihood 
of this resulting in a universal striving to reintegrate is low. 
Most likely, Ukrainian society will become differentiated into 
confrontational social strata and regions. Some will see 
excessively close economic links to Russia and its perfidy as 
the root of all evil, others, on the contrary, will see the 
severance of these relations as being just that. 
  The economic situation will continue to deteriorate, and 
differentiation in society will deepen along with this. However, 
as time goes by, the heat of accusations leveled against Russia 
by Ukrainian public opinion and political consciousness will 
diminish. Even extreme Russophobes are beginning to understand 
this: The main reason for the economic troubles is found in the 
sluggish leadership of the country lacking the determination to 
proceed with radical and rapid reforms. 
  Incidentally, paradoxical as it might be, I believe that had 
Russia switched to world market prices in mutual settlements 
with Ukraine right away, there would have been less Russophobic 
sentiment in Ukraine for a long time now, and the reforms would 
have also proceeded faster. This would have made the 
relationship pragmatic, reduced the field of mutual suspicions, 
and prompted Ukrainian leaders to look for effective economic 
solutions. This state of affairs would have removed suspicions 
concerning Russia's desire of to interfere in Ukraine's internal 
affairs. 
  Russian politics is extroverted, whereas Ukrainian politics 
is utterly introverted. The Ukrainian fox will not allow anyone 
to steal into his burrow. However, even Russian expansionists 
have almost grasped by now that the harshest economic pressure 
bears little fruit in the contemporary world. It may win a 
victory in a totalitarian political space. However, even the 
smallest liberalization immediately reduces the potential for 
economic blackmail. The time of the economic cold war is most 
likely coming to an end because its effect boomerangs.

<H5>  How Will Changes in the Economic Situation in Ukraine and </H5>
Russia Influence Their Mutual Relations? 
  Scenario 1. The economic crisis in Ukraine worsens 
catastrophically, whereas Russia succeeds in overcoming it. 
Under such conditions the eastern and southern regions would 
gravitate toward Russia still more strongly--up to the demand to 
join it. This course of events would almost unavoidably bring 
about a civil war, because western regions would not proceed to 
unify with the neighbor to the north under any conditions. The 
aggravation of the situation poses the threat of many millions 
emigrating, which may bring about the onset of chaos in the 
Russian economy. 
  Scenario 2. Ukraine finds a way to overcome difficulties, 
whereas the reforms in Russia end in failure. The harshest 
possible economic and political isolation of Ukraine from Russia 
would cause an expansion of emigrants from the north (there are 
about 7 million Ukrainians in Russia), which would crush the 
Ukrainian economy. 
  Scenario 3. Equalization of the progress of reforms brings 
about a normalization of political relations. Representatives of 
private capital from the two sides would act as lobbyists for 
this scenario. A great number of joint companies, corporations, 
and financial groups would appear. 
  Contrary to the opinion of various political forces, neither 
Ukraine nor Russia are objectively interested in the destruction 
of each other's economies. However, even with the most favorable 
outcome (Scenario 3) the countries will keenly compete against 
each other in raw materials, sales, and labor markets and fight 
for the favor of foreign partners. [End of boxed item]

<F P=106> [Article by V. Portnikov: "Crimea: A Bridge or Barrier? </F>
Elimination of the Regrettably Known Methods for Resolving 
National Problems Required"] 
  [Text] Russia and Ukraine found themselves facing the 
barrier of the Crimean problem, by the way, not for the first 
time in the several tense years of building bilateral relations. 
The victory of Yuriy Meshkov, who did not conceal his intention 
of altering the status of autonomy, in the presidential 
elections in Crimea compelled Kiev to take a close look at the 
contours of the drifting peninsula while confronting Moscow once 
again with an unresolvable dilemma--the choice between desire 
and possibility. 
  The desire to "recover" Crimea is so clear that it would be 
unwise to conceal it. At the same time, it is specifically 
Russia, along with the USA, that is the guarantor of territorial 
integrity of Ukraine which is parting with its nuclear armament. 
It is specifically Russia, which is building relations with its 
own ex-autonomies with difficulty, that is interested the least 
out of all the countries in the world in any territory 
proclaiming recognized independence and possibly shifting into 
another state. In other words the Crimean issue appears far more 
complex in Russian policy than in the Ukrainian one. 
  It seems that the first Crimean president, Yuriy Meshkov, 
who, in the course of his visit to Moscow, talked of political 
stability on the peninsula in a tone reminiscent of his recent 
opponent, Nikolay Bagrov, head of the Crimean Parliament, is 
beginning to understand this. Stability for Crimea, however, is 
maintenance of the status-quo. Attempts at sharp changes in it 
are no longer stability but the start of a civil war, a 
Russian-Ukrainian confrontation, activization of the movement of 
Ukrainian Tartars which will swiftly transcend constitutional 
bounds, and destroy the resort. It is possible that this will 
not signal the end of the political career of Yuriy Meshkov 
himself as he would be able to establish himself in Simferopol 
with the aid of the Black Sea Fleet, just as Vladislav Ardzinba 
did in Sukhumi. But who needs a second Sukhumi today? 
  The Crimean president, who evidently expected to become an 
equal partner of Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk, could have 
convinced himself at negotiations about the future of Crimea 
that more influential political forces in both countries are 
transforming him into a hostage of the situation on the 
peninsula. In that sense Meshkov, known only for his activity at 
meetings, is much more convenient than Bagrov from whom few 
expected any uncoordinated actions. For Russia, which is 
striving today for the return of "spheres of influence" lost 
following disintegration of the Soviet Union, needs not Crimea 
as part of it, but a lever for pressure on the most ambitious of 
the former Soviet republics (even though very soon Kazakhstan 
will easily surpass Ukraine here). For Ukraine Crimea is 
important as a real demonstration of the "sinister" intentions 
of the neighboring country and as proof of political pluralism: 
in our country even declared antagonists achieve success, Kiev 
is not London which acted far more rigidly and energetically in 
a similar situation in Ulster. 
  That is the way it will be as long as Crimea is a barrier. 
But even Yuriy Meshkov is already speaking of a Crimean bridge. 
But is the building of such a bridge possible given the initial 
positions of Moscow, Kiev, and Simferopol? I fear that up to now 
the stones used in building the foundation of such a bridge 
might prove to be merely new boulders for the barrier. The money 
which Russia plans to grant for the return of Crimean Tartars 
and the special emphasis which Ukraine makes on its financial 
participation, indicates that both countries know about the 
existence of another way. After all Crimea gained the status of 
a republic not because of any special position it has by 
comparison with other Ukrainian oblasts, but because the 
republic was already there and ceased to exist after the tragic 
deportation of indigenous people, primarily of Crimean Tartars. 
They remain the only deported nation which has not restored its 
statehood even formally. Simply speaking: their past, their 
tragedy was utilized by completely different people. Political 
careerism, however, which is noticeable in the case of the 
former Yugoslavia, leads only to slaughter. Before Crimea 
becomes the next hot spot Moscow and Kiev should use all 
possible channels of influence to legitimize the status of 
indigenous nations of the peninsula, naturally, taking into 
consideration the rights of those who enjoyed their hospitality. 
By the way, the latter form a majority anyway. They can elect a 
president and a parliament. The returnees only have a few seats 
consolidated by quota. That decision, however, will hardly 
secure true political stability on the peninsula. The principal 
problem of Crimea is that it may prove to be a ticking bomb even 
without becoming "a bone of contention." They might come to 
their senses in Simferopol after it is too late. Moscow and Kiev 
should help the Crimeans realize the unique position in which 
their land has been placed by historical circumstances and find 
nonstandard political moves--in other words, exclude the 
possibility for resolving national problems by the regrettably 
known methods. Believe me, that is more important than success 
or failure of the loudmouthed promises by Yuriy Meshkov, the 
economic experiments of Yevgeniy Saburov, and even the fate of 
the Black Sea Fleet.

<F P=106> [Article by O. Panfilov: "Russians Have Nowhere to Go nor </F>
Money to Do It. They May Become Hostages of Diplomacy"] 
  [Text] A high-ranking diplomat of the Russian Embassy in 
Dushanbe indicated to an Interfax correspondent that the flow of 
the Russian-speaking population out of Tajikistan decreased 
sharply. He believed however, that this is connected not with 
stabilization of the situation in the republic, but with the 
fact that Russians remaining in Tajikistan have "nowhere and no 
one to go to nor money to do it," primarily because the bulk of 
the population lacks money for the most essential products, to 
say nothing of renting a railway container. At present it is 
also difficult to sell an apartment inasmuch as those wishing to 
acquire housing have done so long ago or occupied vacant 
apartments which cannot be denied even by the authorities. 
Robbery is so common that, as the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 
correspondent was told, people may be robbed in broad daylight 
in Dushanbe having their shoes or a suit someone liked taken. 
  As underscored by the Russian diplomat in his interview with 
Interfax, around 368,000 Russian-speaking citizens left 
Tajikistan over a four-year period. According to the census 
there were 495,000 Russian speakers living in the republic in 
1989, of whom 288,600 were ethnic Russians. Thus around 100,000 
Russian speakers now remain in Tajikistan 80 percent of whom 
reside in the Leninabad Oblast, in the north of the republic, 
where combat operations have never taken place. Almost no 
Russians at all remain in the south of Tajikistan, for instance 
in the Khatlon Oblast, except for those in mixed marriages. 
According to the diplomat practically all of the 
Russian-speaking population of Tajikistan would like to leave 
for permanent residence in Russia, but lack of money "is an 
insurmountable obstacle." 
  The revelations of the Russian diplomat differ sharply from 
what was just recently announced by Andrey Kozyrev, the Russian 
Federation Minister of Foreign Affairs and General Colonel Boris 
Pyankov, former commander of CIS Commonwealth Peacemaking Forces 
in Tajikistan. In explaining Russian military presence they 
constantly recalled that they are performing a noble mission in 
protecting the Russian-speaking people against oppression by 
"Islamic fundamentalists." Tajikistan officials usually 
exaggerate figures in listing Russian-speaking citizens thereby 
gaining the support of both diplomats and the military. But the 
admission made by the Russian Embassy representative may evoke 
sympathy even among observers since, if the diplomat is to be 
believed, only around 20,000 Russian speakers, who are prepared 
to leave given the opportunity, remain in the main part of 
Tajikistan (beside the northern Leninabad Oblast isolated by two 
mountain ranges). This evidently explains the apparent slowness 
of Tajik authorities in adopting the law on dual citizenship and 
granting Russian the status of a second state language, which 
was promised by Emomili Rakhmanov back in the spring of 1993, 
when the treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual aid 
between Tajikistan and Russia was being prepared for signing. It 
is true, even then it was clear that the new regime would be 
unable to retain the Russian-speaking population, inasmuch as 
instead of stability there came crime--robberies, brigandage, 
murders. The Russian Embassy did not complain when Russian 
citizens--journalists or businessmen, were assaulted. It appears 
that the Embassy never did lodge a strong protest concerning the 
murder of a Christian Baptist family and a deacon of the Nikolsk 
Orthodox Church--at least it was never reported by any of the 
news agencies represented in Tajikistan. The Embassy remains 
silent as militant people's front members rape Russian girls (on 
8 December of last year, for instance, two female friends were 
raped and murdered in the basement of House No. 36 on the 6th 
Driveway on Gafurov Street in Dushanbe). 
  If the revelations of the diplomat were disseminated on 
purpose then could Russian diplomacy change its attitude to 
events in Tajikistan at all? Extending political and military 
support to the Dushanbe regime the Russian government most 
probably intended preserving the even then considerably thinned 
out Russian-speaking colony. The Russian community, which has 
externally preserved a position of neutrality for a long time, 
is suddenly becoming active, at first declaring that military 
presence of the Russian army must be continued as long as 
possible and two months ago demanding a quota of Russians in the 
Tajik parliament. The first demand is also quite explainable by 
the fact that architect Valeriy Yushin, chairman of the Russian 
community, is a member of the Russian National Council, whereas 
the second one diverges somewhat from what was said by Emomili 
Rakhmanov concerning the status of the Russian language and dual 
citizenship. Can a citizen of Russia and Tajikistan 
simultaneously be a member of the Legislative Assembly of 
Tajikistan. The language parity is preserved somewhat by the 
fact that three Russian-language republic and one oblast 
(Leninabad Oblast) newspapers are still published in Tajikistan 
even though with a limited circulation. The amount of television 
and radio programming in the Russian language has not increased. 
At the same time, as strange as that may appear, the opposition 
"Voice of Free Tajikistan" is broadcasting in Russian and Uzbek 
(and, of course, in Tajik) from the territory of Afghanistan. 
The shortage of Russian teachers in secondary schools and 
instructors in the higher educational establishments is already 
being felt in Leninabad Oblast as well. 
  The failure of Russian policy aimed at preserving 
Russian-speaking colonies in former Soviet republics is quite 
evident. It is likewise clear that resolution of internal civil 
strife by military means is not a panacea for the political 
impotence of diplomacy. In several months when the number of 
Russian-speaking citizens of Tajikistan decreases further, the 
presence of Russian troops waging a struggle against "Islamic 
fundamentalism," may acquire a different coloration.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Ignatenko, Gorbachev Fund: "Zone of </F>
Mutual Interest? Russia Has Separated Itself from Integration 
Processes in the Central Asian Region"] 
  [Text] Russian political scientists, diplomats, 
strategists, and publicists speak about Central Asia as "a zone 
of Russia's vital interests," about "Russia's foreign political 
priorities" in the region, etc. To look at the region's economic 
problems in depth, from at least two sides--both the Russian and 
the Central Asian--is the intention of this article. 
<H5>  Viewpoint </H5>
  Economic interdependence and, correspondingly, the need for 
close economic cooperation are such obvious things that it is 
awkward even to recall them. Russia and Central Asia are parts 
of a unified national economic complex of the former USSR. This 
complex was formed as a system with elements that supplement one 
another. The region is largely the source of a number of raw 
material resources that are either completely lacking in Russia 
or exist in insufficient quantities. The extremely large 
copper-porphyry, pyrite and stratiform deposits of Central Asia 
and the Transcaucasus lay beyond the borders of Russia. The 
situation was no better with respect to a number of other 
mineral-raw material resources. Russia has insignificant 
reserves of copper, manganese, chromites, strontium ores, 
germanium, potassium salts, etc. It is also necessary to mention 
cotton here. Russia's main supplier of it was Central Asia (with 
Russia's demand for 1,175,700 tonnes, Uzbekistan alone provided 
544,000 tonnes). This list could easily be continued. 
  Not only Russia depends on deliveries from the post-Soviet 
"South"; Central Asian countries are interested in them as well. 
Coal from the Kazakhstan Ekibastuz is intended for heating and 
electric power plants operating on the territory of Russia. The 
Karaganda Metallurgical Combine delivers to Russia about 2 
million tonnes of rolled metal a year. The problem of selling 
these and other products will inevitably arise if exports to 
Russia are excluded. 
  The existing organizational forms of economic cooperation 
between Russia and states of the post-Soviet Central Asia are 
developing (true, without very good results) within the 
framework of the CIS: An Economic Union of CIS States has been 
created, a number of interstate organs have been 
instituted--Interstate Bank, Interstate Council on Questions of 
Industrial Policy, etc. Cooperation is developing at the level 
of enterprises and branches. There is also a future for such 
forms as economic interaction at the level of border oblasts 
(for example, Omsk Oblast of Russia and Pavlodar Oblast of 
Kazakhstan). 
  But one gets the impression that the Central Asian states, 
while not destroying economic ties with Russia willfully, are 
trying to find an alternative to them, working within other 
organizational frameworks with states of the world South. Russia 
is jealous of this, but itself is exerting no active or positive 
resistance to it. 
  In my view Russia should take a considerably more active 
part 
in the regional and interregional organizations in whose work 
the states of the post-Soviet Central Asia have already become 
involved. 
  One of these organizations is the Organization of Caspian 
States (OPG, created in February 1992). Representatives of Iran, 
Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, and Russia participated in 
its creation. The degree of interest of the aforementioned 
states in this organization is shown also by the level of 
representation at the constituent assembly: The first three 
states were represented by the president, the fourth--by a 
deputy prime minister, and the fifth (Russia)--by the ambassador 
to the Islamic Republic of Iran. There is no need to enumerate 
the problems that could be resolved simply through joint 
efforts: raising the level of the Caspian, ecology, extraction 
of oil in the open sea, on the shelf, and along the coast, 
fishing, etc. Russia's passiveness could quite well be regarded 
as one of the reasons why nothing has come of the OPG so far and 
the aforementioned states are cooperating (if they are 
cooperating) in the aforementioned areas either on a bilateral 
or multilateral basis or within the framework of associations 
that do not include Russia. 
  Another example is the Organization for Economic Cooperation 
(OES, sometimes designated as EKO), which initially (since 
1984-1985) included Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan. With the 
disintegration of the Soviet Union, all the Central Asian states 
and also Azerbaijan joined the OES. Russia became a kind of 
initiator of maximum self-isolation from the OES. Moreover, the 
Central Asian states were given an ultimatum: either economic 
cooperation with Russia or participation in the OES. Not to 
mention the fact that the condition for Russian-Central Asian 
cooperation given above is insulting and unacceptable to the 
independent states of Central Asia, the question could have been 
posed differently. Why should Russia not join the OES? As far as 
I can judge, the OES regulations do not preclude that. 
  In order to give a full picture it is necessary to mention 
the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Zone (ChZES) created in 1992, 
in which both Russia and a number of states interested in 
cooperation in the neighboring Central Asia region (Turkey, 
Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia) participate. The coordination 
of this regional organization, to which Russia pays considerably 
more attention than to the one mentioned above, can be 
facilitated by untying several knots right in Central Asia. 
  Integration processes in Central Asia itself is a topic unto 
itself. They began "reactively," they were forced--as a 
completely natural reaction to the creation of the CIS as a 
quasi-Slavic association. Subsequently this separation and 
intraregional consolidation were reinforced by plans for a 
Russian-Ukrainian-Belarusian economic alliance and zigzags in 
Russian policy regarding post-Soviet Central Asia. True, the 
integration processes are extremely weak. It is difficult to 
imagine Russia's participation in these processes. 
  The plans to create new transportation communications 
(railroads and highways, pipelines, etc.) are a visible sign of 
future trends in economic cooperation. The building of 
communications routes tells us considerably more than serious 
agreements and widely announced declarations. 
  One Central Asian leader noted: "Previously all roads to the 
East (from Europe--A.I.) passed through Moscow." Now the new 
states of the region are looking for different roads, which very 
frequently bypass Russia. 
  The program of the Commission of European Communities (CEC), 
which is oriented toward the creation of a combined (rail, 
ferry, and sea) transportation corridor "Europe--Caucasus--Asia" 
is very attractive to the Central Asian states. The main route 
would bypass Russia--along the line of 
Almaty-Ashgabat-Turkmenbashi (formerly 
Krasnovodsk)-Baku-Poti/Batumi. 
  Each Central Asian country is exerting a fair amount of 
effort to create its own transportation access to communications 
centers of world significance. Thus Kazakhstan, having 
established rail communications long the route of 
Almaty-Beijing, is intending to extend this route to the 
territories of Turkmenistan, Iran, and Turkey, in order to reach 
Western Europe. Turkmenistan is speeding up the construction of 
the railroad route of Tedzhen-Serakhs-Mashkhad, which will make 
it possible to link this Central Asian country to Tehran, 
Ankara, and West European capitals. Iranian territory with 
renewed communications in the interests of Turkmenistan will 
become for the latter a kind of bridge to the Persian Gulf and 
the Indian Ocean. Through Kazakhstan, which is joined by 
railroad to China (Beijing), it is also possible to gain access 
to the Far East--the Asia-Pacific region (APR). Turkmenistan is 
also exerting efforts to create a gas line through 
Turkmenistan-Iran-Turkey-West Europe. Turkmenistan leaders also 
dream of laying a gas line to Southeast Asia, China, and Japan. 
Pakistan is prepared to open routes to the Indian Ocean for 
Central Asian states. 
  Regional communications could be affected by the 
implementation of an agreement between Turkey and Azerbaijan for 
the creation of a petroleum line, which will make it possible to 
transport Azerbaijani petroleum to a terminal on the Turkish 
coast of the Mediterranean Sea: Azerbaijan--Northern 
Iran--Nakhichevan--Turkey (Erzurum--the region of the 
Syrian-Turkish border--Yumurtalik). 
  The plan for transporting oil through a pipeline from the 
oil 
region of Tengiz (western Kazakhstan) to Novorossiysk is 
promising and mutually advantageous for both Kazakhstan and 
Russia. But there are serious obstacles to the implementation of 
this plan, the main one being Turkish interests: In the first 
place, since 1990 (because of UN sanctions against Iraq, which 
was prohibited from trading in oil in the full volume) the 
petroleum terminal of Yumurtalik on the Mediterranean Sea and 
the petroleum pipeline leading up to it have been inactive and 
Turkey is trying to put them to work; second, Turkey (largely 
because of the preceding factor but also because of a real 
concern for the ecological situation in the densely populated 
regions) is trying to prohibit large tankers containing oil from 
passing through the Bosphorus. If these Turkish interests (or 
one of them) are honored, the significance of the petroleum 
terminal in Novorossiysk will drop sharply. And oil from Tengiz 
could go not to Novorossiysk but to Turkey, changing the 
aforementioned route somewhat: Tengiz-Azerbaijan-Northern 
Iran-Azerbaijan (Nakhichevan)-Turkey (Mediterranean Sea coast). 
As far as one can judge, in this case too it is necessary to 
observe Russian interests: On the one hand, the petroleum 
pipeline should not extend through the recreation zone or the 
productive agricultural land in the south of Russia; on the 
other hand, Russia itself could hook up to this petroleum 
pipeline for its own advantage. This kind of untangling of 
communications problems which is convenient both for Russia and 
for the Central Asian states in the newly formed geopolitical 
and economic space is possible, apparently, in other cases as 
well, say, with the utilization of mechanisms for regional and 
interregional economic cooperation. 
  Thus Russia will undoubtedly be able to derive an advantage 
for itself from the existence of the transportation corridor 
"Europe-Caucasus-Asia." It could hook up to railroad lines 
through Chelyabinsk, and then the possibilities of the 
Transsiberian main line would also be taken advantage of. For 
many reasons the new Astrakhan-Kizlyar-Baku railroad line would 
not be superfluous either. Through the Caspian, Russia could 
join transportation flows along the Astrakhan-Baku route. One 
gets a sense of satisfaction that Russia is participating in the 
actions for coordinating the program (as an equal with the 
Transcaucasian and Central Asian states and also Iran, Turkey, 
China, Pakistan, Ukraine, and the states included in the CEC). 
  There is a mutual interest in having Russia supply the armed 
forces of the Central Asian states with various kinds of 
weapons, military equipment, and ammunition. All these products 
of the military-industrial complex can come only from Russia: It 
supervised the formation of the infrastructure, combat 
regulations, tactics--everything the armies of the newly 
independent states of Central Asia have inherited; further, the 
products are cheaper than in the West and of better quality than 
the Chinese, which coincide with ours in terms of many 
tactical-technical characteristics; regular deliveries are 
guaranteed; some of the states of Central Asia in cooperation 
with Russia could produce their own arms (from cartridges in 
Kyrgyzstan to aircraft of the AWACS type in Uzbekistan). 
  As for Russia's interests, they include above all the 
availability of a large and promising market for selling 
products of the military-industrial complex, cooperation with a 
number of enterprises of the Central Asian military-industrial 
complex, the use of testing grounds (especially Baykonur), and 
the acquisition of important military-strategic raw material. 
  Military cadres are a promising area of cooperation. At the 
present time there is a critical shortage of officers 
representing the "titular" population in the formation of armies 
of the Central Asian states. Russians and other Slavs make up 
from 70 to 90 percent of the officer corps. It will take at 
least several years to create a highly professional officer 
corps from local residents (again, not without help from Russian 
instructors and military training institutions). The service of 
Russian officers in armies of the states of Central Asia will 
help Russia to relieve a fairly critical problem of returning 
military servicemen to Russian territory. 
  In addition to the already tested forms of cooperation it 
would be possible to consider the following as well: The search 
for new forms of regional collective security (naturally, with 
the mandatory participation of Russia and, possibly, enlisting 
certain adjacent states); expansion of bilateral cooperation 
(for example, in the form of legal documentation with interstate 
agreements of Russia's military presence with Russian military 
bases); the transformation of collective (and essentially mainly 
Russia) forces into real coalition armed forces intended for 
protecting all the former border of the USSR in the Central 
Asian region; development of contract service for Russian 
citizens in armies of Central Asian states. It is not ruled out 
but rather suggested that there be military cooperation within 
the framework of the CSCE and the United Nations.

<F P=106> [Article by A. Kirpichnikov: "Russian Community in </F>
Azerbaijan Backs Geydar Aliyev and Sergey Baburin"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Russian All-People's Union holds press conference </H5>
  A press conference was held by deputies, members of the 
unregistered group "Russian Way", who visited Azerbaijan at the 
invitation of the Russian community (ROA) [Russian Community of 
Azerbaijan]. As a result a cooperation agreement was signed 
yesterday in the presence of the journalists between the ROA and 
Sergey Baburin's Russian All-People's Union. 
  Then the organizers spoke about their visit. They were 
received by Geydar Aliyev and other ROA leaders at the cultural 
center of the Slavs of Azerbaijan and visited camps for refugees 
liberated from Armenians, as well as settlements, and villages 
populated by ethnic Russians. According to the deputies the 
Russian community supports the policy of Mr. Aliyev and shares 
the burden of war around Nagornyy Karabakh, surprised at the 
indifference of the Russian side. The deputies condemned action 
taken by Armenia in seizing foreign lands, the non-fulfillment 
of UN resolutions, and the pro-Armenian SMI [mass media], they 
were also shocked by the state of the refugees and the inaction 
of Russia and underscored the loss of trust in it by Azerbajanis 
and local Russians. Mention was also made of recruiting points 
for mercenaries on Russian soil and of the fact that peace 
proposals of the Russian Federation with regard to the 
withdrawal of the warring sides from the line of contact are 
unacceptable to Azerbaijan. The only area in which the positions 
of Geydar Aliyev, the Russian All-People's Union, and the 
Russian community of Azerbaijan diverged pertained to the 
question of the revival of USSR: in calling for closer 
unification with Russia Mr. Aliyev stands for independence and 
the CIS; Mr. Baburin hints that first there is the CIS, and then 
it is not too far to something like the Soviet Union; the ROA 
chief, Mr. Zabelin, without being specific, speaks of unity. 
  That divergence leads to certain banalities. The problem of 
ethnic Russians in Azerbaijan, naturally, exists. Also a no less 
natural fact is that they support the leadership of the warring 
country in everything: this is not the Baltic region for 
you--expression of discontent may cost you some blood. And the 
desire to receive cultural support, and whenever possible 
materials support, from the historical homeland is totally 
understandable. The viewpoint of the Azerbaijan leadership with 
regard to its own actions and the Russian community, in 
connection with these actions, is equally predictable. Finally, 
the Russian Federation leadership must unconditionally support 
Russian communities on both sides of the front, both 
politically, socially and culturally. It must also take into 
account the attitude of the leadership of the warring sides 
toward the given communities, without even mentioning the 
historical, "geopolitical," simple political, and simple ethnic 
evaluations of what is taking place. 
  It is simpler for the Russian All-People's Union and it may 
allow itself to grumble publicly without being particularly 
concerned with objectivity. Let us say, a comparison of the 
situation in Nagornyy Karabakh and in Bosnia is completely 
proper: in both places it is terrible, in both places Christians 
are persecuting Muslims, and states not recognized by anyone 
were proclaimed on officially foreign land. Mr. Baburin, 
however, who visited both regions, in one case supports "the 
victim," and in the other "the aggressor." In order to preserve 
some semblance of logic he promulgates the version of a world 
conspiracy whose goal is to throw firewood on the fire of 
conflicts from any side just so that it would burn hotter--a 
world conspiracy understandably supported by world forces of 
Evil. With that thesis Baburin places himself not only in the 
position of a person with whom it is improper to argue, but, 
taking into account the literary legacy of Zhirinovskiy, in a 
position that is already occupied by a more astute predecessor. 
  Unfortunately, international "Baburinism" is peculiar to 
many 
leading and rank-and-file deputies of the State Duma who have 
visited one of the warring sides in some conflict, and it is 
completely normal if the deputation from the lower chamber 
dispatched to the Balkans will return with a similar world 
outlook. Even that, however, is not the entire problem. The 
reliance of truly suffering Russian-speaking, Serbian-speaking 
people, and others on political fringes or warring dilettantes 
leads not only to exaggerated self-appraisal and inadequate 
acts, but also, inevitably, to a cautious attitude by persons 
conducting real Russian policy.

<F P=106> [Article by T. Nikolayeva: "A Russian Holding Lithuanian </F>
Passport Is a Foreigner in Russia"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Yesterday Moscow introduced a new visa system for citizens </H5>
of the Lithuanian Republic entering the Russian Federation 
  Thus, at the present time ethnic Russians who acquired 
Lithuanian citizenship will feel themselves real foreigners in 
Russia, inasmuch as visas, even for those who were born and 
lived half of their lives in Moscow or in the Russian 
countryside, and have close relatives there, will be issued in 
accordance with the order established for citizens of foreign 
countries. In order to obtain a visa for a trip to Russia at the 
Russian Embassy it will henceforth be necessary to submit either 
an invitation from an organization, or an original of a private 
invitation registered with organs of the OVIR [Department of 
Visas and Registration] or the MVD [Ministry of Internal 
Affairs] of Russia, or a confirmation from a tourist firm 
engaged in the organization of tourist trips to Russia. 
Applications for a visa, standard questionnaires, and the three 
photographs must be submitted not later than 10 working days 
before the trip, and only in exceptional cases (funerals, 
illness, need for emergency medical treatment, etc) will this 
procedure, costing five U.S. dollars, be accelerated. All these 
expenditures--of time, nerves, and finances--are connected with 
the acquisition of a visa good for only a single visit. 
Multiple-visit visas are issued only upon coordination with the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation on the 
basis of sufficient grounds. 
  The winners were those who, being permanent residents of 
Lithuania, nevertheless obtained Russian citizenship, and, 
temporarily until 6 February 1995, those who are stateless. They 
retained the right to enter Russia without a visa. 
  The Russian consulate in Lithuania, of course, prepared 
itself but, as indicated by the sad experience of the Belarus 
Embassy, it will be impossible to avoid very long lines with 
overnight vigils at the entrance and tattered nerves. Even 
understanding very well that the introduction by Russia of the 
visa regime for Lithuanian citizens is merely a reciprocal step 
to "the European courtesy of Lithuania," Lithuanian ethnic 
Russians cannot comprehend why it was impossible to provide for 
certain measures for them ahead of time in order to ease the 
visa regime. Is it really that difficult to resolve the issue 
concerning mutual easing of the visa regime for citizens of 
Lithuania with the right to Russian citizenship, for instance, 
because of birth, and, correspondingly, for Lithuanians who are 
citizens of Russia with the right to obtain Lithuanian 
citizenship? Perhaps it would have been worth isolating that 
issue from other more complex problems of Russian - Lithuanian 
mutual relations? At present it is necessary to ascertain that 
Russia along with the Baltic states is "performing at the 
pinnacle of civilized behavior" in facilitating the maintenance 
of contacts with relatives for people.

<F P=106> [Article by Ivan Zasurskiy: "The Bankers Did Not Like the </F>
Proposal of the Deputy Prime Minister; the Congress of the 
Association of Russian Commercial Banks Has Opened"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Forum </H5>
  Attending the Fourth Congress of the Association of Russian 
Commercial Banks (ARB) were Sergey Yegorov, president of the 
ARB; Viktor Gerashchenko, head of the Central Bank; Oleg 
Soskovets, first deputy prime minister; representatives of the 
economic committees of the Federal Assembly, Nikolay Gonchar, 
Aleksandr Pochinok, Mikhail Zadornov; and also representatives 
of Russian Banks. 
  Attendees heard Sergey Yegorov's summary report of ARB 
activity during the years 1991-1993. Assessing the situation 
that developed in Russia, the president of the ARB emphasized 
the "untwisting and self-producing spiral of nonpayments," the 
"absence of any kind of price regulation," the "excessive level 
of interest rates," and also the anti-investment climate in 
Russia. It is his conviction that all of this could have a 
negative effect on the interests of those sitting in the 
audience. His report formulated the ARB positions on these 
problems and the possible ways to resolve them. According to Mr. 
Yegorov's words, in particular, "the absence of any kind of 
price regulation threatens to lead to total noncompetitiveness 
on foreign markets of even commodities of our traditional raw 
materials export in the near future." 
  Speaking about the activity of the ARB council, Sergey 
Yegorov noted that, as a result of the association's lobbying of 
the legislative organs, the commercial banks have already won 
hundreds of billions of rubles, which more than pays for the 
support of the ARB organization. 
  The speech of the president also contained a proposal for 
Viktor Gerashchenko to familiarize the ARB with normative 
documents before they go into effect, a disagreement with the 
position of the Central Bank on increasing the limit of the 
minimum capital authorization, hopes for the development of 
sound banking legislation, and the creation of a National Bank 
Board, which would be joined by all organs of economic 
authority, plus ARB representatives. 
  According to Mr. Yegorov, 5,000 crimes were committed in the 
financial sphere last year and 20 bankers were killed. The ARB 
is continuing to work on Security problems in the banking 
business, both in authoritative structures and among members of 
the association, which today has on the order of 800 banks. 
  Speaking at the bankers' forum, Oleg Soskovets proposed a 
number of measures for using the banking system in conducting 
the industrial policy of the government. In particular, one of 
his proposals consisted of directing 50 percent of the profit of 
banks from short-term speculative operations to financing the 
reconstruction of industry at a favorable rate. There was scanty 
applause when the deputy prime minister departed. 
  In the second half of the day, Viktor Gerashchenko gave his 
speech, during which he criticized Presidential Edict No. 1662, 
which talks about total voucherization with financial vouchers. 
However, Viktor Gerashchenko was less critical of the 
president's letter of 12 April, which gives recommendations on 
procedures for the bankruptcy of enterprises. This letter, in 
his words, makes it necessary to rethink the relations of the 
Central Bank with economic agents. Mr. Gerashchenko ended his 
speech with an answer to the likely criticism of excessively 
following the recommendations of the IMF. "This policy is being 
conducted by the government and approved by the State Duma, we 
cannot conduct any other. But if you do not like it, your voice 
must be louder," he said in addressing the delegates of the ARB 
congress.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Grigoryev: "The Chairman of the Central </F>
Bank Has Taken a Stricter Position on Credit: Direct Centralized 
Credit Has Been Acknowledged To Be Inefficient"] 
  [Text] In addition to the membership of more than 800 
domestic banks, the prestige of the ARB [Association of Russian 
Banks] was confirmed by the caliber of guests who took part in 
the proceedings of the ARB Fourth Congress. 
  Since the completion of work on the basic directions for the 
monetary and credit policy of the Bank of Russia coincided in 
time with a regular ARB congress, Viktor Gerashchenko devoted 
his report to outlining a fresh concept. This made it possible 
for the chairman of the Central Bank to avoid the direct, 
unprejudiced, and (judging by the experience of the previous ARB 
congress) generally nonsensical polemics with delegates to the 
congress while keeping his presentation topical and current. 
  In the belief that attaining stability and manageability in 
the monetary system of the country is its main objective, the 
Central Bank considers "the absence of effective instruments of 
control over the money supply" to be a high-priority problem. In 
conjunction with this, the concept--in the opinion of Central 
Bank representatives an extremely harmful one--of reorganizing 
the banking system on the pattern of the American Federal 
Reserve System poses a major threat. The emergence of several 
emission centers, even if with limited powers, will bring about 
uncontrollable growth of the money supply and will very shortly 
create financial chaos in Russia, cautioned Viktor Gerashchenko. 
  The generally standard methods of monetary regulation--a 
reserve requirement policy, the level of refinancing rates, the 
volume of credit outlays, at times interpreted in an extremely 
exotic manner, with the peculiarities of Russia taken into 
account--constituted the positive segment of the Central Bank 
program. 
  The volume of mandatory reserve requirements is, first, the 
main technique for regulating the credit multiplier; second, it 
makes it possible to influence the composition of the holding 
portfolios of banks by stimulating their interest in certain 
securities. The current level of these requirements (20 percent 
for demand accounts and 15 percent for time deposits) is quite 
high, which is however justified given the current inflationary 
situation. It is another matter that any structure of the 
reserve funds at all has been lacking so far. Tied-up funds sit 
in accounts at the Central Bank. Besides, an atrocious 
settlement system deprived the banks of an opportunity for the 
current management of reserves. The Central Bank is now ready to 
allow the use of state securities for meeting reserve 
requirements. It is understood that this is primarily about 
one-year treasury bills issued by the Ministry of Finance to 
cover last year's debt of the state budget to enterprises. The 
profit margin on these securities was set at the level of 40 
percent annually. Including the bills on the list of reserve 
assets is the only way to interest the commercial banks in them. 
  Mr. Gerashchenko greatly upset the bankers by confirming the 
intention to extend reserve requirements to foreign exchange 
deposits. Apparently, the interests of the Central Bank and the 
U.S. Federal Reserve System coincide in this instance. In recent 
years, the Federal Reserve System has been experiencing certain 
difficulties because of an increase in demand for cash dollars: 
the rate of cash emission has been above the index of inflation 
by one order of magnitude. The rapidly growing demand for 
dollars outside of the United States, primarily in Russia, is 
the main reason for this paradox. The Central Bank has now 
decided to support its American colleagues and will restrict the 
amount of dollars in Russia. 
  This year the Central Bank intends to make major changes in 
the principles and instruments of refinancing. Viktor 
Gerashchenko finally directly acknowledged the ineffectiveness 
and even the outright unprofitability of the direct extension of 
credit to enterprises by the Central Bank. Moreover, the Central 
Bank intends to rectify the consequences of its own credit 
abuses and not only root out this vice in practice but wipe it 
out in the documents, sanitizing to this end the balance sheets 
of banks that have participated in the distribution of 
centralized credit. Viktor Gerashchenko believes that the 
defaulted debt of enterprises by virtue of centralized credit 
should be converted into public debt with state obligations 
being drawn up. This touching concern for banks, most of which 
have made good money off the centralized-credit windfall, runs 
into a number of obstacles. In particular, quite a few loans 
were not extended by decisions of the government. The Central 
Bank extended some on its own, too. It is not easy to understand 
what obligations on these loans have to do with the public debt. 
  The quantitative planks for the volume of emission and the 
level of the refinancing rate have been set forth in a joint 
declaration of the government and the Central Bank. The Central 
Bank complied with them strictly in the first quarter. In the 
opinion of Viktor Gerashchenko, the planks are realistic. The 
chairman of the Central Bank commented on rumors concerning a 
prompt sharp reduction in the refinancing rate which were 
triggered by his presentation in the State Duma. Unlike ARB 
President Sergey Yegorov, who unambiguously evaluated the 
current interest rate policy of the Central bank of Russia as 
smothering not only production but also (!!!--Andrey Grigoryev) 
the banking system, Mr. Gerashchenko stated neatly that "the 
downward trend that has emerged in the credit market may render 
the refinancing rate unjustifiably high," and then the Central 
Bank will proceed to reduce it. The quotas of increment of 
financial aggregates (see BIZNES-SEGODNYA No. 28, 19 April) 
restrict the volume of credit to the banking system to 16-17 
billion rubles [R]. For this reason "the Central Bank effects 
financing under strict conditions." The volume of credit 
distributed on an auction basis will expand. Although 
regulations on centralized credit auctions provide for an 
opportunity for directed credit to the "real sector of the 
economy," the Central Bank will not facilitate this by reducing 
the auction rate. The Central Bank considers a reduction in the 
segmentation of money markets to be an important task of credit 
policy; to this end the Central Bank intends to structure the 
distribution of resources taking into account the demand 
emerging in the course of the auctions. 
  The Central Bank intends to compensate for the limited 
potential of refinancing by using new methods to sustain 
liquidity in the banking system. First, there is a transition to 
lombard credit. Having signed a contract of indefinite duration 
with a territorial main branch of the Central Bank, banks will 
be able to receive credit against the pledge of state securities 
and first-class bills of exchange. A list of these will be 
established by the Board of Directors of the Central bank. The 
interest on lombard credit will be higher than the refinancing 
rate. Second, if a debit balance is a threat, banks will be able 
to receive credit for up to seven days in an amount not to 
exceed 25 percent of the compulsory reserve fund against a 
pledge of first-class assets (foreign exchange, precious 
metals). The rate will be 20 percent higher than the refinancing 
rate. 
  As we evaluate the generally progressive plans, we are just 
left wondering what stood in the way of the Central Bank 
carrying out at least some of the aforementioned undertakings 
last year at the latest? 
  Besides, the chief of the Central Bank came out in favor of 
a 
major effort to reform the legislative foundation for banking. 
However, Mr. Gerashchenko emphasized primarily the legal 
problems of the Central Bank itself. In particular, two 
significant decisions that were incorporated in presidential 
edicts--the conversion of enterprise debt into bills of exchange 
and the indexation of deposits in the Savings Bank--were made 
without consultations with the Central Bank and were legally 
improper. As far as the issues of legislative regulation of the 
operation of commercial banks are concerned, they were 
substantively dealt with by Garegin Tosunyan, ARB deputy 
president and chairman of the Tekhnobank, who presented a draft 
of the banking legislation reform developed by the ARB. 
  The first deputy prime minister of the government greatly 
spoiled the mood of participants in the ARB Congress. Starting 
by outlining well-known truths to the effect that structural 
changes in the economy are the foundation for Russia's 
prosperity, including that of its banking sector, Oleg Soskovets 
put into words the measures that in his opinion are necessary 
for the industrial crisis to be successfully overcome. Speaking 
before the bankers, Mr. Soskovets decided to cover plans for the 
search for money. Naturally this was about distribution or, more 
precisely, administrative redistribution. The funds to satisfy 
the lobbyists supporting the "industrial" deputy prime minister 
are not available in the budget; the Central Bank has begun to 
display firmness on this score, having grasped the 
ineffectiveness of direct centralized provision of credit to 
"producers." This has prompted the government to turn its gaze 
to the vaults of commercial banks (it is to be understood that 
official statements by the first deputy prime minister reflect 
the point of view of the cabinet). 
  As a theoretical basis for the measures planned, Mr. 
Soskovets used the notion of the unlawfulness and fallaciousness 
of banking per se (which, incidentally, many of the speakers at 
the congress tried to refute, regardless of polemics with the 
deputy prime minister). In the soft wording of Oleg Soskovets, 
the notion was voiced as a thesis about the "unjustified nature 
of banks' profit from speculative transactions with foreign 
exchange and intermediary operations." In conjunction with this, 
the government considers it feasible to "allocate 50 percent of 
banks' profits from such operations as easy credit for retooling 
programs in industry and the agro-industrial complex." It is 
necessary to allocate one-third of the internal funds of 
commercial banks for the same purposes. Besides, Mr. Soskovets 
charged that the banks, having accumulated considerable funds, 
allocate them "to intermediary and commercial operations which 
do not bring about a growth of the stock of merchandise and are 
not associated with supporting state programs or investment 
activities." 
  Soskovets' first thesis calls for taking money away from the 
banks, while the second affects both enterprises and the 
population. After all, it is precisely their funds that the 
banks accumulate. The activities generating the growth of the 
"stock of merchandise" which the deputy prime minister means 
will plainly bring about a reduction in the real volume of 
capital. If the crazy ideas outlined above are implemented, the 
holders of bank deposits will at best receive symbolic interest 
on them, and at worst, will receive "frozen" accounts. 
  While we insist that the presentation of the first deputy 
prime minister should be viewed as the official position of the 
government, it is hard to seriously consider the government 
capable of such undertakings. Besides, Oleg Nikolayevich himself 
understands in retrospect that nobody will give him the windfall 
money to support state enterprises (some of which are becoming 
the property of Mr. Soskovets), and that the government is not 
in a position to "allocate" the capital of the banks anywhere 
without regard for the interests of shareholders and depositors. 
However, it is extremely lamentable that officials so highly 
placed allow themselves to engage in absolutely irresponsible 
and stupid twaddle, and then in premises as respectable as the 
Hall of Columns in the House of Unions.

  [Text] More than a half century ago the Russian philosopher 
I.A. Ilin predicted that the dismemberment and weakening of 
Russia would lead to very dire consequences for the entire world 
and reduce it to chaos. And the President of the United States 
is already admitting that in the new world, which was formed 
after the destruction of the communist system, there is less 
order. In the work of that same Ilin we find a precedent: Having 
been convinced that the weak Germany after 1945 became the gates 
for Soviet expansion to the West, the latter overcame its fear 
of the revival of a strong Germany and helped it to become a 
strong power again. 
  In brief, we are gradually gaining the understanding that on 
the territory of the former USSR we must create some kind of 
unified state formation based on the principles of democracy and 
a market economy, one that is economically, socially, and 
politically strong and stable. 
  The question arises: What about the numerous peoples who 
populate this space? 
  One must assume that the principle of national-territorial 
autonomy has not justified itself. Under the communists these 
autonomous entities were an utter fiction and as soon as they 
began to be filled with real content, blood was shed. To 
preserve them in the posttotalitarian society would mean endless 
conflicts because of disputed territories, endless Karabakhs. 
And, moreover, "since all the modern ethnic groups have been 
dispersed, national statehood does not fully satisfy the 
aspirations of those peoples that are actively striving for it. 
What, for example, can be granted to the Tatar ethnic group as a 
whole by Tatarstan's acquisition of independence, if only 
one-fourth of all the Tatars of the former USSR live on this 
territory? Who will represent and provide for the national 
interests of the 75 percent of the Tatars who live outside 
Tatarstan? Otto Bauer, one of the creators of the idea of 
personal autonomy, wrote at the beginning of the 20th century: 
"The purely territorial principle everywhere places the minority 
in the hands of the majority...to implement the territorial 
principle in its pure form means that each nation will swallow 
up the minorities of other nations taken into its body, but at 
the same time it sacrifices its own minorities who are scattered 
throughout other national areas." 
  All sober-minded political forces in Russia today are coming 
out in favor of restoring a unified state, admitting that the 
current principle for construction of the state, which was 
realized in the USSR--according to the ethnic principle, of 
course--will lead nowhere. 
  At the same time we must be aware that we will not be able 
to 
restore the province-oblast system in the same form in which it 
existed before 1917. The peoples have become accustomed to 
sovereignty and national states, and with the elimination of the 
national-territorial autonomous entities the question of what 
will replace them will inevitably arise. 
  What is the alternative? 
  The way out, in our view, consists in separating the entire 
sphere of interethnic relations from the notion of territory and 
providing ethnic-personal autonomy, whereby the bearer of ethnic 
sovereignty is not the territory but representatives of a given 
ethnic group regardless of where they may live within the 
boundaries of the "large" state. And the right to personal 
autonomy may be exercised not only by individual peoples but 
also ethnic groups (for example, among Russians-Kazakhs). 
  The idea of personal autonomy appeared approximately 100 
years ago in Austro-Hungary. In Russia by the beginning of the 
20th century it enjoyed support from all liberal and left-wing 
parties except for the Bolsheviks. 
  Under the tsar the right to personal autonomy was actually 
enjoyed by many "nomadic foreigners," particularly Kazakhs and 
Kyrgyz. They had their own self-government, elected their own 
bolushes (district leaders), biys (judges) and had their own law 
(adat) by which they judged their fellow tribesmen, etc. The 
tsarist administration did not intervene in their internal 
affairs; it simply collected taxes. Naturally, the European 
population residing on these territories were not subject to the 
local "foreign" authority. 
  After February 1917 attempts were made to realize principles 
of personal autonomy in other regions of Russia--in the Muslim 
Volga region, Siberia, Ukraine, and in Estonia, which had 
seceded, this principle was established right up until 1940. But 
as soon as the Bolsheviks came to power, promising all peoples 
"the right to self-determination right up to secession," and 
then turned their "sovereignty" into a fiction, no further 
attempts were made to realize the principle of personal autonomy. 
  What should be the real content of the idea of personal 
autonomy for the peoples of modern Russia? 
  In the first place, every nation should have the right to 
the 
external attributes of statehood--a president, a parliament, a 
flag, a seal, an anthem, etc. It is no secret that for 99 
percent of any people sovereignty is needed for the sake of 
sovereignty itself. This must be taken into account. 
  Let us consider the Tatar ethnic group as a concrete 
example. 
The president of Tataria should become the president of the 
Tatars, and all Tatars living in Russia should be under his 
rule, but representatives of other nationalities living in the 
Kazan Province would not be subject to him. Naturally, the 
question of whom to obey--their own personal-autonomous 
president or the Russian state--would have to be decided by 
every adult citizen for himself. Nobody would force a Tatar to 
be subject to the president of the Tatars if he did not wish 
this himself. 
  Each ethnic group, exercising the right to personal 
autonomy, 
should have its own press, radio, television, and also system of 
education in its native language right up to higher education; 
the forms and ways of organizing this--to create their own 
educational institutions or ethnic courses, departments, and 
faculties in general Russian ones (for example, Tatar at Kazan 
University)--these, naturally, must be decided by the peoples 
themselves. It goes without saying that they must be permitted 
to create private educational institutions where the language of 
the training, naturally, would be determined by the owners 
themselves. 
  The peoples must also be given the right to have their own 
legislation and courts. If a Tatar, for example, has killed or 
robbed another Tatar, why should the center intervene here? We 
must give them the right to judge the accused for themselves 
(the places for incarceration, incidentally, would most likely 
be common). The people should decide for themselves what kind of 
local legislation to have. 
  The center would intervene only when the criminal and the 
victim did not belong to the same personal autonomous entity. 
  It goes without saying that the center should retain the 
right to correct local laws in cases where they allow violations 
of the basic human rights or the integrity of the state. 
  The principle of personal autonomy of peoples should be 
combined with provincial (oblast) division of Russia. The oblast 
(province) should have a certain contingent of bureaucrats 
headed by the governor who would be responsible for resolving 
statewide issues on the territory of the oblast: the deployment 
of military units, the collection of statewide taxes, the 
functioning of strategically important highways and railroads, 
etc. 
  The personal autonomous entities might also be granted the 
right to issue their own money while, of course, all citizens 
and organizations of Russia would necessarily have to accept the 
Russian ruble as well. There is a precedent for this--in the 
Russian empire many national districts have the right to print 
their own money. 
  It would be more complicated with the so-called municipal 
services--public transportation, water, sewerage, street 
cleaning, etc.--everything that should be under the jurisdiction 
of the local authorities (we will call them zemstvos). How would 
the zemstvos (provincial-oblast, district-regional, etc.) relate 
to the organs of power of the personally autonomous peoples? The 
experience of the Russian empire cannot help us here since in 
those oblasts and provinces where peoples with something like 
personal autonomy lived there were no zemstvos. 
  Here is one of the ways of solving this problem: 
proportional 
representation. Let us say that in Kazan Province 50 percent of 
the population are citizens directly under the jurisdiction of 
the Russian state and the other 50 percent are representatives 
of the Tatar personal autonomous entity. In this case both would 
form up to half of the deputies of the province zemstvo. Whom 
the Tatars would delegate--elected, appointed, or if the 
deputies of the personal autonomous Tatar parliament residing 
permanently in Kazan Province would combine this deputy work 
with that in the zemstvo--they would decide for themselves. 
  This, in my view, is briefly the content of the idea of 
personal autonomy as it applies to Russian reality today. 
  In conclusion I shall mention the most widespread objections 
we have heard and try to respond to them. 
  1. This kind of organization of the state would be 
aimed at dividing the peoples. 
  Excuse me, but why would there be division if the people 
belonging to various personal autonomous entities were living in 
one state, constantly communicating with each other, and 
learning from one another; if, for instance, a Bashkir saw that 
a Tatar living in Ufa had greater rights, he could suggest to 
his personal autonomous organs of power that it would not be a 
bad idea for the Bashkirs to learn from the Tatars. And if it 
comes to that, are the sovereign national-territorial formations 
not proceeding more toward separation, especially if you look at 
who is calling for "sovereignization" now (see above)? The 
"ideal" national-territorial sovereignty would entail separation 
and placement of peoples in various autonomous quarters. This is 
shifting the blame, as they say! 
  2. Such a policy is apartheid since there would be 
different laws for different nationalities. 
  No. Apartheid is when one people or another have forced upon 
them a way of life that is different from the others. But no one 
will be forcing those Tatars to have their own legislation that 
is different from the Russian. They will be given the right to 
have it, and if they want to they will take advantage of their 
right--that is their business. And to be frank, 
national-territorial autonomous entities are similar to 
Bantustans. Every resident, for example, of Kazan, regardless of 
nationality, must obey the laws of Tataria whether he wants to 
or not. So again it is shifting the blame. 
  3. A very significant objection: The idea is not bad 
but the peoples who have developed a taste for territorial 
sovereignty will not go for it. I have also heard this: 
"Territorial-national autonomous entities are now hundreds of 
years old or maybe even thousands" (!). 
  And this in our dynamic age when everything is changing 
almost every day, to speak about hundreds and thousands of 
years?! Whether or not the people will go for this will be shown 
in the near future. At the beginning of the article I already 
said that two years of sovereign life have affected the 
awareness of many peoples.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Batygin: "Those Who Attempted To Set </F>
Up the Urals Republic Found Themselves... Ahead of the 
Locomotive"] 
  [Text] Today the State Duma will hold parliamentary 
hearings on "The Idea of the Urals Republic and the Prospect of 
Developing Parliamentarism in Russia." The initiative belongs to 
the Committee on Federation Affairs and Regional Policy, and was 
supported by the Duma Council. The greatest persistence in 
preparation of the hearings, however, was shown by Larisa 
Mishustina, a deputy of the parliament's lower chamber and a 
former chairman of the Glasnost Commission of the Sverdlovsk 
Oblast Soviet. 
  It would probably be appropriate to recall the chronology of 
events surrounding the sensational proclamation of the Urals 
Republic, which was characterized by the center as an onslaught 
of separatism on the regional front and produced the harshest 
measures in response. 
  A year ago, on 25 April, an opinion poll was conducted among 
Sverdlovsk Oblast residents. Of almost 2.3 million persons, 83.4 
percent replied positively to the question "Do you agree that by 
its powers the oblast should be equated to a Russian Federation 
component republic?" On 1 July of the same year the oblast 
soviet adopted the decision "On the Status of Sverdlovsk Oblast" 
whereby it proclaimed itself a Russian Federation constituent 
republic. On 27 October the session adopted a Urals Republic 
constitution and set elections to its legislative assembly for 
21 December. The elections did not take place, since on 9 
November 1993 the president of the Russian Federation issued a 
decree "On Suspending the Activities of the Sverdlovsk Oblast 
Soviet of People's Deputies." On top of that, the head of the 
oblast administration, Eduard Rossel--the ideologist of the 
creation of the Urals Republic--was dismissed from his job. 
  Thus the "mutiny on the ship" was put down; the attempt to 
raise the oblast's status, treated as a manifestation of 
separatism, was nipped in a bud. The new national constitution 
does not mention the self-proclaimed republic among Russian 
Federation components--it still lists Sverdlovsk Oblast. And 
now--the somewhat unexpected parliamentary hearings; a return to 
an apparently closed topic. Are Urals residents persisting? 
  A conversation in the Duma with "troublemaker" Larisa 
Mishustina on the eve of the hearings brought some clarity. 
  "Accusations of separatism are absolutely groundless," she 
dismissed my doubts resolutely. "There was never a question of 
seceding from Russia, of our own money and customs. There is 
nothing in the idea of the Urals Republic that could worry 
Moscow. We were acting within the framework of the constitution." 
  Turbulent processes, which lately have shaken regions 
formerly removed from big politics, have brought Russia to a 
qualitatively new state. Decentralization of power is taking 
place; republics, krays, oblasts, and autonomies gradually are 
coming into their own--into the political arena as independent 
subjects. The regions want not only to decide their fate but 
also to actively build the future state. This desire is 
especially great among those who are traditionally called the 
backbone of the Fatherland. 
  There are thousands of problems emerging today in the 
Russian 
provinces which need immediate resolution at the local level, 
without waiting for vague and belated "directives" from the 
center. Quality management is only possible today at the level 
of the regions, where direct feedback exists between the local 
authorities and the population. 
  "Naturally at the same time economic and political equality 
of the regions in their relations with the center should be 
ensured in real terms and codified in the law," says L. 
Mishustina. 
  The proclamation of the Urals Republic, in the opinion of my 
interlocutor, did not pursue the goal of attaining privileges 
only for its region. 
  "We were fighting," says the deputy, "for the constitutional 
rights of all regions of this level--those possessing a powerful 
economic potential, developed internal market, and democratic 
traditions. Our experience in proclaiming a republic should not 
be forgotten--it is a contribution to the development of the 
idea of federalism in Russia: Sooner or later this issue would 
have come up in another part of the country. Yes, we were in a 
hurry; that is why we moved like a battering ram and we are glad 
that the constitution proclaimed the principle of equality of 
subjects. Now we can, without staging a political showdown, 
calmly sort out the relations between the center and the 
regions, analyze the pluses and minuses. Until the law on the 
status of Federation components is adopted. But the task of the 
parliament is not only to adopt laws, but also to enlighten, to 
try first to understand what is happening on the local level, 
how federal relations are developing... By the way, we do not 
intend to limit ourselves to parliamentary hearings; we will 
hold seminars, conferences." 
  In their new capacity as Duma deputies, Larisa Mishustina 
and 
her colleagues now have the opportunity to look at the problem 
from a broader viewpoint, from different angles. Academics, 
members of the president's administration and his advisers, and 
jurists have been invited to today's hearings; Eduard Rossel 
will be there, too. By the way, when L. Mishustina and 
like-minded colleagues from Russia's Choice met with the 
president recently, she asked Boris Nikolayevich to reconsider 
the fate of the former head of Sverdlovsk Oblast administration, 
who in her opinion had been unfairly dismissed from his job. 
Yeltsin did not make a decision on the spot, but took the 
deputy's request into consideration. 
  Some time in the past our president said: "Federalism is a 
territorial form of democracy." It appears that the time has 
come to implement this thesis in practice. 
  ...In the Duma I also had a conversation with an expert--V. 
Yevdokimov, a chief scientific associate of the Institute of 
Philosophy and Law of the Urals Branch of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences. 
  "The Sverdlovsk Oblast administration," says Vyacheslav 
Borisovich, "could unilaterally announce: Beginning such and 
such a date we will reduce our transfers to the state budget. 
Instead of pressure, they chose a different way--to do 
everything legally to find a legitimate way to solve the problem 
of achieving the economic equality of Federation components. I 
will repeat what Larisa Pavlovna said: There is no separatism in 
the proclamation of the Urals Republic--only the principle of 
economic equality." 
  In our opinion, the political-legal experiment of Sverdlovsk 
residents--proclaiming themselves a republic--despite being 
unconstitutional at the time, deserves attention. It was 
rejected in the best traditions of the command-administrative 
system, without talking things out with the authors, without a 
serious study of the proposal's substance. I have a persistent 
feeling that in the strategic development of ideas of federalism 
the Urals people ran "ahead of the locomotive" and therefore 
found themselves ruthlessly crushed by the state system of 
administration, which is only beginning to acquire new features. 
  Nevertheless, the question remains open. In a sense, I think 
that regardless of its outcome, today's conversation in the Duma 
on the role and status of regions on the basis of the Urals 
example should be marked as a credit to our young parliament.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Petukhov and Andrey Ryabov, under </F>
rubric "Hypothesis": "Game of Duckpins as a Form of Political 
Mobilization"] 
  [Text] Which of the currents of political ideology 
will dominate on the Russian political Olympus? Discussions 
about whether the radical reformers will return to their 
first-place roles in the government, or whether they have 
definitely yielded the initiative to the moderate conservatives, 
or perhaps even to the more "drastic" national-patriotic 
opposition, are not professional exercises engaged in by 
political experts and journalists, but the completely normal 
reaction to the indefiniteness and instability of the current 
political situation in Russia. 
  Forecasting the chances of success by various parties or 
movements is more purposeful if one relies not upon conjectural 
findings, but on the analysis of the state of the Russians' 
public awareness and those priorities toward which that 
awareness is gravitating. Definite food for thought on this 
subject is provided by the results of a comprehensive 
sociological study conducted by the Russian Independent 
Institute of Social and National Problems in February-March 1994 
(a total of 1700 respondents in 10 regions of the country were 
polled). 
  Most of the persons polled (55.7 percent) state that they 
are 
in favor of a socially oriented market economy ("the state must 
guarantee all citizens a social minimum, and whoever wants to 
get more must attempt to do so himself"). For purposes of 
comparison: the ultraliberal economic model ("the state must not 
interfere in the life of the citizens; each individual must 
count only on himself") and the more moderate version of the 
same liberal model ("the state must help only the weak and 
helpless") are supported, respectively, by 4.2 percent and 13.0 
percent of the respondents. A total of 22.4 percent of those 
polled give their preference to the orthodox communist system of 
social equalization. Most Russians unambiguously link their 
hopes of the arising of a new socioeconomic model with the 
development of entrepreneurship (all told, 63.8 percent of the 
respondents asserted that they would like personally to engage 
in that type of activity). 
  Having defined themselves with respect to socioeconomic 
policy, Russians demonstrate a high degree of mistrust in the 
authority. This, in particular, manifested itself clearly when 
they answered the question of what today represents the greatest 
danger to Russia. A total of 53.9 percent mentioned the increase 
in crime; 42.8 percent, the impoverishment of the population; 
39.4 percent, the impotence of the political authority; and 24.4 
percent, unemployment. In other words, most Russians do not 
believe in the ability of the political establishment to 
guarantee an acceptable level of social and economic stability 
in the country or to resolve effectively the tasks that only the 
state can and must resolve, and therefore they are counting only 
on their own strengths. 
  At the same time, when evaluating their personal prospects, 
55.2 percent of the respondents remarked that their life in the 
near future will improve or, if worse comes to worst, will 
remain unchanged. The fairly high indicator of "personal 
optimism" reflects the population's ability to adapt to the 
complicated conditions of the current transitional period. 
  Yet another sign of the Russians' distrust of authority is 
the low rating of the political leaders. G. Yavlinskiy received 
the support of 23.5 percent of the respondents; B. Yeltsin, 
17.2; Ye. Gaydar, 16.7; V. Zhirinovskiy, 9.2; G. Zyuganov, 8.8; 
S. Shakhray, 6.7; V. Chernomyrdin, 5.9; and A. Rutskoy, 2.2 
percent. Incidentally, it is completely possible to link G. 
Yavlinskiy's relative success with the preponderance of the 
votes in favor of a socially oriented market economy, because 
the image of that politician, who proclaimed the slogan "a 
different reform" is linked by the mass consciousness with his 
adherence specifically to that path of development. But 
nevertheless the number of percentage points garnered by the 
leader of the Yabloko [Apple] block is obviously insufficient 
for him to lay claim to the role of the expresser of the will of 
the majority of the population. 
  After becoming acquainted with the figures that have been 
given, it might seem to certain people that Russians have 
completely lost their interest in politics, and therefore, for 
the political leaders in the current situation, it does not make 
any sense to seek a magic formula for success. However, this is 
definitely not so. In the opinion of 66.2 percent of those 
polled, there must exist in the country some kind of commonly 
held idea that is capable of uniting all segments of society -- 
the entrepreneurs, workers, intellectuals, the military, and 
rural inhabitants. The results of the study do not make it 
possible with sufficient accuracy to understand exactly what 
that idea is. The range of opinions is extremely broad: 20.8 
percent of the respondents feel that the democratic forces are 
capable of providing a better future for the country; 18.0 
percent put their hopes on receiving aid from the West; and 11.5 
percent, to one degree or another, are counting on the positive 
role of the Orthodox church. Nevertheless one is struck by the 
fact that, all told, more than half those polled (56.6 percent) 
expressed their sympathies with various public forces and the 
traditionalist-state orientation. 
  Summing up what has been stated, we take the risk of 
hypothesizing that in the mass consciousness there is a growing 
need to have a new social force or leader emerge on the 
political scene, a force or leader capable of combining in their 
activity the ideas of a socially oriented market with adherence 
to traditionalist political and spiritual values. 
  It would seem that, among the current Russian parties and 
movements, there are a rather large number of people who openly 
declare their "neoconservatism." Nevertheless, their loud and 
promising political declarations are not finding the proper 
support among Russians. The reason for this is the fact that all 
of them, in one way or another, are linked with the present 
political establishment, which is responsible, in the 
population's opinion, for the current woeful state of the 
country. Therefore, in order to lay claim to the role of a truly 
influential political force of the neoconservative persuasion, 
simply the adherence to an ideology that integrates the slogans 
of market social liberalism and spiritual-political conservatism 
is obviously insufficient. A leader who attempts to occupy a 
particular political niche will have to appear in the public's 
opinion as -- in the full sense of the word -- a new person in 
Russian politics. In addition, Russians are completely fed up 
with verbose discussions of ways to bring the country out of its 
crisis, and they currently are inclined, to a much greater 
degree than previously, to believe populist promises (we might 
recall, for example, the recent successes of V. Zhirinovskiy, 
who currently has already lost a considerable part of his 
previous popularity because of his unproductive position in the 
State Duma). Proceeding from this point, one can assume that the 
leader or party that lays claim to success, while differing only 
slightly on the basis of world-view position from the views 
expressed by the current moderate conservatives -- from PRES to 
DPR -- will attempt to achieve mass support with the aid of 
slogans that are simple and easy for the rank-and-file voter to 
understand, while also using untraditional forms of political 
mobilization. The example of the headlong ascent of S. 
Berlusconi to the political Olympus in Italy, a country which, 
throughout the entire twentieth century had seemingly 
anticipated the changing of the political climate on the 
European continent, apparently should be viewed as a symptom of 
these kinds of changes. The catchy motto "Fozze, Italia! 
("Forward, Italy!), plus the organizing of an election campaign 
modeled on clubs made up of fans of the Milan soccer team that 
is loved by millions of Italians, in addition to the criticism 
of the First Republic elite that had discredited itself -- those 
are the basic components of the successful debut of the 
telecommunications king from the Apennines in the big political 
games. And, incidentally, talking about criticism. According to 
our research, the largest number of people polled assume that 
the following are to blame for Russia's current misfortunes: 
Communists (34.1 percent); the nomenklatura (26.1 
percent); and the Mafia (20.0 percent). Thus, it is not 
difficult to predict the "critical component" in the program of 
the Russian Berlusconi. What might be the basis at such time of 
the untraditional political mobilization -- a game of duckpins, 
societies of amateur orchard growers or worshippers of the 
intoxicating amber beverage, people's walks -- remains only a 
guess. To those, however, who will rush to reproach us for 
overlooking the possibility that Russian neoconservatism will 
become fascist, we might note that, all told, only 23.2 percent 
of the respondents are inclined to see in our current mess the 
results of intrigues by various "dark forces" -- American 
imperialism, the Masons, international financial circles, etc. 
And more than half the people polled (52.2 percent) assume that 
Russians are the same nation as the other nations of the Russian 
Federation and should not play any special role.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Serba, member of the Council of Experts </F>
for Cossack Affairs under the Ministry for Nationalities Affairs 
and Regional Policy, under the rubric "Position": "The State 
Duma Has Not Yet Started on the Cossacks Issue: The Cossacks Are 
Shifting Their Interest to Regional Power Structures"] 
  [Text] The Cossacks had barely asserted themselves as a 
public movement as they rushed to establish contacts with the 
legislative organs of the then USSR. This was only natural: 
Their desire to restore the Cossacks' use of land and the 
hetmens' self-rule as well as the formation of a Cossack unit in 
the army had to find support in the appropriate legal acts. 
Plans for the future included the creation of a professionally 
trained group of Cossack deputies who would defend the Cossacks' 
interests under the complicated political and ethnic situation 
emerging in Cossack regions, mostly in the Kuban, Terek, and 
North Kazakhstan. 
  The board of the Cossack Union, which was the first mass 
Cossack organization created in the USSR, set its stake on the 
USSR Supreme Soviet and put immense effort into its work with 
deputies from the Cossack regions. These attempts were not 
successful, however. Kuban was represented in the Supreme Soviet 
by the ill-famed Ivan Polozkov; other Cossack regions were 
represented by just as incongruous local party leaders. The 
Cossack Union could not "delight" the Cossacks with any single 
act that would have anything to do with them, not even an act on 
their rehabilitation. 
  Hardly any more success was achieved in the highest 
legislative organs by another public Cossack organization, the 
newly restored Union of Russian Cossack Troops, which had been 
eliminated by the Bolsheviks. Unlike the Cossack Union, it 
managed to establish contacts with the Russian parliament. It 
used a new approach in coordinating its activities with the 
leaders of those political parties and deputy associations whose 
policy in one field or another corresponded with Cossack 
interests. An attempt to set up a group of Cossack deputies who 
would work to restore the Cossack status met with no success. 
  The lack of any significant results shown by the Cossack 
Union and the Union of Russian Cossack Troops in their work in 
the highest legislative organs of both the former USSR and the 
Russian Federation caused a certain disappointment in them among 
the Cossacks, who shifted their attention to the regional power 
structures. The 70-year-old pronouncement of Don hetman Kaledin 
that "The healing of Russia should start with the outlying 
areas" has been spread widely; whether it is appropriate or not, 
people keep quoting a statement by Novosiltsev, a contemporary 
member of the Union of Cossack Troops: "Given the current 
situation, it is impossible to form any state power in Russia. 
Power should be established in the provinces, in the oblasts, 
and from there it should spread to the center and then settle." 
  Most of the Cossack leaders came to the latest elections 
with 
this idea of creating a strong local power which would become 
the Cossacks' ally. As a result, the votes of many millions of 
Cossacks supported a large variety of parties and election 
blocs, from Russia's Choice to the communists. The support of 
the Cossack voters was quite considerable and some of the 
Cossack hetmen have joined regional representative bodies (some 
of them were even elected to the Russian State Duma). This 
allowed the local Cossack organizations to resolve some critical 
issues, mostly legal or economic in nature. However, the 
emergence of these "Duma Cossacks" did not do anything for the 
Cossack community of Russia as a whole. They were elected from 
various "non-Cossack" parties and blocs and, being promoted by 
one or another structure that financed their election, these 
deputies, instead of working for the Cossacks, had to "pay back" 
by working for those who had financed their successful election 
campaigns and ensured them victory over the other candidates. 
  Three months have passed since the State Duma started work, 
but nothing has been uttered from its podium yet about the 
situation of the Cossacks on the Terek or in North Kazakhstan, 
or about the threat of ethic and social explosions in the Kuban 
and Don. Nothing was said either about any mechanism allowing 
implementation of presidential edicts on Cossack 
self-administration and use of land, or about correlating these 
edicts with legislation on Cossacks' federal service. In order 
to change the situation, the Cossacks may act as an independent 
force at elections to all-Russian representative bodies and 
produce their own socioeconomic program. One must also remember 
that the Cossack movement is well organized and its participants 
are socially active and disciplined (the percentage of voting 
Cossacks is much higher usually than the same figure for other 
sections of the population). But the weakness of the Cossack 
movement lies in its lack of unity, in the absence of accord 
among its leaders. The hetmen of various Cossack units and 
unions cannot come to a mutual understanding, are unable to 
design a mutually acceptable pre-election program. Therefore, 
the total number of Cossacks proclaims only its potential 
possibilities, but not its realistic strength. 
  One of the strong points of the Cossack movement is the fact 
that it is scattered over the entire territory of Russia and 
represents all social strata of our society. The Cossacks enjoy 
more popularity with people from other locations in non-Cossack 
areas. The reason for this lies on the surface: Other residents 
of Cossack regions are concerned about violations of their 
rights and therefore observe the Cossack movement with 
apprehension; but residents of "non-Cossack" territories do not 
have the same emotions and view the idea of restoring the 
Cossack status with more objectivity. Thus, the three Cossack 
propagandists from the Cossack association in Moscow managed to 
collect more signatures in Novgorod Oblast for support of Don 
hetman Kaledin than the Cossacks of the Kuban and Orenburg areas 
taken together. The result of propaganda may be a lot more 
effective in other areas, for instance, the north of Russia and 
the subpolar region, which have large numbers of descendants of 
the repressed Cossacks. During the election campaign the 
Cossacks may move outside their traditional regions and 
transform the entire territory of Russia into their field of 
action. 
  But in order to achieve any success in the pre-election 
struggle, the ultimate goal set for the Cossack movement should 
be other than a fight for privileges. Only in this case can the 
Cossacks realistically count on the support of the Cossack 
population. The Cossack movement does not have any well-known 
leaders on the all-Russia scale. It should rely on the 
provisions of its program but not on the popularity of certain 
"leaders" who bore us on TV. It should prove that a strong 
Cossack movement is needed for the purpose of reviving all 
Russia and establishing its army.

<F P=106> [Summary of report by F.G. Khamidullin, deputy prime </F>
minister of the Republic of Tatarstan, at the 19th Session of 
the Republic of Tatarstan Supreme Soviet: "Results of the 
Republic of Tatarstan's Socioeconomic Development in 1993 and 
the Forecast for 1994"] 
  [Text] Esteemed People's Deputies! 
  A most important event in the life of the republic was the 
conclusion of the treaty between Russia and Tatarstan, which 
affords new opportunities for the socioeconomic development of 
the republic. The government has drawn up and adopted an action 
program for realization of the treaty, which will largely 
determine the directions of our activity in the current year. 
  Permit me to dwell briefly on the progress of the economic 
reforms. Mention should be made briefly of being among the most 
important measures in this sphere in 1993 for the further 
development of the processes of privatization and 
denationalization in accordance with the republic program 
approved by the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Tatarstan. 
More than 300 enterprises with summary statutory capital of more 
than R427 billion have been privatized in the course of its 
realization. They include the Tatneft, Nizhnekamskneftekhim, and 
Orgsintez associations, the Kazan Engine-Building, Kazan 
Helicopter, and Tatmyasoprom plants and the Chistopol Watch 
Works, the Tatnefteprovodstroy Trust, and others. The privatized 
industrial enterprises manufactured more than 40 percent of the 
total commodity product. The privatization of housing has begun. 
  Work on the issue of registered privatization deposits got 
under way. Fifteen specialized check investment funds, which 
have altogether accumulated privatization checks totaling more 
than R10 billion, were functioning in the republic by the end of 
the year. 
  F.G. Khamidullin went on to say that as a result of the many 
months of work of a large group of specialists, scientists, and 
employees of economic departments a program of the targeted 
social protection of the populace, the first in the CIS in 
practice, had been prepared. Its realization will make it 
possible to protect more efficiently the needy strata of the 
population of the republic under the conditions of the 
development of market relations. 
  An important instrument of government regulation of the 
economy in 1993 was the use of the system of the preferential 
allocation of credit. A special commission of experts under the 
auspices of the State Committee for Economics and Forecasting 
made an expert appraisal of almost 400 specific plans presented 
by the enterprises, took the most efficient of them, and 
recommended them to the government for the preferential 
allocation of credit under the strict supervision of the banks 
and the State Committee for Economics and Forecasting. 
  Realization of the agrarian reform continues. Of the 884 
kolkhozes and sovkhozes which underwent reregistration, 702 
retained their status, and 182 farms were reorganized. More than 
4,000 persons are employed at the 725 peasant (private) farms 
that are operating at this time. They have been allocated 24,300 
hectares of land, 642 tractors, 340 motor vehicles, 78 
grain-harvesting combines, and the requisite set of agricultural 
equipment. Some R589 million of credit resources and R170 
million from the republic budget were allocated last year for 
the development and formation of these farms. 
  The speaker then called the deputies' attention to certain 
negative trends causing the government particular concern. It is 
a question primarily of the decline in industrial production. 
The main reason is the nonpayments problem. The sum total of 
receivables from customers, the majority of whom are outside of 
the Republic of Tatarstan, amounted as of 1 March to 
approximately R2.3 trillion, of which more than one-third is 
past due. The economic development of our republic also will 
depend to a considerable extent on the measures that are adopted 
to resolve the problem of arrears on the scale of Russia. After 
all, a large part of the biggest enterprises works for the 
Russian market. Another problem is the enterprises' lack of 
preparedness for operating under the conditions of the 
competition that has arisen and their inadequate knowledge of 
market conditions. 
  The year of 1994 must be one of the real stimulation of the 
structural reorganization of the entire economy. What are the 
specific directions of the structural transformations? One of 
the main ones is a fundamental restructuring of the 
military-industrial complex. The transformations have begun by 
way of the state's selective support on the basis of a 
competitive seeding of the most rapidly recoupable business 
projects in areas of significance for the republic. Conversion 
problems came to be tackled more actively in 1994 with the 
Russian Federation Government. Specifically, measures to reduce 
the debt to enterprises of the republic's military-industrial 
complex for special products manufactured in 1993 were adopted. 
The enterprises have begun to obtain funds for advance payments 
for the defense order for 1994. This is a direct result of the 
treaty that has been concluded between the Russian Federation 
and the Republic of Tatarstan. A special commission has been 
formed under the auspices of the State Committee for Economics 
and Forecasting of the Republic of Tatarstan for a fuller 
analysis of fulfillment of the mutual commitments in respect to 
the defense block. 
  Serious structural changes are needed in the republic's oil 
and petrochemical complexes. An oil-producing republic lacking 
extended petroleum refining for fuel and oil remains dependent 
on monopoly refiners. In addition, the reserves of high-grade 
oil are being depleted, and the wear and tear and depreciation 
of the petrochemical works continue. This is why a number of 
alternatives involving the attraction of foreign capital is 
being worked up and the Neftekhiminvestk holding industrial and 
financial group has been created in the republic. 
  The areas for a number of new crops--corn for grain, rape, 
and sunflower for oil seeds--are being increased in sectors of 
the agro-industrial complex. The breed is being improved in 
animal husbandry. Thus we have smaller numbers of cows than in 
neighboring Bashkortostan, but the dairy product output is 
greater here. The facilities for the processing of the 
agricultural product are being reinforced at the same time--the 
sugar refineries, meat-packing plants, and milk-conversion 
enterprises are being modernized. The purpose of all these 
transformations is to improve the republic's food balance to 
achieve self-sufficiency in the basic food types with the 
simultaneous creation of a competitive market environment. 
  The structural transformations should also encompass other 
sectors, the nonproduction sphere included. Thus the market is 
already signaling a shortage of skilled managers, accountants, 
and other people capable of working under market conditions. 
  The entire ideology of government support for structural 
transformations of the economy is essentially changing. Support 
must be targeted exclusively at a specifically computed project. 
The times of support for everyone in succession have passed. 
  The structural transformations will produce results with 
simultaneous institutional changes. The development of 
alternative forms of property and competition and the formation 
of a secondary securities market will create a fundamentally new 
environment for all subjects of the market. 
  Support for enterprise should be among the priority areas in 
1994. A draft of the corresponding program has with the active 
participation of the Trade and Industry Chamber of the Republic 
of Tatarstan been prepared in execution of the edict of the 
president of the Republic of Tatarstan. It provides for measures 
of support for small business and the priority areas of the 
economy, the granting of tax privileges and preferential credit 
included. The realization of this program will contribute to the 
further development of the infrastructure of the market and the 
formation of a competitive environment. 
  An acceleration of the pace of denationalization and 
privatization will contribute to a considerable extent to the 
development of market relations in the republic. A further 450 
enterprises will be privatized in 1994. They include the 
Tatenergo and Zavod imeni Sergo associations, computer systems, 
Elekon, and others. The privatized industrial enterprises will 
manufacture more than three-fourths of the total commodity 
product in the republic as a whole. 
  The set task for the creation of a competitive environment 
in 
1994 is an acceleration of the rate of privatization of trade, 
public catering, and consumer service facilities. 
  A most important task of 1994 is the privatization of 
housing. Only 5 percent of the apartments out of the total 
amount of housing subject to privatization has been privatized 
in the republic at the present time. It is contemplated having 
raised this indicator to 30 percent by the year's end. 
  Proceeding from the current situation, the speaker 
emphasized, the forecast of the economic and social development 
of the republic for 1994 is oriented toward support for the 
life-sustaining sectors of production and also selective support 
for the enterprises that are prepared to secure the rapid 
recovery of the resources invested in the interests of the 
republic's economy. Industrial production is to constitute 
R12.365 trillion, and output in comparable prices will decline 
17 percent here. 
  The overall decline in the level of production in the 
republic as a whole will be influenced appreciably by fuel 
industry. The reason for this is the reduction in the production 
of oil and gas, the continued deterioration in the structure of 
the reserves, and the fraught environmental situation. 
Accordingly, a decline in production in petrochemical industry 
and power engineering is anticipated; a decline of 15 percent is 
forecast at enterprises of the defense sectors. 
  A number of enterprises, including the Kama Truck Plant, is 
forecasting an increase in the manufacture of its product in the 
mechanical engineering and metal-working sectors. A certain 
increase in production is expected in the food sectors of 
industry. Despite the crisis situation, a number of associations 
and enterprises is operating in stable fashion. They include 
computer system associations, the Chistopol Watchworks, and the 
Tochmash Plant. The Terminal Association and the Plant imeni 
Gorkiy, which have pretty good prospects, have begun to increase 
the pace of production. 
  The process of the conclusion of trade and economic 
agreements with countries of the near abroad for the supply of 
material and technical resources is becoming more purposeful and 
efficient. Agreements have been concluded at the present time 
with Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova, and the Republic of 
Lithuania, and agreements with 37 regions of the Russian 
Federation have been extended. 
  In 1994, according to forecast estimates, the production of 
consumer goods will constitute 100.2 percent, including 103.4 
percent for foodstuffs and 96.7 percent for nonfood commodities. 
An increase in the manufacture of basic consumer commodities 
like refrigerators, synthetic detergents, toilet soap, footwear, 
and knitwear is expected in the current year. 
  It is planned to maintain the trend of a stabilization of 
the 
production of agricultural products in 1994. Purchases of 
agricultural products for republic food stocks will remain 
practically unchanged. 
  It is contemplated continuing the government support for the 
agro-industrial complex in the current year. Budget resources 
will be channeled, in the main, into an increase in the 
fertility of the land--the compensation of expenditure on the 
purchase of mineral fertilizers and chemical plant-protection 
agents, a fundamental improvement in the land, support for 
pedigree breeding and elite seed growing, and 
scientific-personnel support. The funding of the construction 
and modernization of the most important enterprises of the food 
and processing industry, the supply of gas and electricity to 
the countryside, and social and cultural amenities is planned 
also. It is planned allocating from the republic budget R310 
billion for these areas. 
  It is contemplated preserving for the purpose of the social 
protection of the population of the republic the subsidies on 
animal husbandry products purchased for republic needs. 
Approximately 27 percent of the expenditure side of the republic 
budget is earmarked for the funding of the agro-industrial 
complex altogether, subsidies included. 
  Land reform will continue. The reform of the kolkhozes and 
sovkhozes, which will to a considerable extent interest the 
workers of the countryside in the end results of production, 
will be completed. An increase in the number of peasant 
(private) farms is forecast. It is planned to render them 
government support from budget appropriations and make soft 
loans available in the current year. 
  According to the forecast estimates of enterprises of food 
and processing industry, an increase in the production of 
foodstuffs of 3.4 percent (in comparable prices, counting 
alcoholic beverages) is envisaged for 1994. An increase in the 
production of wholemilk products (in milk equivalent), macaroni 
products, flour, and canned fruit and vegetables is scheduled. 
  The forecast for 1994 as a whole in terms of all sources of 
funding envisages the assimilation of R2.5 trillion of capital 
investments with a decline compared to the 1993 level in 
comparable prices of 28.6 percent. 
  The allocation of capital investments for the construction 
of 
housing for persons demobilized from the armed forces and 
certain other facilities totaling R56.5 billion from the budget 
of the Russian Federation is contemplated. 
  Aside from this, a whole number of other federal targeted 
programs, in which enterprises and organizations of the republic 
may participate thanks to the treaty that has been concluded 
with Russia, is being drawn up. The leaders of enterprises, 
ministries, and departments should step up their efforts for the 
specific development of projects with Russian departments. The 
Government of the Republic of Tatarstan has performed the 
corresponding preparatory work. 
  It will be hard in the coming years to expect under the 
conditions of a reduction in production, the arrears crisis, and 
the high rate of inflation a significant increase in investments 
from the resources of enterprises of all forms of ownership and 
the republic budget. The funds of commercial banks and foreign 
investments could be realistic sources of an increase in 
investments. 
  In 1994 the proportion of funds channeled into construction 
for nonproduction purposes is forecast at the level of 37.7 
percent against the actual 1993 level of 35.2 percent; this 
ratio will be maintained thanks to the republic budget, in the 
main. 
  The introduction of housing with a total area of 980,000 
square meters, 91,400 square meters of which will be for the 
movement of residents out of dilapidated and dangerous housing, 
is contemplated from all sources of financing in the present 
year. The government has adopted a decision on the supplementary 
allocation of funds for the construction of housing for the 
handicapped and participants in the Great Patriotic War. It is 
contemplated through the efforts of individual developers 
building 320,000 square meters of housing, which is 25 percent 
more than was introduced in 1993. 
  The forecast envisages the introduction of general schools 
for 9,900 students (101 percent of the 1993 level), preschools 
for 3,110 children (103.8 percent), hospitals with 749 beds (179 
percent), general clinics catering for 1,720 visits per shift 
(116.2 percent), and clubhouses with 4,000 seats (87.7 percent). 
  The adoption of the laws of the Republic of Tatarstan "The 
Subsistence Minimum" and "The Minimum Wage" created the 
legislative basis for the stabilization and prevention of a 
decline in personal living standards. A legislative provision 
specifying that the minimum wage may not be lower than the 
subsistence minimum has for the first time been made the basis 
of the calculation of wage-increase indicators for 1994. 
  It is forecast that, despite the considerable decline in 
production, the average wage in 1994 will increase by a factor 
of 4.1 compared with 1993 and will in December 1994 be in excess 
of R400,000 per worker. An increase in the remuneration of the 
employees of publicly funded organizations also is specified in 
the draft budget with regard to this rate of increase in the 
average wage. 
  With a growth of consumer prices by a factor of 4.3 
approximately compared with the 1993 level the increase in the 
price of goods and services constituting the subsistence minimum 
will be regulated and should not exceed the 3.8-fold level. That 
is, the forecast provides for a preferential growth of wages (by 
a factor of 4.1) compared with the value of the subsistence 
minimum (a factor of 3.8). 
  Realization of the program of targeted social protection of 
the population will continue. The amount of the sums of 
compensation to the needy strata of the populace in the form of 
food checks (more than 140,000 inhabitants of the republic are 
currently being paid a sum total of more than R5 billion a 
month) will increase proportionate to the increase in the value 
of the subsistence minimum. 
  It is contemplated making the subsidies for transport 
services, for provision of the public with fuel, and for 
medication specifically targeted in 1994. 
  A 50 percent reduction in fares on suburban motor transport 
will be introduced in the period from 1 May through 1 October. 
  A whole set of measures pertaining to the social protection 
of the population is envisaged by an agreement among the Cabinet 
of Ministers, the republic Council of Trade Unions, and the 
Association of State-Owned Enterprises of Tatarstan for 1994. 
Realization of the comprehensive "Care" program for an 
improvement in services for war and labor veterans, elderly 
single citizens, and the handicapped will continue. Funds for 
the organization of the summer recreation and health and fitness 
of children and funds for the support of the children of 
employees of publicly funded organizations in preschools will be 
allocated from the republic budget. 
  The forecast of the labor market for the republic for 1994 
contemplates a level of unemployment that is no higher than 1.5 
percent of the workforce. Financial assistance to enterprises 
and organizations for the creation of approximately 12,000 jobs 
is envisaged simultaneously within the framework of the 
Employment Program (2,453 jobs were created thanks to resources 
of the Employment Fund in 1993). 
  Switching to the concluding part of the report, F.G. 
Khamidullin emphasized that work had been under way for more 
than a year in the republic on a draft concept of socioeconomic 
development incorporating a reform of the organs of 
administration. The provisions of the concept are currently 
being specified in the light of the treaty and the agreements 
concluded with Russia. It will upon completion be presented to 
the people of the republic. 
  The independence and rights of Tatarstan accorded by the 
treaty demand increased responsibility for all business in the 
republic. Questions of the strictest austerity in all types of 
material, labor, and financial resources are particularly 
pertinent. The government is contemplating a number of 
organizational and economic measures in this direction. 
  On the whole, the year promises to be difficult, and the 
crisis has not yet been overcome, but there will in the present 
year be appreciable qualitative changes in the economy laying 
the foundations of prospects of an improvement in the general 
economic situation.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yaram Mamadayev, former leader of Dzhokhar </F>
Dudayev's cabinet, head of a government of national trust of the 
Chechen Republic in exile, by Mikhail Ivanchikov; place and date 
not given: "All Prophets Prefer To Live Outside Their Fatherland] 
  [Text] 
  [Ivanchikov] Mr. Prime Minister, you were together with 
General Dudayev, the present president of Chechnya, at the 
sources of the independence of the Chechen Republic. Why did 
your ways part? 
  [Mamadayev] I would not reduce everything merely to our 
personal relationship. We should, perhaps, proceed from the fact 
that General Dudayev is unquestionably by nature an 
authoritarian individual. And anyone who expresses even the 
slightest disagreement with him automatically becomes his 
personal enemy. And I am no exception in this case. 
  I remember well my last conversation with the general last 
May, when I found myself in the literal sense looking down the 
barrels of automatic weapons in my office. Armed people had not 
come to see me at that time of their own free will, 
naturally--they had been sent by Dudayev. Although he later 
called me personally and said: "I swear! I sent no one." But he 
is not, after all, a little boy to be maintaining such things! 
With us Muslims the words "I swear" are sacred. Dudayev's older 
brother once told me, incidentally: "I would never swear for my 
brother on the Koran." This is a very telling remark yet again 
characterizing the present president of Chechnya. 
  [Ivanchikov] Do you have support, financial included, inside 
and outside of Chechnya? On what, after all, do you live, 
work.... 
  [Mamadayev] I have never concealed the fact that I am given 
financial support by Chechen entrepreneurs in Moscow. As far as 
an evaluation of my activity within the Chechen Republic is 
concerned, we need to return to the moment when the government 
of national trust in exile was formed. A specific feature of 
Chechen society is that public opinion takes shape in the 
process of a dialogue between the teyns (a teyn is an ancestral 
clan--NYG note). Thus the Government of the Chechen Republic 
that I head was formed with regard to the wishes of the teyns 
and the opinions of religious figures, the Chechen 
Industrialists' Union, and the local administration chiefs. But 
President Dudayev, who in fact debarred this government from 
power, thereby flouted the will of the people. And this is in 
itself dangerous. 
  It is hard to reproach me, at least, with personal ambition. 
It would have given me more pleasure to have been involved in 
enterprise than in political activity. But I was forced to take 
account of the wishes of my people. As long as the population of 
the Chechen Republic considered me its prime minister, I was 
such. Nonetheless, I am looking to the future. The Caucasus 
Transnational Corp (KTK), whose activity is aimed entirely at 
the restoration of interregional economic relations and movement 
toward the world level, was formed to this end. As far as the 
latter circumstance is concerned, I can report not without 
pleasure that we are even today attempting to win the support of 
influential Western financial structures. 
  [Ivanchikov] You mentioned interregional cooperation, 
referring to certain regions of Russia also. How do you see 
Chechnya's future in this connection: as part of Russia or as a 
totally independent state? 
  [Mamadayev] The wishes of the Chechen were expressed 
unequivocally: total independence. And, I repeat once again, I 
am on the side of my people. If, therefore, the union of teyns 
ever supports membership of the Russian Federation on these 
terms or others, I would not object. 
  I would like in this connection to add the following. Those 
who believe that Chechnya needs Russia more than Russia needs 
Chechnya are wrong. And the other way about also. It is not a 
question of who can live without whom, and who, not. We have 
historically been neighbors. The situation in the Caucasus 
depends on Chechnya to a large extent, and the Caucasus, in 
turn, influences the situation in the south of Russia. As you 
can see, therefore, Chechnya and Russia have a mutual interest 
in one another. 
  Also fruitless, in my view, are any attempts to isolate the 
Chechen Republic, as were made recently by President Yeltsin, 
declaring an economic blockade of Chechnya, virtually. Who needs 
a new focal point of tension in the Caucasus, which, were it to 
arise, would be comparable with the Near East or Balkan 
conflicts? Yet the economic blockade of the Chechen Republic on 
the part of Russia with the virtual withdrawal from Chechnya's 
jurisdiction of Sunzhenskiy and Malgobenskiy Rayons is merely 
contributing to the appearance of such conflicts. In addition, 
such a situation is merely to the benefit of General Dudayev's 
criminal regime. The gang of looters he heads is flouting the 
laws and pillaging the republic and destabilizing the situation 
in the south of Russia. And everything is being ascribed here to 
the consequences of the economic blockade declared by Russia and 
to "the Kremlin's imperial policy." 
  But Moscow, unfortunately, is persisting in its desire to 
keep Chechnya as part of Russia at all costs. Not long ago I was 
speaking with Sergey Filatov, chief of staff of the president of 
the Russian Federation, and he confirmed yet again that the 
Kremlin had no intention of revising its policy of isolation in 
respect to Chechnya. 
  [Ivanchikov] The release of Ruslan Khasbulatov from 
Lefortovo 
has made certain adjustments to the alignment of political 
forces in Chechnya. Could he become the new leader of the 
Chechen Republic? 
  [Mamadayev] Whatever you think of him, Ruslan Khasbulatov is 
undoubtedly a politician of world stature. He has both weight 
and authority in Chechnya. In addition, Khasbulatov comes from 
the most influential Chechen teyn--the Kharachay. But his 
political views are contrary to those that have been expressed 
by our people. 
<H5>  NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA Explanation </H5>
  Boris Yeltsin once told Russia's regions to "Take as much 
sovereignty as you can." Chechnya took the maximum. Everyone 
knows full well what this has resulted in for it. The power 
structures of this republic were unable to agree among 
themselves, and one leader was forced to give way. This was 
Yaram Mamadayev. The other--General Dudayev--is, in fact, both 
the leader and master of Chechnya, although his authority has 
begun to decline as of late, and he can no longer count on full 
support at home. To hold on to power, therefore, he will 
evidently have to appeal increasingly for support, primarily to 
Moscow. 
  Considering the traditions of Chechen society, it has to be 
observed that the sovereignty of the Chechen Republic, as a 
supreme and undoubted value of the republic, may be determined 
only in the event of all the teyns being able to agree on this 
score. In addition, it is essential also to take account of the 
opinion of the Russians who live in Chechnya and who belong to 
no teyn. 
  Reflecting on the subject of the sovereignty of the Chechen 
Republic, the sociologist Abdurakhman Avtokhranov, another 
prominent representative of the Chechen people, observes: "Our 
people have never known statehood and have for this reason acted 
regardless of all states. They have always been intrepid for 
their self-preservation. Consequently, the self-preservation of 
the Chechen people is not made directly dependent on the 
acquisition of sovereignty and statehood. And the present 
Chechen politicians, in the republic or in exile, should take 
account of this fact also.

<F P=106> [Interview with Chamal Mashevich Beslaneyev, </F>
chairman of the governing board of the Kabardino-Balkaria 
Republic Organization of the Agrarian Party of Russia and past 
head of the Shalushkinskiy Sovkhoz, conducted by Z. Asin; date 
and place not given] 
  [Text] The Kabardino-Balkaria Republic Organization 
of the Agrarian Party of Russia (APR) was created at the 
founding meeting in Nalchik recently. The party's Program and 
Rules were approved and appropriate corrections to account for 
the specifics of the region and the republic were made in these 
documents. The party was registered on 25 March. The new party's 
governing board was elected and its members included Z. Kh. 
Balkizov, chairman of the Germenchik Kolkhoz, M. M. Klevtsov, 
chairman of the KBR [Kabardino-Balkar Republic] State Land 
Committee, C. Z. Shavayev, his deputy, A. T. Kushkhov, the 
minister of agriculture and food, Z. M. Taov, the head of the 
Ministry of Agriculture and Food kolkhoz organizing department, 
K. S. Kuchmenov, chairman of Agrosnab [Agricultural Supply 
System], V. I. Punarzhi, chairman of the KBR Agrarian Union, and 
Z. Kh. Shogenov, chairman of the Kolkhoz imeni Lenin in 
Chegemskiy Rayon. Ch. M. Beslaneyev, who headed the 
Shalushkinskiy Sovkhoz for the last several years, was elected 
chairman of the governing board. 
  Our interview is about the motives for creating the new 
party and its goals and tasks. 
  [Asin] Chamal Mashevich, the Agrarian Party headed by 
Lapshin 
is one of the most influential in Russia. As I understand it, 
you are a part of the all-Russian party of agrarians. What are 
the motives for creating this republic party? 
  [Beslaneyev] Yes, we are the republic, Kabardino-Balkaria 
Organization of the APR. 
  As for the second part of the question, I will say right 
away 
that we do not intend to "plug" the gaps in the political vacuum 
which once formed. It is now so overflowing with so many parties 
and movements of the most varied persuasions and all colors of 
the rainbow that not even a small niche left for another can be 
found in that space. The people are confused not only about 
their program documents but even their names. Fortunately, this 
boom has not hit our republic so hard. 
  The essence of the motives. The economic, political, and 
social standing of agriculture has been reduced to a critical 
point. The state has not implemented the so-called shock therapy 
as such in even one sector of the economy. If it were conducted 
in a decisive, well-considered, and sober manner, the state and 
the entire economy would have wakened and gotten going long ago. 
  In 1991 state social programs in rural areas were supported 
with budget financing at a level of 22 percent for housing 
construction, 31 percent for social-domestic objects, and 67 
percent for roads. In 1992 less than half as much money was 
directed to the social sphere as in 1991. This past year the 
volume of capital investments in rural areas declined again by 
half as compared to 1992. 
  Because of the price "crunch" and the enormous state debts 
to 
kolkhozes and sovkhozes, rural residents, and they account for 
26 percent of the entire population, live in extremely tough 
economic and domestic conditions. Proceeds for the output of 
fields and farms received by the treasuries of kolkhozes and 
sovkhozes fell short by more than 1.5 trillion rubles [R] and 
R800 billion worth of budget allocations. The state is buying 
agricultural output abroad while 35 percent of the rye from the 
harvest grown in Russia remains unsold, 67 percent of the 
vegetables, 76 percent of the long-stemmed flax, 24 percent of 
the animal fat, and 59 percent of the wool. It has become 
difficult to sell all types of grain, meat, and meat products in 
many regions. 
  [Asin] In our republic too, in my opinion. I have 
information 
on unsold meat at the meat combine and unclaimed first 
generation hybrid seeds in the republic's grain elevators. 
  [Beslaneyev] You are absolutely right. Here is one more 
example of how the peasant is really being robbed. Only 28 
percent of the earnings from the sale of grain are left for the 
grain producers, while one-fifth goes to trade and 40 percent to 
grain receivers. The list of examples of excess being created in 
the agricultural complex would take up a great deal of time. 
Suffice it to mention that as a result of all this, a foundation 
has been laid for further degradation of agriculture. As of 
today, Agroprom [Agroindustry] is unable to ensure simple 
reproduction using its own resources. 
  So in these conditions, it has become urgently necessary to 
create a strong political party able to keep agriculture from 
breaking down for good. 
  [Asin] The appearance of such a political party which sets 
such goals is a gratifying thing. What ways do you see to 
achieve them? 
  [Beslaneyev] This would be the most reliable path: the 
diversity and equality of various forms of ownership and 
economic activity on land must be achieved and commercial 
reforms based on long-term scientific programs must be conducted 
on the state level. We support the priorities of development of 
the agroindustrial complex. 
  The primary task is overcoming the opinion which has become 
fixed in social consciousness that the peasantry is conservative 
and politically backward. They must take a proper place in 
society. 
  [Asin] What methods do you intend to use to achieve your 
goals? 
  [Beslaneyev] Only constitutional means and political 
methods. 
We intend to participate actively in elections to the state 
organs of power. We realize very clearly that only those who 
truly express the will of the majority can count on success and 
have this moral right. People have had enough populist slogans 
and unfulfilled and deliberately unfeasible promises. The rural 
laborer is tired of them. 
  In our work we will cooperate with other political parties, 
trade unions, and public movements and organizations. 
  [Asin] What will be the foundations of this cooperation? 
  [Beslaneyev] Cooperating with organizations and movements 
whose goals and tasks are close to ours as well as with power 
structures does not mean abandoning our program goals and tasks. 
We will follow them strictly. But we will begin from the need to 
unite the efforts of political parties, structures of parliament 
and executive power, and the healthy forces of society in the 
cause of uplifting and strengthening the agrarian sector and 
restoring the traditional way of life in the countryside. We 
also take into account that our republic is largely an agrarian 
one and most of the population has rural roots. The countryside 
has been and continues to be the keeper of the national culture 
and traditions of the Kabardins, Balkars, and Cossacks. 
  [Asin] What do you consider the most important position, the 
most important question? 
  [Beslaneyev] There is perhaps no tougher or more fundamental 
question in our work than the question of land. The approach to 
resolving it cannot be the same even in conditions of different 
rayons within the republic itself. Even less acceptable is a 
mechanical transfer to Kabardino-Balkaria of models developed 
somewhere else. Our party supports the outright transfer of land 
parcels to ownership with the right of lifetime possession and 
bequest. But only to those who live and work on it or want to 
obtain it exclusively for production of agricultural output, 
horticulture, or gardening. 
  But at the same time, we are against haste in resolving the 
question of the free buying and selling of land. In the 
republic's conditions, this may lead to redistribution of land 
in favor of persons who have nothing to do with agricultural 
production and to unpredictable consequences. We must not allow 
land to become an object of speculation and enrichment of rich 
people. Yes, we are for the equality of multistructural forms of 
economic activity on the land. We believe that private farming 
must not be "under the thumb." But we must not go to extremes. 
For development of peasant (private) farms does not presuppose 
the mandatory suffocation of collective forms of economic 
activity on the land. But it is clear that in the present stage 
of the reforms in Agroprom, private farmers still cannot, as 
they say, feed the country. There are many reasons for this: we 
do not have the small equipment needed for small farms, the tax 
system is imperfect, and private farmers' relations with the 
processing enterprises are becoming extremely difficult. We must 
understand that the development of private farming, especially 
given the shortage of arable land, is the longest, most capital 
intensive, and most inefficient way. There are, of course, 
barriers of a psychological and professional nature. Already the 
first experiments have shown how the peasant farmer must be 
trained in many things. By no means is everyone ready for this 
now. If excesses triumph here, we risk sliding down the path of 
the inefficient, subsistence form of economic activity typical 
of underdeveloped countries. 
  [Asin] But is there other experience? 
  [Beslaneyev] We usually like to refer to the United States. 
In fact, the American agrarian sector is oriented to large 
market agricultural enterprises. This type of economic activity 
can be created on the base of kolkhozes and sovkhozes without 
large additional expenditures. I want to be understood 
correctly: There will be no obstacles to those private farmers 
who want to and in fact do everything necessary to use the land 
efficiently or to those for whom this difficult job is not a 
sideline but their life's work. They can and will successfully 
coexist with other forms of labor organization. Large commodity 
producers will be no obstacle to them. 
  [Asin] Chamal Mashevich, what organizational plans does the 
party's governing board have? 
  [Beslaneyev] Anyone who is even a little tempted by this 
work 
understands that in the future we cannot do without a precise 
organizational structure. We are going to create our own cells 
in the villages from people who understand and sympathize with 
our ideas and program. Then will follow their joining into rayon 
organizations. It would probably be appropriate to stipulate 
that we do not plan to revive a communist-oriented party. We 
have precise practical goals where the economic and social 
orientation predominates. 
  But for now we face the work of explaining our Rules and 
Program. I believe that we have already taken the first step in 
this direction with this conversation. We see clearly that 
without detailed knowledge and a sense of the problems bothering 
rural residents we will not rally people around us. 
  The Agrarian Party will work hard to preserve the republic's 
integrity and indoctrinate the rising generation in the best 
traditions of our peoples. We are not striving for 
self-isolation; our program includes close cooperation with all 
branches of power, with the Ministry of Agriculture and Food, 
and with elected and management organs. In defending the 
interests of rural commodity producers, we will rely on solid 
knowledge of the state of affairs in local areas. 
  [Asin] To judge from the makeup of the APR governing board, 
there is good potential for this. In my opinion, a solid "team" 
has been chosen, one able to create a party which in terms of 
size is a mass party and in terms of quality a competent one. I 
sincerely wish you well, may you have success in your work, and 
thank you for the interview.

"Extraordinary Measures for Combatting Crime Introduced in 
Kuban"] 
  [Text] The decree of the head of administration, "On 
Extraordinary Measures for Combatting Crime," has been 
introduced into operation in Krasnodar Kray. The preamble of the 
document states that the criminal situation which has arisen in 
the kray creates a real threat to political, economic and social 
transformations. 
  By coincidence, on the eve of the appearance of the decree, 
Krasnodar had buried four victims of crime. Two men in masks had 
broken into the jewelry store "Zhemchug," and shot the 
salesgirl, a customer and the duty militiaman with an automatic 
weapon. Another woman was wounded by a stray bullet. During the 
ensuing chase and gun battles which took place in crowded 
places, one more militia worker was killed. Later, during the 
capture of the robbers, one of them was killed... According to 
the decree, the internal affairs agencies must significantly 
increase the density and mobility of units of the militia 
patrol-duty service. 
  Among the measures introduced were operations for preventing 
and curtailing the activity of armed groups, as well as a set of 
measures for maintaining the safety of citizens in places of 
possible inter-ethnic conflicts. 
  The document devoted much attention to outsiders. Those who 
violate the public order will be deported outside the boundaries 
of the kray. Anyone who is not carrying documents shall be 
detained and placed in receiving-distributing centers until 
their identity can be established. 
  Some measures are extraordinary. Thus, the agencies of the 
tax police, if they are unable to collect taxes due to the 
budget and other mandatory payments, receive the right to impose 
administrative arrest (seizure) of the property of legal persons 
and individuals and to later sell it through auctions. 
  Juveniles are also not overlooked. It has been decided "to 
limit the presence of minors under 16 years of age in public 
places after 10:00 p.m. without their parents or persons acting 
in lieu of them." 
  One of the points of the decree is an innovation, although 
the mechanism of its realization has not yet been explained. "In 
necessary cases, to provide for the allocation of facilities for 
the temporary residence of persons who have become victims of 
domestic violence, to create publicly funded counselling centers 
for provision of legal and other aid to citizens in the 
resolution of social-domestic conflicts." 
  Aside from the internal affairs agencies, military 
servicemen 
of the internal troops and Cossack social organizations will 
also be involved in the fight against crime. The heads of the 
law enforcement agencies have been told to implement 
organizational measures for utilizing the capacities the kray's 
radio and television broadcasting network for emergency 
transmission of current announcements. 
  Citizens who report the whereabouts of especially dangerous 
criminals who have committed or are planning to commit serious 
crimes will be given a monetary reward in the amount of up to 5 
million rubles (R). 
  The extraordinary measures, the need for which Russian 
Minister of Internal Affairs Viktor Yerin pointed out during his 
recent visit to Kuban, shall remain in effect up until 1 October 
of this year.

"Bryansk Oblast Duma Began Its Work: Seats Divided Between 
Agrarians and Local Authorities"] 
  [Text] Bryansk--On a second attempt, the Bryansk Oblast 
Duma has convened its first session. Elections to the new 
representative body took place in six out of nine three-mandate 
districts in the Bryansk region. There were 150 contenders for 
27 seats in the oblast duma. The greatest activism was shown by 
voters in rural districts--it was thanks to them that 18 
candidates got their mandates. Voters in the three districts in 
the oblast center did not turn out in the numbers needed to make 
up the required 25 percent that would make the elections valid, 
and have lost their representation in the duma. 
  Of those elected, 50 percent are agrarians, and the rest are 
members of the executive branch from a rayon to oblast level. 
The statute on elections to the oblast duma envisages that 
one-third of the deputies will work full-time; however, so far 
not a single deputy of the current term has dared to leave his 
administrative or directive job and become a professional 
politician. Deputies will consider the question of temporary 
rules for the oblast duma, elect a chairman and his deputy, and 
form permanent committees.

Itself: The Incidence of Cancer Is on the Rise in Bryansk 
Oblast"] 
  [Text] Bryansk--Over the eight years since Chernobyl, there 
had been an increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer in 
Bryansk Oblast. Over seven years before the accident, 111 cases 
of thyroid cancer had been registered in the oblast. Today the 
statistics show 546 cases. The incidence of this disease 
increased annually at a rate of 70 percent, while for other 
types of cancer this indicator was only 1.5-2.0 percent. 
Specialists associate the onslaught of thyroid cancer with the 
radiation the population had been subjected to during the first 
days of the catastrophe, when information about the tragedy was 
carefully kept under wraps and local party bosses led the people 
out to the May Day demonstration. Workers solidarity has cost 
the Bryansk region residents dearly: The radiation background in 
some areas of Bryansk Oblast reached 200 microroentgen an hour. 
  Currently the oblast administration takes steps to provide 
social protection for those who were affected during the 
catastrophe at the Chernobyl nuclear power station, However, it 
is also time for the federal authorities to pay their debts, 
which currently amount to about R50 billion.

<F P=106> [Article by Irina Vladykina: "Monopolists Are Told to </F>
Restructure; Program for Demonopolization of the Economy Adopted 
in Central Urals"] 
  [Text] The list of monopolist enterprises of Sverdlovsk 
Oblast includes around 300 names, and continues to be 
replentished with new enterprises in those spheres of economics 
and business to which the Sverdlovsk territorial administration 
of the State Committee on Anti-Monopoly Policy and Support of 
New Economic Structures has cast its glance. The railroad, 
electrical power production and communications occupy the 
leading and strongest place in this register. The oblast 
anti-monopoly administration has recently filed four claims in 
court against just the Sverdlovsk Railroad and its sections. 
  The program of demonopolization adopted at the meeting of 
the 
Sverdlovsk Oblast government is called upon to stop unfair 
competition, limit monopolistic activity, and protect consumer 
rights. It is intended for a period of two years. But, as the 
chief of the Sverdlovsk Oblast Anti-Monopoly Administration, 
Nikolay Uzhegov, noted, demonopolization, judging by all, will 
be a more prolonged process. 
  Such criteria as scientific and legal justification, 
socio-economic effectiveness of enterprises and their 
controllability and manageability were selected as basis of the 
program. Democracy, openness and a consideration of public 
opinion were proclaimed as the principles for the program's 
realization. 
  The program on demonopolization of the economy of Sverdlovsk 
Oblast includes numerous measures, which are grouped into nine 
blocks. Particular attention is focused on developing 
competition on the commodity markets in the sphere of 
scientific-technical progress, in trade, public catering, and 
consumer services. The program also defines its 
priorities--provision for the development of commodity markets 
in the sector, support of small and medium-sized enterprise, 
control and regulation of state monopolies, prevention of the 
emergence of various subjects which occupy a dominant position 
in the economy, as well as the deconsolidation of such 
monopolist enterprises, if this is economically justified and 
expedient. 
  Aside from the territorial administration, a special 
commission has been formed in Yekaterinburg in order to 
implement control over the realization of the program on 
demonopolization of the economy. It will include various 
representatives of the administrative agencies, entrepreneurial 
structures, scientists and specialists. The commission will not 
have authoritative powers and authorities. Its activity must 
have an advisory character.

"One of the Murderers of the Deputy Chairman of Bashkiria's 
Supreme Soviet Detained: He Is a Republic Parliament Deputy"] 
  [Text] Kazan--At a session of the Bashkiria Supreme Soviet 
that took place on 26 April in Ufa, deputies stripped their 
colleague--Valerik Talipov--from immunity from prosecution. 
  The Bashkiria Procuracy suspects him of murdering Ravil 
Musin, head of the city of Dyurtyul and Dyurtyulinskiy rayon 
administrations, who also served as a volunteer deputy chairman 
of the republic parliament; he died some time ago from the 
explosion of a grenade attached to a wicket at his home. 
  After Musin's death, Talipov assumed the former's duties. 
Some time later he was dismissed for "shortcomings in his work" 
and went on to become the director of Dyurtyulinskiy meat 
combine, where he worked until lately. 
  According to a version of the investigation, Talipov 
participated in a criminal conspiracy to kill Musin by hiring a 
contract killer. The suspect is under arrest. Investigation 
continues.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Kosolapov, Chelyabinsk: "My Radio Telephone </F>
Started Ringing: a Modern Communications Network System Has Been 
Created in Chelyabinsk"] 
  [Text] "If you want to, we can call a foreign country. 
Would you like to call Germany, for example?" My conversational 
partner picked up a touch-tone telephone with a short antenna, 
and quickly ran his fingers over the keyboard: about twenty 
seconds later, I could hear coming from the other end of the 
line the voice of a woman who was speaking in German. The 
audibility was excellent, just as though we were not thousands 
of kilometers apart: there was no interference, no noise, or 
crackling. 
  "The automatic international responder," it was explained to 
me, "tells whom to call, how to call him, where to go for advice 
or the necessary information.." 
  Possibly for a businessman in Hamburg or North 
Rhine-Westphalia this is an everyday occurrence -- communication 
with a subscriber located even a tremendous distance away, 
almost instantaneously -- but I, a person unspoiled by 
domestically produced communications equipment, perceived 
everything that happened as a minor technical miracle. Obviously 
I had seen radio telephones, which practically every militiaman 
carries nowadays, and, in addition, important managers have been 
installing them for many years in their official cars, but I 
myself did not have any contact with this kind of progress. 
  "Now everyone who concludes a contract with our organization 
will have the opportunity to become a subscriber to the mobile 
radio telephone system," A. B. Blinov, technical director of the 
Radiotelefon AO [joint-stock company] says. "Today I signed an 
official order concerning the completion of preliminary tests, 
and a week or two will go into bringing the entire complex to a 
steady, stable state, and in late April we shall begin working 
at full strength." 
  But how does the mobile radio telephone communications 
system 
operate? The Chelyabinsk system has two main centers: one is 
situated in the oblast radio teletransmitting center, and the 
other in Metallurgicheskiy Rayon, in the ATS-21 [dial telephone 
station No. 21] building. Relay communications have been 
installed between them. Both centers are switched into the city, 
long-distance, and international automatic-dialing system. 
Therefore there will be no problems in reaching a subscriber 
located anywhere on the planet. Calls have already been made to 
the United States, Finland, and even Australia, without any 
problems. And I myself could talk to Germany, if there was 
anyone I wanted to talk to. 
  Incidentally, the city network is not limited for the radio 
telephone to the territory of Chelyabinsk. The signal extends to 
a radius of 30 kilometers from the telecommunications tower and 
gets as far as Kopeysk and many suburban settlements and 
villages. Simultaneously with this, the telephone can be 
extremely selective. It can connect with just one 
mobile-communications subscriber, if that is what you want. 
Provision has also been made for other services, which we 
previously have not even dreamed of: you can indicate the number 
of a subscriber from whom you do not want to get calls, and he 
will not be able to connect with you. If what you need is only 
one-sided communication, you can make the call, or if not, there 
is nothing complicated about this -- that is how it will be. If 
you are talking too long, the telephone will indicate to you at 
the proper time that your money is running out... 
  Chelyabinsk is the fourth city in Russia where a mobile 
radio 
telephone system has been created. A year ago the system was 
activated in Moscow and St. Petersburg, then, quite recently, in 
Nizhniy Novgorod. The fact that our city proved to be among the 
pioneers in the communications sphere is definitely not 
accidental. For many years the oblast center has housed the 
Scientific-Research Institute of Measurement Technology (NIIIT) 
previously was kept extremely classified and which specialized 
in developing electronic systems for the navy, aviation, and 
space travel. Hence the high proficiency level of its workers, 
and their initiative and ability to make contact with their 
partners. The basis of the Radiotelefon AO, which is headed by 
V. O. Lenkevich, is made up of people from NIIIT. Also, many 
production orders for the manufacture of equipment are also 
executed by former work associates. 
  However, the main supplier of the modern technology is the 
Swedish Ericson company. The first consignment of equipment was 
delivered from Scandinavia in January. A month later five more 
tons of freight arrived. Simultaneously, the installation 
workers arrived, and, incidentally, not all of them are 
necessarily Swedes. Currently, for example, two people are 
working here: one is from Malaysia, and the other is from 
Mexico. They have not yet become fluent in Russian, but they 
have watched the "Simply Mariya" television series and have 
suffered through a lot with the characters. 
  The first phase of the system is planned for 2000 
subscribers, and the maximum capacity is 12,000. The experience 
gained by foreign countries indicates that, on the average, in 
an ordinary city one percent of the people use mobile telephone 
communications. The capacities that the Radiotelefon AO is 
proposing for Chelyabinsk are apparently completely adequate. 
Although it is difficult to know: in Finland, the country in the 
world that is most densely saturated with radio telephone 
communications, three percent of the population prefer mobile 
communications. 
  In our oblast the new system, it seems to me, has rather 
good 
prospects: currently the NIIIT specialists are working on the 
introduction of radio telephone service in Miass. The 
telecommunications tower possibilities have been studied, and 
contracts have been concluded with enterprises, including such 
an important one as UralAZ. According to the plan, the 
installation of the equipment will begin at the end of the 
second quarter. The reception zone will include the city of 
Chebarkul, and all the sanatoriums situated in its environs. In 
parallel with this, preparatory work is under way to introduce 
mobile communications in Magnitogorsk. Whoever possesses modern 
communications, possesses the world...

<F P=106> [Article by S. Pautova, under rubric "Economic Survey": "Cut </F>
Your Coat According to the Cloth..."] 
  [Text] Today we are publishing the latest in a series 
of articles based on data provided in the "Memorandum Concerning 
the Basic Results of the Economic and Social Development of the 
City of Novokuznetsk in 1993," which was prepared by T. B. 
Balakirev, chief of the Department of Forecasts For the 
Development of the City, of the Novokuznetsk city 
administration's Committee for the Economy. 
  The results of the work performed by enterprises in the 
services sphere largely formed the components of the concept 
"cost of life" in our city. The volume of personal services in 
comparable prices constituted 35-40 percent of the 1992 level. 
  The increase in the prices of thermal and electrical power 
and the rental of spaces, and the high taxes and credit rates, 
led to a situation in which, out of 41 enterprises in the 
personal services sphere, almost one-third operated at a loss. 
In order to survive, they engaged in commercial activity and 
rented out their spaces. 
  The cost of paid services in our city during the past year 
rose considerably. This is how the dynamics of the increase in 
the payment for services looked for various types of them: the 
cost of repairing a television set rose, as compared with 1992, 
by a factor of 8; a refrigerator, a factor of 14; a watch, a 
factor of 11; and furniture, also by a factor of 11. The 
services involved in making custom-made clothing became 
definitely inaccessible for many people. Whereas the cost of 
making a woman's dress in January 1993 in our city was 4100 
rubles, in December that cost was 39,778 rubles, and the cost of 
making an overcoat was, respectively, 11,596 and 87,600 rubles. 
  The section "Foreign-Economic Activity" evokes interest. 
Five 
percent of the output produced by the city's enterprises was 
used by the administration to satisfy citywide needs. This is 
how the currency proceeds were distributed during the year that 
elapsed. The city, jointly with the coal workers, purchased 
medicines with a total value of $100,000. An additional $5000 
was spent to purchase seven motor buses in Hamburg (West 
Germany). 
  The city spent some of the funds on communications 
equipment: 
telex equipment, an information network for law-enforcement 
agencies, and for equipment for a new telephone system with 
20,000 numbers (a contract dealing with its construction has 
been signed with the Italian Italtel company). A total of 
$417,000 and 580,000 marks were spent for these purposes. 
  A machine to remove the asphalt surface of roads cost 
$342,000. A $200,000 contract will make it possible to open at 
the Novokuznetsk Bread Products Combine a shop for producing 
vegetable oil. 
  We shall end this article with information about social 
policy, with figures and facts pertaining to this section of the 
work that was carried out in 1993. 
  The administration's Committee on Social Policy worked in 
such basic areas as the execution of measures in the program 
entitled "The Social Protection of the Population of the City of 
Novokuznetsk in 1993"; the decentralization of pensions and 
grants in aid in the city; and the creation of a system of 
social assistance centers and structures carrying out the social 
support of the population. 
  The committee expended a total of 915.2 million rubles 
during 
the year to execute the program entitled "The Social Protection 
of the Population of the City of Kuznetsk in 1993." On what 
items was this money spent? It was spent on the work performed 
by the center for social assistance to the public; the 
decentralization of the payment of pensions; meals for 
schoolchildren; additional payments to children up to the age of 
one year for food (milk kitchens); additional payments for 
municipal services, radio, the payment of preferential trip 
tickets to rest homes; the conducting of holiday celebrations; 
the maintenance of the nursing care home and the social 
hospital; and the maintenance of the orphanage. 
  More than 18,000 city dwellers received material assistance 
last year: from retirees to children in single-parent homes. In 
addition to direct material assistance, the system of welfare 
payments is widespread: welfare payments for apartment rent and 
services, for medical treatment and rest, to purchase fuel in 
the private sector, and to pay for radio services. 
  In 1993 the city opened institutions for the rendering of 
emergency social assistance. Those institutions include a social 
shelter for children from 3 to 14 years of age who need shelter 
before being returned to their family or being admitted at 
children's institutions for permanent residence. Throughout the 
year, more than 200 children were taken in at the shelter. 
  There appeared a social hotel for women, single mothers with 
children, and refugees with children. The hotel accepted more 
than 50 persons. 
  Social assistance centers appeared in the city's rayons 
(effective 1 August 1993, they were put into a separate 
structure). The "Telephone of Trust" social-psychological 
telephone hot line was in operation. The need for that hot line 
is attested to by the number of calls: more than 200 a month. 
  Only one item in the city's social program remained 
unfulfilled: because of a lack of nonbudgetary funds, retirees 
from budget-financed and eliminated organizations did not 
receive their lump-sum grant in aid.

<F P=106> [Article by S. Pautova, under rubric "City Life in Facts and </F>
Figures": "We Have Not Begun Hurting Less"] 
  [Text] Today we are continuing the series of articles 
based on data provided in the "Memorandum Concerning the Basic 
Results of the Economic and Social Development of the City of 
Novokuznetsk in 1993," which was prepared by T. B. Balakirev, 
chief of the Department of Forecasts For the Development of the 
City, of the Committee for the Economy. 
  It is necessary to begin by stating that the indicators 
pertaining to the health level for the city's population are 
unsatisfactory and have a tendency toward further worsening. 
Wherein does this manifest itself? 
  Last year the mortality rate in our city was 15.5 cases per 
1000 inhabitants. As compared with 1992, that indicator rose by 
26.6 percent. The average age of persons who died was 54 years 
among men and 66 years among women. In Zavodskoy Rayon those 
indicators are, respectively, 51 and 63 years. Our men die 15 
years earlier than the average life expectancy for the country 
as a whole, and women die 5 years earlier. 
  Among those who died, one-third were persons of working age. 
For a number of reasons, the disorders that take first place 
among the deaths are cardiovascular diseases; in second place, 
traumas and poisonings; and in third place, neoplasms (that is, 
cancer diseases). Among the second category of causes of deaths, 
murders and suicides constitute a considerable percentage (40 
percent of the people who died underwent an autopsy). 
  The indicator for the infant mortality rate rose last year, 
as compared with 1992, by 6 percent, and constituted 19.9 cases 
out of 1000 live births. But the birth rate indicator dropped to 
8.09 per 1000 women of childbearing age. The negative natural 
increase in the population increased to 14 percent. 
  An additional problem is the disability rate. In 1993 the 
VTEK [Medical Commission for Determination of Disability] 
certified 5364 persons (almost 300 more than in 1992), and 
recognized 5292 persons as being disabled; this is 11 percent 
more than the previous year. Out of every 10,000 persons, 33 
retire on disability for the first time. In Kuznetskiy Rayon 
that indicator is equal to 34.7. 
  Among the reasons why people retire on disability, diseases 
are in first place; in second place, disability since childhood; 
and in third place, occupational diseases and industrial 
injuries. One observes a tendency toward an increase in the 
degree of severity of the disability: there has been an 
increasing number of persons in Group I and II. 
  The number of recorded disorders, both primary and chronic, 
in connection with which the city dwellers sought medical 
assistance in 1993 remained at practically the same level. 
However, the indicator of the overall disease rate increased, 
and constitutes 772.5 cases out of 1000 persons in the 
population (as compared with 1992, the increase constitutes 10.5 
percent). Consequently, many persons with chronic disorders do 
not seek assistance. 
  The rate of diseases and disorders among children increased. 
  As for the structure of the disorder rate among adults, one 
continues to note an increase in disorders of the cardiovascular 
system, traumas, diseases of the osteomuscular system, and the 
respiratory organs. Pathology of the respiratory organs is in 
first place percentage-wise. 
  It must be noted that, in addition to everything else, the 
city dwellers sought assistance at cooperatives and from 
physicians in private practice. This information was not taken 
into consideration during the analysis. 
  As for the rate of disorders among workers at industrial 
enterprises, one noted an increase in it: by 5.2 percent in the 
number of cases, and by 8.19 in the number of days. The highest 
level of the disorder rate was noted in the coal industry. In 
general, however, workers in the city's enterprises most 
frequently suffered from colds, traumas, and diseases of the 
osteomuscular system. 
  The imagination is staggered by the number of visits to 
clinics: 6.5 million. On average, each city dweller has 10.5 
visits a year (in 1992, there were 10.39). 
  More than 144,000 residents of the city and the oblast 
received inpatient treatment at hospitals in the city of 
Novokuznetsk (which is almost 6000 more than in 1992); and 
48,134 surgical interventions were carried out. 
  The Medical First-Aid and Emergency Station operated under 
more strained conditions than in 1992, responding to 192,794 
calls, or 18,500 more than in 1992. The structure of the calls 
made there continues to be the same: 73 percent were calls 
involving diseases; 11 percent of the calls dealt with 
accidents; and 1.3 percent of the calls dealt with childbirth.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Snisarenko: "Tyumen Oblast Gets Its Duma"] </F>
  [Text] It is specifically a duma, since according to 
the proposal of the organizational committee the deputies were 
offered two names for the supreme representative body of state 
power in Tyumen Oblast--the oblast duma or the legislative 
assembly. The deputies chose the oblast duma by a majority of 
votes. 
  And now let us proceed in order. The meeting of the oblast 
supreme body was called to order by the chairman of the 
organizational committee, A. Kayumov. All 17 elected deputies 
were present, along with the head of the oblast administration 
L. Roketskiy, his deputies, representatives of the 
Yamalo-Nenetsk and Khanty-Mansi Okrugs, the representative of 
the RF [Russian Federation] President, G. Shcherbakov, members 
of the former oblast Minor Soviet, and representatives of the 
mass media and the trade union organs. 
  Prior to the election of the chairman of the Tyumen Oblast 
Duma, the meeting was conducted by Deputy S. Kirichuk. 
  On its first day of work, the duma heard the report of A. 
Zhikharev, chairman of the oblast electoral commission. 
  The duma ratified the temporary regulations of the 
representative body of state power for Tyumen Oblast, the 
Statute on the Representative Body of Oblast Power--the Oblast 
Duma. 
  After the recess, the deputies undertook a review of the 
most 
interesting question on the agenda--the election of the oblast 
duma chairman and his deputies. 
  We must note that the proposal presented by Deputy A. 
Korelyakov to elect the duma chairman on a non-fulltime basis 
and to reduce the technical apparatus of the oblast duma to a 
proportion of one to one, with the number of apparatus workers 
equalling the number of deputies, was rejected. 
  However, another proposal presented by this same deputy was 
passed--that of introducing an amendment to Article 4 of the 
Statute on the Representative Body of State Power in Tyumen 
Oblast--the Oblast Duma. This amendment stated that a deputy has 
the right to obtain any information in the oblast and federal 
organs of executive power and the ability to bring this 
information to his voters. 
  By the results of the fourth round of voting, Nikolay 
Pavlovich Baryshnikov, the deputy head of administration of 
Khanty-Mansi Okrug, was elected chairman of the Tyumen Oblast 
Duma. 
  At the suggestion of the new chairman of the oblast duma, 
Vladimir Nikolayevich Tretyakov was elected as his deputy. 
  A detailed account of the first day's work will be presented 
in the next issue.

<F P=106> [Article by Vitaliy Snisarenko: "Potential of the Duma Is </F>
High; The Paramount Question: `How To Realize It?'"] 
  [Text] As we have already reported, the first plenary 
meeting of the representative body of state power in Tyumen 
Oblast was held, and the deputies chose to call themselves the 
"oblast duma" (only 5 of the 17 deputies voted for the name 
"legislative assembly"). 
  I believe that the motivation of Deputy V. Yudin regarding 
unity of the Russian land was well argumented: There is a state 
duma in the capital of the Russian Federation, so then why 
should every oblast or kray think up its own specific name?! 
  I also believe that Tyumen residents who are southerners 
should not react painfully to the election of northerners as the 
duma chairman and his deputy--N. Baryshnikov and V. Tretyakov. 
They are not northerners above all, but rather they are Tyumen 
residents first and foremost. In their very first brief 
speeches, both spoke primarily about unity of the oblast and 
about those pressing problems which the oblast duma is capable 
of solving only by being united. 
  The speech "on results of work," presented by the head of 
administration of Tyumen Oblast was also in the same vein. 
Specifically, L. Roketskiy synonymously emphasized that he sees 
the new duma as the main body of state power in the oblast, and 
that it is necessary to speak not so much about the natural and 
necessary separation of powers as about the parity of 
responsibility for the fate of the oblast's present and future. 
  "You have been elected from the entire territory, and this 
in 
itself is a guarantee of its unity. Let us serve Tyumen Oblast 
together!", said the governor. 
  We should mention also the farewell speech of the ex-speaker 
of our former soviet, V. Ulyanov, in which he noted most 
correctly that Tyumen Oblast was that region of Russia where, 
fortunately, the transfer of power from the "old" soviets to the 
new duma took place painlessly and in a civilized manner. 
  And now allow me to express certain strictly matter-of-fact 
and specific notions about what I expect from our duma and... 
what can be expected of it. At the same time, returning to the 
headline of the present material, I will emphasize once again 
that I believe the domestic potential of our oblast parliament 
to be really high. And it is not at all frightening that we see 
there a rather multi-layered "administrative stratification." 
Just as strong is another stratification--"first hand" economic 
managers, and next to them are teachers and doctors (I only 
regret once again that no representatives of higher education 
were elected to the duma). 
  Yes! One could sense that at its first session, some of the 
regional heads in the duma "looked askance" in the direction of 
their chief to whom they were directly subordinate. But I will 
also say that L. Roketskiy himself immediately and in rather 
strict form put a stop to their efforts at "consulting" and 
"sharing opinions." 
  Yes! One could sense that the economic managers who had won 
their relative independence tried already at the first meeting 
to stage a cavalry charge against the executive power. That 
happened too... 
  But I believe--and hope!--that this is merely the price of 
development and growth. Our duma members must realize the main 
thing: They must not follow the lead of the executive power in 
trying to patch up the holes in our badly torn coat. Rather, 
they must think about how to sew a new strong one which will 
last a long time--that is their task! 
  And this task is not an easy one. It is tremendously 
difficult. Especially since very little time has been left for 
it--some year-and-a-half or two. And if the "first convocation" 
of the duma proves unable to cope with the main task of waging a 
mental attack on the slogan, "For our bright future!", then it 
will not be able to break the ground for those who come to 
replace it in 1996, when we--well, we simply must!--will have to 
not simply follow the path of reform, but will finally have to 
see its positive results. 
  A colossal weight of responsibility is being placed today on 
the "full-time" leaders of the duma, N. Baryshnikov and V. 
Tretyakov. We do not envy them. God forbid that they become 
regular stately bureaucrats of a new model! It is they who will 
determine today how strongly and effectively the work regimen of 
duma activity will be organized, and I stress this last word. It 
is they who must reorganize the technical apparatus which we 
have inherited from yesterday's soviet into a highly productive 
instrument for the realization of the thoughts and ideas of the 
deputies, or more precisely, the members of the new duma. 
  I am not speaking now of trifles, such as when at the first 
meeting "every and all" were crowded, perspiring, into a little 
hall, where it was difficult to hear some of the speeches 
because there were not enough microphones. 
  We are speaking of something else. What we need are not 
blind 
executors, but a system of analysts which most fruitfully 
organizes and realizes the ideas and thoughts of the duma 
members. I may even be so bold as to equate these two 
forces--the duma itself and its new apparatus. If this does not 
happen, then the duma will spin its wheels in place... 
  It is enough to give at least a cursory review of the plan 
for the duma's standard-setting activity: Here we have that very 
same draft of the Tyumen Oblast Charter and its Administrative 
Code, other codes--land and water and statutes on the national 
settlement and local self-government. We cannot list them all, 
but these questions may be resolved only in a creative manner, 
and with a scrupulously pragmatic and rational approach. 
  After all, that same "administrator" V. Bugayev was correct 
in his "farewell" criticism of V. Ulyanov, when he cited the 
latter's lack of preparation in regard to the totally unclear 
mechanism for realization of the last message of the Minor 
Soviet addressed to the RF Federal Assembly. Let us consider 
this criticism as the first sign of efficiency in the work of 
our Tyumen Oblast Duma which has just begun.

<F P=106> [Open Letter to the Russian Federation President, adopted in </F>
Kirov at a meeting of the Union of Cities of Northwest Russia, 
carried under the headline: "Oh, the Governors Are Stern!"; date 
of letter not given] 
  [Text] Esteemed Boris Nikolayevich! 
  In the past three-four months the heads of administration of 
such big Russian cities as Omsk, Saratov, Vladivistok and 
Nizhniy Novgorod have been removed from office. The 
circumstances of their removal were various, but in every case 
it took place under pressure from the oblast governor. A 
standard set of accusations was made against practically every 
one of them: attacks on the oblast administration, the collapse 
of Russian statehood, links with the opponents of reform, 
corruption, a one-time flagrant violation of job duties, etc. 
  The same sort of situation is emerging today in a number of 
other cities. 
  We are very much concerned by the fact that the people 
leaving their work are honest, decent people who are deeply 
concerned over the interests of their cities and have actively 
defended the rights of local government established by the 
Russian Constitution and guaranteed by your edicts. 
  The main thing is that the dismissals were not preceded by 
objective checkups on the work of the heads of city 
administrations, they received no written explanations, the 
grounds for their removal were not examined in any commissions, 
and some of them were denied the right to the personal meeting 
with the Russian president that is guaranteed by your edicts. 
  Today most governors are doing everything they can to 
subordinate local government to themselves, which is directly 
contrary with Article 12 and Chapter 8 of the Russian 
Constitution. Those who resist this are either dismissed or 
leave on their own accord. 
  One gets the impression that local government is a fiction 
and is not needed by the federal authorities, although we are 
convinced that local government is, in an objective sense, an 
ally of the Russian president and the central authorities in the 
political and economic reform of our country and protection of 
the public's interests. 
  Esteemed president! We propose that you: 
  1. Take local government under your protection and 
guardianship. 
  2. Meet with the representatives of the unions and 
associations of Russia's cities. 
  3. Speed up the drafting of normative acts delimiting the 
jurisdiction of the bodies of state authority of the 
Federation's components, on the one hand, and of local 
government, on the other. 
  4. When heads of administration are removed from office, 
schedule elections for heads of local government with 
multiple-candidates. 
  5. On the basis of petitions by heads of administration who 
have been removed from office, carry out checkups and publish 
their results. 
  Adopted at a meeting of the Union of Cities of 
Northwest Russia in Kirov. 
<H8>  From the Editors </H8>
  V. Pyshkin, executive director of the Union of Cities of 
Northwest Russia, asked us to publish this letter to the RF 
president. In satisfying his request, we refrain from any 
commentary on the positions of the letter's authors and their 
assessment of the cases of the removal of the heads of 
administration of big Russian cities, which really have become 
more frequent. Here it is necessary, as the saying goes, to look 
into each specific case. We would like only to recall the 
article of the Constitution that is cited by the participants in 
the meeting of the cities of Northwest Russia: "... Local 
government is autonomous within the limits of its powers. Bodies 
of local government do not belong to the system of bodies of 
state authority." And while it is in the embryonic stage, as it 
were, it would probably make a lot of sense for the president to 
take it "under his protection and guardianship.

<F P=106> [Article by Afrikan Solovyev and Galina Pechilina: </F>
"President of Chuvashia Does Not Get Into Conflict With the 
Agrarian Lobby"] 
  [Text] After the federal center got over the fever of 
drawing up economic programs at the beginning of 1990, the 
Russian provinces fell ill with program-creating. Lately 
KOMMERSANT experts have been predicting a sharp increase in the 
activeness of local authorities in seeking various options for 
getting out of the economic crisis. In this connection, the 
question of the powers of local political elites will be raised 
anew. This past weekend Chuvashia, where the local press 
published the theses of a "Program of Popular Reform," made 
itself known. 
  Interest in the program has to do with the identity of the 
consultants who took part in drafting it. In addition to the 
president's economic advisers, Finance Minister Boris Fedorov 
and Sergey Glazyev, head of the parliamentary Committee on 
Economic Policy, as well as Viktor Kisin, the former minister of 
industry in Ivan Silayev's government (and now Chuvashia's 
representative to Russia's highest bodies of state 
administration), the program was prepared by specialists from 
the Russian government's Center for Informational and Social 
Technologies (its director Yevgeniy Saburov became the "main 
reformer" in Crimea's government), and the Export-Import Bank, 
which is the Chuvash government's financial agent. 
  Noting the complexity of the republic's socioeconomic 
situation, Nikolay Fedorov (former minister of justice in the 
governments of Ivan Silayev and Yegor Gaydar) wrote an item in 
the press on behalf of the authors and attributed this 
complexity not only to reasons that are typical of 
Russia--inflation, the decline in production, the shortage of 
working capital--but also to distinctive features of Chuvashia 
that have deepened its economic crisis. Among these he included 
the lack of a clearly defined economic specialization, a 
sizeable proportion of production facilities that are subject to 
defense-industry conversion, a labor surplus, agrarian 
overpopulation, the high unit-cost of production, and the 
underdevelopment of the market infrastructure. Fedorov defined 
his objective somewhat uniquely: "The coming years will be years 
of gathering money in order that afterwards there will really be 
something to give out." Many people believe that hidden behind 
these words lies an announcement of the introduction of a regime 
of strict economy in the republic. The financial creed of the 
Chuvash government has been announced more candidly: "Not to 
give in to pressure from the people that is irresponsible in 
terms of the future." 
  As for relations with Moscow, Fedorov did not show any 
particular originality in noting the need to renovate them, 
which was supposed to have been provided for in the treaty with 
Russia on the delimitation of powers and subjects of 
jurisdiction. 
  Implementation of the program will be carried out on the 
basis of individual subprograms. In particular, there is a 
proposal for joint actions among Russia's republics and the CIS 
countries to establish an international bank and clearing 
system, as well as several joint concerns in the form of 
financial and industrial groups. In addition, it is planned to 
establish, on the basis of Chuvashia's enterprises, five or six 
model concerns that will be assigned the role of being the 
locomotive of a fundamentally new economic system in the 
republic--"an industrial-agrarian type in combination with small 
and medium-sized private enterprises." The partners of 
participants in this program will be determined through 
international, federal and republic investment competitions. An 
incentive for successful implementation of the idea will be the 
condition that after two or three years of effective work a 
firm's original property and newly created property, including 
land, will be transferred to collective or private ownership. 
Touching on issues of privatization, Fedorov expressed a rather 
populistic support for making active adjustments in it: "We 
cannot be pleased by a practice of privatization as the result 
of which we get, in place of monopolistic prices, 
supermonopolistic prices; instead of an increase in the 
efficiency of production, a decline or total collapse of 
production; and instead of an increase in budget revenues, a 
drastic decrease in revenues." As a matter of fact, the 
"privatization" part of the program is limited to that. 
  It is interesting that, against a backdrop of rather liberal 
statements, the program declares that, under the conditions of a 
republic that is small in terms of land, private farming is not 
promising: reliance is being placed on well-organized collective 
farms. Thus, through the example of Chuvashia, we can see the 
vanity of any attempts to smash the colossus of the agrarian 
lobby, which opposes the least disturbance of the status quo in 
land relations.

<F P=106> [Article by Irina Pirogova: "Drums Are Pounding in My Heart: </F>
Future of Small Ethnic Groups of the North Endangered"] 
  [Text] Anadir-Uzlen-Buktha Provideniya- Moscow--Not so long 
ago I caught sight of an issue of MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS which 
contained an article by the writer Valeriy Povolyayev entitled 
"Why Do the Chukchi Have Russian Names?" I read it carefully 
because I spent my school years on Chukotka and I have been 
there on business trips. This opus left me with a wild 
impression. The former Soviet writer, ex-secretary of the Union 
of Writers of the RSFSR and an activist in the Komsomol-Youth 
and other widespread publications, retells from the words of his 
dinner partner a couple of old anecdotes about residents of the 
North. For instance, about the fact that a representative of the 
local authorities when filling out passports, not being terribly 
bright, filled in all of them with names like Ivan Ivanov, 
Petrov, Sidorov, etc., and a photographer who was no better 
pasted photographs of one person in all the documents--he said 
they all looked the same. 
  Funny, is it not? Especially when you find out that the 
writer's friend was talking about Koryaks, who live, as we know, 
on Kamchatka, while the article made no mention at all of 
Chukchi. Is it worthwhile to waste paper and ink on such a 
"myth"? The answer, which is simple for any self-respecting 
writer, is not only not acceptable to Povolyayev but, on the 
contrary, he tries to capitalize on other people's anecdotes, as 
it were, cutting himself a piece of ham from the overall 
swinishness. Hence the attempt to appear as one who tells 
"pretty tales" about international friendship supposedly 
generated by the "empire of evil," from which Povolyayev broke 
away, after being treated extremely well there, again in the 
name of the triumph of democracy. 
  I was inclined to remain silent. Let God be his judge. But 
my 
pain over the fate of that wonderful land to which I had come so 
close, its small and adult children, would not leave me in peace 
all this time. As for the friendship of peoples, which is now 
threatening to become anathema, we would do better to listen to 
the writer Yuriy Rytkheu. 
  "I recall a case from my childhood," said Rytkheu. "In 1940 
an unprecedented flu epidemic broke out among us in Uzlen, and 
at that time the Northern peoples were not so protected. We were 
all in bed in our tepees. There was nobody to go hunting. And we 
had nothing with which to buy food. We were already eating 
cooked strips of leather, pieces of walrus hide. And suddenly 
some incredible news spread through our tepees: Everyone could 
go to the store and take food, whatever he needed and however 
much he wanted. Absolutely free of charge. At first nobody 
believed this, and then somebody decided to go and see. I went 
too. It all turned out to be true. To this day I get a lump in 
my throat when I recall this. 
  "The country was at war. Leningrad, besieged by the enemy, 
was under a blockade. The entire working rear was on a 
starvation ration, and suddenly the store in Uzlen was opened 
wide and we were taking bread baked by the Russian baker Uncle 
Kolya from an unmanned store, without a salesman. Perhaps it was 
this bread that saved my compatriot Anna Ntutetegryne, who later 
became chairman of the Chukotka district ispolkom [executive 
committee] and a member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet 
of the USSR. And my sister Galya, who is working as an animal 
breeder. And myself, whose first teacher of literature was 
Aleksandr Tvardovskiy. And many others of my countrymen...Yuriy 
and Galina Rytkheu, Antonina Kymtytval, Anna Ntutetegryne, Zoya 
Nenlyumkina, Nina Akukyn, Vladislav Rintetegin--Russian first 
names, Chukchi and Eskimo last names. These were their parents' 
names. 
  "And as for certain difficulties with the pronunciation and 
writing, perhaps our state which is zealously striving to be 
democratic should take the path of Western 'civilized' 
countries. Yuriy Sergeyevich told me about the only Eskimo 
student in Canada, Mary Carpenter, from the University of 
Western Ontario. She gave him a brochure published by the 
Indian-Eskimo Association of Canada which said Canadians spend 
on average per year: $500 million on travel abroad, $1 
billion--on alcoholic beverages, $200 million--on confectionery 
items, and $30 million--on food for dogs and cats. And reading 
on in this brochure one could learn that out of every thousand 
newborn Eskimos almost one-fifth die in childhood--10 times more 
than among the white residents of Ontario. During past years the 
standard of living of white Canadians has risen higher and 
higher, but as for Eskimos...." 
  In parting Rytkheu asked Mary to write her address down in 
his notebook. After her name Mary wrote W-3-244. 
  "Is that your postal address?" Yuriy Sergeyevich tried to 
clarify. 
  "No," answered Mary, "that is my number." It turned out 
that, 
for purposes of government statistics, Eskimos of Canada do not 
have first names. This is explained by the fact that Eskimo 
names are too difficult to pronounce and write. Therefore they 
have decided to assign each Eskimo a number. 
  "Western Eskimos have the letter W in front of their name, 
just as I do, and Eastern ones have E. It is easy and simple. We 
in Tiyuktoyuk have carved these numbers on a wooden chip and 
every Eskimo wears this chip on a chain around his neck, next to 
the cross," Mary explained. 
  Some 40,000 people, a whole nation, have been numbered like 
a 
herd of reindeer or a crowd of prisoners in a concentration 
camp. Indeed: "What is in a name?" But here in Leningrad back in 
the 1930's the only faculty of peoples of the Far North in the 
world was opened at the Pedagogical Institute imeni A.I. 
Gertsen, and dozens of generations of humanities specialists 
have trained there, making up the basis of a new national 
intelligentsia. 
  Since the beginning of "perestroyka" this process has slowed 
up considerably as, incidentally, have all the other processes 
related to the socioeconomic position of indigenous and 
immigrant residents of Chukotka. And the apogee of plundering 
has been reached. The prolonged illness of this region's economy 
is threatening to come to an abrupt end. The more gold, fish, 
pelts, and other assets the state structures and private 
entrepreneurs take out of this land, the worse the life of its 
inhabitants become, year after year. 
  Back four years ago the shortage of goods from Magadan 
Oblast, and hence above all from Chukotka, amounted to 54 
million rubles [R] (not the present "wooden" ones, but the 
former full-value "Union" ones), of which R42 million were for 
food. Each year here they obtain practically no meat, potatoes, 
vegetables, or fruits. During the last navigation period they 
shipped in barely 20 percent of the Northern "food basket." And 
what else can be expected when a state, torn apart by political 
and ethnic conflicts, bled dry by hyperinflation and a 
catastrophic drop in production, is not able to feed its own 
citizens even on the Mainland. 
  Everything extracted on Chukotka goes for export--to be 
sold. 
And what is received in exchange? Coupons for sugar, alcohol, 
and condensed milk. Do you want more food products and of better 
quality? Go to the commercial stores where, what with the higher 
costs of fuel, payment for energy sources, and the disappearance 
of the paper ruble, prices are such that you would not dream 
about them in a terrible nightmare. And these mountain hicks can 
now take anything they want from commerce. Oranges, tangerines, 
raisins, unlimited alcohol.... 
  "How do they get there," I naively asked the people with 
whom 
I was talking, "if this is a special zone and even someone on a 
business trip has to present a special permit from the organs of 
the Ministry of Internal Affairs in their place of residence?" 
  "Very simple. At some point a person has gone to vacation in 
the Caucasus, he has been discovered by local merchants and 
offered a deal: You send me an invitation to be a guest and I 
will pay you with both money and goods when I arrive. How can 
you resist the temptation when things are as scarce as they are 
today?"--they explained to me. 
  For a certain amount of time the local authorities were 
still 
hoping for state credit. Today, now that through the efforts of 
the "shock therapists," food prices have shot out of sight, 
there are no hopes for credit. The all-Russian conference on 
problems of survival of the Northern peoples held recently in 
Krasnoyarsk could only sum up the sad results of the current 
destructive credit policy of the powers that be in these regions. 
  "The money that is being allotted is several times less than 
what is needed. The credit moves to the recipients at such rates 
that during this time because of inflation and the complete 
destabilization of the price policy it almost turns into a heap 
of ashes. In some places the navigation period lasts only 10-25 
days. Nobody needs the money arriving on the 26th day--after all 
there are simply no other ways of bringing in supplies." 
  Thus the residents of Chukotka of all 
nationalities--Chukchi, 
Eskimos, Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians, who at one time 
were representatives of the unified Soviet brotherhood of 
peoples and now do not know what their citizenship is or who 
needs them--have only one solution: to go begging to their 
relatives in Alaska and its state authorities and ask for help 
or engage in underground barter and recall the good old days 
when the Soviets were still in power here. Perhaps in general 
they should follow the example of Alaska and sell Chukotka to 
Clinton along with Magadan so that they will not bother Moscow, 
the Kremlin, and the White House with their long-standing 
complaints and requests like this? 
  When I was still a child I read a remarkable book by Tikhon 
Semushkin entitled "Alitet Goes to the Mountains," which 
discusses the first years of Soviet power on Chukotka. 
  And he is not the only person whose creative work was linked 
to the Far North and pointed out the path of great Russian 
literature to its talented sons. Semushkin discussed this in a 
conversation with Yuriy Rytkheu: "It seems to me that you and 
Grigoriy Khodzher, and Vladimir Sangi, and Yuvan Shestalov, and 
many others seem to come from the books written by Vatslav 
Serashevskiy, Vladimir Bogoraztan, Vladimir Arsenyev, Gennadiy 
Gor, Nikolay Shudin...." 
  With their help and support during the forties and fifties 
they formed the spiritual environment in which the local 
intelligentsia grew up. Yuriy Rytkheu himself, having become a 
student at the Leningrad Pedagogical Institute imeni A.I. 
Gertsen, began his literary activity with a translation into his 
native language of the works of Russian and Soviet writers, 
received the blessing of A. Tvardovskiy on the pages of NOVYY 
MIR and published more than 30 books with 8 million copies 
translated into 17 languages, not counting the languages of the 
peoples of the Soviet Union. 
  Reflecting on this creative process of mutual enrichment of 
cultures, Yuriy Rytkheu then writes: "It is interesting that 
during those years we did not even think about receiving the 
wealth of another people. It seemed to me at that time that it 
was quite natural and legitimate that the wealth of one people 
belonged to another." 
  It seems to me that a people's cultural wealth essentially 
does not depend on numbers although, on the other hand, it lives 
and develops only as long as its creator thrives in the land. 
  I recall my last meeting in Anadyr with participants in the 
Eskimo people's ensemble "Atasikun." The women take along their 
tambourines and drums and they sing. The pounding of the drums 
and the singing that penetrates to the heart took me back to 
somewhere in ancient times and I got the feeling that I was on a 
seacoast at sunrise. Two boys were dancing and their smooth, 
rhythmic movements told me visually about the awakening of the 
polar night. Then it turned out that I was not mistaken: This 
dance, "Our Land," was handed down from generation to 
generation, and in general everything I saw that evening was not 
simply a concert. People of kindred spirit had gathered here and 
they spoke the language of song and dance and recalled something 
very distant and dear. And along with respect for them and 
delight in their art, in my heart there grew a feeling of 
sadness: Why are there so few of them? 
  Are you alive, "Atasikun?" How are things going for you in 
this time of trouble when the laws of our friendship have been 
trampled into the dirt by highly placed Ivans who do not recall 
their heritage?

With New Title"] 
  [Text] With his new title, Karelia's president, the 
communist Viktor Stepanov, from now on will be deriving his 
power from direct election by the voters in acting as leader of 
the Republic. 
  According to preliminary results in Monday's election, the 
47-year old Stepanov garnered 68 percent of votes cast in the 
race for chairman of the Karelian government. He was thge only 
candidate whose powers correspond to those of other republics' 
leaders. Until now, Stepanov's title has been speaker of the 
Karelian Supreme Soviet, or parliament.

  Karelia's venerable Prime Minister Sergei Blinnikov likewise 
politically a man of the old guard, was originally a candidate 
running against Stepanov, but pulled out of the campaign a month 
before the election. Pro-reform forces tried in vain to push a 
young generation democrat, Petroskoi University Professor Sergei 
Belozertseveya, to become a third candidate. 
  Stepanov's behind-the-scene forces, the Karelian Communist 
League and the Veterans Association, in his election campaign 
charged the breakup of the Soviet Union as a mistake, and 
demanded those responsible for it--thus also President Boris 
Yeltsin--be brought to justice. 
  Stepanov himself, however, apparently would prefer a 
face-to-face meeting with Yeltsin, and to appear as the man 
whose good relations with the central government will produce 
tangible advantages for Karelia. 
  The Moscow paper NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA in its latest monthly 
rating of political figures ["political stock exchange"] placed 
Stepanov 88th on the list of Russia's one-hundred most 
influential politicians. 
<H5>  New Name for the Parliament </H5>
  Karelian voters on Sunday [17 April] elected a group of 
local 
government bodies, as well as a new 61-member, bicameral 
parliament. Its name will no longer be the Supreme Soviet, but 
the Lawmaking Assembly. 
  The election outcome will be more clear later. Definite 
power 
relationships of the type seen in West Europe are out of the 
question, since many representatives have not revealed their 
affiliations, and because identification with a party is in 
practice far less binding than is in the case in the Finnish 
parliament. 
  For Finns this was hardly a real election, since less than 
35 
percent of eligible voters cast their ballot in the city of 
Kostamus and in the Petroskoi election district. For the entire 
Republic the figure was 42 percent. In elections held last 
December and in voting on the constitution 54 percdnt of 
Karelians still bothered to vote.

<F P=106> [Article by Zoya Makmatova, chief engineer of the </F>
information department of the West Siberian Administration for 
Territorial Monitoring of the Environment: "Ecological 
Monitoring; On the Ice--Oil, in the Water--Arsenic, in the 
Air--Ammonia. Although It Could Have Been Worse"] 
  [Text] According to data of the West Siberian territorial 
center for hydrometeorology and monitoring environmental 
pollution, several emergency situations were observed at the end 
of March and in April. 
  On the night of 29 March in Leninsk-Kuznetskiy, while 
discharges from the worsted cloth combine were being pumped, 
electric power was cut off in the second microrayon, as a result 
of which the sewerage pumping station went out of operation. The 
disposal of household fecal wastes into the Meret River (a 
tributary of the Ina) amounted to 1,800 cubic meters a day. It 
was not until the evening of 4 April that the sewerage pumping 
station was brought back into operation. 
  On 30 March 12 tonnes of crude oil were poured onto the ice 
of the Ob River, five miles below Kolpashevo (the pollution area 
totaled 3,800 square meters). Part of the oil was pumped out, 
and the rest was burned on the ice. The Tomskiy Geophysical 
Trust was guilty of the pollution. 
  On 22 March an observer of the hydrometeorological post of 
Shelabolikha (Ob River) noticed a yellow foam across the whole 
river. Water analysis tests conducted in the rayon of 
Kamen-na-Ob showed increased content of petroleum products (39 
PDK [maximum permissible concentration], arsenic (14 PDK), and 
synthetic surface substances (10-12 PDK)). The Altay Kray 
Ecology Committee believes that the arsenic got into the water 
along with pesticides that were washed off from the fields. 
  In April three incidents of high pollution (above 5 PDK) of 
the atmosphere by nitrogen dioxide was observed in Novosibirsk. 
One of the incidents (8.5 PDK) occurred as a result of waste 
from the refinery plant Atoll. 
  Four incidents of atmospheric pollution by nitrogen dioxide 
and one incident of methanol were registered in April in Tomsk. 
The source of the pollution were the petroleum combine and 
TETs-3 [thermal electric power plant]. 
  The plant rayon industrial center and the coke and chemical 
plant were the source of pollution of the atmosphere in Kemerovo 
with ammonia (5.5 PDK) and carbon disulfide (24 PDK).

<F P=106> [Article by Tatyana Kirshina: "The Elevator Is Plunging. But </F>
We Are Still Alive..."] 
  [Text] The picture of a broken and rapidly falling 
elevator as a reflection of Russia's present condition is no 
longer a novelty to anyone. When I visualize this picture, the 
question that comes to mind for me personally is: Does this mean 
that we will inevitably crash (after all, an elevator is not 
repaired while it is falling), and only then will we be able to 
begin to repair it? But is there a landing pad on which the 
elevator can plop down with passengers who can still think after 
the dizzying drop?.. 
  A third of the residents of Novosibirsk Oblast are below the 
poverty line--this is a statistical fact. Sociologists give 
other figures: Only 9-12 percent of the respondents they polled 
believe that they are living normally, and the rest, in their 
personal opinion, are living in poverty. An interesting fact, 
people are starting to bake bread not only in the village but 
also in the city, and they are eating it now far more--alas, 
they cannot afford many other food products. The residents of 
Novosibirsk now consume half as much sugar and fish. But what 
can be said about vegetables, fruit, and meat! Do not be upset, 
food specialists console us, meat is generally harmful. In 1991, 
for example, they issued this recommendation: For an adult, 20.9 
kilograms of meat per year is quite enough. One would like very 
much to believe them, if a year earlier these very same 
specialists had not cited an entirely different figure--they 
recommended that we eat 80.3 kilograms of meat in a year. How 
cleverly this turns out for us--we can adjust the "scientific" 
recommendation to current life. At present, however, there are 
no recommendations at all about what and how much we should eat. 
Obviously, there is only this advice: Whatever one can get... 
  It seems that not one bright spot was seen in the stream of 
unpalatable information that the participants in the social 
policy section passed out in their speeches at the Novosibirsk 
scientific-practical conference "Strategy for Stabilization of 
the Region's Economy." 
  But the fact itself, albeit not of a very equal partnership 
of the problems being discussed--economic and social--probably 
was the bright spot at a conference with a technocratically 
dominant idea. 
  If we do not now make a decisive turn to the individual, and 
if, as before, we are fixated on searching for a resolution of 
the problem of "pure" economics, then within 25 years the 
economic mechanism will chew up the population, rendering it 
childless and sick. This is the forecast of Academician Vlail 
Kaznacheyev--it is by no means just an image, it is supported by 
sound calculations. 
  Kaznacheyev said that a person also has his own KPD 
[efficiency factor]--the realization of his creative potential. 
How will society claim from each of us what is embedded by 
nature? In Russia, this KPD is 3-5 percent (out of 100 persons, 
only three to five do the work they were meant to do). The KPD 
of individuals in developed countries is four times higher. Will 
we catch up to the West in this indicator some day? For the time 
being, we are showing the world another phenomenon--not only a 
quantitative but also a qualitative demographic shock that is 
unprecedented in world history. 
  An understanding of the fact that the time has come to 
change 
priorities and to rank the individual higher than the economy 
seems to be taking shape among Novosibirsk Oblast authorities--a 
specific social program has been established in the oblast, 
responsibility for whose implementation has been entrusted to 
the first deputy governor for the economy. At the conference, 
incidentally, it was proposed that the deputy governor for 
social problems be given the status of first deputy. That is the 
way it is in Yaroslavl, for example.. However, for the time 
being the Novosibirsk governor...does not have a deputy on 
social questions at all--the position is vacant. 
  "We came to this conference not with fresh innovations," 
Kaznacheyev explained, "they have been in preparation for many 
years. About 100 practical proposals were contained in the 
recommendations that our section developed. But we think that it 
is necessary to make the section itself a permanent operation. 
So that we will be heard at more than just conferences." 
  Novosibirsk Oblast has almost 600,000 families: With 
children 
(58 percent), and childless, two-parent, and single parent 
families (10 percent). It is on the basis of family policy that 
various socioeconomic problems can be resolved. But in each 
sphere it is difficult to resolve them in isolation. What can 
the Novosibirsk social assistance service do when for each 
insufficiently provided-for person (there are 482,000 of them in 
the oblast), it is able to allocate from its budget only 1,260 
rubles [R] each per year, but the subsistence minimum is 
R55,250. The government proposes to feed the poor exclusively at 
the expense of the local budget. Maybe the law on the 
subsistence minimum, the possibility of the adoption of which 
was recently discussed in the State Duma, will somehow help set 
priorities? 
  Meanwhile, the law and its normative documents on employment 
are far from being completed. But what if the problems of 
unemployment, migration, and social policy were all tied 
together in a common program of all of the CIS republics. After 
all, refugees continue to come to Siberia, but the number of 
jobs is being cut here as before... 
  According to rumors, albeit not officially verified, as one 
of the speakers at the conference recounted, a modern 
Raskolnikov has appeared in Novosibirsk Oblast. He killed an 
elderly woman who, it appears, made loans at high interest rates 
to impoverished fellow-villagers. Village pensioners here and 
there now live better than those who work in agricultural 
joint-stock companies of machine operators and cattlebreeders, 
whose monthly earnings fluctuate in the range of R7-12,000 
rubles. 
  Will our elevator have to plunge downward much more? It is 
time to repair it.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yevgeniy Ivanovich Nazdratenko, head of </F>
administration of Maritime Kray and Federation Council deputy, 
by Natalya Vstovskaya; place and date not given: "Yevgeniy 
Nazdratenko: `For Me, the Kray Is a Big Economy'"] 
  [Text] His name flashed across the pages of the 
kray's press, and soon, at the end of the 1980's, beyond its 
boundaries as well. Starting from scratch, with 17 kindred 
spirits, he established a mining company in Dalnegorsk--in a 
city in the northern Maritime area. For a certain time the 
enthusiasts worked at their business, specifically "their own," 
without losing courage, literally "working for nothing." They 
did not divide the first profit of 25,000 among themselves and, 
with patient agreement, the wives invested in the production. 
After a certain number of such turnovers this was a unique 
enterprise in which everything became beautiful a la Chekhov: 
the work, the life of the worker, and the amazing harmony with 
work-giving nature. In May 1993 Yevgeniy Ivanovich Nazdratenko 
was entrusted to manage Maritime Kray. And in December 80 
percent of Maritimers voted for him as a deputy of the 
Federation Council. 
  [Nazdratenko] I could have improved things more in my mining 
business. But concern for the future, at least for my children, 
did not permit me to continue to live in an oasis, when there is 
devastation all around. This is what led me to today's 
post--anguish over how my countrymen are forced to live. And I 
am confident that my team shares it completely. 
  [Vstovskaya] The inheritance that fell to your lot, Yevgeniy 
Ivanovich, is not enviable. The time has come to shovel aside 
the obstructions of the Maritime economy... 
  [Nazdratenko] Not even local obstructions, but the 
consequences of the breakdown--the financial system of the 
country and nonpayments. On one hand the kray has very rich 
resource capabilities and very valuable experience in 
interbranch cooperation, and on the other, there is a euphoria 
of permissiveness and absence of control, pilfering of state 
property, and a transfer of raw materials abroad. 
  Many know how at one time I fought for the idea of 
joint-stock companies. I was one of the first to establish an 
enterprise with a nonstate form of ownership, which the 
communists did not like: At that time there was no talk yet 
about conversion to joint-stock companies and privatization. But 
now the democrats are accusing me of conservatism, calling me a 
partocrat and an opponent of progress. But I am not against the 
processes themselves, I am against the methodology of conducting 
conversion to joint-stock companies. Who in the country needs 
this conversion to joint-stock companies, when all of our 
industry has "died." Who becomes the owner, and the owner of 
what? The owner of the graveyard of industry, perhaps? Or is the 
situation similar to that of the Bor association. If the 
subscription for stocks brings with it a 30-40 percent reduction 
in the number of workers, and the people under the conditions of 
a single-industry village or a single-industry city cannot find 
work anywhere, then, tell me, who needs such conversion to 
joint-stock companies? Directors should not blindly carry out 
directives from the top, but, with a sense responsibility for 
the people in the creation of state programs, should proceed 
from local conditions. If you cannot find an optimal solution 
with the record and progress of production and the interests of 
the people, then it is better that you leave and not taint 
yourself with sin! Therefore, it is all the same to me what I 
will be called--a democrat, a communist, or a Bolshevik--the 
main thing is that I am confident that I am acting in the 
interests of the people. Now the question has been raised: to 
give complete authority to convert to joint-stock companies on 
the territory, taking local conditions into account. It was 
necessary to have three years of such savage and snarling 
privatization to understand just what we have piled up. But now 
they are letting the localities unravel it. Did I not say turn 
to conversion to joint-stock companies, but in the direction of 
the people?! 
  [Vstovskaya] Yevgeniy Ivanovich, at the same time, industry 
has used up the energy requisitions. Nonetheless, it was 
possible to live through the winter and not freeze, and not to 
be in debt to the Federation. 
  [Nazdratenko] My team and I are frequently accused of going 
to Moscow to scrounge for money. But we demand only that which 
is our due. In what way, for example, is the single-industry 
city Bolshoy Kamen, with its Zvezda plant that repairs 
submarines, guilty? What--is it asking for subsidies? No--it has 
a positive balance sheet. In what way is the aircraft-building 
city of Arsenyev to blame? Is it asking for subsidies? It has a 
positive balance sheet. How is the group of plants, including 
Dalzavod, guilty? They fulfilled their duties to the government. 
I am not asking for subsidies. I am asking them to pay for 
produced products. Pay them! They will then receive their wages, 
they will pay taxes, they will pay for electric power, we will 
pay for fuel--to the krays and regions of Russia--and everything 
will take its normal course. Therefore, when the state law on 
bankruptcy is being prepared, it is not entirely understandable 
to me in this situation. After all, the bankrupt is now the 
state, which does not pay the plants, and they become bankrupt. 
How can such a law be implemented? First pay, and then it will 
be clear who is a bankrupt and who is not. It is necessary first 
to become familiar with the credit-financial system in the 
country. 
  Now, as for energy requisitions. If we use the terminology 
of 
Gaydar's doctrine--everyone under market conditions should have 
equal conditions for getting started... Excuse me, what kind of 
starting positions does the Maritime area have? When, for 
example, the energy surplus in the chain of the Siberian GES 
[Hydroelectric Power Station] puts the cost of a kilowatt-hour 
at 9 rubles [R]. On Kamchatka it is R230, Sakhalin--R170, 
Khabarovsk--R87, and Magadan--R90. In Maritime Kray it is R40, 
the lowest of the Far East cities, but this is owing to the fact 
that in August it was possible, together with the government, to 
work out the wonderful Decree No. 1001 on stabilization of the 
economy of the kray, which guaranteed Maritime Kray special help 
from Russia, which is being implemented in the part of the 
subsidy to the fuel-energy complex. After all, Maritime Kray is 
the main eastern gateway and the transport back of Russia, and 
carries a huge load. 
  The energy crisis of budget enterprises practically does not 
affect defense industries. What difference does it make to a 
defense enterprise how much a kilowatt-hour costs, it makes no 
difference, it is paid for out of the state budget. But for the 
rest of the enterprises--commercial, fish processing, mining, 
lumber, and building branches--after all, these same figures 
stifle every kind of production. I think that average tariffs 
should be adopted for the entire territory of the Russian 
Federation. Whether for the Kola Peninsula, where there is a 
surplus of nuclear electric power stations, or Siberia, where 
there is a chain of Siberian electric power stations, or for the 
Maritime area, which has very little energy of its own 
production. 
  We did not live this winter--we survived. I am so grateful 
to 
all the people for their patience! There truly was a frontline 
situation. It was even necessary to evacuate whole villages in 
some regions of Russia. Thank God it did not reach this point 
here. The absolutely helpless people were covered in this 
terrifying situation. Pensioners and invalids. In a word, it was 
easy to control the money that was released for these purposes. 
  To resolve the question of energy supply for the Maritime 
area, the Ussuriysk TETs [thermal electric power station] has to 
be completed. But the question arises: How is it to be fed? It 
will be necessary to develop new open-pit coal mines. And to 
have our own coal, and not depend on the central part of the 
country. For the reason that after tariffs on electrical energy, 
the second hitch is railroad tariffs, which cut off the oxygen 
for the railroaders themselves: 37 percent of the freight was 
not shipped, and they remained out of work. But if we have our 
own coal, which will not have to be conveyed from far off, the 
cost of electric power will become cheaper, and the enterprises 
will be able to take a deep breath of air. And we will solve the 
problem for a minimum of 10 years. But this will require the 
assistance of the Government of the Russian Federation. 
  The present railroad tariffs do not permit the kray to 
either 
import or export anything. When you pay R120 million for one 
rail car from Vladivostok to Moscow, what can be carried in it? 
It is unprofitable. Therefore, we are correct in already buying 
grain abroad this year, and bringing it in by sea. And meat, and 
macaroni products... 
  An edict of the president on support for Russian grain 
producers was being prepared. This edict established huge duties 
so that we would not import grain from abroad. In principle and 
in logic--yes, all rural residents should welcome this. But in 
the Maritime area, which is oriented on the defense industry, 
and where the terrain is mountainous and not much grain is 
grown, this is unacceptable. We talked about this in the 
government. We had numerous proposals and were able to convince 
the president and the government, and they passed a decree 
according to which there is no duty on imported grain, and there 
is a differentiated approach to other products. Consider--an 
ocean liner takes 12 days from Canada and carries 10,000 tonnes 
of wheat at one time, at an acceptable price. A tonne of 
Canadian wheat costs us R100,000, while a tonne of Altay wheat 
costs R270,000. Which is better? 
  Incidentally, the government treated us with complete 
understanding, and exempted us from customs duties with respect 
to grain. And we will without fail find how to support our own 
grain producers and other agricultural products. 
  [Vstovskaya] The government also heard the appeals of the 
administration regarding fair export quotas and duties for 
enterprises that were glutted! 
  [Nazdratenko] I also consider this to be a victory of common 
sense. Six enterprises of the mining industry of Maritime Kray 
for whom duties were removed will be able to sell part of their 
concentrate and its production abroad. The enterprises have once 
again begun to work at full capacity, and people have gone back 
to their jobs. Previously some of the most profitable 
enterprises--Dalnepolymetall, Bor, and the well-known 
Spassktsement, although it was idle all winter, are beginning to 
work at full speed. And now orders have come in for cement. 
  Only Khrustalnenskiy GOK [mine processing combine] is not 
part of such enterprises. Its position is more complicated, 
inasmuch as the central mine there ran out, and it is being 
closed down. But this combine makes up the town: It is the only 
large employer in the village of Kavalerovo. Therefore we are 
concerned for it and the whole village. We are now working on an 
agreement with Kamchatka where there are a number of gold, 
nickel, and sulfur deposits. Part of the resources will be moved 
there, and work will be conducted on the watch method. This, 
probably, is right. 
  [Vstovskaya] All this is extremely necessary and 
appreciable, 
but it is unskilled labor. Is it already possible to construct a 
building on a level platform? 
  [Nazdratenko] We have already started to draft an important 
decree, and we are coming to an agreement with the government on 
a concept of the status of Maritime Kray and its development. I 
think that this will be a working document, if the government 
accepts it. It has gotten an "OK" from Viktor Chernomyrdin, 
chairman of the Government-Council of Ministers. Only scientists 
of the Far Eastern Department of the Russian Academy of Sciences 
are involved. No one from abroad will be brought in--only with 
our own mentality! Whatever we come up with is what we will live 
with. There will be nobody to accuse of leading us down the 
wrong path. Of course, the prologue was Decree No. 1001. A lot 
of good things are outlined there. Our latest document that is 
being prepared on the status of the kray in light of the new 
constitution, according to which we all became components of the 
Federation (that is, everyone worries about his own territory) 
with a unified constitution and a unified political system, will 
make it possible to take into account the economic interests of 
the Maritime area as a part of Russia and the Far Eastern 
Region. To determine in what directions and how its economy will 
exist independently. 
  Part of this big concept for the development of the Maritime 
area is the outlook of the kray under conditions of a transfer 
to the market in light of the geostrategic and economic 
interests of Russia is being developed on resources from the 
budget of Russia. 
  [Vstovskaya] How do you see Maritime area relations with 
other territories of the Far East? 
  [Nazdratenko] The problems of the Maritime area, Kamchatka, 
Magadan, Sakhalin, and Khabarovsk could be resolved in one idea. 
Apparently, the tsar who did not divide these krays and oblasts, 
but simply named a governor-general, was not stupid. I think 
that the time will come when we will have to unite. I, at least, 
am taking big steps toward this. We must integrate; otherwise, 
each will be selling its resources abroad for a song. I would 
see such cooperation here. Although there are a lot of 
differences internally as well. 
  In a word, I am an industrialist, and I treat our Maritime 
area as one big economy. We lived through the winter. And 
although it was very difficult (but, in addition, endless audits 
and dirty tricks were distracting), I am not disappointed in the 
work. And concern for the next winter is already pushing people 
into action. Because we did not succeed in developing open-pit 
mines, we did not succeed in developing coal supplies. We did 
not succeed in completing the construction of the Ussuriysk 
TETs. We need state money--there is none. There are many 
problems. One thing is left: For us, Maritimers, to continue to 
work, rolling up our sleeves, together with other Far 
Easterners. To work in a good way with the government and to 
resolve tasks that life presents us logically and not simply to 
put forth slogans.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Main Indicators Characterizing the </F>
Social-Economic Situation in the Oblast in January-March 1994"] 
  [Text] According to data of the Moscow Oblast 
Statistical Committee, state and private enterprises, 
joint-stock companies, and associations produced industrial 
products amounting to 2 trillion rubles [R] in current prices. 
By comparison with the corresponding period in 1993, the volume 
of production fell by 33.6 percent. Industrial labor 
productivity amounted to 74.2 percent of last year's level. 
  The output of consumer commodities amounted to R638.1 
billion, including food commodities--R157.9 billion, and nonfood 
commodities--R480.2. With regard to January-March the production 
of consumer commodities was reduced by 24.4 percent. 
  Owing to all sources of financing, R454 billion of capital 
investments were acquired. Construction-assembly work was 
implemented in the amount of R343.6 billion. The following were 
put into operation: 220.3 thousand square meters of housing, a 
school for 400 pupils, and a 170-bed hospital. Eleven percent 
more dwelling units were built than a year ago. 
  Agricultural enterprises of the oblast produced about 49,000 
tonnes of meat, 208,000 tonnes of milk, and more than 739 
million eggs, which amounts to 97.5, 85, and 94 percent, 
respectively, of the level for January-March of last year. 
  By 1 April the overdue indebtedness of industrial 
enterprises 
and organizations, construction, and agriculture for paying 
wages to their workers reached R24.7 billion. Workers in 
industrial enterprises did not receive R19.2 billion on time, in 
construction--R3.4 billion, and in agriculture--more than R2 
billion. 
  The total volume of retail goods turnover for January-March 
of this year was about R737 billion in current prices, exceeding 
the turnover of the corresponding period of last year by a 
factor of 8.6. The population realized R101.4 billion for paid 
services, which in comparable prices is about 51 percent of the 
volume of the first quarter of 1993. 
  The continuing increase in prices for commodities and 
service 
rates in March was characterized by a summary index of consumer 
prices of 109 percent relative to February and 141.3 percent 
relative to December of last year. Consumer expenditures, 
calculating for one family, exceeded R141,000 on the average. 
  The average wage of workers and employees in February 
increased in comparison with January by 10 percent and amounted 
to R131,500.

Socioeconomic Research of the Youth Institute: "Refugees--Moscow 
Is a Big Railway Station"] 
  [Text] Logic suggests: Before talking about a problem, and 
especially before intending to solve it, it is necessary to 
picture the scale of it. As for refugees, objective statistics 
are lacking, both for all of Russia and for the Moscow region. 
At first glance the reasons are simple: There is no control over 
movement across the border from former Union republics (except 
for the Baltics), and there are no clear-cut legal norms. 
According to the law of the Russian Federation on the status of 
refugees, adopted in the summer of last year, only citizens of 
other states can be considered as such. This means that persons 
who arrive in Central Russia from zones of ethnic conflict, 
which are within the boundaries of the territory of the Russian 
Federation (Chechnya, Ossetia, Ingushetia, and others), cannot 
obtain the status of refugee. They are called either resettlers 
or displaced persons, but the essence does not change because of 
this. It turns out that there are many more refugees than 
recorded. 
  Although, strictly speaking, the figures are still 
terrifying. According to data of the MVD [Ministry of Internal 
Affairs] of the Russian Federation, more than 9,000 refugees 
were counted at the end of 1993 in Moscow and Moscow Oblast, of 
which 3,600 are concentrated right in our city, and 5,500 in the 
oblast. This figure does not include those who are living here 
in an "illegal" status. Expert estimates in this regard are 
rather contradictory, and vary from several to hundreds of 
thousands. They cannot be used as objective information for an 
analysis of the economic status of refugees. Therefore, the data 
cited further apply only to persons who officially have the 
status of refugees. 
  The Moscow region, fortunately for its residents, was never 
"open" to migrants, rather strict restrictions existed 
associated with residence permits. Nevertheless, the population 
of the capital has grown steadily from year to year precisely 
owing to migrants. Now, despite the decree of the Government of 
Moscow concerning toughening passport control and the 
introduction of duties on the right to stay in the city, the 
number of refugees and displaced persons on its territory is 
increasing. In 1992, 2,500 refugees were counted here, and now 
the number is significantly higher. We are talking only about 
people who use official channels to acquire the right to live in 
Moscow. 
  Why is the capital so attractive? For a majority of those 
who 
arrive in the Moscow region (61.7 percent), the presence here of 
institutions and organizations that can solve their problems is 
important. Thirty-seven percent of this group declare that they 
would like to get authorization to go abroad. So, for a large 
part of the arriving refugees Moscow represents a kind of 
transshipment point. In addition, it should be noted that there 
is quite a large number of commercially inclined persons for 
whom the presence of conflict on interethnic grounds is only a 
reason for legal resettlement from regions with an unstable 
political and economic situation in a city, which for them is a 
"gold mine" (15 percent on average). 
  But on the whole the economic situation of the refugees in 
the Moscow region, really, like everywhere, is unenviable. Many 
(24.6 percent) live in crowded material conditions. The main 
official sources of their existence are state allowances and 
assistance from relatives (26.8 percent, on the average). Only 
22.7 percent have stable earnings. Fewer have permanent 
work--only 3 percent of them, and 32 percent of the able-bodied 
do not work at all. However paradoxical, their misfortune is 
that they do have...a higher and secondary special education (up 
to 33 percent). In Moscow they encounter an already developed 
infrastructure that is characterized by a great oversaturation 
of this kind of specialist (four-fifths of all employees). This 
problem has especially worsened now under conditions of 
increased unemployment. At best, those who arrive can count on 
work that is "not prestigious" to the local residents. Despite 
the significant share of those who would like to change 
specialties so that they could find work in the Moscow region 
(up to 38 percent), there are also those who under no 
circumstances (18.5 percent) want to engage in work that is "not 
according to their specialization," and, as a rule, this is the 
intelligentsia (80 percent from this group). 
  But, in addition to work and obtaining the means for 
existence, the problem of housing is becoming even more 
critical. At the present time 28 percent of them are forced to 
rent housing, and 650 [as published] percent take shelter with 
relatives. The housing situation for 40.5 percent of the 
refugees is simply intolerable. Of course, it is necessary to 
feel sorry for them. But in our region hundreds of thousands "of 
our own" families are standing in line to receive housing. But 
not many people (2 percent) can allow themselves to buy an 
apartment, given today's high prices. So, the question stands 
this way: Either leave the region, or buy housing. Therefore, 
many of them (43 percent) plan to sell their apartment in their 
previous place of residence and acquire one within the 
boundaries of the Moscow region. However, not everyone by far 
has something to sell (20 percent, on average). It is even more 
difficult with residence permits. But it is what makes it 
possible to use the social benefits (acquiring a free education, 
material allowances, etc.). It is practically impossible to get 
a residence permit without acquiring housing in Moscow. The 
percentage of those without residence permits in Moscow, and 
this means in many ways "people without social rights," is the 
highest in Russia (48.3 percent of the refugees living on its 
territory). 
  The most vulnerable people in this situation are children 
and 
pensioners. A majority of families, of course, need material 
assistance for the children on the part of the local authorities 
and the state. There is not enough money for clothes and 
normal nourishment. Pensioners cannot get pensions and other 
benefits due them because of difficulties in transferring 
documents from their previous place of residence. The loss of 
documents complicates the situation in many ways, and a search 
for them is hampered or impossible because of the tense 
political situation between Russia and a number of republics. 
Without residence permits it is also difficult to use medical 
services, which very tangibly hits an already meager budget. 
  A lot has been written about the difficult economic 
situation 
of the refugees, but the issue of ways to resolve the problem 
remains open to the present time. This in many ways depends on 
the presence in the state of a good national program of 
resettling refugees on the territory of the country. Such an 
attempt was undertaken at the end of 1991 by the Government of 
Russia--the "Migration" program was adopted. But...it remained 
mainly on paper. It appears that it is aimed more at the 
resolution of questions of providing cheap manpower and 
developing the regions of the non-Chernozem, Siberia, and the 
Far East. Alas, the interests of the state, and not the 
refugees, emerged as the priority. A serious review is needed of 
the principal provisions of the program. After all, besides 
everything else, its implementation in its previous form 
requires large material resources, whose allocation, based on 
the difficult economic conditions, does not seem possible. But 
despite all this, uncontrolled migration pressure on the 
European region of Russia, including on the Moscow region, 
continues to increase. 
  The attempts of the Government of Moscow to protect its 
region from such pressure, using old methods (toughening the 
rules of passport control), have an unhealthy effect on Russian 
refugees most of all. After all, persons of other nationalities 
who come to Moscow can count on the assistance of various 
friendly associations of their own people that exist here 
(Azerbaijani Chechen, Armenian, etc.), which help their 
fellow-countrymen overcome the "barrier" of residence 
registration legally as well as illegally. Therefore, only the 
Russians are thrown to the whims of fate. It is no accident that 
Russian refugees are experiencing the greatest economic 
difficulties in their own "historic motherland." 
  It is apparent that previous experience in the regulation of 
migratory streams cannot be used to resolve refugee problems. 
While their appearance in Russia is in many ways a new 
phenomenon (we have not had refugees since 1924), it is not new 
as such to many countries of West Europe and America. They have 
accumulated a wealth of multifaceted experience in this regard, 
and it would not be out of place to utilize it. The more so in 
that under conditions of a threat of mass migration from the 
former USSR to the countries of West Europe (30 percent owing to 
refugees), they are eagerly ready to help. 
  There is a special decree of a parliamentary meeting of the 
European Community adopted in February 1993 "Concerning the 
Migratory Movement of the Population between the States of the 
Former USSR," and recommendations attached to it, according to 
which Russia can count on the rendering of assistance to 
refugees and displaced persons on its territory. Of course, now 
the problem lies not so much in money as in necessary meaningful 
aspects of the national program for rendering assistance to 
refugees and forced migrants. The creation of a network of 
nonstate social services, aimed at refugees, can be viewed as a 
promising direction in the resolution of this problem. These 
organizations, which are not dependent on state structures and 
not subordinate to them, whose source of existence will become 
not budgetary resources but subsidies from various charitable 
funds, including international, should work on those questions 
that state services refuse to work on (offering juridical 
services, searching for housing, retraining, searching for 
employment, etc.). They will be able organically to supplement 
the work of state services. There are already quite a few of 
them in the countries of Western Europe. For example, there are 
about 60 in Great Britain alone (of these, four work on a 
nationwide scale and 56 are small local organizations). Seventy 
percent of the total number of these organizations are 
concentrated in London, which is very similar to Moscow in the 
nature of the problem in this respect. Now the employees of our 
center, together with colleagues from Great Britain, are 
conducting work on a joint project whose purpose is to 
accumulate British experience in work with refugees and use it 
in a plan to develop nonstate social services in Russia 
(including in Moscow). 
  In our opinion, another no less promising direction in the 
resolution of the refugee problem could be the establishment of 
a network of centers for refugee professional retraining, taking 
into account the requirements of regional labor markets. The 
specific nature of the work with refugees and forced migrants 
lies in the fact that the status of "refugee" is itself 
temporary. Many of those who were questioned would like to go 
back and continue to work in their former specialty, given a 
stabilization of the situation in the region of their former 
residence. Therefore, the content of the programs for the 
retraining of refugees should reflect universality and 
differentiation. In acquiring a new specialty, the previous one 
should not be lost. Ignoring the previous work experience of 
refugees is an unnecessary loss of time and resources. At the 
same time, the experience of Germany, France, and Great Britain 
is being used widely.

<F P=106> [Interview with Petr Aksenov, prefect of Moscow's </F>
Southwestern District, by unidentified KURANTY correspondent; 
place and date not given: "What Gives the Authorities a 
Headache"] 
  [Text] Petr Nikolayevich Aksenov was born in 1946 in 
Lipetsk Oblast. Upon graduating from school he went to work in 
construction. Worker; foreman; supervisor; construction 
administration chief; trust director; chairman of the Sovetskiy 
Rayon Executive Committee; first deputy prefect of the 
Southwestern district; and, finally, prefect--this is his 
resume. Married. Two children. 
  [KURANTY] Petr Nikolayevich, your first 200 days on the job 
are behind you now. How was it? 
  [Aksenov] I am not new to the prefecture; I know the 
specifics of the district, the existing problems, the 
"bottlenecks" in the work of district services and units. The 
task is to strengthen the work of local administration, and 
first of all of its lower tier--municipal district 
administrations headed by subprefects. Because they are the ones 
carrying the main burden of working with the population, 
resolving the daily problems of life support for the territory. 
Therefore I have set a goal for myself: Give subprefects the 
opportunity to demonstrate their abilities most fully. Not guide 
them by the hand, not tell them what to do in municipal 
districts and how, but give them the freedom to show initiative, 
to experiment, at the same time not forgetting that we are at 
the service of district citizens who will be the main judges of 
the local authorities' work. 
  What concerns district residents? Warm homes and clean 
streets, and the ability to buy everything they need. The 
prefecture staff must do everything possible--and sometimes 
impossible--to make it so. 
  How do we arrange for the timely removal of household trash; 
how to perform quality road repairs; how to provide heat for 
residential buildings? These should be our "headaches," not the 
residents'. 
  [KURANTY] When you agreed to become a prefect, did you have 
a 
maximum and minimum program? 
  [Aksenov] Of course. Let us start with the maximum program. 
First, we have an ambitious plan to change the situation with 
respect to road repairs. The Southwestern district is the only 
one that does not have its own asphalt- and concrete-making 
plant. We have allocated a site for its construction. The money 
the city appropriates for capital repairs and maintenance of 
roads clearly is not enough. At the same time the volume of work 
is growing. Which means that we have to attract nonbudget means, 
organizations-investors. 
  The second acute issue is trash. The state of the services 
responsible for cleaning and trash removal is such that much 
effort has to be devoted to strengthening their material and 
technical base and selection of cadres. In addition, in order to 
put an end to monopolism and create competition to already 
existing road-maintenance organizations, we have organized two 
new alternative services. We are bringing various commercial 
organizations into the business of keeping order in the district 
on a large scale. 
  Although the state of cleaning and trash removal on the 
territory of the district is far from ideal, the situation has 
improved to a considerable extent. 
  [KURANTY] Petr Nikolayevich, does your maximum program 
include solving the housing problem? 
  [Aksenov] Of course. First, housing in the district varies 
greatly. We have five-story buildings--in the famous 
Cheremushki, Kotlovka, and Zyuzino municipal districts; we have 
areas with standard prefabricated panel nine-story buildings--in 
the Gagarinskiy and Konkovo municipal districts; and we have 
modern high-rise buildings in Yasenevo, Tyoplyy Stan, and 
Butovo. Therefore, along with new construction we will devote 
much effort to reconstruction of old quarters, increasing the 
density of existing housing. The concept of socioeconomic and 
city planning development of the Southwestern district, approved 
by the Government of Moscow, envisages a large program of 
housing reconstruction, and not at the expense of the city 
budget but through investor financing. 
  Despite active construction and reconstruction, however, the 
housing problem in the district remains quite acute. In the end 
of 1993, 26,810 families were on the waiting list for 
improvement of housing conditions. 
  So we do have a lot of work to do in this direction. We have 
outlined the following ways of solving this problem. 
  First, we will increase control over which housing is being 
vacated; for this purpose we will first and foremost arrange for 
a mechanism to receive timely information from housing 
utilization offices about vacated rooms and apartments. 
  Second, we will take the necessary steps to implement the 
mayor of Moscow's order regarding stricter controls over the use 
of privatized housing, preventing the use of privatized 
apartments and rooms for purposes other than intended. Such 
things do occur--this housing is being used as office space for 
various commercial organizations, and as illegal hotels and 
dormitories. 
  Third, we will work more actively with the courts, since we 
disagree with the practice that has become widespread 
lately--families that are not in acute need of housing 
improvement get extra rooms as the latter become vacated in 
their communal apartments. 
  [KURANTY] One of the main problems of concern to everyone is 
trade. A lot of hopes were pinned on the privatization of trade 
enterprises; however, such phenomena as cheating customers and 
rudeness persist in privatized stores anyway. How do you feel 
about this? 
  [Aksenov] You can look at this problem from different 
angles. 
From the standpoint of market saturation with goods, 
privatization has done a lot, of course, and we all can feel it 
today. The old distributive system does not exist anymore. You 
can buy anything today. There is a great selection of goods in 
the stores. As to rudeness--what can one say? This is a question 
of a person's culture. 
  [KURANTY] Can the authorities help; who should the offended 
customer turn to? 
  [Aksenov] He can turn to the prefecture's consumer market 
administration, or to the relevant department in the 
administration of the municipal district on whose territory some 
or other point of sale is located. Depending on the nature of 
the complaint, the local administration will take necessary 
steps--either through its administrative or trade inspectorate, 
or though the organs of sanitary-epidemiologic oversight. I 
would like to emphasize that in the new economic conditions 
local authorities still have real levers to enforce trade 
enterprises' unconditional compliance with established rules and 
norms. 
  The analysis of complaints and petitions we receive shows 
that the greatest number of them are about street-stand and 
kiosk trade. We have put together a program for getting small 
retail trade in order on the territory of the district. 
  About 250 kiosks already have been removed from the 
district's territory. They were kiosks that had either been 
illegally set up or did not have licenses or cash registers, did 
not meet merchandise assortment requirements, did not maintain 
the adjacent territory in proper order, and so on. In addition, 
we have tightened the procedures for issuing permits to conduct 
trading from stands, vehicles, and small retail outlets. 
  We do not have such complaints with respect to large trade 
establishments--such as "Moscow," "Leipzig," or "Bucharest" (we 
have about 40 such stores). 
  [KURANTY] Petr Nikolayevich, which line of prefecture work 
do 
you consider most important? 
  [Aksenov] Absolutely everything is important--construction, 
repairs, improvements, trade, transportation, social security, 
and many other things. Only a comprehensive solution to all 
these issues will allow us to carry out the task that is the 
responsibility of the bodies of local authority--ensuring normal 
living on the district territory and satisfying the needs and 
demands of the population.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktoriya Rabotnova: "Second Round of Elections </F>
to the City Assembly: Its Future Either Vacant or Murky"] 
  [Text] Results of the second round of elections, held 3 
April in half of the districts, seem to come as a complete 
surprise to most politicians. The chief sensational aspect is 
the defeat of the electoral bloc Democratic Unity of Petersburg. 
Democratic Unity led 19 candidates to the finish line--more than 
all the remaining electoral associations combined, but only 
three of the candidates nominated by the Belyayev bloc will get 
seats. 
  Aleksandr Nikolayevich himself, destined by many to become 
chairman of the coming assembly, was not among the victors. 
After the first round of voting, Belyayev outdistanced his 
rival--Aleksandr Shchelkanov, former chairman of the city 
executive committee, by an almost twofold lead. Several days 
prior to the runoff election, Shchelkanov assessed the directive 
of the mayor on extending the 20 March voting as illegal, and 
proposed to Belyayev that they mutually withdraw their 
candidacies. Judging from the response of the Belyayev team, 
this proposal was seen as an attempt to avoid the inevitable 
defeat of "a politician who had not fulfilled himself." One can 
today assert that Shchelkanov--who wrote "In the event this is 
rejected, I will be forced to prolong my fight and will be 
victorious"--assessed the situation more sensibly... 
  Turning now to other electoral associations. The bloc All 
Petersburg passed through the second round with minimal losses, 
gaining four seats. The blocs Our City--Our Home and Unity for 
the Sake of Progress had one victor each. But Beloved City 
achieved the greatest success--all five candidates in this 
association who underwent the second round of voting were 
victorious over their rivals. Independent candidates will get 
the remaining seats. 
  As before, however, the results are not entirely conclusive. 
The dispute on legality of the first round is not yet over. We 
know that the majority of electoral associations are disputing 
the mayor's decision to extend the voting time frame. Only 
Democratic Unity and Business Petersburg supported the decision. 
It cannot be ruled out that they will now change their opinion 
and join others seeking to attain acknowledgment of the spring 
elections as invalid. 
  It should be stated that a great many "oddities" took place 
prior to the second round as well. At one of the polling 
stations in District No. 9, for example, oranges were 
distributed from a Mercedes to voters, along with an appeal to 
vote for Yuriy Novolodskiy. The team of the respected chief of 
the justice administration interpreted this fact as provocation 
(albeit only after his competitor's authorized agents submitted 
a complaint to the Central Electoral Commission). The 
provocation story would be quite convincing had not a 
Novolodskiy overseer reminded prisoners during the voting at 
Kresty--"Did you get the free cigarettes? They are from us..." 
  Gifts were also promised to the voters at District No. 23. 
True, not to all--only to those who supported Shukhrat 
Sayfullayev, president of the joint-stock company Peter the 
Great, in the second round of voting. They were promised monthly 
sponsored assistance out of the company's specially established 
assistance fund. True, it is not entirely clear how people 
swallowing this bait could prove they voted for him--it is 
hardly likely that precinct commissions would release their 
certified documentation. It cannot be ruled out that 
Sayfullayev's recent rival, Boris Pustyntsev, will contest the 
voting results--such campaigning is entirely too similar to 
outright graft. 
  The campaign in District No. 11 was also waged "freestyle." 
One of the candidates, Valeriy Selivanov, was forced to 
apologize to the voters during a radio presentation for the fact 
that he was unable to respond to their questions during 
television debates. The fact of the matter is that for some 
reason it was not the presiding official, and not the chairman 
of the electoral commission who sorted out the questions--but 
rather Democratic Unity leader Aleksandr Belyayev, who came to 
the studio to support the candidate of his bloc. Only after the 
television debates were over was Valeriy Nikolayevich able to 
find out what indeed his voters had asked. The effect of the 
Selivanov radio broadcast was unanticipated. He received phone 
calls recommending that he not make idle chatter about it--or 
what would then happen would be his fault. If this was a 
joke--it was not all that funny. After all, during the election 
campaign two of Selivanov's authorized agents were subjected to 
attack. 
  Disputes as to how honest the election was in one district 
or 
another and how legal the election was overall will go on much 
longer than one month. Especially since the new Assembly will 
still not be able to get down to work. Until such time as 
three-fourths of the deputies are elected, the elections are not 
valid. It is foolish to be guessing today what awaits us in the 
fall--by-elections or a new campaign which will clearly take 
place under different rules. In any event, political experts and 
the leaders of political parties have time to analyze the frame 
of mind of St. Petersburg residents. It is entirely evident that 
the defeat of Democratic Unity candidates in the majority of 
districts cannot be just a coincidence.

<F P=106> ["Address to the Reader": "We Are With You Again"] </F>
  [Text] Hello, dear readers. After a month-and-a-half-long 
absence, UTRO finally has found its way into your mail box. The 
interruption was hard for both you and us. Our telephones rang 
off the hook: What has happened to the newspaper? We once heard 
crying on the other end of the line: "I am recovering from a 
heart attack... You are all I have. And now the box is empty--so 
I do not have you anymore either, do I?..." Most calls, however, 
ended with the sentence: "Hold on, we are with you!" 
  The cause of the protracted silence hardly needs any 
comment. 
We are not living in a desert, and everybody hears about 
stoppages of giant enterprises, the bankruptcy of entire 
industrial sectors, and delinquency files. We have also been 
unable to escape this fate--no paper or money. It is doubly 
disappointing that the oxygen vent was closed at the time the 
subscription campaign began... But even on the brink of disaster 
we found out once again that there are enough good people in the 
world for whom the notion "credit of confidence" is not an empty 
sound. They believe in the newspaper's vitality, and this is why 
we are with you today. 
  We are still struggling with tremendous hardships. But we 
want to assure our loyal readers, like-minded in spirit, that 
the newspaper will try to not let you down in your expectations. 
It will honestly inform you about everything that is happening 
in the kray. We will continue to delve into such topics as 
economics and politics, social protection and ecology, culture 
and science, spirituality and human rights. Such notions as work 
and morality, honor and conscience, love for the Motherland and 
duty--everything that makes the nation that preaches them 
great--will never get rusty or lose their value in the eyes of 
our authors. Neither will we ignore the shoots of healthy 
entrepreneurship, the reforms taking root, and the normal 
market, as well the as strengthening ties with the countries of 
the Asia-Pacific region. There is only one item that is banned 
here--dirt. In every sense of this word--whether it is 
distorting the substance of the issue in published materials or 
catering to unhealthy instincts--in short, catering to the 
"consumer." 
  With the right of a friend, the newspaper expects of its 
allies-readers one thing--patience and tolerance. Initially we 
will not be able to publish five times a week--we will somewhat 
reduce the periodicity and will have an issue on Tuesday, 
Thursday, and Saturday. And let the reader not be offended by 
some excessive advertising--we cannot survive without it 
economically. Moreover, we invite the active business 
cooperation of businessmen, entrepreneurs, and economic 
managers. We will gladly publish any private advertisement for a 
moderate price. 
  In short, let us shake hands for friendship. Stay with us, 
friends, for the second half of the year. Our index is 53402.

<F P=106> [Interview with G. Troitskiy, Armavir administration chief, </F>
by Irina Goryunova, Armavir-Moscow: "G. Troitskiy: There Must Be 
Just One Authority: Responsibly Executive"] 
  [Text] Georgiy Konstantinovich Troitskiy is in love 
with his work and with his city. This is obvious immediately, 
after one hour's acquaintance. The Armavir administration chief, 
chairman of the Association of Administration Chiefs of East 
Kuban, champion of Russia, and captain of the Russian combined 
team for all-round sports loves to walk, is an excellent dancer, 
and can talk very interestingly about former Politburo members 
with whom he worked and about someone else from his hometown, 
the former USSR President... But today the thing that excites 
him more than anything else in the world is life in Armavir, 
this particle of Kuban, particle of the Caucasus, and particle 
of our common Homeland, a city that is ethnically diverse, 
filled with springtime beauty, and rich in good people and 
fertile land. 
  [Goryunova] Georgiy Konstantinovich, your biography, your 
ties with our country's prominent figures, your successes in the 
management field, and a number of high positions have not 
prevented from returning once again to the city where your 
career began. Why? 
  [Troitskiy] The bulk of my activity has been linked with 
Armavir. I began here. For about five years I was the deputy 
chairman of an executive committee. Here in Armavir I became a 
deputy to the city and kray soviet. For nine years I worked as 
the chairman of the city soviet. That experience and that 
baggage have been extremely helpful for me in my current work. 
In addition, experience that proved to be beneficial for me was 
my work in Stavropol Kray, and later in Rostov, where I worked 
closely with Mingasprom [Ministry of the Gas Industry], which 
was administered by Chernomyrdin, who was the customer for my 
main administration. So more than two years ago I decided to 
return to my city. 
  [Goryunova] For many years you worked in the system of an 
authority that is now called an administrative-fiat system. 
Although you were always closely linked with the economy, the 
gas industry, and construction. Today you are working in the 
system of another authority. Do you make comparisons frequently, 
and to whose advantage are those comparisons? 
  [Troitskiy] Every authority has its negative and positive 
sides. Practically every authority is not to people's liking 
sometimes. And a person who is on his wa to power must take that 
into consideration in his practice. During the days before 
perestroyka things were easier on the job. For many reasons. 
Including the fact that there was discipline. It used to be 
possible to resolve many questions more quickly. But the 
negative aspects of party leadership, and in particular the 
equalization policy and the lack of talent among many leaders, 
immediately manifested themselves in the collapse of the CPSU. 
The system of allocations by fiat precluded not only creativity, 
but also taught people how to live with ready-make decisions. 
The individual's sense of being a property owner was completely 
destroyed. For example, I repeatedly asked the party agencies 
the question: why, while protecting merchants' homes as 
monuments of urban construction, did you categorically ban the 
construction even of buildings with one and a half stories? The 
city was filled with sheds and hovels. Today we are having to 
live with much of our past inheritance. 
  I am alarmed by the lack of a mechanism for 
interrelationships between the authority and the enterprises. 
The executive authority today senses this problem in an 
especially acute way. A number of laws also are not particularly 
gratifying. For example, the law that has already been enacted 
by the old Supreme Soviet, to the effect that only the first 
person has the right to apply his signature. This not only puts 
an additional workload on me, but also deprives my deputies of 
their responsibility and initiative. 
  [Goryunova] Armavir is an ethnically diverse city. Under the 
conditions of the current aggravation of the ethnic conflicts 
and taking into consideration the especially complicated 
situation in the Caucasus, how are you coping with the problems 
that arise? 
  [Troitskiy] People of 79 nationalities live in our city. Of 
them, 15 percent are Armenians, more than half of whom are old 
indigenous residents. The general directedness in their life and 
the language that they use are Russian. The segment of the 
Armenian population that is in conflict and that emigrated to 
our area from Abkhazia, Azerbaijan, and Nagornyy Karabakh, is 
actually creating the difficulties. Although, for the time 
being, the situation is being regulated. The Krasnodar Kray 
leadership is taking strict measures and is monitoring the 
registration process strictly. 
  I grew up in the Caucasus. I have worked in Armenia, 
Georgia, 
and Azerbaijan. I survived the Armenian earthquake and 
participated in the restoration of the republic. I know this 
region very well. And I also know that there are no poor 
nationalities. There are only poor people. That has always been 
my position. 
  [Goryunova] What is the political role of the Cossack 
population in your region? 
  [Troitskiy] The Labinskiy section was created in Armavir as 
long ago as the tsarist days. It includes representatives of the 
Cossack population from six or seven areas, including Stavropol 
and Karachayevo-Cherkessia. So one can say that we have a 
Cossack center. The Cossacks have sufficient authority. When 
they operate within the confines of legislation, the 
administration helps and supports them. But it also happens that 
they operate from a position of strength and attempt to force 
their decisions and ideas on people. Inasmuch as the Cossacks 
are an emotional people, disputes occur, and they are not simple 
ones. Their program openly proclaims a fight for power: within a 
two-year period, the changing over to ataman rule. 
  [Goryunova] As the administration chief, are you opposed to 
this? 
  [Troitskiy] If this is done by election, in the legislative, 
parliamentary way, they have my blessing. But they are 
attempting to operate from a position of strength. And that is a 
violation of legislation. 
  [Goryunova] Can you give any examples? 
  [Troitskiy] One does not have to go far. A sovkhoz hires 
workers of various nationalities. The people are working on a 
long-term basis, and working conscientiously. A Cossack raid is 
carried out, and they are driven out. This is interference in 
the economic activity of the sovkhoz, the inflicting of 
psychological, economic, and political damage. I have repeatedly 
said that you cannot establish power with a lash. Everyone does 
not like a lash. It is possible to seize power. Power is not a 
joy. So making life better for people, while being in power, is 
a task that is a bit more complicated. 
  [Goryunova] Judged on the basis of economic importance, your 
city is the second one in Krasnodar Kray. Everyone realizes that 
the recession throughout the country has also affected you. How 
are you combatting this situation? 
  [Troitskiy] We are all tied up into the same bundle. In my 
opinion, nobody won from the destruction of the Union. And that 
includes our city. Nevertheless, whereas in 1992 the recession 
for Russia as a whole and for Krasnodar Kray was approximately 
20 percent, in our city it was 4-5 percent lower, and the same 
situation prevailed in 1993. This is linked with the fact that 
Armavir is surrounded by large-scale agricultural areas. The 
peasants spend less time at rallies. They do not have time for 
them. The cow wants something to eat, and the land needs care. 
Therefore the peasants still work the way they used to. We have 
a considerable branch for processing agricultural produce. We 
have one of the largest meat-packing plants in Russia, and a 
large oil and fats combine. These branches were practically 
untouched by the recession. But the metal-processing industry 
really was hit badly. Such large-scale associations as 
Tochmashpribor and Elektrotekhnicheskiy Zavod today have a 
production slump of more than 50 percent. 
  Of course, the thing that largely saves us is the fact that 
Armavir is one of a few cities in Russia that have their own 
land totaling more than 200,000 hectares. 
  [Goryunova] Is the privatization of the land in progress? 
  [Troitskiy] We are not speeding up this process. It is a 
pity 
that even today, as used to be the case in previous times, much 
is being done by the fiat method. Including privatization. In a 
few places people want to be privatized, and in a few places 
they do not want to be. Certain people want to work the way that 
they used to. So the sovkhozes have been practically preserved. 
It is simply that now they are called associations. Nevertheless 
we already have 47 individually owned farms. Every city dweller 
has either a vegetable garden, or a plot where he lives, and 
some people have two or three each. Approximately 10-12 
hundredths per resident. For purposes of comparison: in the 
Netherlands, it is 3 hundredths per capita. Moreover, half is 
for export. That is the low effectiveness of land use that we 
have. 
  [Goryunova] You have worked in various branches of authority 
--representative and executive. What is your attitude toward the 
present system of authority? What do you think is hindering its 
normal functioning? 
  [Troitskiy] I am absolutely convinced that there should be 
no 
representative authority. What we need is a legislative agency. 
My entire vast experience proves this. The authority must be 
responsibly executive. But we do not have a single monitoring 
agency that is responsible for anything. Therefore the process 
of the struggle between the two branches is endless. The 
representative agencies want to direct the executive authority 
and want to shift the errors and responsibility to it. The 
authority, I repeat, must be just one. It must bear the 
legislative responsibility. But in our area the court does not 
operate! So the representative authority assumes the 
allocational and monitoring functions. So long as that exists, 
we shall not live any better. 
  If one speaks about today's Government, I would begin with 
the major consideration. Until it turns its head toward the 
commodity producer, and as long as the banks enrich themselves 
at the expense of the producer, the strained economic and 
political atmosphere will be preserved. And, secondly: the 
executive, economic authority must not engage in politics. But 
our Government, by delving into politics, is ignoring economic 
matters. It is necessary immediately to begin thinking about the 
producer, and to remove those stifling taxes -- the strangle 
holds of the banking system. Then the people will begin to 
breathe again, I assure you, and the rallies will end. Thirdly: 
it is necessary urgently to reduce the apparatus. It is 
expensive and uncontrollable. 
  [Goryunova] Today there is a holiday in your city. The 
home-museum of your hometown writer Savva Dangulov is being 
opened, with an exhibition of his second collection "The Artist 
and the Muse"... 
  [Troitskiy] Savva Artemyevich was a remarkable person who 
ardently loved our city. We were friends. I helped to implement 
his idea and dream of creating an art gallery in the downtown 
children's library. The home-museum is finally opening, and I 
hope that it will become the cultural center of Armavir. The 
creative intellectuals will gather here. I am absolutely 
convinced that, without the development of culture or is 
preservation, it is impossible to build anything. Today the lack 
of culture is pulling us toward the West. It is necessary for 
culture to be the property of everyone, not just a matter for 
the intellectuals.

<F P=106> [Article by ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent Valeriy Orlov, </F>
Nizhniy Novgorod, under rubric "Response": "People Want To 
Create a Construction Boom in Nizhniy Novgorod"] 
  [Text] The article "House-Warmings in Nizhniy 
Novgorod" in the 12 April issue of ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI has 
received a large response. The newspaper's correspondent center 
in Nizhniy Novgorod has already received a large number of 
telephone calls and letters. The readers ask whether, during a 
period of economic instability, it is really possible without 
state support to engage successfully in such an expensive matter 
as the construction of housing. And who is this Vyacheslav 
Rasteryayev? 
  I admit that, prior to my acquaintance with the affairs of 
the Nizhegorodskiy Dom company, I myself was a big skeptic in 
this regard. But now I am convinced that such structures have a 
real future. It is precisely these structures that will create a 
healthy and massive housing market. 
  The creator, brains, and chief motivating force of 
Nizhegorodskiy Dom is Vyacheslav Rasteryayev. He is 43 years 
old. Born in Tver. After graduation from the Moscow Motor Roads 
Institute, went to Gorkiy. And he has been working there for 
more than 20 years. He was a foreman and chief of an SMU 
[construction-installation administration], managed the city's 
water canal, and worked as the deputy chairman of the rayon and 
city Soviet. 
  Why did he undertake not the trading of Snickers, but the 
erecting of housing? 
  "The construction conveyor belt began to fall apart as a 
result of the sharp slump in centralized investments," 
Vyacheslav Alekseyevich says. "The collectives that had become 
accustomed to sensing the constant concern 'from the top' were 
left without work. But I had communicated with construction 
workers for my entire life, and I was convinced that I could 
rectify the situation. But at first I decided that it was 
necessary to seek new approaches to the formation of sources of 
construction. Namely, to work with the population, because 
people do have money. " 
  Having proved by deeds its probity, Nizhegorodskiy Dom acted 
as the initiator of the construction of the first municipal bank 
in Russia, which would operate only with the population, but 
would direct the attracted monetary amounts to the construction 
complex. The idea was supported by the city administration, 
which also acquired the controlling block of several large-scale 
enterprises. That is how the Nizhegorodskiy Kredit municipal 
investment bank appeared, and Vyacheslav Rasteryayev was 
elected, ex officio, chairman of its board of directors. 
  The new bank immediately became the most popular one with 
the 
people of Nizhniy Novgorod. First, because people had become 
accustomed to trusting their authorities. And, secondly, it is 
simply advantageous to deal with it! The Nizhegorodskiy Kredit 
bank has approximately 20 types of deposits, and they all 
operate for the benefit of the local residents. 
  Take, for example, the housing-accumulation deposit. By 
using 
it, it is possible without hurrying, over a 15-year period, to 
accumulate enough money for an apartment. It is aimed basically 
at parents who are thinking about their children's future. After 
concluding a contract with the bank, the depositor of the 
housing-accumulation deposit, through his accounting office, 
transfers two to three minimum wages every month. Today the 
minimum wage is approximately 15,000 rubles. For a family in 
which everyone is working, it is not difficult to pay 
30,000-40,000 rubles a month. Then, when the child is grown, he 
is assured of having housing. Incidentally, whoever wants to can 
transfer even more, and then, naturally, he will get the 
apartment more quickly. 
  Figures give convincing evidence of the popularity of the 
municipal bank among the people living along the Volga. During 
the past four months more than 4 billion rubles were attracted 
from the population. And the monetary stream is building up. 
Currently the bank takes in from the people of Nizhniy Novgorod 
120-140 million rubles a day. All this money will soon be 
converted into comfortable apartments. 
  "Currently we are beginning to carry out a new idea," V. 
Rasteryayev says. "It is the housing municipal loan. Its bonds, 
of three types, are planned for a three-year period. The first 
is at a rate of 700,000 rubles per square meter of housing 
space. If, for example, you want to purchase a one-room 
apartment over a one-year period, you purchase the necessary 
number of bonds that correspond to the metric area at that 
price. But if you need an apartment the next year, that bond 
will cost 550,000 rubles. If, however, someone is in too much of 
a hurry and he can be patient for three years, then he must pay 
for each bond, and, consequently, for each square meter of his 
future housings, not 700,000 rubles, but only 480,000. The bonds 
in this loan will also participate simultaneously in the drawing 
of apartments." 
  "But what about inflation?" 
  "We have gotten away from this insidious concomitant of our 
day reducing the construction periods. Whereas the 'usual' 
construction workers will erect homes in two years, we will 
build them in six months. We achieve this by working in two or 
three shifts, with the smooth operation of the entire 
construction conveyor belt. There is also no problem with 
materials. We always have them on hand. And any kind that is 
needed, whether they come from Finland or Italy, or even from 
Chuvashia." 
  Chuvashia was mentioned, of course, not accidentally. It 
turns out that it is more advantageous to bring in and install 
reinforced concrete from the neighboring republic than it is to 
buy it from the nearby Nizhniy Novgorod enterprises. The quality 
of the shipped-in concrete is better, and the concrete costs 
less. But many of the local suppliers of building materials 
continue to operate the old way: the more metal and concrete 
they bang around, the better. 
  Rasteryayev has a different principle: reduce the amounts of 
metal, the expenditures of electrical power, cement, and other 
materials; reduce the construction periods; and take a serious 
attitude toward cost accountability. Because most of the 
construction builders have gotten so close to this line that 
people will no longer be able to buy housing because it is so 
expensive. 
  Rasteryayev was nominated as a candidate in the recent 
election to the Nizhniy Novgorod city Duma. 
  "At first I had my doubts about whether I needed this," he 
recalls, "but, after thinking that, instead of me, the person 
elected to the Duma might be some sweet-talking temporary person 
who would not help the city in any way, I gave my consent to 
run." 
  And he won, as the expression goes, with a clear advantage. 
At the first organizational meeting of the Duma, Vyacheslav 
Alekseyevich was elected chairman of the commission for 
construction, architecture, and land relations. 
  Rasteryayev has already proven to his constituents that he 
had good reason for becoming a deputy. He proposed a unique 
self-reproducing mortgage scheme. The city will allocate, for 
example, to its municipal bank 14 billion rubles. By using that 
money it can build 500 apartments this year. Naturally, the 
expended money will not return rapidly to the city treasury. 
Rasteryayev proposed doing this: these 14 billion "work" in the 
bank and grow to 40 billion. From that amount the city will get 
back its 14 billion, and with the remaining 26 billion it will 
be possible to build, with a consideration of inflation, 350 
apartments. The city will distribute these apartments -- to 
doctors, teachers, people in the military -- and will transfer 
the lists to Nizhegorodskiy Dom. The company will offer the 
potential tenants the opportunity to buy those apartments by 
installment payments, for example, over a 25-year period, with a 
payment of one to two minimum wages a month. The average cost of 
an apartment is currently approximately 40 million rubles. Over 
a 25-year period that amount will be converted to a negligible 
amount. 
  At the same time the mortgage fund will be constantly 
augmented by the tenants' payments, guaranteeing a stable work 
order for the construction workers. And there is monitoring, 
since the bank is a municipal one. Thus, by investing the money 
once, it is possible to force it to work for a long time. 
  Rasteryayev's scheme was reviewed and approved by the city 
administration. Now it is up to the Nizhniy Novgorod Duma to 
have its say. 
  This is a matter for the near future. But Nizhegorodskiy Dom 
already has something with which to please its fellow city 
dwellers during the current half-year. In a month a 
200-apartment building will be able to accept new tenants. In 
June the largest recuperation center in the Volga region, and 
perhaps in all of Russia, will be turned over. It has a swimming 
pool, saunas, practice rooms, and medical offices. The doors of 
several bank branches are also opening. Work is actively 
continuing to build three major housing projects simultaneously. 
  "In order to break through the dam of the depression, it is 
necessary to create a building boom in the country," Vyacheslav 
Rasteryayev states. "Only a construction flywheel can get the 
country's economy moving again."

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksey Kirpichnikov: "The Duma Will Support the </F>
Serbs on 11 May: The Delegation Will Report on Its Trip to the 
Former Yugoslavia"] 
  [Text] As we all know, having returned from its trip to the 
former Yugoslavia, the official State Duma delegation intended 
to report immediately, but the assassination of Deputy Aydzerzis 
and the Duma's move to Okhotnyy ryad prevented this. The report 
was postponed until the first day after the holidays. The 
two-week delay has changed the context of the Yugoslav 
"showdown": both in consequence of the dynamic situation in the 
Balkans and on account of the Accord Treaty. Chapter One of the 
document contains clause 6, which was absent from the drafts of 
20 and 26 April: "The subscribers to the treaty undertake to 
contribute in every possible way... to implementation of a 
unified national foreign policy course." 
  The set goal of the delegation was to visit the territories 
of the parties to the conflict and to conduct an impartial 
investigation. Representatives of all registered factions headed 
by General Nikolay Bezborodov, from the communists, set out for 
the Balkans. There was piquancy in the fact that Deputy 
Bezborodov, deputy chairman of the Defense Committee, being a 
member of the Communist Party, is part of Sergey Baburin's 
Russian Way group of deputies. And reporting on his trip to the 
Balkans, the latter had back on 8 April not only advocated the 
abandonment of sanctions but also proposed how this be done, 
spitting in the face of the world community: delivering 
commodities by ship along the Danube, and if Bulgaria or Romania 
"order us to stop, we are not required to do so." Considering 
the supremacy of the "railroad engineer"-general and the 
presence of the Zhirinovskiyite Vyacheslav Marychev, whose 
position, like that of his faction boss also, is a whole lot 
worse than that of Mr. Baburin, there were serious doubts as to 
future impartiality. This would in jury selection have sufficed 
for rejection, here, however, it remained to hope that those on 
the assignment would overcome the actual stereotype. 
  A rough idea of the course of the future discussion was 
provided by the news conference given by the delegation, already 
described in SEGODNYA, which was held on the Duma's final day of 
business on Novyy Arbat. The first conclusion was that, contrary 
to Aleksandr Vengerovskiy, vice speaker from the 
LDPR--Zhirinovskiy Party--the trip was not "political tourism": 
Thanks to the Foreign Ministry and the embassies in Yugoslavia 
and Croatia, the members of the Duma were able to visit 
Yugoslavia, Croatia, Bosnia, and the republics of Serbia and 
Serbian Krajina and to meet with their top leaders and also with 
the representative of the UN secretary general and the commander 
of the UN force in Bosnia. 
  The second was based on the communique on the preliminary 
results, which affirmed four positions: the anti-Serb 
information campaign and violation of the principle of equal 
responsibility, the need for the lifting of sanctions and 
preservation of the embargo on arms supplies, a weakening of the 
role of the United Nations thanks to the delegation of a number 
of functions to the North Atlantic bloc, and mistakes of the 
Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the diplomatic 
recognition of Bosnia-Hercegovina and in the approval of 
sanctions. It was proposed that the efforts for their 
cancellation be made exclusively within the framework of the 
United Nations here. 
  The third conclusion concerned the members of the 
delegation. 
General Bezborodov was a pleasant surprise. He approached the 
problem in military fashion: If an objective investigation is 
needed, investigate objectively we will. And the other members 
of the delegation, while supporting their Yugoslav and Serbian 
brothers, did not go beyond the framework of the communique and 
did not propose exotic means of a lifting of the blockade like 
the said breakthrough along the Danube or the basing of the 
Russian Navy on the Adriatic coast (the suggestion of that same 
Vice Speaker Vengerovskiy). Mr. Marychev was, naturally, the 
exception: To SEGODNYA's question as to who "the geopolitical 
forces of evil" in the region visited actually are, the deputy 
named NATO and only NATO. Indeed, it followed from the news 
conference that the NATO people are suffering from "Captain 
Tushin's disease" and that the UN representatives are having 
difficulty keeping them from pulling the trigger of the "hanging 
gun." And that in tactical ability General Mladic has repeatedly 
gotten the better of General Rose and that the latter is annoyed 
at this. But it was not NATO that began the war in the Balkans 
and slaughtered peaceful inhabitants, and General Mladic is more 
significant than Yeruslan and, judging by his conduct and his 
relations with Mr. Karadzic and his remarks about NATO, bears a 
striking resemblance to the words of Mr. Marychev. The fact that 
the latter remained in the minority at the news conference 
permits the hope of the similar location of his faction on 11 
May. 
  The day promises to be, if not sensational, then tumultuous. 
The first three points of the communique, although they could 
arouse the deputies' ardor, will for all that most likely be 
approved by the Duma. But discussion of the fourth 
point--charges leveled at the Foreign Ministry--promises to be 
serious. Andrey Kozyrev is a member of the Russia's Choice 
faction, and it was not fortuitous that it was only the Russia's 
Choice representative who failed to sign the communique as a 
whole. It was he, Aleksey Sarychev, incidentally, who raised at 
the news conference the question of the need for a closed 
sitting on 11 May. Why so open a discussion would inflame 
passions in the Balkans, whether such will be the opinion of the 
faction and whether it would be approved by the Duma, and, 
finally, whether it would not be better to follow the words and 
styles than take umbrage at journalists getting information by 
the "tainted telephone" from the garrulous members of parliament 
remained unclear. 
  One thing, however, is clear: The discussion will lead to 
recommendations for a change in Russia's Balkan policy, and 
possibly to demands for personnel reinforcement of the Foreign 
Ministry also. And whereas the Duma lacks the constitutional 
license for the latter, as the Mr. Yerin incident shows, it 
could make recommendations, as mentioned at the news conference, 
law. It could, if turned down by the Federation Council or the 
president, be approved, all the same, by the Duma by a 
two-thirds vote--and, judging by the news conference, it has 
this. 
  I believe, however, that following the Accord Treaty the 
president would not go against the Duma, especially since 
movements at the Foreign Ministry are obvious. In addition, the 
two-week breathing-space has most likely been used for active 
consultations between members of the delegation and the Duma 
leadership and Russian diplomats. Of course, observance of the 
clause concerning a "unified foreign policy course" could be 
impeded--if the Duma devotes its first sitting to a discussion 
not of Yugoslavia but of the methods by which Ivan Rybkin won 
from the lower house the right to sign the treaty and if this 
treaty signature is disavowed. But such a development of events 
is unlikely and constitutes a different subject, what is more.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Kremenyuk, professor, deputy director of </F>
the Institute for the United States and Canada of the Russian 
Academy of Sciences: "The UN in Bosnia: Strange Peacemaking"] 
  [Text] Something strange is taking place regarding the 
existing concepts of peace and war, law and policy, objectives 
and means of attaining them. Over the many years of UN 
operations in support of peace, a fairly stable concept of their 
principles and tasks has taken shape: disengagement of the 
warring sides, complete neutrality, avoidance of political 
assessments of the actions of one side or another, the use of 
force in exceptional instances, on a limited scale, and only in 
self-defense. The rules are fairly rigid but dictated by a need 
for the United Nations to observe a genuine role as peacemaker. 
  In recent times this noble role has undergone an especially 
acute and in no way harmless distortion. In the name of the 
United Nations, squadrons of bombers and armadas of ships are 
massed. In the name of the United Nations, one party to a 
conflict is loudly accused while the other is indulged. In the 
name of the United Nations, plans for a settlement are drawn up 
which often do not even manage to ask the consent of those who 
would be bound by these plans. 
  The results are plain to see, as they say. How disgraceful 
the result of the UN peacemaking effort in Somalia has been! The 
people are starving just as they starved in the past. General 
Aidid--whom the "peacemakers" hunted so zealously--is 
prospering. While the "peacemakers" themselves, having spent 
tremendous amounts of money--that could have been used to feed 
half of Africa--have vanished. No less incredible are their 
actions in Rwanda, from which they managed to extricate 
Europeans and Americans with difficulty and are now swiftly 
retreating, while suffering significant casualties. 
  A direct example of distortion of the peacemaking role of 
the 
United Nations can be seen in Bosnia. In developing the 
anti-Serbian resolution of the Security Council, clearly aimed 
at strangling Yugoslavia with an embargo (this resolution has 
never yielded anything positive), the creators of UN policy in 
Bosnia applied the theory of "Serbian aggression" to carry out a 
policy openly hostile to one of the sides in conflict. For a 
long time ignoring reports on atrocities by Muslims or Croats, 
they did everything they could to blow up testimony on Serbian 
atrocities. Ignoring the deep historical roots and causes of the 
conflict, thereby ignoring its exceptional complexity, they kept 
reiterating that everything could be resolved in one fell swoop. 
As a result, a distorted picture of the conflict was established 
in the minds of many people along with unjustified confidence in 
the possibility of settling it. It was alleged that the entire 
affair revolved around "Serbian greed," that the Serbs must be 
stopped, and that the best way to do this was by inflicting 
massive combat strikes against their positions. 
  So now when this very simple thesis was foisted on the 
Western public, the NATO bloc came upon the scene--out of work 
and lacking any goal following the Cold War. From all 
appearances the NATO Council and its secretary general saw 
Bosnia as a chance to save the bloc and an opportunity to fill 
the military-strategic vacuum that had formed between Italy and 
Greece. Yugoslavia was suddenly, and entirely arbitrarily, 
proclaimed a "zone of responsibility" of NATO. The bloc itself 
is becoming the "tool of the United Nations" and is prepared to 
offer the organization its services. 
  Russia, initially voting in favor of the anti-Serbian 
resolution of the Security Council (the first major mistake of 
its foreign policy in the Yugoslavia crisis), is becoming a 
coparticipant, against its will, in this game which is fraught 
with tragedy. We can now attempt to clarify who issued the order 
to begin the bombing in Bosnia and why. We can deplore the 
disgraceful result of the "Churkin mission" that began with such 
success. We can take offense at the fact that--you see, "they 
did not consult Russia." We can and must accuse the Serbs of 
obstinacy and stubbornness, and of causing the latest collapse 
in the negotiations process. 
  But we cannot close our eyes here to the nature of the 
political actions of the West in Bosnia. These actions, 
culminating in the recent NATO bombings, do not facilitate a 
peaceful settlement, but rather impede it. And the United 
Nations, which must of course be given its due for the 
organization of humanitarian assistance to Bosnia, bears its 
share of responsibility for the breakdown of the negotiations. 
  It would be useful for the UN leadership to remember the 
original objectives of its organization. These do not consist of 
encouraging NATO attempts to resolve all the problems with bomb 
strikes. That is clearly a dead end. On the contrary, the United 
Nations must return to its mission of peace, not turn into a 
warring party in the Bosnian conflict. Otherwise the United 
Nations risks getting entangled in its own Vietnam.

<F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Gornostayev, Cairo-Moscow, under rubric </F>
"Near East": "Moscow as a Diplomatic Regulator: The Two Sides 
Are Turning to Washington for Economic Support"] 
  [Text] Just yesterday, the next day after the signing of 
agreements concerning the introduction of partial Palestinian 
autonomy in Gaza and Jericho, experts began consultative work on 
the forces of the Palestinian police. The participants in the 
training of the new ministers of law and order will also include 
Moscow, but to a rather small degree: 45 future Palestinian 
policemen will undergo training in Russia, and, in addition, 
Moscow will provide certain equipment to the PLO. On the part of 
Israel there are no obstacles to this kind of apportionment. The 
main problem is to carry out the pledges promptly. But it is 
difficult to do this without a good economic base. The lack of 
this base also largely influences the placement of the foreign 
forces in the Near East, where one currently senses to a greater 
and greater extent the dominance of the United States. 
Naturally, a rather large part of the financial and economic 
support for developing Palestinian autonomy directly or 
indirectly -- by way of Israel -- comes specifically from there. 
Tel Aviv has traditionally gravitated toward Washington, but now 
that tendency is also typical, to a certain degree, of the PLO. 
Understandably, Yasir 'Arafat currently, after the attainment of 
peace, has a self-interest primarily in economic support, in 
order to demonstrate to his people the fruits of peace and to 
prove to them all the practical advantages of goodneighborly 
coexistence with Israel. 
  The appeal was made to Moscow when Israel and the PLO were 
confronted by questions with regard to which they did not trust 
one another, and it was difficult to manage without Russia. 
Evidence of this is provided by the recent visits to Moscow made 
one after the other by Yasir 'Arafat and Yitchaq Rabin. Judging 
from the fact that the agreement of autonomy was signed two 
weeks after the visits to Russia by the Near East grandees, 
Moscow succeeded in playing its role in this matter, by speeding 
up the settlement process. It would seem that no small role has 
been played here also by the traditional ties: Palestine-Russia 
(in the past,, the USSR) and Israel-Unuted States. Trust does 
exist along these lines. It also exists along the US-Russia 
line, especially since both these countries are acting as 
cosponsors of the Near East settlement. The fact that the two 
sides of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict could not talk to one 
another face to face was transmitted until recently along the 
chain PLO-Russia-United States-Israel, or in the reverse order, 
or even without the third link. Now, however, the Palestinians 
are seeking greater trust and ties on the part of Washington. 
  There was also a clarification of the details of why Rabin 
and 'Arafat signed the agreement twice. The PLO leader, while 
viewing the so-called Blue Folder -- the detailed appendix to 
the agreement -- at first did not want to sign it, and appended 
a statement to the part pertaining to questions of security, 
with demands for additional guarantees from the cosponsors -- 
Russia and the United States. During the urgently announced 
break they were given to him, and the agreement was consolidated 
by signatures a second time. 
  Speaking about peace in the Palestinian sector, Shim'on 
Peres, Israeli minister of foreign affairs, stated that his 
country would strive for the same resolution with respect to 
Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon. 
  As for the first of these states, it is assumed that here 
Russia has certain levers for exerting pressure on the Arab 
side, confirmation of which will be provided by the definite 
results of the visit to Damascus by a delegation headed by Oleg 
Soskovets, RF first vice-premier. Most probably, the direct 
contacts between Israel and Syria will proceed secretly, as was 
the case with the PLO.

<F P=106> [Article by Professor Vyacheslav Dashichev, Russian Academy </F>
of Sciences Institute of Economic and Political Studies: "The 
Twists and Turns of Russian Foreign Policy Thinking"] 
  [Text] A certain member of the Presidential Council came 
out in favor of creating a new Russian foreign policy concept in 
a very ambitious and direct manner: "In a number of articles in 
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA I first formulated the central idea that has 
subsequently become crucial to the perception of Russia's role 
in the post-Soviet space by all of Russia's leading politicians 
from the president down to minister of foreign affairs Kozyrev. 
The gist of it is that the entire geopolitical space of the 
former Soviet Union falls within Russia's sphere of vital 
interests. So that no one would have any doubt as to what was 
meant by vital interests, I drew a parallel with the Monroe 
Doctrine. To a certain extent an effort was made by me to 
formulate a Russian 'Monroe Doctrine' that would be applicable 
to the situation that has existed since the collapse of the 
Soviet Union." 
  As you are aware, the Monroe Doctrine, which proclaimed the 
principle of "America for Americans," has often been used to 
justify flagrant U.S. intervention in the affairs of the other 
countries in the Americas and the imposition of dictates from 
Washington. Figuratively speaking, the doctrine could be termed 
an American version of the "Brezhnev Doctrine." 
  A. Migranyan is incorrect in his presumption that he was the 
first to put forward the idea of applying the Monroe Doctrine to 
other circumstances, in this case Russia's. This was done by 
fascist Germany to justify its struggle for dominance over 
Europe. On 1 March 1940 Ribbentrop, speaking with Welles, the 
American president's personal representative, said: "Germany 
does not wish to have anything more in Europe than the United 
States has achieved in the Western Hemisphere with the aid of 
the Monroe Doctrine" (see: S. Welles, "A Time for Decision," New 
York, 1944, p 95). Hitler made a similar statement on 9 June 
1940 in an interview intended for the American press. 
("Monatshefte fuer auswaertige Politik," Berlin, 1944, p. 533). 
Thus a German "Monroe Doctrine" emerged at the height of Nazi 
Germany's struggle for the European continent. 
  Now a Russian "Monroe Doctrine" is being imposed on us, but 
with the slight difference that its "applicability" is 
restricted to the scale of the former Soviet Union's 
geopolitical space. Of course, writers of newspaper articles and 
even presidential advisors are not making policy yet. It is a 
long way from an idea to its realization. But neither President 
B. Yeltsin nor minister of foreign affairs A. Kozyrev have 
distanced themselves from the aforementioned statement by A. 
Migranyan. Moreover, the Russian minister of foreign affairs 
himself supports the creation of a sphere of Russian vital 
interests in the geopolitical space of the former Soviet Union 
and maintenance of a Russian military presence there. Naturally 
that prompts some suspicion about whether today's Russia might 
not be heir to great power expansionism. 
  It seems that first we created difficulties for ourselves by 
"destroying" the Soviet Union "to its very foundations" without 
any need to do so, and now we are beginning to overcome those 
difficulties, which have become a disaster, by reestablishing at 
the very least a "sphere of special interests" including Russia 
and the former Soviet -- and now sovereign --republics. Now it 
has become clear even to the uninformed how much more painless, 
simpler and more reasonable it would be to continue the gradual 
process of turning the country into a modern democratic 
community of states that was begun at Novo-Ogarevo. But thirst 
for power has dimmed the reason of politicians, and the worst 
has happened: a catastrophic collapse of the country, with the 
most severe consequences for its citizens. 
  Now Zhirinovskiy and his ilk, demagogically playing on 
Russians' wounded sense of national pride, are threatening to 
restore the Soviet empire by force of arms. Attempts are even 
being made to provide a theoretical justification for the 
manifest destiny of Russian imperial policy. In the article 
"Imperial Russia Will Live Yet," Viktor Gushchin put it 
approximately like this: "Those who favored the dismantling of 
the Union, since they could not comprehend it before, are now 
compelled to admit that following the collapse of the USSR they 
will inevitably have in Russia an imperial "sovereign" in place 
of the "elder brother," with all the consequences that involves. 
Because Russia simply has no other means of self-determination 
in the current world structure. Its great power interests 
already extend too far (by virtue of objective reasons), and too 
many of its sources of life support (by virtue of the same 
reasons) now lie beyond Russia's national borders. In short, 
either imperial Russia or Russia's self-destruction" 
(NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA , 17 September 1993). 
  We should recall that Hitler convinced the Germans that a 
"people without space" and without possession of external 
sources of life support was doomed to perish. Under the slogan 
of winning that space for a "Greater Germany" he unleashed a 
world war and plunged the Germans into a national catastrophe. 
What actually happened was that the FRG, with only about 
one-half of Nazi Germany's territory and lacking its own natural 
resources to support it, became the leading industrial power in 
the world and gain a very high standard of living within four 
decades after the end of the war, thanks to an efficient 
economic system and a rational economic policy. Russia has 
incomparably greater opportunities to do so than Germany does. 
So why is it once again being prodded onto the fateful path of 
empire? 
  It seems to me that the reason behind the resurrection of 
great power ways of a dubious nature lies not only with 
Russians' fractured national pride. A major role in this regard 
has been played by the collapse of Russia's economy and state 
structure, the corrupted morals of the political elite and 
society as a whole, the upsurge in crime and mafia penetration 
of every nook and cranny of the social organism, mafia 
plundering of the people's property, the transfusion of Russia's 
national wealth abroad and -- most important -- the 
impoverishment and profound disillusionment of the broad masses 
of the public with post-August reforms by the Yeltsin-Gaydar 
government. The country's difficult situation and misery are 
increasingly, and rightly so, associated in Russians' minds with 
that course and with the American advisors that are behind it. 
This has resulted in an increase in anti-Western, particularly 
anti-American, sentiments. The seeds of suspicion have been sown 
in people's minds: have American advisors intentionally been so 
persistent in imposing monetarist theory on the Russian 
Government as a basis for reform of the Russian economy, a 
theory which the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank officially rejected 
over a year ago as unfounded? Is this not a secret plot by the 
United States to destroy Russia's economic and 
scientific-technical potential, reduce it to the rank of a 
third-rate power and turn it into a vassal of American policy? 
The way post-August economic reforms have been carried out looks 
very irrational and not at all in line with Russian conditions. 
  Of course, one could debate the motives behind official and 
unofficial Russia policy in the United States. This issue 
requires a very thorough treatment so that we will not, God 
forbid, go to extremes and subordinate our foreign policy to the 
wrong guidelines, as was the case in the past. Be that as it 
may, the fact remains: a new social and psychological atmosphere 
has emerged in this country as a result of the failures of the 
post-August course. 
  Nationalistic great-power extremism from the left and the 
right has begun to feed parasitically -- and successfully -- on 
this new political and psychological situation. This turnabout 
in the country's political sentiments gave birth to the 
monstrous Zhirinovskiy phenomenon. Under pressure from the 
"great power" crowd, who have been making political hay off of 
anti-government discontent, Yeltsin's inner circle has been 
forced to restructure its policy, sharply increasing the 
nationalistic emphases therein and demonstrating with great 
diligence, appropriately and inappropriately, its enthusiasm for 
the traditional "special" national interests of Russia as a 
great power in the Eurasian space. 
  Another important task facing the president's council is to 
dispel the impression of it, widely held by the Russian public, 
as blindly obedient to Western foreign policy, particularly 
American foreign policy, on many international issues. It is 
clear that even Washington has realized that the White House's 
focus exclusively on ordering Yeltsin around could turn against 
it if opinions such as these continue to win proponents in 
Russia and cause a further decline in the Russian president's 
approval rating and threaten his hold on power. In this regard 
money will not help. Intentional creation of friction in 
Russian-American relations and a slight reduction in their level 
would seem to be a more effective approach. Both sides' 
interests coincide on this point, and some reciprocal efforts 
have been observed. The NATO decision on the shelling of 
Sarajevo, which in and of itself looked like political and 
military insanity, since it would drag the West into a pointless 
war in Yugoslavia, was countered by Yeltsin's categorical: "We 
will not permit it!" Then came the sensational Ames case 
(involving the arrest of Russian spies in the United States), 
the arrest of an American spy in Russia, mutual expulsions of 
intelligence officers from Moscow and Washington, and finally 
Yeltsin's rude refusal to meet with ex-U.S. President Nixon. 
  It remains a mystery what is the correlation in this shift 
by 
the president's inner circle toward great power politics between 
domestic power struggle considerations, on the one hand, and 
inherited great power aspirations, on the other. In any event, 
continuation and intensification of this practice will 
inevitably result in the vector of Russian foreign policy 
deviating substantially from the normal course that would be in 
keeping with its national interests, and the country will once 
again be held hostage by the destructive dynamics of imperial 
policy. That historical lesson is an especially timely one for 
us at this juncture, considering the situation that now exists 
in Russia favorable to such a return to the past, as well as the 
confrontational nature of our president's personality and the 
clumsiness with which he and the new nomenklatura are striding 
across the slippery parquet floor of politics. 
  The time of empires, creation of spheres of influence and 
filling of political and military vacuums has disappeared 
irretrievably into the past. They have been replaced by 
regionally integrating communities of sovereign states. Those 
communities are not bound together either by the dominance and 
the authority of a strong individual or by bureaucratic 
centralism, but rather by processes of economic convergence and 
mutual penetration. That is the trend around the world. And it 
is one that cannot be avoided. 
  The Soviet Union achieved a high level of internal 
integration, and not just in the economy, though that 
integration did rest on state-sponsored monopolistic measures by 
the center, was artificial in nature and therefore folded up 
like a house of cards in December 1991 as a result of an 
arbitrary decision by the "troika" to dissolve the USSR. But 
Russia still has vital interests in the former Soviet republics, 
just as those republics still have vital interests in Russia. 
Therefore unilateral proclamation of the near abroad as a sphere 
of special Russian interests is fundamentally wrong and could 
have great destructive potential. The only way the issue should 
be framed is as a concept of interdependence as a basis for 
development of the CIS. Russia's national interest lies in 
helping establish an integrating community within the CIS space 
that will be founded on a socially-oriented market economy and 
democratic values and will be similar in type to the European 
Community. This alone can make the CIS viable. A "Monroe 
Doctrine" will doom it. No one will tolerate Russian dominance 
and dictates. The joint statement by Kravchuk and Nazarbayev 
sharply condemning Kozyrev's proclamation of the near abroad as 
a sphere of Russian vital interests clearly demonstrates that. 
The initiative by Kazakhstan's president to create a Eurasian 
Union fits in very well with the concept of interdependence. 
  The Russian "Monroe Doctrine" is nothing more nor less than 
a 
resurrection of the "policy of making enemies" not only in the 
near abroad but also in the countries of Eastern and Western 
Europe. The current "Drang nach Westen" by the Eastern European 
countries and their efforts to be admitted to NATO can be 
attributed to their fear of a revival of traditional Soviet and 
Russian hegemonism and expansionism. That is a fairly typical 
perception of Russian policy among countries in the region. 
  So what is our policy doing? Instead of dispelling these 
fears, the president's inner circle is constantly heightening 
them. How can those countries have confidence in the policy of 
the Yeltsin administration when, in addition to the Monroe 
Doctrine, it has also armed itself with a Russian version of 
Dulles' "massive retaliation doctrine," which envisions Russian 
first use of nuclear weapons in the event of an attack on its 
territory or that of its allies, i.e. the states within the 
Russian sphere of interests, as follows from an assertion by the 
president in "Fundamental Principles of Russian Federation 
Military Doctrine"? 
  When declaring Russia the successor state to the USSR, 
Russia's leaders did not even deem it necessary to state that 
there would be no succession with regard to the Soviet regime's 
expansionist policy, or to express their sincere apologies to 
the peoples of Eastern Europe who were the victims of that 
policy. It is clear that in more than two years' time Russian 
policy has not succeeded in establishing relations of confidence 
with the countries of the near abroad and Eastern Europe. Those 
relations are greatly burdened by the old perceptions of 
political circles in those countries regarding Russia's imperial 
aspirations. Those perceptions have been reinforced by the use 
of outdated means of economic and military pressure against 
those countries and by a lack of tact and political finesse in 
relations with them. 
  According to the laws of action and reaction, the response 
to 
growing Russian neo-imperialist tendencies has been symptoms of 
a Western return to the old "containment policy." The difference 
from the past is that this containment does not begin along the 
perimeter of the former USSR's sphere of influence, but rather 
along the current borders between Russia and the CIS countries, 
and under circumstances of economic ruin and political 
instability in Russia, i.e on very unfavorable terms for Russia. 
Have the proponents of a Russian "Monroe Doctrine" stopped to 
consider this? 
  The current situation with regard to the shaping of Russian 
foreign policy is in some ways reminiscent of early 1946, at 
which time the overall orientation of the Soviet Union's postwar 
foreign policy strategy was determined. It was then that at 
Stalin's request the USSR Academy of Sciences Institute of World 
Economics and World Policy developed a concept which suggested 
that all efforts be focused on reinforcing the country 
domestically and that the country refrain from expanding the 
Soviet sphere of influence in Europe and also avoid a 
confrontation with the West, which the Soviet Union could not 
sustain. When Stalin read this concept he ordered the institute 
dissolved and its director, Academician Varga, arrested, along 
with a number of his colleagues who helped develop the ideas. 
But in the end it was Varga who was proved correct, not Stalin. 
  Today it would be a disaster for Russia to slip once again 
into a state of "cold war" or even lower-level confrontation 
with the West as a result of returning to an imperialist policy. 
In that case the United States and its allies would attempt to 
create a cordon sanitaire against Russia in the near 
abroad. There have been plenty of calls for that already. 
  Russia's national interests do not require that it pit 
itself 
against the West, particularly with an imperialist policy, a 
Russian "Monroe Doctrine," appeals to countries to remain 
outside the "Partnership for Peace" or other such twists and 
turns of Russian foreign policy thinking. What they do require 
is the country's further progress along the path of political, 
economic and cultural integration in the family of civilized 
states from which it was isolated by more the more than 70 years 
of totalitarian communist domination. Only on that path can 
Russia achieve true greatness and prosperity.

<F P=106> [Article by Pavel Podlesnyy, candidate of historical </F>
sciences, RAN (Russian Academy of Sciences) Institute of Europe: 
"Washington Searches for a New Formula for Relations with 
Russia--The Idea of `Pragmatic Partnership' Is Moving to the 
Fore"] 
  [Text] The question of the foundations on which 
relations with the present Russian state can and should be 
constructed occupies virtually the central place in the 
unusually sharp debate that has developed in U.S. political and 
academic circles, the American Congress, and in press material 
concerned with foreign policy. The essence of the issues was 
stated with exceptional precision in a recent article, entitled 
"Premature Partnership," by well-known American political expert 
Zbigniew Brzezinski: "If Russia is no longer our enemy, then 
what is it--an ally already, or a client, or simply a defeated 
enemy? What should be the objectives and content of major U.S. 
strategy after the `cold war" in relation to the country which, 
one way or another, is destined to be a force in all world 
affairs regardless of its present sickened condition?" At the 
same time rightist conservative figures, above all those closely 
tied to the Republican Party, reproach the Clinton 
administration because its proclaimed policy of "partnership 
with democratic Russia" errs in its exaggerated assessments of 
Russian reforms, focuses excessive attention on Russia to the 
detriment of developing U.S. relations with other post-Soviet 
republics, and prevents the immediate admission of a number of 
countries of Central and Eastern Europe into NATO. This leads 
them to demand a rethinking of the whole set of relations with 
Russia. 
  The causes of such attitudes are obvious. In the first 
place, 
there is the anxiety of a significant part of the American 
establishment over the future pace and direction of the Russian 
reforms, the continuing danger of major social upheavals, and 
the unprecedented growth of crime in the country. It is 
noteworthy that during the recent Senate hearings CIA director 
James Woolsey expressed alarm at the scale of organized crime in 
Russia, emphasizing that this not only threatens the reforms and 
undermines the authority of the Russian leadership, but is even 
beginning to make it more difficult to fight international crime 
and creates a danger that nuclear materials will be exported 
from the former USSR. The administration too has begun to show a 
more restrained view of the future Russian reforms. And while 
some of its representatives (Talbot) call for recognition of the 
first positive results of the transformations despite all the 
difficulties, others (W. Perry) do not preclude the possibility 
that reforms will break down and an authoritarian regime hostile 
to the West will appear in Russia, with the resulting return to 
some form of "cold war." 
  In the second place, the United States is carefully 
observing 
the unending struggle in Russia over foreign policy issues, 
including relations with the West. An example of this was the 
debate about the wisdom of Russian participation in the 
well-known NATO program, Partners for Peace. And special 
attention is being focused on Russia's relations with the 
countries of the near abroad. It is perfectly clear that the 
United States and the West as a whole fear the restoration (in 
one form or another) of a significant part of the USSR (or 
Russian Empire) and the elimination of the geopolitical 
counterweights to Russia, above all Ukraine. 
  In the third place, the real scale of Russian-American 
cooperation in a number of areas, above all economic, is still 
very modest. For example, of the 3.2 billion dollars 
appropriated by the U.S. Congress since 1992 for assistance to 
CIS countries, as of March of this year (according to American 
figures) 282 million had been spent, and 141 million of this 
went to Russia. One of the reasons for this is bureaucratic and 
other delays in the action of the American state apparatus. In 
this connection Congressman L. Hamilton said, "The Russians have 
a right to complain. Congress is appropriating large amounts of 
money, which are not being used." 
  At the present time the main struggle is unfolding between 
advocates of so-called "consolidation of geopolitical pluralism" 
in the territory of the former USSR (Z. Brzezinski, H. 
Kissinger, R. Zelik, and others) and supporters of the idea of 
"pragmatic partnership," which has recently been stated by U.S. 
Secretary of Defense W. Perry and represents a modification of 
Clinton administration policy in relation to Russia. 
  As for the idea of "consolidation of geopolitical pluralism" 
in post-Soviet space, it aims at a new isolation of Russia by 
creating a kind of "buffer zone" of states along Russia's 
borders. "Only then" argues Mr. Brzezinski, "when an appropriate 
milieu has been firmly established for Russia so that it can 
define itself as Russia, will the foundation be laid for strong, 
true American-Russian partnership." 
  But even with a quick glance at this idea it is obvious that 
its realization, or more accurately attempts to realize it, 
would lead Russian-American relations in exactly the opposite 
direction and would undermine the foundations of stability on 
the European continent. 
  Least convincing of all are the attempts to reduce all 
Russia's actions toward the other CIS countries to 
manifestations of, if not openly imperial, then "protoimperial" 
policy. Russia has more than enough vitally important interests 
in the territory of the former USSR, and it cannot be said that 
its new neighbors always given them proper consideration. This 
is not to mention the fact that the Western states are not 
showing real willingness to share even a part of the burden of 
maintaining stability in the territory of the former USSR, with 
the exception of actions to eliminate nuclear weapons in 
Kazakhstan, Belorussia, and Ukraine. And finally, the 
initiatives relating to various forms of reintegration of some 
of the former Union republics do not originate solely or even 
mainly from Russian politicians. 
  The idea of "consolidation of geopolitical pluralism" within 
the boundaries of the former USSR assigns Ukraine the role of 
primary counterweight to Russia's neoimperial aspirations. For 
this purpose it is proposed to greatly increase economic aid to 
Ukraine, step up pressure on its leaders to push them toward 
economic reforms, and offer American political guarantees of 
Ukrainian independence and territorial integrity. It is true 
that they do not answer the question: Where will the United 
States and the West get the tens of billions of dollars needed 
to save the ruined Ukrainian economy, which is barely staying 
afloat--and that is largely thanks to the Russian reforms. And 
finally, the main thing--what does the West intend to do if the 
Ukrainian state disintegrates and what actions does it expect 
from Russia in such an extremely dangerous turn of events? 
  An important role in assuring "geopolitical pluralism" is 
assigned also to "broadening the scale and perimeter of European 
security," or more precisely, admitting a number of Central 
European countries to NATO, which could be done concurrently 
with conclusion of a treaty on alliance and cooperation between 
NATO and Russia. The question immediately arises: Why not 
conclude such a treaty or some kind of major agreement without 
enlarging NATO? Is such an enlargement really the only option to 
ensure stability and security in Europe? 
  The above permits us to draw the conclusion that 
"consolidation of geopolitical pluralism" is nothing more than 
an attempt to pursue the policy of "containing" Russia, ignoring 
the changes taking place in it and in the whole world, 
especially in European space. 
  We also must not overlook the fact that although the views 
described above do not exert a determining influence on 
Washington's actual policy at the present time, they make their 
mark in public consciousness and are one of the factors that is 
forcing the administration to modify its policy somewhat in 
relation to the Russian state. This found expression in 
advancement of the idea of a "pragmatic partnership" with 
Russia, which presupposes the existence of contradictions and 
differences in the national interests of the two countries, but 
also recognized the need for cooperation in many spheres, above 
all elimination of nuclear weapons, nonproliferation of nuclear 
weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, settlement of 
international crises, and development of contacts between the 
military establishments. Such cooperation, important in itself, 
is less subject to domestic changes in any particular country 
and serves as an important instrument of the stability of 
Russian-American relations.

  [Text] The Russian troika-bird has in recent months been 
thoroughly jolted in the foreign policy pits and potholes: now 
the ephemeral Sarajevo triumph, now the NATO bombardment. The 
favorite of diplomatic fortune, Vitaliy Churkin, having in a fit 
of temper deafeningly slammed the door, had only just vowed, it 
would seem, henceforward no more assistance for the 
cheaters--the Bosnian Serbs--and called once again for a march 
in single formation with the West before Andrey Kozyrev and 
Vyacheslav Kostikov hastened without delay to clarify the 
emotional statements of the Russian special emissary.... Hardly 
had the connoisseurs of world politics (even the venerable wolf 
Georgiy Arbatov) heralded in unison the start of a new cold war 
before Boris Yeltsin, following a night-time telephone 
conversation with the American President, was hastening to 
reassure us: There has not been nor is there any crack in the 
relations of the two countries. Up and down, up and down. 
  The reason for the present "rough air" in Russian diplomacy 
is, in my view, the fact that some of the interests it is 
defending are irrational and that it is operating as yet, what 
is more, according to the "one down, two to carry" principle. 
This ailment is not new. Around the end of 1989 or the start of 
1990 I, totally confused by the unintelligible foreign policy 
vocabulary, inquired of one of its creators: "How is the fact 
that the Warsaw Pact is changing from a military-political into 
a political-military organization to be understood?" "It is 
not," came the response. It is merely a signal that we are not 
to be feared." Simply a signal.... 
<H5>  Serbia Passions </H5>
  It is hard to find a reasonable explanation or justification 
for the fact that in some parts of the world, where Russia's 
real interests are weak, Muscovite diplomacy is demonstrating 
effervescent activity, in others, on the other hand, where for 
the sake of the cause dispatch should be shown, an Oblomov-like 
unruffled composure reigns. Let us take the most burning 
example--Serbia. Historical ties to it had been erased almost 
completely in the national Russian memory. Throughout the period 
between the two world wars, particularly following the rupture 
of relations in 1948, Yugoslavia was de facto on the periphery 
of Soviet foreign policy interests. In 1981 the world was in a 
state of agitation as to whether Soviet troops would be entering 
a Poland infected by the rebellious spirit of Solidarity. 
Several years later there was anxious conjecture as to how the 
Kremlin would react to Budapest's statements of its desire for 
the disbandment of the Warsaw Pact. An invasion of Soviet tanks 
was never a serious threat to Yugoslavia, on the other hand, it 
was considered self-supporting. Its image in Soviet public 
opinion of the 1960's-1970's remained more symbolic than real: 
The supporters of a reform of real socialism wanted to see it as 
the embodiment of the open society and profound transformations, 
democracy, and prosperity, for the dogmatists, on the other 
hand, it embodied the betrayal of the socialist idea. Not 
just Yugoslavia but also other countries, with which we were 
linked far more closely in both the economic and 
military-political respects, Poland or Czechoslovakia, for 
example, were seen by the majority in the same symbolically 
simplistic manner, come to that. But in time Warsaw, Prague, 
Budapest receded into the background, into the "gray zone" of 
Russian interests. The people's orators are not making a clamor 
even about Bulgaria, Slav, Orthodox, and bound to Russia by 
historical ties, which currently seems particularly important to 
some people, nor are the Cossacks straining to go there. Around 
Yugoslavia, however, which has plunged into the tailspin of an 
endless bloody war, in which neither the just nor the guilty can 
any longer be discerned, truly unheard-of passions are raging in 
Muscovy. 
  It is possible that these passions are so tumultuous for 
precisely the reason that they have merely a conditional bearing 
on their subject. Both the communists and the nationalists are 
pursuing in the new Yugoslavia their own, clearly expressed 
political interest: Mixing truth with invention, they are 
stylizing Serbia as the victim of a world conspiracy 
(imperialist and/or Yid-Masonic, Muslim--these are details 
according to taste) which has led to the disintegration of a 
formerly unified multinational state. How everything occurred in 
actual fact plays exactly no part at all. This is convincingly 
shown by both the confidences of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, rare in 
their ignorance, and the response to them of his supporters. 
They are seeking merely transparent parallels to first 
emotionally transfer Soviet-Russian reality to Serbia and then 
"accept the justice of it." And, of course, to bring it back to 
Russia--in the shape, for example, of "Karadzic's red folder," 
with which the Duma members are about to be gladdened by their 
colleague Marychev. 
<H5>  After the Third Call </H5>
  Unfortunately, the main motif of the highly active Russian 
diplomacy in Bosnia also is not so much protection of the 
peaceful population and an end to the fratricide as, primarily, 
the self-assertion of Russia as a great power and emphasis of 
the range of its global interests. What was perfectly obvious 
previously also was confirmed once again by the comment that 
fell from Churkin's lips as regards the fact that Russia is not 
one of your banana republics. When, in the wake of our 
diplomacy's notorious Sarajevo triumph, the Bosnian Serb 
aircraft were shot down, this should have served as the "first 
call" for a conceptualization of the Balkan actions. But two 
more, loud and resonant, were required: the NATO bombing and 
Churkin's clash with the Bosnian Serbs over Gorazde, for the 
Foreign Ministry to take a time-out, and for the news media to 
pour cold water on Russian diplomacy. Perhaps this will bring it 
back to the soil of rationality. Although the coming Duma debate 
on Bosnia--against the background of the struggle for the 
signing of the Social Accord Treaty--is not all that reassuring 
in this respect. 
  The question, however, is how this rationality is to be 
understood and what sort of practical steps ensue from it. It is 
possible to swing to the opposite extreme and argue: Since 
Russia has at this time no priority national interests in the 
former Yugoslavia, it should pull out the peacekeeping 
formations from there--and the sooner, the better. Since there 
is nothing there by which we may "profit," let us at least make 
a show of our pacifism. 
  It is somehow awkward even inquiring: Is it merely a 
question 
of the fact that Slavs and Orthodox are dying in Bosnia? The war 
is carrying away human lives and crippling people's 
futures. And it is for this reason, not on account of some 
ideological chimeras or sovereign-power considerations, that 
Russia should not, of course, abandon its efforts for an end to 
the war in Bosnia. Whether they require the presence of Russian 
"blue helmets" or not, how long the presence of Russian soldiers 
is needed there and on what terms--this derives from the main 
thing: concerted actions with other countries of the world 
community attempting to untie the Bosnian knot. Doing this is 
hard enough as it is, but if, in addition, Russian great-power 
ambitions come to be interwoven in it, this knot altogether 
could not fail to become Gordian. 
  An end to the fratricide in the former Yugoslavia is 
undoubtedly in our interests. Not, moreover, irrational and 
"perverted" but entirely real--both general and palpable, 
material--inasmuch as we could in peacetime trade and cooperate 
without regard to blood and soil--with advantage and in the open 
(not as now, in secret, under the cover of "third countries"). 
<H5>  `Russia in a Crowd' </H5>
  But let us take another problem--the absence for Russia of 
allies outside of the CIS. Each in its own way, but almost all 
political forces of the country--particularly in connection with 
the prospect of the expansion of NATO and the Partnership for 
Peace program--are speaking about the threat of strategic 
isolation and about a Black Sea-Baltic cordon sanitaire 
allegedly threatening to cut Russia off from Europe. This 
question requires action and serious decisions, but what is not 
there is not there. 
  Truly, the USSR's former Warsaw Pact allies and the Baltic 
countries are reorienting at full speed toward the West. Fear of 
Russia, even if deliberately stoked by politicians, has 
nonetheless become a phenomenon of the mass mentality, which it 
would be impermissible simply to brush aside. It is at times so 
deeply rooted in the national memory that it cannot be simply 
rationalized just like that, overnight. An example is Poland, 
which was divided three times, by Russia and Prussia included, 
and a fourth time by the USSR and Germany, which subsequently 
swallowed up its eastern neighbor also. The Poles hated and 
feared the Germans no less than the Russians. But in recent 
years--and not only on account of the Deutsche mark but mainly 
owing to the perseverance of the German Government and the 
public--the picture has begun to change. 
  And Russia? Infrequent and unsuccessful, inadequately 
prepared visits. Proposals not meeting with a response in 
society, the absence not only of a formulated policy but even of 
a real desire to formulate it. And, most important--a dialogue 
with the United States or Germany over the heads of the small 
Central European or Baltic countries, to whom their ridiculously 
insignificant place in world politics is without compunction 
pointed out at every available opportunity. 
  I quote Andranik Migranyan, a member of the Presidential 
Council: "...we can no longer be first in line at NATO's doors. 
These doors are already surrounded by Romanians, Estonians, 
Slovaks, and Czechs. Ukrainians, Latvians, and Lithuanians are 
straining to get there also. It would be amusing to see what 
Russia, militarily still a superpower, would look like in such a 
crowd, where everyone is shouting about the threat emanating 
from Russia and for this reason wishes to lean against the 
powerful shoulder of NATO in the search for a guarantee of his 
territorial integrity and security.... Russia could hardly be 
the same type of candidate as, for example, Estonia and Poland, 
and Russia would hardly have the same commitments to the world 
community as the countries that have today swarmed all over 
NATO's doors." Justifying to a group of German and other West 
European politicians and scholars Russia's desire to obtain 
special status in the Partnership recently, Duma deputy 
Vyacheslav Nikonov (Party of Russian Unity and Accord) returned 
several times to one and the same purely hypothetical situation, 
which was, he believed, to have demonstrated the absurdity of 
the desire to put vast Russia on a par with some small country: 
"NATO decides, say, to stage exercises of a peacekeeping force 
in Abkhazia. When the decision is being made, what, would the 
vote of Iceland, merely because the latter is a full member of 
NATO, outweigh that of Russia?" 
<H5>  In the Language of Prince Gorchakov </H5>
  A preoccupation with the dimensions of Russia and a 
reluctance to evaluate them anew and find some basis for 
dialogue with the Central European and Baltic countries are 
irrational and lead, therefore, to an impasse. This, in fact, is 
the result at which Migranyan also arrives: "The analysts who 
say that in not having affiliated with the Partnership for Peace 
program and, subsequently, NATO also we would be condemning 
ourselves to strategic isolation are absolutely right. But it is 
just as correct also that in having consented to participate in 
the Partnership for Peace program with the preservation of the 
NATO bloc, which would decide who could become a full member of 
the bloc and when and how, we would find ourselves isolated." 
There is no solution, apparently, other than a cold war, for 
from the flight of the sovereign-power bird only NATO and Russia 
are visible. The rest are not worthy of attention, a trifle 
thronging around doors and deserving, at best, cross-guarantees. 
It would be more correct to call such a position not isolation 
but self-isolation, and self-isolation on account of inordinate 
great-power arrogance. 
<H5>  Are We Condemned to a New Version of the Cold War? </H5>
  In American policy in respect to Russia also elements of 
irrationality are quite strong: Not all that comprehending of 
our chaos, the Americans, in defiance of their own rules, are 
oriented not so much toward structures as toward persons whom 
they consider influential. One Russian analyst recently even 
devoted an unusual article to the "Chernomyrdin phenomenon" and 
to his possible influence on the process of the adoption in the 
United States of decisions concerning Russia. With this approach 
the cooling in Russian-American relations, which is pronounced 
even now, could result in an abrupt and swift deterioration and 
breakdown. 
  This has not yet happened, and the slide toward a new 
version 
of the cold war is not a fatal necessity which cannot be 
avoided. But a mutual misunderstanding between Russian and 
European (both West and Central European) politicians and 
political scientists is growing increasingly distinctly. Some 
are speaking increasingly often in the language of the 
geopolitics of the start of the 20th century and even Prince 
Gorchakov, others, in the language of international law. But 
even in recognizing strength they refer primarily to economic 
strength. Irrationality, unpredictability, fraudulent 
signals--these are the anti-values of the European diplomacy of 
our day, that which could merely repel the Old World from us. 
Russia is facing one of the most critical foreign policy 
decisions in its history. At a fork in the road.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Samuylov: "The Inter-Civilization </F>
Approach--Russia Needs To Come Forward With a Counter Initiative 
to the `Partnership for Peace'"] 
  [Text] At the present time 
NATO is the only political and military structure which unites 
the main components of Western civilization--North American and 
Western European--into a single whole. One of the weighty 
arguments of the Atlanticists, who advocate preservation of the 
alliance under U.S. leadership in the postcommunist era, is the 
need to preserve the West as a kind of unified whole. 
  The fact that, in the opinion of many American experts, 
Turkey recently has been distancing itself from NATO and 
claiming leadership in the Islamic world, confirms once again 
the Western nature of this alliance. Many counties of Eastern 
Europe and the Baltic are literally bursting to get into NATO 
today, trying to return to the West--undoubtedly their ancient 
historical, cultural, and geopolitical bosom--as quickly as 
possible. 
  If we stand on the ground of historical objectivity, we must 
recognize that, unlike many Eastern European countries, Russia 
was never a part of the West. Even if we disregard the adoption 
of Orthodoxy in the 10th Century, it is well-known that 
approximately from the time of Peter the Great, that is roughly 
from the first quarter of the 18th Century, Russia was one of 
the Great European powers and an inseparable component in 
maintaining the European balance of powers, but it did not 
become part of Europe. Despite the significant Europeanization 
of the ruling dynasty and dominant class, Russia was seen in 
Europe as an alien, expansionist, and Asiatic power. 
  One of the primary reasons for this was the different 
manners 
of joint historical existence of the different peoples and 
ethnic groups. Whereas in the European empires the dominant, 
privileged nation stood out clearly, arrogantly classifying 
subordinate peoples as inferiors, trying to assimilate them by 
force and upholding imperial unity by force on the grounds that 
this nation itself was the representative of the Christian 
world, true civilization, and so on, and whereas in the later 
period the monoethnic nation states of Europe were formed by 
force and at the cost of great bloodshed and numerous wars among 
them to establish "natural" borders, on the other hand the 
formation of the Russian Empire differed fundamentally from this 
European model. 
  The governing strata of the peoples who joined or were 
conquered were not annihilated, destroyed, nor deprived of their 
privileges; rather they were immediately taken into the ruling 
classes in Russia. What was demanded of them above all was 
devoted service to the empire. They and their peoples usually 
kept their unique religious, ethnic, and cultural features. 
Despite the periodic attempts of tsarist authorities at forced 
russification, the Russians who colonized the vast spaces of 
Eurasia did not become an imperial nation and did not act as the 
master people in relation to the ethnic groups who were 
conquered or annexed; assimilation was generally peaceful and 
painless. That is exactly why many peoples who were threatened 
with extinction as ethnic groups by more powerful neighbors 
joined Russia voluntarily, even though their leaders today 
prefer not to talk about this. It can be said without 
exaggeration that this difference between Russia and the West is 
a difference between civilizations. 
  In other words, the Western model of the attitude toward 
different civilizations, ethnic groups, and cultures begins from 
an ideology of Eurocentrism according to which the entire world 
is a backward province of the West and must be civilized; this 
justifies their assimilation and Westernization, by force in the 
past and by other methods today, for their own good. In other 
words, it takes for granted the establishment of a universal 
pro-Western uniformity. The Russian model, by contrast, begins 
from exactly the opposite idea, that preservation of the 
diversity of spiritual worlds, ethnic groups, and cultures is 
the natural form of their mutual existence. Put differently, 
neither the Russian Empire nor the USSR was an empire in the 
classical, European sense of this word. 
  One of the main reasons for the conflicts that have occurred 
and may occur on the periphery of the former USSR is exactly the 
fact that the leadership of a number of former Union republics, 
measuring everything by Western standards, are trying to create 
monoethnic nation states despite the artificiality of their 
borders. And this does not work for them because the small, 
separate ethnic groups and territories of these new states 
prefer the Russian model, which guarantees preservation of their 
unique ethnic and cultural features. In the European version 
there is a high probability that they would be lost. 
  So whereas the West has reasons for a guarded attitude 
toward 
Russia because it is in fact a different civilization, the 
Russians have just as good grounds for the same attitude toward 
the West. After all, armed aggression from the West has come on 
the Russian land more than once, bringing a multitude of 
misfortunes, and it took great exertion of forces to defend our 
national independence. The historical memory of a nation is a 
reality which is formed by the centuries, and its action today 
manifests itself in an extremely guarded attitude toward 
possible enlargement of NATO and its drawing closer to Russia's 
borders. 
  This is even more so when it appears that the West today, 
while renouncing forceful methods, has not changed its 
intentions regarding Russia. And they basically amount to the 
same civilizing mission, to assimilation of Russia, spiritually, 
ideologically, and culturally first of all, and later 
politically and economically. Through the "Partnership for 
Peace" program, the proposal of possible NATO membership, and on 
the defense level. 
  If the West is able to get its way their will be a high 
probability of gradual establishment of pro-Western uniformity 
all across the planet, but before that there will be a global 
standoff on a North-South line and in this case the non-European 
peoples will naturally resist furiously. If Russia preserves and 
consolidates itself as an independent civilization and a unique 
political nation, then the natural form of human existence as a 
great diversity of civilizations, ethnic groups, and cultures 
will also be preserved. 
  Russia does not need to walk always on a Western leash; it 
must come forward with a counter initiative which is linked to 
possibly joining the "Partnership" program. 
  It can be proposed to NATO to form a joint, permanent 
headquarters for conducting peacekeeping operations in Europe, 
where an equal number of NATO and Russian officers would be 
working, headed alternately by NATO and Russian generals, who 
would be given special military units from both the Alliance 
countries and from Russia. They would be rapidly deployed under 
his command in the case of a crisis situation. This headquarters 
should be subordinate not to NATO, but to the U.N. Security 
Council, where Russian has a veto. The CSCE is still an 
amorphous forum, not even an international organization, and so 
it is not suitable for rapid response to a crisis. Such a 
headquarters can act as a regional or European branch of the 
U.N. military staff committee, which is permitted by the Charter 
of this organization. 
  This version of Russia-NATO partnership would put an end to 
the deeply-rooted historical distrust of Russians for Western 
military activity, even under the U.N. flag, and the possible 
engagement of mixed forces close to Russian borders would not 
arouse fears. On the other hand, a serious step would be taken 
in the direction of creating a multipolar, and therefore more 
stable, postcommunist world order. 
  For their part, the United States and NATO would get a 
weighty, truly peace-oriented, and not just Western but 
all-European substantiation for extending the existence of the 
bloc, which they have been trying so hard to find since the end 
of the cold war. 
  It should also be stated that Russia does not intend to join 
NATO, even if it joins the "Partnership" program. Such 
membership is unacceptable for Russia because of its Eurasian 
location and the possibility of serious complications of 
relations, primarily with China. 
  As for the East Europeans, Russia has no power to stop their 
return to the West, but it is possible to try to direct this 
process into a course that is more acceptable. It can be 
suggested that for a start they join the Western European 
alliance, the EC defense structure, toward which Russia does not 
have the negative attitude that it has toward NATO.

<F P=106> [Report from the Center for the State of the Economy at the </F>
Government of the Russian Federation: "Structure of Russia's 
Foreign Trade Turnover in 1993 by Sector"] 
  [Text] The Center for the State of the Economy at the 
Government of the Russian Federation, on the basis of official 
statistical data on foreign trade turnover, has conducted an 
analysis of changes in the branch structure of Russia's exports 
and imports with states of the far abroad for the first nine 
months of 1992 and 1993. 
<H5>  EXPORTS </H5>
  During the period January-September 1993, as compared with 
the same period in 1992, the share of production of the fuel and 
power engineering complex declined somewhat, and amounted to 
53.5 percent as opposed to 55.4 percent. 
  The production share of the metallurgy complex rose from 
14.5 
percent to 17.1 percent. However, the share of non-ferrous 
metallurgy declined from 9.5 to 7.5 percent, while at the same 
time that of ferrous metallurgy increased and amounted to 8.6 as 
opposed to 5.0 percent. 
  The share of exports of machine-building production 
(including deliveries along the line of military-technical 
cooperation) was reduced from 14.8 to 11.1 percent. 
  Exports from sectors of the chemical and wood products 
complex increased from 9.1 to 11.2 percent. However, more 
significant changes were observed in the timber, woodworking and 
pulp-and-paper industries. For the first nine months of 1993 the 
sector's share amounted to 4.4 percent, as opposed to 3.1 
percent for the corresponding period in 1992. But exports of 
chemical and petrochemical products rose from 6.0 to 6.7 percent. 
  The share of product exports from the agro-industrial 
complex 
showed an insignificant increase--from 2.2 to 3.0 percent. 
<H5>  Fuel and Power Engineering Complex </H5>
<H5>  Electrical Power Engineering </H5>
  In the overall volume of exports, the sector's share is 
insignificant. For the first nine months of 1993 it amounted to 
0.3 percent in all, and remains practically at the level of the 
corresponding period in 1992. 
  The value of electrical power exports for the first nine 
months of 1993 was calculated at $95 million, as opposed to $85 
million during the period January-September 1992. As before, the 
main consumer of Russian electrical power is still Finland, 
whose share of the overall volume is at the level of 85-90 
percent. 
<H5>  Oil and Gas Industry </H5>
  The share of the oil and gas industry for the first nine 
months of 1993 declined somewhat with respect to the first nine 
months of 1992, and amounted to 52.0 percent as against 52.9 
percent in 1992. The value of exports from the sector remained 
practically at the level of the corresponding period of 1992, 
and the sum total of exported production was $14.5 billion. 
<H5>  Oil </H5>
  The share of oil (including gas condensate) continues to 
occupy a leading position in the structure of branch exports: 
during the period January-September 1993 it amounted to 44.4 
percent; that is, it increased by 3.2 percent. 
  The increase in oil export volume is taking place under 
conditions of a continuing production slump. During the first 
nine months of 1993, as compared with the same period in 1992, 
the decline in oil extraction amounted to 13.3 percent, and 
initial refinement of oil declined by 15.3 percent. In this 
connection, the increase in the export volume of oil was made 
possible primarily by virtue of significant reduction of exports 
to countries of the near abroad. Thus, oil exports to these 
countries during the period January-September 1993 declined, in 
comparison with the corresponding period in 1992, by 43.9 
percent, or by 25.5 million tonnes. 
<H5>  Gas </H5>
  Deliveries of gas to the export sector occupy second place 
in 
terms of value. The share of export gas in the period 
January-September 1993 amounted to 36 percent, and with respect 
to the corresponding period in 1992, declined by 2.0 percent. 
  The decline in the value of export gas is connected with a 
decline in the level of both world and contract prices. While 
the volume of deliveries increased by 6.6 percent, their value 
declined by 5.2 percent. 
<H5>  Petroleum Products </H5>
  The share of petroleum products in sector exports was 
reduced 
from 21 percent to 19 percent, which is associated with changes 
in the structure of deliveries, and with a decline in the level 
of world and contract prices. 
  In all, during the period January-September 1993, petroleum 
products valued at $2.7 billion were exported, as opposed to $3 
billion during the corresponding period of 1992; that is, 
exports declined by 10 percent on the average. 
  In spite of the decline in the value of petroleum product 
exports, deliveries in physical terms increased by 44.5 percent, 
or by 8.1 million tonnes, which is also taking place against a 
background of reduced production volumes. 
<H5>  Coal Industry </H5>
  The share of exports of production of the coal industry 
declined to 1.2 percent during the period January-September 
1993, as opposed to 2.1 percent for the corresponding period in 
1992. The value of exports amounted to $322 million, and 
declined by $250 million, or by 44 percent. 
  There were significant changes in the structure for 
deliveries in the sector: in terms of value the share of exports 
of hard coal increased from 86 to 98 percent, and the export 
share of brown coal declined from 14 to 2.0 percent. 
<H5>  Metallurgy Complex </H5>
<H5>  Ferrous Metallurgy </H5>
  The export share of the sector rose from 5.0 percent in the 
period January-September 1992 to 9.6 percent in 
January-September 1993. This is the highest growth among all the 
sectors. The value of exports increased nearly twofold and 
amounted to $2.7 billion as opposed to $1.4 billion for the 
first nine months of 1992. 
  Eighty-five percent of the value of the sector's exports 
came 
from deliveries of steel and rolled metal. In the first nine 
months of 1993, their share was a little lower and amounted to 
82 percent. 
<H5>  Non-Ferrous Metallurgy </H5>
  The export share of non-ferrous metallurgy for the first 
nine 
months of 1993 declined in comparison with the same period in 
1992, from 9.5 to 7.5 percent, while the value of exports 
decreased by $600 million. 
  Changes have been made in the export structure of the sector 
over the past year. During the period January-September 1992, 
aluminum comprised 32 percent; nickel, 18 percent; and platinum, 
palladium and rhodium, 13 percent. During the period 
January-September 1993, the export share of aluminum amounted to 
41 percent; nickel, 16 percent; and platinum, palladium and 
rhodium, 19 percent. 
<H5>  Chemical and Timber Complex </H5>
<H5>  Chemical and Petrochemical Industry </H5>
  The share of chemical and petrochemical production showed 
insignificant increase--from 6.0 to 6.7 percent. The value of 
product exports from this sector amounts to $1.9 billion; that 
is, an increase of 13.9 percent. 
<H5>  Timber, Woodworking and Pulp-and-Paper Industries </H5>
  The share of exports for products of the timber, woodworking 
and pulp-and-paper industries increased from 3.1 percent for the 
first nine months of 1992, to 4.5 percent for the first nine 
months of 1993. On the whole, exports amounted to $1.8 million; 
that is, a 49 percent increase. 
  Negative trends in the export structure remain and became 
even more critical: these are connected with a reduction in the 
export of ready-made products, and growth in the export of raw 
materials. The share of non-processed wood materials rose from 
35 to 41 percent; processed wood materials declined from 28 to 
25 percent; and exports of wood pulp from timber were reduced to 
the level of 1992 (12 percent). 
<H5>  Machine-Building </H5>
  The proportion of machine-building products (including 
deliveries along the line of military-technical cooperation) 
declined from 14.8 to 11.1 percent. In absolute terms, for the 
first nine months of 1993, exports of machine-building products 
declined in comparison with the corresponding period of 1992 by 
23.5 percent and amounted to $3.1 billion. The decline in 
exports in rather significant and is approaching one billion 
dollars. 
  As in the past, the leading position in product exports in 
this sector is occupied by motor vehicle deliveries. Their share 
increased from 26 percent in January-September 1992 to 31 
percent in January-September 1993. Next comes deliveries of 
technological (including boiler) equipment, whose export share 
has grown from 20 to 27 percent. The share of the remaining 
kinds of machine-building production decreased slightly in the 
period January-September 1993, or declined to the level of the 
corresponding period in 1992. 
  Changes in deliveries of basic groups of machine-building 
products for the first nine months of 1993, in comparison with 
the corresponding period for 1992, in order of decreasing export 
proportion in the sector, are shown in the following data: 
  Means of Ground Transport --91.2 percent 
  Technological Equipment --99.6 percent 
  Aircraft --50.7 percent 
  Electrical Equipment --71.6 percent 
  Optical Instruments and Apparati --76.5 percent 
  Rail Transport --42.8 percent 
  Exports of Clocks and Clockworks --10.0 percent 
<H5>  Light Industry </H5>
  As in January-September 1992, the light industry product 
export share was insignificant, and amounted to 0.41 percent as 
against 0.7 percent. Product exports in the sector declined from 
$193 million to $114 million, or by 40.9 percent 
  Exports of cotton fabrics dropped by $40 million. Losses 
from 
reduced exports of products made from flax amounted to nearly 
$10 million. 
  The share of deliveries of raw leather goods increased 
somewhat, from 3.0 to 12.0 percent; for wool, from 2.0 to 4.0 
percent; and for clothes from textile products, from 10 to 17 
percent. At the same time, not only their export share but also 
their export value increased--by 230, 13.3 and 4.3 percent, 
respectively. 
<H5>  Food Industry </H5>
  The production share of food industry exports grew from 1.8 
to 2.8 percent; in absolute terms the growth in exports amounted 
to nearly $280 million. 
  A basic increase of $270 million was provided by virtue of 
increasing deliveries of fish. Exports of fish grew by 82.1 
percent, including a $150 million increase in sale of fish to 
Japan; a $25 million sales increase to South Korea; and a $43 
million sales increase to Norway. 
<H5>  IMPORTS </H5>
  As in the past, purchases of machine-building products 
occupy 
the leading position in imports; however, their share is 
gradually decreasing from year to year, and according to data 
from January to September 1993, it amounted to 38.5 percent, as 
opposed to 40.7 percent for the corresponding period in 1992. 
  The share in product imports from the agro-industrial 
complex 
decreased from 28.5 to 25.5 percent. However, the import 
dynamics of the sectors which make up the complex are taking 
different directions. For example, the share of agricultural 
products decreased from 14.8 to 10.8 percent, which is 
principally connected with a gradual decline in state grain 
procurement. The share of products from the food industry, on 
the other hand, increased by 1.0 percent, and for 
January-September 1993 was 14.7 percent as opposed to 13.7 
percent. 
  Significantly, the share of products from the chemical and 
timber complex decreased from 12.4 to 8.6 percent. Moreover, the 
proportion for chemical and petrochemical products decreased 
from 11.2 to 7.6 percent, while timber, wood-processing and 
pulp-and-paper products remained practically at the level of 
January-September 1992. 
  In the period under examination, the share of product 
procurement from the metallurgical complex increased nearly 
twofold, and for the first nine months of 1993 amounted to 6.9 
percent. At the same time, ferrous metallurgy products increased 
from 2.7 to 4.1 percent, and non-ferrous metallurgy products 
from 1.3 to 2.8 percent. 
  A small amount of growth is seen in the proportion of 
products from light industry, and its share for the period 
January-September 1993 amounted to 12.3 percent, as opposed to 
11.9 percent in the corresponding period of 1992. 
<H5>  Machine-Building </H5>
  In January-September 1993, as compared with the 
corresponding 
period for 1992, purchases of machine-building products declined 
by more than $5 billion, and their share of the overall import 
volume decreased from 40.7 to 38.5 percent. 
  As in the past, the leading place in imports of 
machine-building products want to purchases of technological 
equipment, whose share remained practically at the level of the 
preceding period, and amounted to 51 percent. 
<H5>  Metallurgy Complex </H5>
<H5>  Ferrous Metallurgy </H5>
  The share of imports of ferrous metallurgy products rose 
from 
2.7 to 4.1 percent. 
  The year 1993 was characterized by an increase in 
procurement 
of ready-made products, in particular pipe, whose share in 
branch imports increased from 44 to 77 percent, and in terms of 
costs by a factor of 1.4. 
  About 42 percent of imports fell to the procurement of pipe 
for oil and gas pipelines, while 35.6 percent was made up of 
import of pipe for drilling oil and gas wells. According to 
information from the Institute on Economic Problems of the 
Transition Period, production of drilling pipe in Russia has 
decreased to 8.0 percent of the level of 1992; that is, it has 
practically ceased. Therefore, it was necessary to make up for 
their lack on the Russian market by procurement from import. 
<H5>  Non-Ferrous Metallurgy </H5>
  In imports, the share of non-ferrous metallurgy products 
increased from 1.3 to 2.8 percent, and this is the only sector 
for which import costs increased in the period January-September 
1993 in comparison with the same period of 1992. 
  The increase took place primarily as a result of an increase 
from 76 to 84 percent in the share of procurement of raw 
materials for the aluminum industry. The share of raw material 
procurement for production of zinc climbed from practically zero 
to 6.0 percent. 
<H5>  Light Industry </H5>
  The share of this sector in overall import volume rose from 
11.9 to 12.3 percent. On the whole, imports of products from 
light industry declined by $1.4 billion; however, the rates of 
decline in this sector, which amounted to 46.7 percent, lag 
behind the rates of decline for imports as a whole. 
  During the period January-September 1993, the procurement 
structure for imports changed somewhat, and the share of basic 
goods was as follows: 
  Clothing from Textiles --29 percent 
  Shoes --18 percent 
  Knitted Wear --13 percent 
  Carpets --10 percent 
  Leather Goods --9.0 percent 
  Furs and Fur Goods --5.0 percent 
<H5>  Agro-Industrial Complex </H5>
<H5>  Food Industry </H5>
  The share of the food industry increased from 13.5 to 14.7 
percent. On the whole, food industry imports were reduced by 
$1.5 billion; that is, the rate of decline of procurement of 
food products amounted to 44.8 percent, which is somewhat lower 
than the rate of decline for imports as a whole. 
<H5>  Agricultural Products </H5>
  The share of agricultural product imports declined rather 
significantly--from 14.8 percent in January-September 1992 to 
10.8 percent in January-September 1993, which corresponds to a 
decrease of $2.4 billion, or 62.4 percent. 
  Since the mid-1980's, procurement of grain had occupied one 
of the leading places in Russian imports; however, in 1993 grain 
imports began to decline in comparison with preceding years. 
Thus, in the period January-September 1993 the share of grain 
imports in total agricultural product import volume declined 
from 91 to 87 percent, which corresponds to a $2.2 billion 
reduction in procurement.

<F P=106> [ADS report: "Foreign Trade Decreased by 5.9 Percent in the </F>
First Quarter"] 
  [Text] Russia's foreign trade in the first quarter of 1994 
declined 5.9 percent in comparison with January-March last year, 
to 13 billion dollars, according to the current data of the 
State Committee for Statistics. The decline in January-February 
in comparison with the same period last year was 8.8 percent. 
The improvement of the quarterly indicator, according to Deputy 
Chief Vladimir Kiselev of the Main Economic Administration of 
the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, was due to the 
continued growth of exports and the slight deceleration of the 
decline of imports. The positive balance for the quarter was 5.2 
billion dollars (2.2 billion in January-February).

  [Text]Total export volume in the first quarter amounted to 
9.1 
billion dollars, displaying an increase of 5 percent over the 
volume for the first quarter of 1993. Exports in March increased 
to 3.5 billion dollars, as compared to 3 billion in February and 
2.5 billion in January. Shipments to industrially developed 
countries in comparison with the first quarter of 1993 displayed 
an increase of 8.4 percent and reached 5.5 billion dollars (2.2 
billion in March), and exports to developing countries increased 
by 5.6 percent to 1.2 billion dollars. Exports to all other 
countries decreased by 2.3 percent, declining to 2.4 billion 
dollars.

  Exports of crude oil increased by 3.1 percent to 18.5 
million 
tonnes, shipments of petroleum products increased by 14.8 
percent to 6.6 million tonnes, and exports of natural gas 
increased by 11.8 percent to 28.4 billion cubic meters. In terms 
of cost, however, exports of crude oil and petroleum products 
decreased by 17 percent and 20 percent respectively--because of 
the drop in world prices in 1993. Exports of nickel and aluminum 
more than doubled. As Mr. Kiselev pointed out, the increase in 
exports of primary aluminum was accompanied by an even larger 
increase (2.7-fold) in imports of aluminum ores and 
concentrates, much of which come here as part of "tolling" 
operations (ore imports paid for with finished metal products).

commodities. Imports of machines, equipment, and vehicles

all Russian imports from distant foreign countries). 
  Imports of the main foodstuffs continued to decrease. 
Imports 
of grain were 87.6 percent below the figure for January-March 
1993, declining to 372,000 tonnes. Furthermore, as Mr. Kiselev 
reported, there were virtually no shipments of grain in March, 
and all incoming shipments in January-February were made in line 
with 1993 contracts. No contracts with the main foreign 
suppliers of grain were signed in the first quarter. There were 
decreases of 54 percent in imports of meat, 83 percent in sugar 
imports (including 95 percent for raw sugar), 30 percent in 
imports of vegetable oil, and 91 percent in imports of noodles 
in comparison with January-March 1993.

<F P=106> [Article by journalist Mayya Lomidze: "RAMSIR Worried About </F>
Its Fate"] 
  [Text] In the past six months there has been a considerable 
decrease in the volume of foreign investments in Russian 
industry. As compared with August 1993, investments have dropped 
to one-tenth of the previous amount, from $115.7 million to 
$13.8 million. In December the share of foreign capital in the 
capital stock of SP [joint ventures] constituted 30-40 percent, 
as compared with 80 percent in July. In the opinion of certain 
Western businessmen, the reason for this decline was not only 
the instability of the political situation and the imperfect 
nature of legislation, but also the unexpected reorganizations 
in the agencies of administration. 
  The edict entitled "The Restructuring of the Federal 
Agencies 
of Administration," which was signed in January 1994, 
essentially eliminates the only agency that used to carry out a 
more or less consistent investment policy. In accordance with 
the president's order, the Russian Agency for International 
Cooperation and Development (RAMSIR) is transferred to the 
jurisdiction of MVES [Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations] 
"with transformation into a state enterprise." 
  Thus, the work of improving the state registry of 
enterprises 
is indefinitely postponed. No one knows which department will 
engage in the registration of the major investment agreements or 
who will guarantee the work of the Commission on Humanitarian 
Assistance to Russia, under the RF government. 
  Currently the government is working on the drafts of edicts 
entitled "Procedure for State Registration of Enterprises and 
Physical Entities Engaging in Entrepreneurial Activity" and 
"Encouraging the Attracting of Foreign Investments Into the 
Priority Branches of the National Economy." The president's 
administration is preparing a federal investment plan for 1994. 
However, if the tendency to "dissipate the functions" of one 
department among several others is preserved, one would scarcely 
expect those legislative drafts to be effective. 
  In the opinion of V. Korolev, deputy chairman of RAMSIR, the 
actual elimination of the agency will result in the further drop 
in investments. Potential investors once again will encounter 
complete confusion when one ministry will engage in providing 
informational support, another ministry will engage in the 
registration of enterprises, and a third one will engage in 
export-import problems.

  --The most dynamic area of foreign investment in Russia is

  [End boxed material 2] 
  Representatives of firms which participated in the 
seminar, "German Investments in Russia," held yesterday in the 
FRG [Federative Republic of Germany] embassy, had the 
opportunity to see with their own ideas the different 
interpretations of Russian legislation on the part of 
presidential and government structures. Yevgeniy Yasin (the head 
of the analytical center under the president's administration) 
and Igor Noskov (the chief of the Minfin [Ministry of Finance] 
Department of International Tax Relations) have opposite 
interpretations of the benefits presented in the presidential 
edict, "On Improving Work With Foreign Investments." 
  The seminar which was held was interesting primarily because 
of its organizers. From the German side this was the Moscow 
Representation of German Economics--the first step on the road 
to opening a German chamber of commerce and industry in Moscow 
(an American chamber of commerce and industry already exists in 
Moscow). From the Russian side it was the Expert Institute of 
the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. Its 
director, Yevgeniy Yasin, was recently named to head up the 
analytical center under the president's administration. So that 
German businessmen had reason to expect from the organizers of 
the seminar not only appraisals of the development of the 
economic situation in Russia, but also support of their 
interests. 
  Yevgeniy Yasin characterized Russia's economic position as 
"naturally-critical, but not catastrophic." The decline in 
production in 1994 comprised 23 percent in January, 24 percent 
in February and 27 percent in March. According to Mr. Yasin's 
evaluation, this is an overproduction crisis, the solution to 
which is structural reorganization. A typical example is that of 
the textile industry, which Yasin's institute studied. There is 
a natural differentiation taking place in this industry: Leaders 
are emerging (15-16 percent of the 170 enterprises studied) as 
well as outsiders (24 percent), whose only prospects 
are--bankruptcy. The tactics of the leaders in 1993 amounted to 
sales priorities, including export, as well as the total absence 
of capital investments. In 1994, Yasin believes, these tactics 
must be supplemented by investment activity. The function of the 
government is reduced to holding down inflation and supporting 
private investments. Investment potential has been accumulated 
in foreign and domestic trade and at the commercial banks. Hopes 
are riding on the financial consortium of non-state banks and 
investment companies which is being created, and which will emit 
state-guaranteed securities and finance projects selected by the 
consortium itself from among those prepared by Minekonomika. 
This is not the only project. Thus, commercial banks are 
prepared to finance an investment project in the sum of $200 
million for production of the Il-96-m. Mr. Yasin's general 
conclusion was that the situation on the money market (inflation 
being held down and the positive value of bank interest) make 
realistic a turn toward stepping up investment activity, without 
which Russian industry "will not survive." 
  After such an announcement, the seminar participants turned 
to the problems of specifically foreign investments. Their 
attention, not surprisingly, was concentrated on taxes. The 
application of the VAT [value-added tax] (20 percent) and the 
special tax (3 percent) to import equipment was characterized as 
a "tax on investments." The 38 percent tax on "surplus wages" 
(including that of foreign citizens) was called a "fine." 
Explanations were presented by Igor Noskov, head of the Minfin 
Department of International Tax Relations. And it was he who 
gave the seminar participants their main surprise. Mr. Noskov 
said that, from the standpoint of Minfin, the 3-year immunity of 
foreign investments from statutes of the Russian authorities 
(except for federal laws and presidential edicts) which may 
inflict material loss upon them, which was introduced by the 27 
September 1993 presidential edict, "On Improving Work With 
Foreign Investments," does not apply to taxes. The justification 
for this is that all changes in taxes must be ratified by 
parliament. The comment of the German entrepreneurs to the 
effect that the 38 percent tax also did not get the approval of 
the Federal Assembly clarified the Minfin position: "To let 
everyone in and not to let anyone out." Igor Noskov's 
announcement met with sharp reproach from Yevgeniy Yasin, who 
announced to the satisfaction of the participants that Minfin 
must carry out the presidential edicts. Moreover, the 
stipulation of immunity must be secured and expanded (it is 
presumed that the term of the moratorium will be increased from 
3 to 5-7 years) in the changes which are being introduced into 
the law on foreign investments.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Sanko and Ruslan Sakirov: "Davydov </F>
Proposes Benefits for Investors; Duma Assumes Strict but 
Constructive Position"] 
  [Text] The visit of Minister of Foreign Economic Relations 
Oleg Davydov to Spain, Morocco and Great Britain has been 
concluded. 
  In Spain, Oleg Davydov was a member of the delegation 
accompanying Boris Yeltsin during his official visit, and in 
Morocco he took part as an Russian observer in the concluding 
meeting of the Uruguay round of the negotiations within the 
framework of GATT [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]. In 
Great Britain he conducted talks with his English colleagues and 
business circles, reports POSTFAKTUM. 
  During his numerous meetings with foreign colleagues from 
Spain, Israel, Brazil, Uruguay, Great Britain and other 
countries, and with the business circles of Spain and Great 
Britain, Oleg Davydov called upon them to actively cooperate 
with Russia in trade as well as in economic investment. 
Recognizing the difficulties of work by foreign investors in 
Russia under conditions of a most difficult crisis, high 
inflation and, mainly, the absence of legislation to guarantee 
the effectiveness and ensure protection of foreign capital 
investments, Oleg Davydov noted that at the present time Russia 
is taking definite steps to stabilize the economy. Inflation has 
been reduced, although it has been impossible to overcome the 
inertia of economic decline. To support the continued movement 
of reforms, the government is developing proposals for creating 
beneficial conditions for foreign investors, specifically in the 
sphere of the light and food industry. 
  To expand its foreign trade, Russia, according to Oleg 
Davydov, intends to bring its foreign trade legislation in line 
with the conditions of GATT, which it intends to join in the 
near future. For this purpose, there will be a gradual 
liberalization of foreign economic ties in accordance with the 
conditions of the transitional period. On the road to GATT, a 
reduction in export duties is envisioned, with their subsequent 
total repeal in the future. The list of goods subject to quotas 
and licensing is being reduced, certification of import goods 
has been undertaken and a system of certification of export 
products is being created, and the preferential financing of 
import is being repealed. 
  Oleg Davydov stressed that Russia intends to adhere to the 
right to intellectual property in accordance with the principles 
of the Uruguay agreement. While speaking out in favor of a free 
and open Russian market, Russia will nevertheless implement a 
policy of rational protectionism, without violating GATT 
principles. 
  Noting that British enterprises are most prepared for 
cooperation with Russia, Oleg Davydov called upon them to 
consider the fact that "in the next century Russia and China 
will define world economic development," reports POSTFAKTUM. 
  Upon his return to Moscow, the minister will meet with harsh 
criticism, as expressed in the recommendations of the Duma, "On 
Foreign Economic Activity." 
  Specifically, the Committee on Economic Policy headed by 
Davydov's former chief, Glazyev, is recommending to the 
president that the 12 presidential edicts on customs benefits be 
"brought into line with the legislation" (in essence, repealed). 
To the government it is recommending that it submit to the State 
Duma a draft of a federal program for the development of export; 
step up work on repayment of debts of foreign states to Russia; 
develop measures for preventing economic crimes in the sphere of 
foreign economic activity; introduce openness into the 
registration of exporters of strategically important raw 
material goods, and improve the system of management of foreign 
economic activity in the interests of national industry. For 
this purpose, it should examine the question of uniting the 
functions of the state administration in the sphere of foreign 
economic and industrial policy within the framework of a single 
department (ministry) on the basis of the MVES [Ministry of 
Foreign Economic Relations], Goskomprom [RF State Committee on 
Industrial Policy] and subdivisions of the Ministry of Economics.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Ivanov, under rubric "Taxation of the </F>
TEK" [Fuel and Energy Complex]: "The Government Has Sped Up the 
Oil Excise Tax"] 
  [Text] The Russian government has introduced a new 
system for levying the excise tax on oil. Now the excise tax 
will be computed not in percentages of the price, but in 
absolute values (the average amount of the excise tax will be 
14,750 rubles per ton of oil). The new system was introduced by 
the decree entitled "Excise Tax on Oil Produced on the Territory 
of the Russian Federation," which was put into the official 
delivery system yesterday. 
  The levying of excise taxes on the sale of oil by the 
petroleum and gas associations was introduced as long ago as 
September 1992. At that time it was established that the excise 
tax is levied in the form of a certain fixed percentage of the 
price of the output that has been sold. Such a measure was 
completely understandable -- under the conditions of the formal 
freeing of the oil prices, the government was attempting to link 
the price increases with the budgetary proceeds (by raising the 
price, the oil producer automatically increased the payment of 
the excise tax). It is noteworthy that, unlike the excise taxes 
on ordinary commodities (for example, alcoholic beverages and 
tobacco), the Russian excise tax on oil is levied at a different 
rate for various petroleum-producing associations: for less 
effective producers, the rate of the excise tax is lower than 
for the more effective ones. Moreover, a number of associations 
operating at a low profit rate are completely freed of having to 
pay the excise tax. Thus, realistically speaking, the oil excise 
tax is, rather, a kind of variety of differentiated rent -- in 
the instructional guide concerning the levying of this excise 
tax it is stated outright that the payers of the excise tax are 
the producers who are situated in relatively better natural and 
economic conditions. 
  In September 1993 the rates for the excise tax were 
increased. However, the principle remained the same -- the 
levying of the excise tax in percentages of the price. Now, 
however, in conformity with the new decree, the principle has 
been changed --it has been decided to levy the excise tax in the 
form of a fixed amount, with its monthly indexing in conformity 
with the change of the exchange rate of the dollar to the ruble. 
For the time being, the rate of the excise tax has been 
established in the amount of 14,750 rubles per ton; 
simultaneously Minfin [Ministry of Finance] and Mintopenergo 
[Ministry of Fuel and Energy] have been instructed, within the 
period of one week, to develop new differentiated rates for the 
excise tax for individual petroleum and gas producing 
enterprises and associations. In addition to petroleum, the 
decree also pertains to an excise tax on gas --Gazprom [gas 
industry] has been instructed to develop recommendations 
concerning the possible increase in the rate for this excise 
tax, effective 1 July 1993 (for the time being, it constitutes 
15 percent). 
  One's attention is drawn by the fact that, with the existing 
level of the release prices of petroleum, the new principle for 
levying the oil excise tax does not increase, but even somewhat 
decreases, the payments made by the petroleum enterprises to the 
budget. Moreover, the state actually is rejecting the idea of 
continuing to augment the budget at the expense of the increase 
in oil prices -- inasmuch as the average amount of the payments 
becomes independent of the actual price level. 
  Thus, the new excise tax that is fixed in its absolute 
expression enables the authorities to achieve two goals at once. 
First, the government demonstrates its concern for the financial 
status of the petroleum producing enterprises, enabling them, if 
they so desire, to keep more funds at their disposal. Secondly, 
the authorities are emphasizing their disinterest in raising 
petroleum prices and are deflecting from themselves any 
accusations to the effect that the high prices are explained by 
the high excise taxes. Thus they are managing to display also 
their concern for the consumers of petroleum in the domestic 
market.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladislav Kuzmichev: "Violators Are Threatened </F>
With Unusually Harsh Sanctions; Step-by-Step Introduction of 
Currency Control Is Underway"] 
  [Text] The RF [Russian Federation] Central Bank has 
developed a working program of step-by-step introduction of 
control over the currency operations of residents and 
non-residents performing entrepreneurial activity on the 
territory of the Russian Federation. 
  The first step in the organization of currency control in 
Russia is regulated by the joint instructions of the Central 
Bank and the RF GTK [Russian Federation State Tariff Committee] 
dated 12 October 1993, No 19 (coordinated with the MVES 
[Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations] of Russia), "On the 
Procedure for Implementing Currency Control Over Receipt by the 
Russian Federation of Currency Revenues From the Export of 
Goods." The said instruction went into effect as of 1 January 
1994 in regard to the export of strategically important raw 
materials goods, and as of 1 March in regard to all nomenclature 
of export goods. 
  The system of currency control is based primarily on 
stepping 
up the role of authorized banks as agents of currency control, 
as well as of information exchange in regard to the movement of 
funds in foreign currency and foreign trade shipments between 
customs agencies, commercial banks and organs of state 
administration. 
  The only control document will be the tracking certificate, 
which is a universal document of control for all types of 
currency operations (including accounting not only for export, 
but also for the import of goods and services). 
  Information on specific shipments will be forwarded by the 
RF 
State Tariff Committee to the authorized banks which have signed 
the tracking certificate with the exporters. The authorized 
banks must fill out the cards received from the RF GTK and 
return them within the control period, using the column reserved 
for bank use to provide information on the receipt of revenues 
for the shipments indicated on the card. 
  There are also plans to create a data bank on the basis of 
the RF GTK computer center to keep track of all foreign trade 
shipments and payments. This will make it possible to verify 
information on the movement of funds and goods. Thus, it will 
become possible to identify cases where export prices have been 
reduced and import prices have been increased. 
  The adopted order of control provides for the collegial 
(MVES, TPP [Chamber of Commerce and Industry], etc.) adoption of 
decisions on controversial questions. 
  At the second stage (four-six months after start of 
implementation of control), the application of an analogous 
scheme is planned (under the so-called "mirror principle") for 
import and barter trade operations. 
  At the third stage (second half of 1994), a system of 
currency control for the export and import of services and for 
non-trade operations will be introduced. 
  Subsequent stages presuppose the implementation of control 
over operations associated with the movement of capital. 
  The introduction of a system of control is planned for 
May-June, when the computer center of the RF GTK will be able to 
provide exact information on all export shipments and currency 
receipts. 
  Strict sanctions are provided, up to the non-acceptance 
withdrawal of funds from banks whose clients are guilty of 
improper and untimely accounting for the mandatory sale of part 
of their export earnings. 
  In order to implement the currency control, the Main 
Administration of Currency Regulation and Currency Control has 
been created within the central apparatus of the RF Central 
Bank. Its primary functions are: To participate in the 
development of legislative and standard statutes and 
international agreements of Russia in the sphere of currency 
regulation and control; to license currency operations; to 
coordinate and provide methodological management of the activity 
of organizations implementing control, and to cooperate on these 
questions with the central banks of other states and 
international organizations. 
  In order to increase the effectiveness of operation of the 
agencies implementing currency control, the RF Central Bank 
proposes: To strengthen the legislative base, and specifically, 
to introduce criminal responsibility for violations 
in the currency sphere; to specify individual statutes of the 
law on currency regulation and currency control, and to adopt 
legislative statutes which permit the signing and ratification 
of international agreements on currency questions. The Bank of 
Russia, in conjunction with the RF MFA [Russian Federation 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs], has sent to the RF government a 
proposal on joining in the Strassburg "Convention on Money 
Laundering, Identification, Arrest and Confiscation of Recovered 
Funds Obtained by Criminal Means."

<F P=106> [Article by Igor Trosnikov and Yana Mirontseva under the </F>
rubric "Foreign Trade": "Leopold Rothschild's Visit to Moscow: 
The London Company Will Work in the Interests of a Moscow Bank"] 
  [Text] In March of this year, the Russian National 
Bank signed a 10-year agreement on cooperation in the Russian 
stock market with one of the structural subdivisions of the 
London banking house, N. M. Rothschild &amp; Sons Co, and the 
trust 
company, Rothschild Trust Corporation Ltd. The first joint 
project within the framework of this agreement was the issuance 
of bank bills which representatives of the London bank arrived 
to present (see yesterday's issue of KOMMERSANT). Yesterday 
representatives of the House of Rothschild and their Russian 
partners held a press conference devoted to business cooperation 
on the Russian capital market. 
  The plane which brought the English financiers to Russian 
land landed on Tuesday evening. Even earlier there were rumors 
floating about that the Englishmen had refused the services of 
the ninth directorate of the KGB and preferred to hire guards at 
one of the Israeli firms. And it was said that almost an entire 
planeload of bodyguards would fly to Moscow. However this 
information was indignantly denied by the bank's representative, 
who reported that the host side would ensure the delegation's 
safety. 
  So the business meetings of the representatives of the House 
of Rothschild began on Tuesday, and the schedule was so full 
that yesterday's press conference, despite the journalists' 
numerous questions, was brief. But even so, the KOMMERSANT 
correspondents managed to ask a question which bothers many 
people, why a powerful financial group agreed to become a 
business partner of a Moscow bank which is not the largest. 
  "We are very pleased to be working with the Russian National 
Bank," the president of the company Rothschild Trust Corporation 
Ltd., Leopold Rothschild, clearly did not want to reveal all the 
nuances of cooperation with the Russian bankers. According to 
him, the Moscow bank was the first to show initiative by 
proposing that the Rothschild group participate in issuing bills 
and the plan itself proved to be "very practical and 
interesting." 
  Leopold Rothschild emphasized that the agreement on 
cooperation in the Russian capital market was signed for 10 
years and its prospects largely depend on the success of the 
first project. Mr. Rothschild reported that his company's role 
in it is minimal. Gold will be bought with the currency 
transferred to the trust company's account in the N. M. 
Rothschild &amp; Sons Co. bank, and it will be kept in storage 
and 
sold as needed. In the opinion of KOMMERSANT experts, this plan 
has a number of indisputable advantages. Thus, the Russian 
National Bank, like most Russian banks which do not have a 
license to work with gold, thereby receives the opportunity to 
back bills with gold assets. And selling some of the gold will 
be sufficient to pay off the bills (the London company will do 
this at the bank's instruction) and settle obligations. The only 
problem is that after a year (the term of circulation of a 
bill), gold may drop in price. 
  Mr. Rothschild was asked the perfectly logical question of 
in 
what form the gold is to be bought. For example, will term 
contracts be concluded for its delivery? But the head of the 
trust company, who had obviously decided to avoid specific 
answers when possible, merely said that gold deals would be made 
"based on the principle of commercial wisdom" and "with maximum 
advantage for the Russian National Bank."

<F P=106> [Article by Nelli Shmakova: "Foreign Trade Firms' Contracts </F>
Are Being Broken: Russia Will Get Back the Debts--If the 
Departments Agree"] 
  [Text] Of all the existing methods for paying off 
credits granted by the former Soviet Union to countries of Asia, 
Africa, and Latin America, specialists consider the most 
realistic to be paying a debt with commodity deliveries. But the 
numerous changes in Russian legislation have turned this 
possibility into a utopia too. Yesterday the administration of 
the Mashinoimport VO [foreign trade organization]--one of the 
organizations which handles deliveries of commodities to pay off 
debts--received a letter from the RF Ministry of Finance which 
imposed work conditions which can be considered nothing but 
enslavement. 
  The method of paying off the indebtedness of the developing 
countries with deliveries of goods, despite all its flaws, in 
principle could at least partially eliminate the difficult 
problem of paying the debt. On the one hand, Russia was supposed 
to receive various types of raw and processed materials, 
technological equipment, and consumer goods, thereby satisfying 
the most acute needs of our consumers in this sphere. On the 
other, the budget would have received a considerable amount of 
money. This practice gave perfectly positive results until 1993, 
but then the situation changed drastically. Among other things, 
the system of subsidizing imports was abolished and the term for 
transferring money earned from selling goods to the budget was 
limited to one month (according to specialists' calculations, 
this operation can sometimes take up to 6 months). In response 
to these measures, foreign trade organizations stopped 
fulfilling contracts concluded. And this year the situation 
involving paying off credits with commodity deliveries was 
aggravated even more by the March increase in import duty rates. 
  In accordance with the new letter from the Ministry of 
Finance, the term for settling accounts with the budget is in 
fact increased--up to two months. But now firms must present the 
so-called guarantee obligation when Vneshekonombank (which, as 
everyone knows, services transactions on debt obligations of 
other countries) receives the shipping documents or a letter of 
credit is opened there. With this obligation, after two months 
time has elapsed, the associations grant the bank the right to 
deduct, on a nonacceptance basis, the shortfall from their own 
accounts, and if there are insufficient funds in the accounts, 
the organization is responsible with its fixed and working 
capital. 
  In this way, when fulfilling a state order, the associations 
are inevitably threatened with bankruptcy. The Ministry of 
Finance undoubtedly had good intentions--increasing budget 
revenue, but the conditions it proposed on deliveries do not 
suit anyone, and that, in turn, in no way helps replenish the 
Russian treasury. For example, last year as a result of stopping 
deliveries of goods to pay off credits, according to rough 
estimates the budget had a shortfall of several tens of millions 
of dollars just from the unpaid customs charges and taxes from 
trade organizations engaged in importing these types of goods. 
  As a result of the actions of departmental bureaucrats, not 
only is the fulfillment of intergovernmental agreements being 
disrupted, but the very possibility of credits issued by the 
former Soviet Union being returned is called into question.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Krylov, jurist: "Businessmen Do Not Feel </F>
Safe; Free Economic Zone `Yantar' in Kaliningrad Suffering Birth 
Pangs"] 
  [Text] Kaliningrad today is seemingly all in anticipation 
of an economic miracle. The hour is not far off when the free 
economic zone "Yantar" will announce itself in full voice. 
Already today there has been a notable revitalization of 
entrepreneurial activity in the city and the oblast. 
Representatives of the business world from all of Europe have 
become frequent visitors here. Blocks of bank offices, financial 
institutions, customs services and trade representations will 
spring up in the oblast center. 
  However, for a full assurance of tomorrow, the newly 
emerging 
Russian "gold coast" needs one other indispensable condition: 
Stability, the guarantee of effective and safe activity of 
businessmen, industrialists and merchants. And who, if not the 
law enforcement agencies together with the administration, must 
provide them? 
  The matter, of course, is not a simple one, and quite 
troublesome. Yet otherwise, the positive undertaking in 
development of an international economic and trade center in the 
west of Russia may become just the opposite--a sort of 
provincial Klondike, where there is a constant re-drawing of the 
zones of influence by shadow groupings, money laundering and 
racketeering, and where justice is meted out by people who are 
subservient to and dear to the hearts of those who are strong in 
this world. So as not to make unsubstantiated statements, let me 
cite just one example from the life of present-day Kaliningrad. 
  At the start of 1994, the local newspapers illuminated in 
detail the course of the judicial proceedings in the case of the 
joint Latvian-Russian-Argentinian enterprise "Silar 
International." Vladimir Shershakov, the general director of the 
firm, and Petr Saranchuk, the director of its Moscow branch, 
were sentenced by the court of Baltiyskiy Rayon in Kaliningrad 
to four years and three years two months, respectively, in a 
strict regimen correctional-labor colony, with confiscation of 
property. The convicted men were incriminated in attempted 
contraband and document forgery. 
  The scandalous episode began in the winter of 1993, when 
fuel 
belonging to "Silar" which had been prepared for shipment to 
fishing sites was suddenly detained by order of B. Livenkov, 
deputy chief of administration of the oblast MB [Ministry of 
Security]. Even before the trial, 10,000 tonnes of diesel fuel 
were handed over "for storage" to the Pioneer Base of the 
Kaliningrad Ocean Fishing Fleet. Then, in investigative 
language, this "material evidence" mysteriously disappeared. 
Together, as it later became clear, with the many thousands of 
dollars in profits from its sale. The accused parties, headed by 
Mr. Shershakov, patiently waited for proof of their guilt to be 
presented. The version of "attempted contraband" clearly did not 
hold water, and the MB investigators began looking for 
compromise throughout all the activity of the enterprise. For 
them it was now a question of saving face, since, with the aid 
of TV and the local newspapers, it had been reported to 
Kaliningrad residents ahead of time (before the trial!) that the 
activity of the contrabandists had been curtailed and that the 
10,000 tonnes of diesel fuel had been returned to the homeland. 
  During this period, the associates of one of the rayon 
sections of the Kaliningrad militia filed a criminal case 
against the Pioneer fishing fleet base for unlawful sale of fuel 
which did not belong to them. It seemed that a further 
investigation of the cases should be conducted jointly, uniting 
them into one. However, the MB administration rejected this 
proposal. Moreover, the transport procurator's office, to which 
the case had been handed over, had already begun its processing. 
  Today, after the proceedings, it is not surprising that the 
accused persons never admitted their guilt and insisted that the 
case against them had been fabricated. At the same time, the 
representatives for the defense--both Moscow and Kaliningrad 
lawyers--synonymously called the trial "lawlessness in regard to 
progressive and law-abiding enterprise," and intend to fight for 
a review of the ruling in the oblast court, and if necessary 
even in the Supreme Court. 
  Work with problems of entrepreneurship and private business, 
for example, demands additional knowledge and special training 
on the part of the representatives of the law enforcement 
agencies. 
  In the economic zone which is being created, under 
conditions 
of market relations Kaliningrad jurists are already today 
encountering numerous problems. The goods traffic and turnover 
of capital is increasing many times over. Aside from the 
national code of laws, it is necessary to have an excellent 
knowledge of international law and its peculiarities in one or 
another partner country. 
  The judicial proceedings surrounding "Silar International," 
in my opinion, are a good illustration of what we have said. 
  If you, for example, do not have a sufficiently good grasp 
of 
the questions of formulating agreements between branches, or 
doubt the correctness of preparation of the customs documents, 
what will you do? That is right, you will call in experts. It is 
a pity that Judge Tamara Dolinskaya thought differently, and 
because of this for two months the defense was not able to have 
even one (!) economic expert evaluation with the participation 
of independent specialists. 
  We might add that an elementary commercial analysis, an 
expert evaluation, were it to be conducted, would immediately 
show that the efforts on organization of the fishing trade, 
including the provision of vessels with fuel, is several times 
more economically expedient than the resale of this fuel. And 
furthermore, a one-time deal cannot be more attractive to 
businessmen than a long-term profitable venture. (For 
comparison: The resale of the fuel could have brought "Silara" 
$600,000 in profits, while the fishing could have brought it 
over $3.5 million).
