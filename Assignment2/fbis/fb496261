<F P=106> [Article by Igor Volosov, candidate of economic sciences and </F>
sector head at Russian Institute of Strategic Studies: 
"Russia-United States: Partners or Rivals?"] 
  [Text] One of the distinctive features of 
Russian-U.S. economic relations at this time is their 
development under qualitatively new military-political and 
economic conditions, which are having a decisive effect on the 
interaction of the two states. 
  The end of the "cold war" minimized the importance of 
military potential as a factor determining a country's position 
in the international arena and assigned priority to indicators 
of economic, scientific-technical, and financial strength. As a 
result, Russia, which had been the United States' equal as a 
leader in world development and which had essentially determined 
the course of this development in conjunction with the United 
States, turned into one of the large but economically weak 
states with claims to only a "secondary role." 
  The collapse of the USSR, the severe economic crisis in 
Russia, and the uncertainty of emergence from it made our state 
even more vulnerable in world politics and international 
economic relations. Members of the U.S. military-political, 
business, and scientific communities, however, know that Russia 
still has significant economic and scientific-technical 
potential in addition to nuclear strength and political 
influence. If the reforms are successful, this could turn it 
into one of the United States' principal competitors in the 
international arena and the world market, particularly in 
several advanced fields. This is one of the main factors 
motivating the United States to become actively involved in the 
reform of the Russian economy according to guidelines convenient 
for the United States. 
<H5>  Freedom of Choice? </H5>
  One of the main elements of the present U.S. policy on 
Russia 
is the encouragement of the Russian Government to choose 
patterns of economic reform meeting the long-term economic and 
political interests of the West. In this context, the United 
States was instrumental in imposing the IMF stabilization 
program on Russia. This program has obvious foreign economic 
goals in addition to internal economic objectives. The 
experience of other states with comparable programs proves that 
their main results are "favorable" economic conditions for the 
servicing of foreign debts and the rapid growth of energy and 
raw material exports, which have always been convenient for the 
United States and the other leading nations that are the largest 
creditors and consumers of fuel and raw materials. 
  The results of Russian economic development since 1992 prove 
conclusively that the United States and other leading Western 
nations managed to create the necessary conditions for Russia's 
integration in the world economy as a country specializing in 
the export of fuel and raw materials and of finished goods 
requiring only the slightest processing. Serious negative 
tendencies of a structural nature, resulting from the IMF 
stabilization program, are already apparent in the Russian 
national economy. One of these tendencies is the "weight gain" 
of the Russian economy, in which the processing industries' 
share of physical production had already decreased to 64.5 
percent in the first half of 1993 in comparison to 65.6 percent 
in 1992 and 67.9 percent in 1991. This was accompanied by the 
noticeable growth of the fuel and raw material sector, which 
accounted for 25 percent of physical production in 1993 in 
comparison to 11.3 percent in 1991. 
  Besides this, the accelerated decline of industrial 
production as a result of the "shock therapy" also made 
additional fuel and raw materials available for export, which 
more than compensated for the reduction of output in various 
industries. When aluminum production in Russia decreased by 8 
percent in 1990-1993, for example, its domestic consumption was 
reduced by a factor of almost 2.2, which allowed for a more than 
3.7-fold increase in exports of this metal. Exports of crude oil 
from Russia increased by more than 20 percent just in 1993, in 
spite of the 6-percent reduction in output. As a result, exports 
of fuel and raw materials already exceed 80 percent of the 
Russian total. 
  The expansion of Russian exports of fuel and raw materials 
to 
the world market is in the long-term and short-term interests of 
the United States and other developed Western countries. Russian 
shipments in recent years were the main factor destabilizing 
these markets and lowering prices. The index of world prices of 
nonferrous metals, for example, had reached its lowest level in 
the last eight years by the end of 1993--40 percent below the 
1990 indicator. Comparable tendencies were apparent in the 
markets for energy resources. These price dynamics are extremely 
convenient for the industrially developed countries, stimulating 
their economies and helping them surmount economic difficulties 
of a cyclical nature. 
<H5>  Welcome, or Off-Limits to Outsiders </H5>
  The United States' attempts to accomplish the Russian 
economy's integration in the world economy as a fuel and raw 
material appendage of the industrially developed nations are 
also evident from the development of trade and economic 
relations between the two countries. Raw materials are clearly 
prevalent, for example, in Russian exports to the United States: 
The overwhelming majority of export shipments to the American 
market consist of nonferrous metals (aluminum, nickel, zinc, 
copper, and others), metals of the platinum group, silver and 
precious stones, petroleum and petroleum products, inorganic 
chemicals, and fertilizers. Russian fuel and raw materials have 
been of the greatest interest to American private businessmen, 
who invested around 400 million dollars in Russia in 1993. It is 
no coincidence that the biggest project will entail a consortium 
of U.S. oil and gas companies investing a total of 3.4 billion 
dollars in the exploration and development of new oil and gas 
deposits in West Siberia and on the shelf of Sakhalin Island. 
  All of this has been accompanied by U.S. attempts to crowd 
Russian exporters out of traditional markets and to keep Russia 
out of the world markets in which it could compete, particularly 
the markets for high-tech goods. 
  In the last seven years Russia's share of world arms exports 
decreased from 38 to 17 percent, while the United States managed 
to increase its share from 30 to 58 percent. In the last two 
years alone, the United States almost doubled its own arms 
exports. Meanwhile, the United States, which has a monopoly in 
the world market for space services, is constantly spreading 
rumors about Russian dumping in this field, although this 
industry is no longer subsidized by the state in Russia, and the 
low overhead costs of production are due to effective technology 
and cheap manpower. A similar situation is taking shape in the 
world uranium market, where Russian shipments still account for 
only 4 percent of the total, although the Russian output 
represents around 25 percent of the world total. 
  Furthermore, the United States is in no hurry to make any 
cardinal improvements in the trade and economic status of 
Russian goods. Most-favored-nation status in trade was extended 
to Russia for only one year, the Jackson-Vanik amendment is 
still in effect, and anti-monopoly legislation is still being 
applied vigorously to Russian goods. 
  Integration processes on the North American continent are 
having an increasing effect on the development of foreign 
economic relations between the two countries. The more active 
recent steps to form a North American free trade zone (NAFTA) 
created even more difficulties for Russian goods in American 
markets. The sale of Russian motor vehicles in the United States 
with minimal customs duties, for example, would require 
two-thirds of the components to be produced in the NAFTA states. 
There are even more serious restrictions on textiles. The 
exporter of Russian linen fabrics to the United States has to 
prove that the goods have no analogues in the North American 
countries. The perceptible relaxation of CoCom [Coordinating 
Committee for Multilateral Export Control] controls on exports 
of several high-technology goods to Russia was dictated 
primarily by competition in the world market. The findings of a 
study by the U.S. Department of Commerce, in particular, 
indicated that existing restrictions were ineffective because 
high-power computers could be obtained in the world market in 
circumvention of all controls. According to statements by 
American officials, the liberalization of computer exports will 
enhance the competitiveness of American companies substantially 
without hurting U.S. national security. 
  In spite of Russia's increasingly severe socioeconomic 
difficulties, most of the West's financial aid is being extended 
in the form of comparatively expensive credits from 
international financial institutions, and not in the form of the 
nonrefundable aid that was extended to, for example, Japan and 
Germany during their periods of economic reform in the 1940s and 
1950s. This provides more evidence that the West has no 
intention, or even the potential, to offer Russia sweeping 
economic assistance comparable to the famous Marshall Plan (the 
American aid in the restoration of the postwar economy of 
Western Europe), which would amount to 60-75 billion dollars in 
today's prices. 
<H5>  The `Triangle' Will Not Become a `Square' </H5>
  This approach to the Russian reforms is a reflection of the 
way in which the United States and other Western powers see the 
new balance of power in the world economy and international 
relations after the end of the "cold war." At present there is 
an obvious tendency toward more vigorous efforts by the leading 
Western countries to set up an effective system for the 
collective regulation of world economic processes and 
international relations, which should be based on the three 
"poles" of economic strength--the United States, the European 
Union, and Japan, which account for around two-thirds of the 
world GDP. As Director F. Bergsten of the distinguished 
Institute of the World Economy remarked in this context, the 
"big three" should begin acting like an unofficial managing 
committee of the world economy. Under these conditions, Russia's 
many attempts to become an equal member of the group of leading 
Western countries for the collective resolution of global 
problems will not win any support. We must not forget that the 
harsh laws of competition were always at work in the world 
economy and international politics, and there was always the 
determination to secure national interests, frequently by 
infringing the national interests of others....

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Titov and Nadezhda Yakhotina: "Americans </F>
Preferred Reasonable Prices of Novosibirsk Plants"] 
  [Text] The management of one of the largest 
finance-industrial groups in the USA, the Harbor Group, is 
studying the possibility of placing a number of large orders 
with conversion enterprises in Russia. A press conference was 
held yesterday at the American business center in Novosibirsk, 
regarding the April visit by Harbor Group President Sam Fox to 
Moscow, Novosibirsk, Saratov and Kazan. 
  The Harbor Group unites 50 enterprises in the United States 
and Europe which produce goods made of metal, rubber, and 
plastic, as well as compressors, medical equipment, medicines 
and precision production parts. It is a supplier of components 
for IBM, Apple, Ford, Chrysler and General Motors. It provides 
over 50 percent of the medical equipment to all the hospitals in 
the United States. Its annual turnover is $1.5 billion. 
  As the director of the American business center in 
Novosibirsk, Robert Ekkart, reported at the press conference, at 
the present time the Harbor Group has undertaken the development 
of 10 production programs which will be proposed for 
consideration to Russian plants in May of this year. Another 
visit by Harbor Group representatives to Novosibirsk is planned 
for that time. In the course of this visit, specific programs 
and conditions of cooperation will be discussed, and 
technologies and production blueprints will be handed over so 
that the enterprises may evaluate their own capacities. 
  The conversion enterprises of Moscow, Saratov, Kazan and 
Novosibirsk have evoked the greatest interest of the Harbor 
Group. The signing of a number of agreements with the Saratov 
Aviation Plant, the Novosibirsk production association "Sever," 
the Berd Electromechanical Plant and the "Sibtekhstilmash" plant 
is expected in the near future. The Harbor Group intends to 
place orders with these enterprises for the production of parts 
and components for computers in batches of from 10,000 to 1 
million units. The value of these will comprise from $0.2 to 
$600, and the overall volume of the orders may comprise $20 
million. 
  Mr. Ekkart noted that, considering the high technological 
level of the Novosibirsk conversion enterprises and the presence 
of high class specialists, the Harbor Group considers the prices 
on the production of these enterprises to be satisfactory. In 
his words, in Moscow the representatives of the Harbor Group 
"silently walked out of the plant which they were considering, 
because of the absurdly inflated prices on its products." 
  The initial basis for serious interest by the Harbor Group 
in 
the enterprises of Novosibirsk was the cooperation with the 
Institute of Hydrodynamics of the Russian Academy of Sciences 
Siberian Department in the sphere of developing pumping 
equipment. Aside from expressing interest in participating in 
production projects with Novosibirsk enterprises, the firm is 
also exhibiting great interest in scientific-research 
cooperation. 
  Nevertheless, we should hardly expect any large investments 
by the Harbor Group in Russia in the very near future. This fact 
was confirmed by Mr. Fox in his comment to the effect that at 
the present time the Russian conversion enterprises are 
experiencing the need not for investments, but for loading their 
production capacities and creating conditions for work.

<F P=106> [Article by Oleg Davydov: "Great Prospects for </F>
British-Russian Cooperation"] 
  [Text] Trade volume between Russia and Great Britain 
was $3.7 billion in 1993, remaining at roughly the same level as 
in previous years. Products in the raw materials group continued 
to predominate in Russian exports, including diamonds and 
precious metals, oil and petroleum products, other metals and 
wood products. Generally speaking, based on figures for January 
1994 one may conclude that there has been an upturn in 
Russian-British trade, as trade increased by a factor of two in 
comparison to January 1993, with growth in both Russian and 
British shipments. Russia and Great Britain are currently 
negotiating on ways of dealing with the former USSR's 
indebtedness based on the terms of the Club of Paris agreement. 
This will help resolve one of the most sensitive issues in the 
two countries' economic relations: the uninsured commercial 
debts of organizations in the former USSR to British companies, 
which total approximately $250 million. 
  * * * 
  A few days ago Oleg Davydov, Russia's minister of foreign 
economic relations, paid an official visit to Great Britain. 
  He met with members of the Cabinet of Ministers, including 
minister of trade Needham, minister of energy Eggar, and 
minister of state Goodlad. Talks were held with heads of the GPT 
Company regarding a plan to modernize Moscow's telephone 
network, a plan referred to as Comstar. The Russian minister 
visited the sorting rooms of the DeBeers Company, met with the 
head of the British Bankers' Association, and participated in a 
roundtable discussion with the Confederation of British Industry. 
  Before departing from London for Montreux (Switzerland) to 
attend a conference on trading in energy sources, Oleg Davydov 
shared his impressions of his visit with a DELOVOY MIR 
correspondent and talked about the most pressing problems of a 
foreign economic nature facing Russia. 
  * * * 
  [Davydov] The first thing I should note is that British 
business people are better prepared to expand their cooperation 
with Russia than are their colleagues in other countries. They 
have a fairly large amount of experience working with our 
organizations. However, as you are aware, opportunities are 
determined by the level of participation in cooperation. You 
know that we have had a period of recession here, with declining 
output. Currently Great Britain is emerging from a period of 
decline, and soon it will start expanding its industrial 
production volume; the sales market which could stimulate 
economic development right now is quite well defined. It is 
Russia and, of course, China. It appears that these are going to 
define economic development. Those markets' capacity is very 
large. It is only natural that the West is showing increasing 
interest in those countries, with a view toward starting up 
operations in those markets, or at least "staking a claim" in 
this new "Klondike." Therefore our talks and meetings in Great 
Britain were very serious. 
  This concerns us greatly. And the second thing that is 
causing us some worry is that foreign capital is primarily 
involved in the energy sector. Everybody is interested in oil 
and gas production or refining. Yet the largest market is in the 
consumer sectors, i.e. food industry and light industry. Thus 
far foreign investment in those businesses has been very slight. 
That is why we are currently considering ways of making the 
terms of foreign investment in that sector of the economy even 
more favorable. Proposals in this regard are being prepared by 
the government and will be submitted to the State Duma for 
discussion. 
  Generally speaking, in regard to the reason why foreign 
investors are still holding back one should note their 
insufficient understanding of the nature of the economic reforms 
being implemented in Russia. Naturally the influx of investment 
is hampered by the high rate of inflation, the weak banking 
system and insufficient tax breaks for investors during the 
period of initial capital recoupment. 
  Direct investments by British partners have also been very 
limited thus far. They mainly go into the energy sector, the 
textile industry, communications and a few other areas. British 
officials and businessmen have learned, "firsthand," so to 
speak, that a presidential edict entitled "On Improvement of 
Work With Foreign Investments" has been issued for the purpose 
of improving the investment climate for foreign entrepreneurs. 
They have expressed an interest in the fact that newly-created 
normative acts will not apply for three years to enterprises 
that exist at the time those acts are enacted, or to plans for 
the development of security-based forms of attracting foreign 
capital and the possibility of foreign investors' participation 
in privatization of Russian enterprises. The English were keenly 
interested in the news that the government is currently 
considering a new program to bring foreign capital into the 
process of defense plant conversion in Russia. The priority 
sectors singled out in this regard are manufacturing of civil 
aviation equipment, maritime and river transportation, equipment 
for the fuels-and-energy complex, new communications technology 
and equipment for agriculture and the food industry. 
  The amount of foreign investment in those areas could reach 
$4 billion by 1995 and as much as $20 billion by 2000. 
  The West, including Great Britain, has shown great interest 
in the terms of operation for foreign banks and the conducting 
of financial operations in Russia. At this point our banks are 
still very weak. During the transition period it will be 
virtually impossible to ensure them the ability to compete 
successfully at the international level. Therefore we have 
offered 12 percent of the market to our partners and we feel 
that as of the present time that is as far as Russia is prepared 
to go. As reforms progress and banking structures grow stronger 
we will expand foreign banks' access to the Russian market. 
  Beginning in the middle of this year a favorable climate 
will 
be created for foreign investors, including British ones, due to 
a transition to the principle of selling shares in Russian 
enterprises through stock exchanges. That means that Russia is 
opening up to Western capital the stage of direct partnership in 
restructuring of the Russian economy.

<F P=106> [Interview with Oleg Davydov, minister of foreign economic </F>
relations, by Andrey Avdoshin in Madrid; date not given: "How To 
Revive Trade and Economic Relations With Spain"] 
  [Text] The economic element was an important topic of 
discussion during RF President Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin's 
official visit to Spain. The details of the talks on ways of 
stimulating trade and economic relations between the two 
countries were discussed by a direct participant in the talks, 
Minister of Foreign Economic Relations Oleg Davydov, at the 
request of a DELOVOY MIR correspondent. 
  [Davydov] The first thing we ascertained during our 
conversations with Spanish colleagues and businessmen was the 
obvious lack of correspondence between our economic relations 
and the level of political relations and productive potential of 
Russia and Spain. This is particularly true of trade and 
investments, as well as the presence of Spanish business in our 
market. 
  I must admit that we also had problems with the Spanish 
businessmen's pessimistic opinion of current processes in the 
Russian economy. They are still temporizing, in the belief that 
the right time for them to enter our market has not arrived yet, 
preferring to allow such countries as the United States and 
Germany, with their colossal financial potential, to take all of 
the risks at this time. 
  We feel, on the contrary, that temporizing could lead to the 
loss of the whole Russian market, which is undergoing spirited 
development. Furthermore, this process will be stepped up after 
1 July this year, when voucher privatization comes to an end and 
privatization for money begins. This would be a convenient time 
for the Spanish to find their own niches in our economy for the 
best use of their experience and technology. 
  We were particularly impressed by the high standards of the 
production, processing, shipment, storage, and packaging of 
agricultural products in Spain. It was no coincidence that the 
Russian president visited one of the country's largest meat 
processing enterprises--Campofrio, which is also operating 
successfully in Moscow--on his last day in Madrid. 
  Spanish businessmen do not know enough about the situation 
in 
our currency market either, including the domestic 
convertibility of the ruble. 
  In view of all this, the Russian side invited Spain's 
Minister of Commerce and Tourism Javier Gomez-Navarro to visit 
our country with a group of businessmen for the purpose of 
taking a closer look at the situation and establishing business 
contacts. The main advice we tried to give the Spanish was this: 
"Do not get held up at the starting gate; start moving 
vigorously." Furthermore, they have to remember that Russian 
imports are being reduced: They decreased by 27 percent last 
year, and this tendency will continue. Today the state has 
already stopped all centralized imports: It is not buying 
anything. Of course, centralized exports still exist and 
represent around 20 percent of the total volume, but these will 
also be phased out by 1995. The state will be occupied solely in 
establishing favorable conditions for the development of 
export-import operations and helping domestic enterprises 
compete for sales markets. 
  [Avdoshin] What was your impression of B. Yeltsin's meeting 
with the Spanish businessmen? 
  [Davydov] The president's speech was quite brilliant, it 
seems to me, and all of the people present at the meeting were 
pleasantly surprised, first of all, by his awareness of the 
whole range of problems in Russian-Spanish trade and economic 
relations and, second, by his candor. He frankly discussed the 
difficulties we are experiencing, but nevertheless advised the 
Spanish to work more vigorously in our market. 
  [Avdoshin] What kind of agreements were concluded on new 
Spanish credits for Russia? Reports in the local press have been 
ambiguous, particularly with regard to specific figures and 
amounts.... 
  [Davydov] The whole thing is quite simple: The Spanish will 
extend 100 million dollars for the development of mutual trade 
and are willing to extend another 100 million through EC 
channels for various programs of aid to Russia and 425 million 
for the promotion of direct private Spanish investments in our 
country. These funds will be extended to private businessmen 
with specific promising projects. 
  [Avdoshin] The press has also had much to say about our debt 
to Spain, which is supposed to be impeding the intensification 
of bilateral economic relations.... 
  [Davydov] We said we would pay it off (it amounts to 900 
million dollars) within the confines of the clubs of Paris and 
London. This is not a problem. Last year we fulfilled all of our 
obligations in the Club of Paris and we are fully determined to 
do the same this year. State budget allocations for this purpose 
amount to around 2 billion dollars. 
  [Avdoshin] What was your personal impression of your 
contacts 
with Spanish businessmen? How would you assess the results? 
  [Davydov] The results were indisputably positive. I have 
rarely encountered this kind of sincerity and eagerness to 
establish relations. Furthermore, all of this is occurring at a 
time when Spain has serious economic difficulties of its own! 
  [Avdoshin] In his speech the president said that measures 
would be taken soon to establish more favorable conditions for 
foreign investments in Russia. What did he mean? 
  [Davydov] This is envisaged in the amendment to the Law on 
Foreign Investment in Russia that was submitted to the State 
Duma for consideration. One of its provisions stipulates that 
foreign companies investing in Russia will be exempt from profit 
taxes for the whole period of investment recoupment and will 
then be taxed at the national rate. If we do this, the 
investment climate is certain to improve dramatically. The 
government feels that this would be advisable.

<H5>  Russian-Greek Trade Volume (Based on Information From the </H5>
Greek Embassy in Russia) 
  Greek exports to Russia: $125 million in 1992 and $175 
million in 1993 (an increase of 40 percent). The export 
structure is dominated by agricultural products, refined 
petroleum products, bauxite and other ores, and consumer goods. 
  Russian exports to Greece: $437 million in 1992 and $479 
million in 1993 (an increase of 9.6 percent). The export 
structure is dominated by oil, non-ferrous metals and motor 
vehicles. 
  Russia's share of Greek exports was 1.3 percent in 1993, and 
1.9 percent of its imports. 
  There are already 70 large and 150 medium-sized and small 
Greek firms in Moscow. Their numbers are growing. A total of 20 
Russian-Greek joint ventures have been established in Greece 
(primarily in Piraeus).

  At the end of next week Brussels will witness the final and 
decisive round of Russia's talks with the European Union 
regarding partnership and cooperation. In connection with this 
Moscow attaches particular importance to the position taken by 
Athens, current chairman of the Union. But there appears to be 
no reason for concern: Greece has already announced its 
intention to facilitate the signing of an agreement without 
delay. Furthermore, Athens has decided to set an example and 
demonstrate that mutually advantageous cooperation with Russia 
is quite possible. Toward that end a business club has been 
established at the Greek Embassy in Moscow, with its official 
opening held yesterday. 
  The Greeks make no secret of the fact that the signing of a 
cooperation agreement between the European Union and Russia 
would be a worthy prize for Greece's six-month chairmanship of 
the Union. And Greece's new ambassador to Moscow, Kiryakos 
Rodusakis, has from the very first days following his arrival a 
few months ago devoted particular attention to the establishment 
of contacts between business people in the two countries. He 
proposed establishing a business club in order to help his 
countrymen who are willing to take the risk of plunging into the 
tumultuous Russian market. That initiative garnered the support 
of approximately 20 Greek companies that have been operating in 
Russia for several years and have offices in Moscow. The time 
lag between words and actions proved short, and last Thursday 
the Greek Embassy was the scene of an official presentation of 
the business club (with the club temporarily headquartered in 
the embassy's commercial section). It was there that Mr. 
Rodusakis announced his intention to get Russian entrepreneurs 
who have or would like to have business ties with Greece 
involved in the club as well. 
  According to the Greek ambassador, the business club's 
primary function is to fill the information vacuum that has thus 
far hampered expansion of economic relations between the two 
countries. Toward that end the decision was made to establish 
close cooperation both with the Russian authorities and with 
commercial structures. In addition, the club intends to provide 
information about prospects for business in various sectors of 
the economy. Priority will be given to those sectors in which 
the Greeks have considerable experience and strong traditions: 
trade, shipping, tourism, banking, insurance, construction, 
communications and the food industry. The club will place 
particular emphasis on familiarizing Greek businessmen with 
regions both in Russia (Siberia and the Volga region) and in the 
rest of the CIS (the Crimea, the Caucasus, Kazakhstan and 
Uzbekistan) where the Greek diaspora is represented. 
  For this summer the club has plans to sponsor the first 
international Greco-Russian congress on cooperation in Moscow, 
and also to open a joint business center in Russia's capital.

"Neighbors": "Russia To Continue the Electrification of Vietnam: 
Russian and Vietnamese Heavy Industries Will Become Friends"] 
  [Text] The Russian Federation Committee on Machine Building 
and the Vietnamese Ministry of Heavy Industry are preparing 
counterproposals on cooperation between enterprises in the two 
countries in the field of machinery and equipment manufacture, 
an agreement regarding which will be signed on 6 June 1994 
(during a visit to Moscow by Vietnamese prime minister Vo Van 
Kiet). An ADS correspondent learned this from Anatoliy Ogurtsov, 
chairman of the Russian Committee on Machine Building, who 
visited Hanoi as part of a government delegation headed by 
vice-premier Yuriy Yarov. Between 12 April and 15 April the 
delegation held talks within the framework of the 
intergovernmental Russian-Vietnamese commission on economic, 
trade-related and scientific-technical cooperation. 
  During a meeting with Tran Lum, Vietnam's minister of heavy 
industries, said Anatoliy Ogurtsov, the Vietnamese expressed 
their intention to renew the partnership between machine 
builders in the two countries, particularly with regard to the 
manufacture of electric machines with a capacity of 10-50 
kilowatts and 5,000 kilowatts for the micro-hydroelectric power 
plants and small hydroelectric plants that Vietnam is preparing 
to build in inaccessible areas in the northern part of the 
country. Since it was with assistance from the former USSR that 
Vietnam built virtually all its large-scale energy facilities, 
including seven units of the Hoa Binh Hydroelectric Power 
Station, with a capacity of 1.92 gigawatts, according to Mr. 
Ogurtsov it is like God himself is telling Russian machine 
builders to continue their partnership with their Vietnamese 
colleagues in the field of electrification. Particularly since 
the Central Boiler and Turbine Institute Scientific Production 
Association, the Leningrad Metals Plant Joint-Stock Company and 
the Syzran Turbine Plant are already manufacturing a series of 
small-scale hydroelectric units developed by them, units that 
are already operating successfully in the republics of the 
Northern Caucasus, Tajikistan and Kirghizia. 
  Vietnamese machine builders have also indicated an interest 
in the joint manufacture of certain types of metalworking 
machinery with computer numerical control, as well as assembly 
of the Vladimir Tractor Plant's DT-50 and DT-52 wheeled 
tractors, the Volgograd Tractor Plant's DT-75 caterpillar tread 
tractors and KamAZ vehicles at plants in Vietnam. Also announced 
was a shipment of sheet metal-bending presses manufactured by 
Tyazhpressmash Joint-Stock Company (Ryazan) and the Kolomna 
Heavy Machine Tool Plant Production Association. According to 
Mr. Ogurtsov, all these proposals by Vietnam are presently under 
consideration, and by the time of the May arrival in Moscow of 
Vietnam's minister of heavy industries Tran Lum the forms of 
cooperation between machine building enterprises in the two 
countries will have been worked out, as well as schedules and 
prices for shipments in both directions.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hikmet Cetin, minister of foreign affairs of </F>
Turkey, by Anatoliy Koritskiy; place and date not given: "To 
Cooperate in the Name of Peace"] 
  [Text] [Koritskiy] A priority area of Turkey's foreign 
policy are the Turkic-speaking republics of the former USSR. 
Russia also maintains its interests there. How do you, Minister, 
evaluate the possibility of joint, concerted action on the part 
of Moscow and Ankara in this region which might correspond to 
the interests of the peoples living there? 
  [Cetin] I would like to emphasize first of all that Russia 
is 
for us an important neighbor. Both Russia and Turkey undoubtedly 
perform a key role in this region, primarily from the viewpoint 
of the preservation of peace there. It is for this reason that 
our countries should cooperate. I believe that this is precisely 
how matters stand there at the present time and I believe that 
this will be the case in the future also. 
  There has recently been a number of meetings of the leaders 
of our countries, my meetings with Mr. Andrey Kozyrev in Moscow 
and Ankara included. Our president, Suleyman Demirel, and, 
subsequently, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller also paid official 
visits to Moscow, during which negotiations were conducted with 
President Boris Yeltsin. In the course of these meetings, talks, 
and negotiations we discussed our policy in respect to the newly 
sovereign Turkic republics. We were persuaded that Russia, like 
Turkey also, is interested in these republics being independent 
and truly sovereign. For my part, I would like to mention 
especially that Turkey has no intention of governing them. They 
will do this themselves. But Russia and Turkey could play an 
important part in their upswing. And we have the opportunity to 
cooperate with Russia here. 
  Truly, aside from the long-standing traditional ties to 
Russia, these republics have things in common that link them 
with Turkey also: language and cultural, historical, and 
religious traditions. For this reason we are trying to make our 
contribution to their development also. But in performing this 
duty of ours we are by no means competing in the region with 
Russia. We are cooperating with Russia. And the events taking 
place there confirm that for these countries' independence and 
their economic development and political stability cooperation 
with Russia is vitally necessary. 
  [Koritskiy] Quite recently even voices were being heard in 
Turkey quite often and at quite a high level about the "threat 
from the north." Do you, Minister, perceive this threat today? 
  [Cetin] I see no threat emanating for Turkey from the north. 
There can be no question of such a threat at the present time. 
An analysis of the events occurring in the Caucasus, the Near 
East, the Balkans, and in other regions shows that there is an 
insistent need for the close cooperation of Turkey and Russia. 
In my view, our relations with Russia are distinguished by 
mutual understanding. If we look at the entire 500-year history 
of Russo-Turkish relations, it may be seen that there have been 
wars between us, that there have been times of quite cool 
relations. But the periods of mutual understanding and good 
cooperation have lasted far longer. The times of the cold war 
are now ended. This affords extensive opportunities for Russia 
and Turkey in respect to a unification of efforts in the 
struggle for peace and stability both in the region and 
throughout the world. I am convinced that we have a chance to 
considerably increase the efficiency of our trade and economic 
relations also. 
  [Koritskiy] Esteemed Minister, the process of change on the 
European continent has begun with a search for ways toward a 
common nonbloc Europe. The military opposition on the continent 
has today become a thing of the past. There is no Warsaw Pact. 
NATO should leave the stage also, it would seem. Instead, we are 
observing the opposite. The question of the expansion of NATO 
has gradually switched from the sphere of discussion to a 
practical plane. How do you assess this problem? 
  [Cetin] NATO was created as a defensive alliance. But the 
threat against which this organization was to have defended us 
has gone, it no longer exists. The cardinal changes that have 
occurred indicate that NATO needs a new role, which it could 
perform in a strengthening of peace and stability in the world. 
For a definition of this role it is essential to restructure, 
and we believe that NATO could be doing this very soon. 
  [Koritskiy] Esteemed Minister, how do you evaluate the 
prospects of the joint actions of Russia and Turkey to settle 
the conflicts surrounding Nagornyy Karabakh and on the 
Afghan-Tajik border? There is, after all, a real danger of their 
internationalization. 
  [Cetin] Armenia's armed forces occupy approximately 20 
percent of Azerbaijani territory. I believe that their actions 
are not in the least bit different from Iraq's aggression when 
it occupied Kuwait. Armenia is ignoring the UN Security Council 
and CSCE decisions on this issue. You are right in saying that 
there is a danger of internationalization of the conflict. I am 
convinced that the joint efforts of all countries are needed. 
The pooling of the efforts of Russia and Turkey would produce 
certain results. This is shown even by the difficult process of 
a settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. 
  As far as Afghanistan and Tajikistan are concerned, I 
consider that the presence and active operations of 
representatives of the CSCE are essential here. The directed 
intervention of the UN Security Council would be useful also. 
The conflict on the Afghan-Tajik border affects the interests of 
Turkey also. Turkey is prepared to join its efforts with those 
of Russia to avert a negative development of events here. I am 
convinced that it is in this way that we could defend and 
preserve peace and stability in the region.

<F P=106> [Article by Leonid Alekseevich Safonov, director of Russian </F>
MFA Africa Department: "Russian Priorities in Africa"] 
  [Excerpts] Africa today, like the "Third World" as a whole, 
with its profound socio-economic, national-ethnic and military 
problems, is becoming one of the prime sources of global and 
regional threats for decades to come. Armed conflicts, which 
have a destructive effect on international stability, social and 
ethnic upheavals, massive famine and pandemic diseases, 
terrorism and the narcotics business, are threats on a global 
scale and objectively cannot but affect the interests and 
security of other regions and states, Russia included. 
  The contemporary world, and above all the 
industrially-developed countries, are faced with the growing 
realization that one can hardly isolate oneself from the 
problems of the African continent, which are already leading to 
an increase in the influx of emigrants from Africa to Europe and 
other regions: such as, the growth of Islamic extremism; and the 
spread of diseases, including AIDS. It is no coincidence that in 
this connection Prime Minister of France Balladour stated, that 
the interests of his country "are suffering greatly from African 
crises, whether it is a question of development of trade, 
reliable supply of raw materials, the dangers of uncontrolled 
emigration, or conflicts which threaten to upset the balance of 
power on the entire continent."[.sup]1[/] 
  Obviously, for these same reasons, Russia too cannot wall 
herself off from Africa behind the palisades of her own 
difficulties. The moreso since, while acting judiciously and 
with knowledge of affairs; and while structuring relationships 
with the African states on a genuine, mutually advantageous 
basis, with equal rights, without the previous distortions in 
the ideological and military sphere--it is possible that 
cooperation with Africa, which is still a rich and independent 
region despite its severe crisis, can be put to use in 
overcoming our own specific problems. 
  At the very same time, if we withdraw from Africa, we are 
then in essence acknowledging our inability to engage in 
positive, constructive cooperation, and we are confirming the 
opinion which is still heard from time to time, that our policy 
in Africa was founded merely on the negative values of the "cold 
war." 
  The warm breeze of change, which is breaking up the ice of 
many years of confrontation in the world, is blowing over Africa 
as well. Many countries on this continent have set about making 
democratic transformations: elections have been held on a 
multi-party basis, fundamental rights of citizens have been 
proclaimed, and more attention is being devoted to human rights. 
The changes taking place in the world, and in African states as 
well, along with those transformations which are being carried 
out in Russia, force us to look anew at the development of 
Russo-African relations as well. A thorough "inventory" must be 
made of the experience of our over 30 years of ties, singling 
out all that is of value and useful, and decisively rejecting 
the approaches which were dictated by the market conditions and 
ideological considerations of the past. 
  At the same time one can properly set the priorities in our 
relations with Africa, discover the most promising areas for 
cooperation, and determine the circle of reliable partners, only 
on the basis of precise analysis and forecasting of the economic 
and political development of African countries, taking into 
consideration those factors which have decisive influence on the 
formation of a political and economic climate both for the 
African continent as a whole, and for the individual 
countries.[passage omitted] 
  I believe that it is also in the Russian interest, 
especially 
in the economic plane, not to lose sight of the potential of 
Africa as our partner, the more so since we have already 
established a firm foundation for cooperation in our relations 
with many African countries. 
  For the most part, future Russo-African relations are seen 
precisely in all-round development of mutually-advantageous 
economic ties; however, it will hardly be possible to achieve 
this until military-political stability is assured on the 
African continent, and until the prerequisites are established 
for stable socio-economic development. Orienting herself on the 
prospects which lie in the plane of economic and trade 
relations, Russia, employing political means, will strive to 
support the processes of democratization in Africa, and will 
take part in settling existing conflicts and forestalling 
potential conflict. 
  Within the framework of the given approach, we should 
obviously focus special attention on activating political ties 
with this continent. At the same time, it is necessary to pay 
attention to its specific nature, when quite often cooperation 
in all other sectors depend upon the level of political 
relations and with establishing contacts with the leadership of 
a country. We cannot shut our eyes to the fact that the ruling 
circles of many African states still take a cautious attitude 
toward the political processes and reforms in Russia, lack 
confidence in their successful outcome, and doubt that our 
country, at the present stage, is capable of playing a 
definitive role in the international arena. 
  African leaders, as practical experience shows, apart from 
discussing questions of bilateral relations, are prepared for 
dialogue with us on a broad range of problems associated with 
strengthening international peace and security, and primarily 
among those who are either directly influencing the situation on 
their continent, or who are promoting the acceleration of 
positive global transformations. From this point of view certain 
directions in Russo-African interaction are seen to be 
promising, such as certain aspects of disarmament, creation of 
nuclear-free zones, formation of regional security systems, 
strengthening international mechanisms for forestalling and 
settling conflicts, and formation of an international economic 
climate that is beneficial for Russia and Africa as well. 
  The political assistance of Russia to settlement of the 
basic 
"hot spots" of Africa, to include support in the UN Security 
Council, is directed toward fulfilling the global mission of 
assuring a more secure world. We also consider this assistance 
an important part of our political partnership with the African 
countries, which strengthens the basis for mutually-advantageous 
cooperation with them. 
  Russia is taking a most active part in the Angolan 
settlement, and together with the United States and Portugal is 
joining a "troika" of observers over the process of carrying out 
the Bisesskiy (Lisbon) Agreements (May, 1991). Russian military 
and civilian observers have been sent under UN auspices to a 
number of other conflict zones in Africa (Mozambique, Liberia, 
Somalia and Rwanda). 
  On the whole it is obvious that in analyses of the prospects 
for stabilization of the situation in the "hot spots" of Africa 
and around them, one should avoid excess optimism. In this 
connection, Russian proposals made at the 48th Session of the UN 
General Assembly are considered timely ones. The essence of 
these proposals is--to establish within a United Nations 
framework additional mechanisms which will permit significantly 
increasing the success rate for peacemaking operations, to 
include the African continent as well. 
  Experience in operations in support of peace implemented by 
the international community on the African continent is 
important for us, for application to Russia's own efforts on the 
territory of the former USSR. 
  At the same time, while cooperating with the West on the 
African continent, one should proceed from the fact that the 
commonality of approaches noted for a number of problems does 
not at all signify that they are completely identical. Russia 
must operate above all in consideration of her own national 
interests, as well as the reality of the multipolar world that 
is taking shape. 
  In spite of a certain slump in the sphere of trade and 
economic relations, prospects for developing cooperation with 
Africa exist, and above all in the extraction of minerals; in 
geology; and in construction, fisheries, woodworking and 
agriculture. Constructing and utilizing major new 
facilities--such as the bauxite extraction complex in Dian-Dian 
(Guinea); expanding the scale of independent activities of state 
and commercial structures; setting up joint enterprises; 
establishing new zones for trade and economic activities, for 
example, in Namibia and the South African Republic--can 
genuinely raise the overall qualitative level and scale of 
Russia's economic ties with Africa. 
  The interests of Russia are served not only by maintaining, 
but also by expanding existing ties. It is at the same time 
necessary to purposefully and consistently place them on a new 
basis: to establish multi-level forms of cooperation with the 
countries which remain, chiefly for ideological motives, beyond 
the sphere of our attention. At the same time we should above 
all examine the possibilities for developing relations with 
those states which represent a promising market for acquiring 
Russian products, or suppliers of the goods and raw materials 
which we need. 
  Intensification of Russo-African interaction will to a large 
extent also depend upon transition to new forms and methods of 
cooperation--granting of licenses and know-how, rental of 
machinery and equipment, collaboration between industrial 
sectors, and scientific-production cooperation. 
  In recent years, while overcoming significant difficulties, 
the processes of integration have intensified in Africa. One may 
quite confidently assume that in the future, inter-African 
economic cooperation, aimed at the creation of an African 
economic community and regional economic structures, will become 
more significant. Such intentions have already appeared very 
vividly in a number of regions on the continent. 
  Russian foreign economic structures could also take 
advantage 
of trends for integration in Africa for increasing her own 
exports to the corresponding markets, which will apparently be 
expanding as a result of the aforementioned trends. Our 
participation is possible at the level of enterprises, 
investment banks, and in the form of joint ventures. 
  In resolving African problems of development, for the 
continent as a whole, for subregions and countries, Russia is 
devoting significant attention to the role of the UN Economic 
Commission for Africa [ECA] and, in particular, to the fact that 
ECA could stimulate and attribute a truly international 
character to its programs in such areas as transportation, power 
engineering, development of natural resources, and environmental 
protection, as well as support of small and mid-level 
entrepreneurship. 
  Russian organizations are completely capable of 
participation 
in implementing projects within the framework of the second 
decade of industrial development in Africa and the second decade 
of transport and communication of the UN's ECA. It would appear 
that Russo-African cooperation, taking into consideration the 
peculiarities of the continent, could promote the solution of 
problems of employment and the development of facilities in the 
infrastructure; and could have as its ultimate goal the 
involvement to the fullest of African countries in the system of 
international division of labor on a fair basis. 
  An important element of bilateral relations between Russia 
and countries of Africa, which requires a weighty and 
well-thought-out approach, is the problem of their obligations 
for credits issued by the former USSR. In terms of state credits 
alone, the volume of indebtedness of sub-Saharan African 
countries amounts to nearly $14 billion. The situation is 
aggravated by the fact that the domestic political situation in 
many of the countries which are the principal debtors is 
unstable, and the economy is in a state of crisis. Therefore, 
the task consists of finding ways and means of restoring the 
debts, without straining political relations, and without 
breaking existing mutually-advantageous ties. 
  It is most important to proceed from the fact that the 
search 
for solution of this problem must not rest on narrow 
departmental considerations. It is necessary to take into 
account all aspects of political and commercial-economic 
relations with each country, individually. The question of 
indebtedness should be examined comprehensively, employing 
various strategies: partial payment in freely-convertible 
currency and local currency, compensation for debt by deliveries 
of goods, or reinvestment; taking things one step at a time, 
using part of the debt for covering the expenses of Russian 
missions, and so on. 
  The sphere of military-technical cooperation remains an 
important link in Russia's foreign policy and economic ties with 
Africa. This form of interaction appears to be quite promising 
in the context of increasing its profitability and placing it on 
an exclusively commercial basis. A number of African states have 
an appropriate degree of interest in this. 
  One must not fail to consider that a prolonged pause in the 
given sphere of relations with Africa can have a negative effect 
on Russian interests; since the vacuum formed as a result of 
breaking military-technical ties with the Soviet Union, and then 
with Russia as well, is being energetically filled by other 
countries--including those which produce weapons under Russian 
licenses, of greatly inferior quality than that which Russia 
herself could offer. It is evident, incidentally, that Russian 
arms deliveries should not appear in regions of existing and 
potential armed conflicts, nor in countries with openly 
dictatorial regimes. 
  Apart from solving the urgent problems cited above, 
developing stable relations with African countries demands 
long-term humanitarian and political investment in the future of 
our ties. In this context one should, obviously, be thinking 
about the possibility of continuing, in modern conditions, the 
training of African national cadres in the VUZ's of our country. 
Such a practice provides its own positive results. It is another 
matter, that this cooperation should be for the most part placed 
on a compensatory basis. At the same time it should remain 
advantageous and attractive for our African partners as well. 
  The question of future Russo-African relations continues to 
attract the attention of the Russian and world community. Today, 
it is true, few people doubt whether or not we need Africa in 
general. On this account, it would appear that at last a 
more-or-less unified point of view is taking shape--Yes, it is 
necessary, since Russia, even with her present difficulties, 
cannot allow herself the luxury of turning her back on Africa, 
nor to all the other regions of our planet. Russia must assure 
herself a fitting role in the world balance of influence, and in 
the multilateral processes for regulating the world economy and 
international relations. 
  By preserving all that is rational in bilateral political, 
economic and cultural ties with Africa; applying to them content 
appropriate to the realities of today; and by developing 
cooperation in new directions, to include those countries which 
previously lay beyond the bounds of our active policy, Russia 
will support her own state interests, and will obtain greater 
freedom in the choice of foreign policy alternatives. In this 
manner the prerequisites will be laid down for more solid 
positions for our country, not only on the African continent, 
but in the world arena as a whole.

<F P=106> [Article by Vasiliy Golovnin under the rubric "Fish": "The </F>
Japanese Are Asking Us Not To Fire. Tokyo Advises Its Fishermen 
Not To Mess With `Putina-94'"] 
  [Text] Tokyo--An influential official in Tokyo stated: "If 
your border guards begin shooting, this will be the end of 
normal Russian-Japanese relations." Official Tokyo responded 
quite nervously to "Putina-94," a large-scale operation to put 
an end to foreign poaching which began on 20 April in the waters 
of Russia's Far East. Now the Japanese are anxiously 
anticipating the results of this action. However, so far the 
newspapers have been reporting on the operation of Russian 
border guards which has begun in an unemotional and markedly 
informative manner. 
  As is known, in addition to the vessels, aircraft, and shore 
installations of the border guard troops, the forces of the 
Pacific Fleet, the patrol craft of the Russian Federation 
Committee on Fishing, specialists from the Customs Committee, 
and even a surveillance satellite have been pressed into service 
for "Putina." The objective of the operation is to restore 
control over Russian waters in the Far East where poachers from 
Japan, North and South Korea, China, and even representatives of 
a faraway Poland have operated with virtual impunity in recent 
years. At the same time, at issue is restoration in the region 
of the prestige of the Russian border guard troops, which have 
recently been referred to with compassion in, for example, 
Japan: They lack fuel, their patrol craft are old, their engines 
are weak--how can they keep up with border violators? 
  There are a few very attractive regions in the Far Eastern 
zone to which foreign fishermen are drawn as if by a magnet. 
These are the shores of Kamchatka, with the best crabs in the 
world, and the famous zone in the center of the Sea of Okhotsk 
where an entire army of poachers from the world over literally 
scoops out pollock and other valuable marine life, taking 
advantage of the fact that technically this area is considered 
to be open water. From this standpoint the South Kuril zone, in 
which the confrontation between Russian border guards and 
Japanese fishermen has become particularly acute, is the least 
favorable. Naturally, a long-standing dispute between Moscow and 
Tokyo over title to these islands makes the situation 
particularly piquant. 
  According to data from the border guards, more than 7,000 
incursions by Japanese vessels in the Russian waters of the Far 
East were registered last year; the South Kuril zone accounted 
for most of them. The violators are apprehended, kept in dirty 
pretrial confinement cells, put on trial, fined, and even have 
their vessels confiscated. Recently the captain of one of the 
trawlers caught was wounded in the leg when a Russian patrol 
craft fired warning shots. However, so far these measures have 
failed to bring about a radical change in the situation because 
poachers are apprehended quite infrequently, after all. 
  The Russian authorities displayed their determination to 
take 
harsher measures for the first time early this year, when about 
80 Japanese vessels entered the zone of the South Kuril island 
of Kunashir on 21-22 January all at once; the vessels stayed 
there for a long time, despite numerous warnings from Russian 
border guards. The incident was widely publicized and for the 
first time caused vigorous protests from Moscow bolstered by a 
conspicuous pick-up in the activity of the border guard troops. 
However, incursions into the waters of the islands in dispute 
continued on a smaller scale until the beginning of April, 
causing the irritation of our marine guards to mount. 
  Tokyo's position with regard to all these events is 
ambiguous. On one hand, Japan calls on its fishermen not to 
invade Russian waters. As a representative of the Japanese 
Marine Safety Directorate has communicated, his department 
intends to convince potential violators "not to cross the 
border" of the Russian Federation zone, warning them of possible 
consequences, especially in the course of "Putina-94." 
  However, it is well known that for the most part a 
particular 
variety of fishermen who are closely associated with the yakuza 
mafia engage in poaching in our waters. As a rule this element 
could not care less about admonitions; besides, it is a mark of 
special valor for them to "rub the noses" of the Russian 
occupiers of the South Kuril Islands in it, since most of the 
yakuza subscribe to an extreme variety of nationalism. 
  Tokyo's official position objectively prompts incursions 
into 
this zone. Tokyo considers the South Kuril Islands its own 
territory and, correspondingly, does not consider the passage of 
its vessels there to be a "violation of the state border." The 
Government of Japan has consistently rejected all protests from 
Moscow on this occasion, and approaches revealed cases of 
poaching strictly from the standpoint of its domestic 
legislation, which virtually eliminates any opportunity to 
punish the culprits. 
  Nonetheless, statements by influential officials in Tokyo 
who 
have a direct involvement in relations with Russia indicate that 
Japan is alarmed by the pick-up in the activity of our border 
guards, since the Japanese are afraid that the border guards 
will start firing on violators. In essence, the authorities here 
have nothing against poachers being apprehended, as they believe 
this to be unavoidable, and even useful in a way. However, even 
a chance killing of a violator-fisherman while being chased and 
apprehended would unavoidably cause an unpredictable surge of 
hatred for Russia in Japan, which apparently is not to the 
liking of a majority of local politicians. On the other hand, 
there are quite influential forces in Japan that might even be 
waiting for blood to be drawn in order to dispense once and for 
all with all attempts at normalizing relations with Moscow by 
making a racket about "Japanese being killed by KGB soldiers," 
as our border guards are still called locally. 
  In view of this, statements by Andrey Nikolayev, commander 
in 
chief of the border guard troops, to the effect that "Putina-94" 
is not aimed at a coercive resolution of the issue of unlawful 
fishing but is mainly called upon to be a powerful psychological 
influence on potential violators, are hopeful. It appears that 
the essence of the issue is in making the apprehension and a 
substantial financial penalty for the poachers virtually 
unavoidable, because shooting in the Far East is caused only by 
the inability of the border guards to compete as equals with 
poachers on fast vessels. This problem has another aspect, too: 
There are virtually no continuous working contacts between the 
border guard services of the two countries which could get the 
ball rolling.

<F P=106> [Article by KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA correspondents Irina </F>
Bakayeva and Tamara Kaleyeva: "A `Noose' Has Been Thrown Around 
the Neck of Crime. What Will Be the Result?"] 
  [Text] Lately the capital has been agitated by rumors, each 
more wild than the next. Allegedly there have been several 
assassination attempts, including on Ministry of Internal 
Affairs officers, on the president of the Butya company, Bulat 
Abilov, and on other famous people. 
  We called the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] press 
service and found out that these rumors were not news to them. 
  "We know of this," said the deputy chief of the MVD press 
center, Lieutenant Colonel Aleksandr Vulf. "This information is 
not true, however. All the persons whose names are being 
mentioned in 'unofficial chronicles' are alive and well." 
  "Nevertheless, residents of the capital noticed, for 
instance, unusual activism on the part of the militia over the 
past few days. Why?" 
  [Vulf] In the past the militia has always worked in a 
special 
mode during holidays. The same was true over the past few days: 
The militia was put on a round-the-clock operation schedule, 
with reinforced patrols--that is why there was more special 
equipment on the streets than usual, and patrols were armed with 
submachine guns. This is not at all related to a crime surge. On 
the contrary, over the past four months the total number of 
crimes in the republic has dropped by 7 percent, and criminal 
investigations--by 10 percent. The number of murders, robberies, 
and assaults has dropped. In order to maintain this trend, the 
republic organs of internal affairs conducted Operation "Kuryk" 
("Noose") a few days ago. Over a period of three days 1,288 
crimes were registered, of which 888 were solved while the trail 
was hot. We also detained 1,153 suspects--63 for inflicting 
grave bodily harm, 92--for hooliganism, and 21--for assault. 
"Noose" also caught 262 drug addicts, from whom we confiscated 
22.5 kg of drugs. On the basis of these facts, 1,069 criminal 
cases have been initiated. 
  In the course of the operation 633 units of firearms were 
confiscated, 55 stolen cars were found, and 4,152 persons were 
delivered to medical sobering-up facilities. We checked 
dormitories, hotels, and "suspicious" apartments. It turned out 
that 425 foreign citizens were living in Kazakhstan not only 
without a residence permit but even without a passport. One 
hundred thirteens persons were expelled from the republic. 
  These are the facts we were given at the MVD press center. 
And at the offices of the Butya company we were told that Bulat 
Abilov is in good health and actually is on a business trip to 
Japan. 
  *** 
  Of course, there is no smoke without a fire, but the rumors 
surrounding the incident that took place on 5 May near the 
famous Arasan bathhouse have acquired the appearance of a 
smoke-screen: Rumor had it that one of the top officials in the 
republic MVD died in a mafia score-settling incident. 
  In reality the incident was far more prosaic. At 2330 
Colonel 
A. Seitov, chief of the MVD criminal investigations department, 
who lives near Imeni 28 Panfilov Soldiers Park, was taking his 
dog for a walk as usual. This time his whole family had decided 
to get a bit of fresh air: A. Seitov himself, and his wife, son, 
and daughter-in-law. Some intoxicated young men, who were 
"having fun" at a commercial kiosk near the bathhouse, took a 
liking to the beautiful dog. Two of the six confronted the 
family and pulled out a gun: "Give us the dog or we will kill 
it." 
  Admonishments, verbal warnings, and even an MVD officer ID 
produced no effect: The drunks continued to brandish their 
weapon. Then the colonel pulled out his standard-issue weapon 
and fired a warning shot in the air. Instead of coming back to 
their senses, the riesenschauzer lovers attacked the colonel and 
wounded his daughter-in-law. Then A. Seitov, too, used his 
weapon. One of the attackers--B. Alpysbayev, 30-year-old 
director of the bathhouse men's department--was killed, and the 
other one was wounded. 
  The procuracy initiated criminal proceedings against the 
attackers. It was found that A. Seitov's use of a firearm had 
been justified. 
  Thus, there was no "score-settling;" nevertheless, an attack 
on, of all people, a top criminal investigations official is 
indeed troublesome: After all, we mere mortals do not carry 
standard-issue weapons for self-defense...

<F P=106> [Interview with President of Kyrgyzstan Askar Akayev by </F>
Mikhail Serdyukov in Bishkek; date not given: "I Am Looking for 
the Formula for Life"] 
  [Text] Question to Kyrgyz Radio: "What Does 
Kyrgyzstan have in abundance and what is lacking?" Answer: "We 
have a lot of lazy and foolish people, and Akayev has no 
alternative." 
  "That is it," said the president, "I am leaving...." 
  He said that to his wife, but she knows him very well 
and she was not very frightened. Again the opposition...both 
looked out the window. The sun played on the nearby mountains, 
covered with eternal snow. In such moments, if they managed to 
remain alone, they did not turn out the light in the residence. 
  "I will leave if I get less than two-thirds of the 
votes on the referendum," stated the president. 
  "Oh, God almighty!" Mayram begged. "When will you 
deliver our family from such words?" She was praying, 
understandably, for herself. 
  Is Allah present in Kyrgyzstan? The president received 
98 percent of the votes. The figure reminds one of the days of 
stagnation, but that is a part of the past. The people were left 
with their chosen one, and his wife with her fate. 
  As the sun went down we drank tea and complained about 
the spring: It brought nothing but disaster--mud slides, 
mountain torrents, flooding, and--asked: Is it easy to be 
president under such conditions? When there is disaster after 
disaster, when the people do not really want to live in the old 
way but they have simply not learned the new way.... 
  [Serdyukov] I bet you never dreamed of such a fate when you 
were a child.... 
  [Akayev] I wanted to be a historian. Military. Since third 
grade I have been addicted to reading about the campaigns of 
Suvorov, Nakhimov...I read everything there was to read about 
Napoleon. Then I saw the film "Waterloo" and it seemed that I 
already knew it all, I understood, but how I wanted Napoleon to 
be defeated.... 
  [Serdyukov] Were there military people in your family? 
  [Akayev] Both military people and government leaders. 
Incidentally, I am the great great great grandson of Atake-Biye 
himself. In 1785 he was the Khan and sent ambassadors to Russia. 
They were received by Catherine II, and with great respect. 
Because she was an intelligent woman and she understood that 
Russia would have a great interest in our region. My ancestor 
Shadan-Batyr ruled in northern Kyrgyzstan and helped General 
Skobelev unite the southern part of our country with Russia. 
  My father, as a descendent of the Khan's tribe, was forced 
to 
hide on the steps of Kazakhstan. There he met my future mother. 
Asel is alive, she is 93 years old. She is Kazakh. 
  [Serdyukov] So you are good friends with Nazarbayev--thick 
as 
thieves! 
  [Akayev] Yes, we are not simply friends. We are 
relatives...my mother is a second cousin of Nursultan Abishevich. 
  [Serdyukov] This is the first time I have heard of that. And 
I do not think I am the only one.... 
  [Akayev] What is so special about this? Such things are not 
really miracles in Asia. But here is what is surprising: Until 
1989 Nazarbayev and I did not know one another very well. We met 
in Moscow when we both became deputies of the Supreme Soviet of 
the USSR. I told him about our kinship.... 
  [Serdyukov] Was he very happy? 
  [Akayev] We were like two brothers. 
  [Serdyukov] You do not happen to be a relative of Yeltsin as 
well? 
  [Akayev] No, we are simply good friends. We have been 
helping 
each other since the times when we were both deputies. 
  [Serdyukov] Does it seem to you that the very concept of 
"male friendship" is impossible in its true sense for high-level 
politicians? How, for example, do you deal with the situation 
when "you may die, but you rescue your friend"? Is such a thing 
really acceptable for a president? What should he do, destroy 
his state while saving another leader? 
  [Akayev] Did you see "Dinner" with Oleg Tabakov and Armen 
Dzhigarkhanyan? I know that it is hard to get in to see this 
show. When my wife and I were in Moscow, only Tabakov himself 
was able to get us tickets. Anyway, in this show two important 
politicians, Fouche and Talleyrand, are vowing their friendship 
to one another even though they are actually sworn enemies. 
  Talleyrand wanted to use Fouche to get into power and then 
quietly get rid of him. But Fouche understands this and is 
saving up compromising material against his "friend." It becomes 
clear to Talleyrand that he will not be able to betray his 
friend. And so he concludes what is now a truly friendly 
alliance with him for the rest of his life. Question: How real 
is it? This is a show all presidents would do well to see. I was 
convinced once again that the professional politicians today are 
not so different from their colleagues back in those feudal 
times. What is bad? All the presidents' forces are now going for 
an empty struggle, they are using up all their ammunition in 
verbal battles. That is no way to emerge from the crisis. And I 
am beginning to understand why dictatorial regimes have achieved 
success in economic prosperity.... 
  [Serdyukov] Do you have to keep a tight rein? 
  [Akayev] How else was Napoleon able to keep Fouche and 
Talleyrand in check? After all, they were sold out and they 
betrayed other people, but for the most part they served him 
faithfully and truthfully. Him and, understandably, the empire. 
  [Serdyukov] When you became president, did you have to 
change 
any of your habits or get rid of former friends? 
  [Akayev] One of my mottoes is always remain yourself. I will 
not betray myself. For which I am frequently criticized: They 
say the president should be a little more pompous, definitely 
secretive, and of course, powerful. And "he"--that is, 
I--continue to be...a member of the intelligentsia. 
  [Serdyukov] But has it ever happened that you have broken 
off 
relations with a recent friend because of high-level political 
considerations? Let us say that at one time he was a good 
comrade to both you and Yeltsin. And suddenly he had a large 
fallout with Boris Nikolayevich. Upon meeting him, how would you 
act with the person who was "out of favor"? 
  [Akayev] As I did before. 
  [Serdyukov] And if Yeltsin was offended and your relations 
with him became cool? Would the whole republic not suffer? 
  [Akayev] No, I cannot remember such a thing with him. Here 
is 
an example--Gennadiy Burbulis. We became friends back when we 
were deputies. He was the one who at my friendly request 
organized Yeltsin's first visit to Kyrgyzstan as president of 
Russia. That was a month before the August putsch, and I had 
certain information about preparations for it. Of course, I 
warned Boris Nikolayevich in a private conversation. And he 
said: "Can you discuss this where everyone can hear?" "Of 
course, I can!" And I did when we exchanged official greetings. 
Gorbachev was greatly offended at that time...he did not believe 
it...but then there was Burbulis. He parted ways with Yeltsin, 
but that does not diminish our friendship. I recently flew to 
Moscow, phoned him, and invited him to dinner: I said, let us 
sit down and talk...he was terribly surprised about something: 
"All the rest of the presidents are avoiding me, they think that 
I will have the wrong influence on their relations with Yeltsin, 
but you...." I'm a friend of Boris Fedorov, Yegor Gaydar...they 
did not fall in my estimation at all after losing their posts. 
  [Serdyukov] Askar Akayevich, what do you think: Can the 
president have shortcomings? 
  [Akayev] I have a pile of them. But my main teacher, the 
scholar Sergey Aleksandrovich Mayorov, who is well known in his 
field, taught me to fight against them: Write down all your 
shortcomings on a card and every day try to correct at least one 
of them. 
  [Serdyukov] Are you succeeding? 
  [Akayev] I am trying. But still, in 1986, when they took me 
into the Central Committee to be in charge of the department of 
science and scholarly institutions, I received a letter from my 
teacher in which he gave me, as a person "who is now a leader 
and an official," several pieces of advice. Guess what the first 
was? 
  [Serdyukov] Always keep smiling. 
  [Akayev] That is a character trait, the external 
manifestation of it--I am a confirmed optimist. And that is in 
my blood, without any advice.... 
  [Serdyukov] Well, then do not contradict the leaders. 
  [Akayev] I contradicted them. For which they very quickly 
asked me to take less "responsible" work. 
  [Serdyukov] I give up. What? 
  [Akayev] "Beware of journalists!" 
  [Serdyukov] And so, is it very terrible? 
  [Akayev] Sometimes it is not terrible but very revolting. 
  [Serdyukov] Your position is such that you are always in the 
public eye. Incidentally, I recall one boom not so long ago. 
Your name was fluttering in the newspaper-journalistic wind of 
the boundless CIS area in connection with the notorious Seabeco 
campaign, which you for some unknown reason endowed with gold 
from the treasury. And now Boris Birshteyn is repaying you by 
educating your eldest daughter in the best Swiss higher school. 
I know there is a bitter taste in your mouth. But if possible, 
for SOBESEDNIK, shed some light on this situation just one more 
time. 
  [Akayev] It is all painfully simple. Back before I was 
elected president, the Swiss firm Seabeco concluded with the 
former Kyrgyz Government a contract that was very advantageous 
for itself and essentially extortionate for the republic for 
joint development and extraction of our gold. I demanded all the 
documents, studied them attentively along with specialists, and 
came to the conclusion that further joint work would be 
inexpedient. 
  Well, since Seabeco had already invested a certain amount of 
its money in this project, we decided to return its money from 
the republic budget. That is all there is. I think we dealt with 
this Birshteyn in a gentlemanly way and one can say that we 
settled our accounts immediately. As for my eldest daughter 
Berma--she has nothing to do with this story. She is a student 
in the department of computer mathematics and cybernetics of 
Moscow State University, in her third year. The best students 
were sent abroad. And she was among them. The training is 
financed by the "business and management" fund. Birshteyn and 
certainly I have nothing to do with this. It is just that my 
eldest daughter is a very hard worker. 
  [Serdyukov] Like her father? 
  [Akayev] Mayram spends more and more time with the children. 
We have four. Two students--a girl and a boy. Two 
schoolchildren--the same combination. My eldest son, Seydar, is 
also abroad, in Washington. He is taking exams in an American 
University. He lives with friends. Remember Sagdeyev, the 
academician?... He is our friend and welcomed our son...I think 
that whether or not I am president, the children should receive 
the best education possible. This is of major value to them. 
  [Serdyukov] Have you studied all your life? 
  [Akayev] And now--where can you hide? I was a specialist in 
the area of precise sciences. But a president cannot do without 
knowledge of economics. 
  [Serdyukov] The more I get to know you, the more clearly I 
understand that you were not all that eager to become 
president... 
  [Akayev] That is exactly right. In the Supreme Soviet I 
worked on the committee for economic reforms. With Bunich and 
Bogomolov--real jewels--and we became friends...there, of 
course, I became interested in politics and economics. 
Imperceptibly I became more involved. And then suddenly in 
Kyrgyzstan the parliament decided to elect a president. They 
came to me and I said immediately: "No. Categorically. Look for 
a president among the professional politicians. There are so 
many of them nowadays...or--I advised--draft Aytmatov. He has 
enough respect for any position...." Well, it seems they backed 
away from me. Thank God!... And then my daughter and I happened 
to be guests of academician Samarskiy--an extremely great 
mathematician--we were talking...there was a phone call from 
Bishkek--the democrats had found me here too! Well, they drafted 
me: I had to fly home immediately. And I was elected president 
on the first round. I had to work.... 
  [Serdyukov] How many hours a day? 
  [Akayev] Figure it out. I wake up at 0500. I do not go to 
bed 
until after I have seen all the news on television--after 
midnight. 
  [Serdyukov] All those hours without letting up? 
  [Akayev] What do you mean? I spend about 40 minutes shaving. 
At home they know that this is my weakness. Previously my wife 
was always scolding me, especially when we lived in a tiny 
apartment in Leningrad: I was the only person knew who could 
take so long in the toilet. I do not use mechanical razors. Only 
razor blades. It gives me wild pleasure. 
  [Serdyukov] And, of course, jogging? 
  [Akayev] Absolutely. With friends. My doctor and the general 
who is the chief of my personal guard. Twenty kilometers a 
week--a golden norm. 
  [Serdyukov] Do you really have to have a guard? 
  [Akayev] I do not have to. But like any president, my 
freedom 
is quite restricted. 
  [Serdyukov] Is there any place where you can get away from 
it 
all? 
  [Akayev] Yes. In the mountains. My whole family enjoys 
downhill skiing. True, the chief of the guard is there as 
well.... 
  [Serdyukov] During hours of recreation Nazarbayev takes out 
his mandolin and Yeltsin--his spoons. And when you are together, 
what role do you play in this trio? 
  [Akayev] I listen. And very attentively. It turns out that 
presidents need listeners very much. And I feel simply 
irreplaceable in this trio. I know that both Yeltsin and 
Nazarbayev value me as an attentive conversationalist. I am 
capable of understanding their thoughts. It is important to have 
such a person. I never let anyone think that he is the only one 
who is right.... 
  [Serdyukov] And do you swim in cold water? Boris 
Nikolayevich 
respects.... 
  [Akayev] That is exactly right. But now I have a new 
diversion. Nazarbayev recently suggested that we arrange a 
tennis tournament among the presidents. I had to have a court 
built in the yard of my residence. Now I am training hard. Since 
I had never before learned.... 
  [Serdyukov] They are clever. They have been playing tennis 
for a long time. Ask for a handicap. 
  [Akayev] Why? I will suggest my own sports. A triathlon, for 
example. And definitely running. In order to even out the 
chances. 
  [Serdyukov] You probably go hunting for "wild boar"--with a 
rifle. 
  [Akayev] Boris Nikolayevich has a dream of hunting in 
Kyrgyzstan. But it has not all worked out yet.... 
  [Serdyukov] Probably because you are not a hunter. 
  [Akayev] Not even a fisherman. 
  [Serdyukov] But what entertains you most? 
  [Akayev] Music. I love classical music. When I need a burst 
of inspiration I listen to Mozart. In moments of heavy 
reflection nothing can replace Liszt's "Hungarian Rhapsody." 
  [Serdyukov] Do you spend a lot of time listening to Liszt? 
  [Akayev] I can put the record on in the morning and listen 
to 
it all day long. Over and over again...that is the way it is so 
far. 
  P.S. The editors thank Vasiliy Tolstunov, president of 
the Sezam firm, for help in organizing this article.

<F P=106> [Article by Arkadiy Dubnov: "General Gromov Is Not Afraid of </F>
the Tajik Opposition: He Is Afraid of a `New Afghanistan' for 
Russia"] 
  [Text] There is no general in the Russian army who knows 
better than General Boris Gromov what a war outside of Russia 
means. He was the last commander of the Soviet expeditionary 
corps which fought in Afghanistan and was the last to leave it, 
in the wake of his 40th Army, crossing the border Amu-Darya at 
the now-celebrated bridge in Termez. This was five years ago. 
Since that time General Gromov has been a convinced opponent of 
Russia's involvement in such wars, in which neither victory nor 
glory are to be found. But the general has not forgotten against 
whom his Afghan vets were fighting. The Mujahidin remain his 
enemies today also. 
  Boris Gromov is now deputy minister of defense of Russia. 
For 
his subordinates the Afghan Mujahidin have become the enemy once 
again. They are being fought by a Russian expeditionary corps 
which is now in Tajikistan. They and combatants of the Tajik 
opposition. Now, the corps is called not a "limited Soviet 
military contingent," it is true, but a part of the coalition 
peacekeeping force of the CIS. But this does not alter the 
essence of the matter, albeit languid, a war is under way in 
Tajikistan, nonetheless, and Russian soldiers are fighting on 
one side for the Tajik Government in Dushanbe and against the 
Afghan enemy and Tajik combatants. 
<H5>  Turadzhonzoda Was Surprised </H5>
  It is any wonder that the meeting between General Gromov and 
an acknowledged leader of the Tajik opposition, Khodzhi Akbar 
Turadzhonzoda, deputy chairman of the Islamic Resistance 
Movement of Tajikistan, which took place in Moscow at the end of 
last week, was held in a less-than-diplomatic atmosphere, to put 
it mildly. No, it was not Gromov who had sought this meeting, 
the former spiritual leader of Tajik Muslims had requested that 
a head-to-head meeting with the general be arranged. 
Turadzhonzoda had come to Moscow at the end of the first round 
of inter-Tajik peace negotiations. He and his movement 
colleague, Mukhammad-sharif Khemmatzoda, chairman of the Islamic 
Revival Party, who are the official leaders of the Tajik 
opposition delegation, refused to sit at the negotiating table 
until Dushanbe was officially represented thereat by some top 
person of the Tajik Government. For the opposition leaders, the 
visit to Moscow meant an opportunity familiarize the Russian 
leadership with its position in personal contact with it for the 
first time. It is hard to say whether this meeting was useful 
for the deputy defense minister.... But for his 
interlocutors--undoubtedly. To their astonishment, they learned 
that they were being taken for some others. The point being that 
General Gromov began the conversation with accusations that the 
opposition was demanding the withdrawal of Russian troops from 
Tajikistan and an end to all relations with Russia, and this was 
unacceptable. 
  "You are mistaken, you have, evidently, been misinformed," 
Turadzhonzoda responded. "We recognize Russia's geopolitical 
interests in Tajikistan and are not demanding the withdrawal of 
the Russian, more precisely, coalition, peacekeeping force, 
provided that the command staff, which does not occupy a neutral 
position and which supports the present Tajik Government, is 
replaced. As far as relations with Russia are concerned," 
Turadzhonzoda observed, "we do not envisage the future of 
Tajikistan without the closest and most friendly ties to it. 
This viewpoint should be well known to the Russian leadership, 
the Tajik opposition has conveyed it to Moscow in its messages, 
and the Russian press has expounded it also," the former chief 
qadi of Tajikistan added in surprise. "We would like to know 
where you came by this misinformation," he asked Boris Gromov. 
  "From the opposition," the general replied. 
  "We represent the opposition, it is important, therefore, 
that we know from whom this comes...." 
  "Do not interrupt me," the deputy defense minister stopped 
his guest.... 
  This tone of the exchange did little, evidently, to 
contribute to its productiveness. General Gromov asked that it 
be conveyed "back there" that the Russian army would, in spite 
of everything, defend the Russian-speaking population. 
Turadzhonzoda replied that this was not how the issue should be 
framed, that no one was intending to attack the Russian 
speakers, and that their safety could be secured only by peace 
in the republic. And if some people do have a bad attitude 
toward the Russians, it is because, possibly, they are treating 
Tajik refugees badly in Russia.... Do not treat them badly here, 
do not attack them, and no one will touch Russians either.... 
  "You should not try to frighten us," Gromov said, "otherwise 
you will be duly repulsed...." 
  This was how the discussion went. It would be hard to call 
it 
a peacemaking discussion. 
<H5>  One Out of Every Five Tajiks in Exile? </H5>
  The meeting between the leaders of the Tajik opposition and 
Russian diplomats was at somewhat of a different level. Khodzhi 
Akbar Turadzhonzoda termed the conversation with Albert 
Chernyshev, deputy minister of foreign affairs, "friendly" even. 
The deputy minister inquired, the deputy chairman of the 
movement responded. 
  "Can the opposition be reconciled with the government in 
Dushanbe? Should it not join in the process of preparation for 
the elections to the new Tajik parliament scheduled for this 
year?" 
  "How is this possible when political parties are banned, 
political opponents are jailed or wanted by the police, there is 
no free press, and the principal 'authority' in the republic is 
the man with the gun? What kind of elections are they if one out 
of every fifth Tajik is in exile?" Turadzhonzoda answered the 
question with a question. "The present government should be 
replaced by a new leadership made up of professionals who were 
not involved in the Tajiks' civil war, the opposition is not 
laying claim to political power today, and we want the 
leadership of the People's Front, which came to this power in 
illegitimate fashion, to do the same...." 
  "But then there would be a power vacuum," the Russian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, "especially since the 
government in Dushanbe was elected legally at a session of the 
Tajik parliament in December 1992 in Khudzhent." 
  "Can a government elected by deputies under the threat of 
death be legitimate, we should not deceive ourselves.... Could 
it otherwise have been possible for the government to have been 
made up of 13 representatives from Kulyab Oblast alone, more 
precisely, from just one of its rayons--Baldzhuvanskiy. We 
cannot recognize such a government," Turadzhonzoda said. "If 
Russia wishes to defend its interests in Tajikistan," the former 
qadi continued, "it could do so at a far smaller cost in terms 
of human and material resources: It has only to put pressure on 
Dushanbe for it to agree to our proposals. And as soon as a new 
government is formed, we guarantee the disarmament of our armed 
formations, if the same is done with 80 percent of the 
government formations." 
  The functions of maintaining order, the opposition believes, 
could be assumed by the CIS peacekeeping force, if states 
bordering Tajikistan are not members of it. And only then, 18 
months to two years hence, when the refugees have returned to 
their homeland, Turadzhonzoda maintained, could elections be 
held and a new Constitution of Tajikistan adopted. 
<H5>  The Hot Breath of the `Irreconcilables' </H5>
  "And what would your plans be were you to win the 
elections," 
the deputy minister of foreign affairs of Russia asked. 
  "We understand your concern," his interlocutor replied, "you 
are afraid of the scarecrow of Islamic fundamentalism being 
shoved onto you.... We propose that Russia and other countries 
of the CIS be the guarantors of the preparation of a 
constitution which excludes the possibility of the formation of 
a theocratic state. We aspire to a secular, democratic regime, 
in which religion would be separate from the state," the former 
leader of Tajik Muslims emphasized, "and the constitution should 
contain a provision prohibiting its revision for 30-50 years." 
  The Tajik opposition is convinced that the government in 
Dushanbe will never relinquish its power as long as Russia 
supports it by its military presence, and for this reason the 
success of the inter-Tajik negotiations depends, in its opinion, 
on Moscow alone. Otherwise, the leaders of the opposition say, 
we will be compelled to prove that we are right by force, and 
Russia will be drawn increasingly into a "dirty" war, the 
outcome of which is determined in advance: Russia would be 
forced to withdraw from Tajikistan in disgrace, repeating its 
Afghan path. Turadzhonzoda acknowledges that "we are unpracticed 
at diplomatic negotiations," and this is why he came to Moscow, 
endeavoring to achieve understanding and support. It is possible 
that the difficulties of the opposition leaders who came here 
amount additionally to the fact that they feel the "hot breath" 
of the radical and irreconcilable armed opposition or of the 
Islamic circles that are backing it. The position of Khodzhi 
Akbar Turadzhonzoda and his closest associates who resolved to 
agree to negotiations is still quite influential today, it would 
seem. But what will be the case tomorrow? 
  Dushanbe is content with the results of the Moscow round. 
They are speaking there about a "psychological turning point" in 
relations with the opposition. If this is even the "desire," it 
is hardly "reality." The Kulyab clan, which controls the main 
power structures in the government and which has the most 
hostile attitude toward the opposition (this is mutual, for that 
matter), has no intention of ceding its positions. According to 
certain information, the attempts made this February to remove 
from the government Yakub Salimov, minister of foreign affairs 
(the most odious figure among the leadership and a leader of the 
disbanded People's Front, who has, in addition, a criminal 
past), was unsuccessful. Salimov declared that he would resign 
only together with the top leaders of the republic. His 
departure would undoubtedly enhance the image of the official 
Tajik leadership, but there are fears there, not without reason, 
of the republic splitting in this case into not two but three 
hostile camps. 
<H5>  The Chief Banker of Tajikistan Rebukes Russia </H5>
  It is naive to imagine that Moscow does not see this, and we 
should not be deluded as to its readiness to put pressure on 
Dushanbe under these conditions. The Tajik regime has no 
intention of capitulating to the demands of the opposition. 
Especially since it has managed to pull itself into the orbit of 
Russia's economic and military-strategic attraction. The 
situation appears amusing at times. Kayum Kavmiddinov, chairman 
of the National Bank of Tajikistan, recently rebuked the 
Ministry of Finance of Russia for delay in the payment of R60 
billion promised the republic last year on account of a loan of 
R120 billion, thanks to which Tajikistan was permitted to join 
the ruble zone. 
  What demands can be made of Dushanbe here, it will be a case 
of apologizing, more likely.... And of printing hundreds of 
billions of rubles with Tajik symbols as quickly as possible 
until the R70 billion of real rubles which have already been 
allocated are finally "washed" out of Tajikistan. 
  There is, meanwhile, about a month to go before the next 
round of inter-Tajik negotiations. It will take place, most 
likely, in Tehran, where the official Tajik delegation will head 
in the same composition as before. And this means that the 
opposition leaders will once again fail to show at the 
negotiating table. But whereas in Moscow their absence did not 
prevent agreement being reached on the future 27-point agenda, 
in the Iranian capital the delegations' authority for adopting 
decisions on these points will be manifestly insufficient. After 
all, it will be impossible to decide questions of a political 
settlement including an end to mutual hostilities on the 
Tajik-Afghan border and within the republic, the attitude toward 
the various military formations of both the government and the 
opposition, and measures of mutual trust in the absence of the 
political leaders from both sides. 
  A situation where these leaders are unofficially present 
alongside and determine the tactics of their delegations, as was 
the case in Moscow, say, where Rashid Alimov, minister of 
foreign affairs of Tajikistan, was present at the time of the 
negotiations, is possible. But it is hardly likely that the 
decisions adopted in that case could be deemed legitimate for 
both parties. 
<H5>  A `Second Afghanistan' Still Looms </H5>
  ...Making forecasts, even for a month ahead, is a thankless 
task. Nonetheless, some things may be anticipated. As a result 
of the change of commander of the CIS peacekeeping force in 
Tajikistan (General Valeriy Patrikeyev, who was prior to this 
commander of the Transcaucasus Military District, has been 
appointed in place of General Boris Pyankov, who attempted to 
don the garb of peacemaker and simultaneously called one side 
"gangsters," whom he contrasted with the "constructive 
government forces") a softening of the threatening rhetoric in 
respect to the opposition may be expected for a certain length 
of time. Especially since the inflaming of military hysteria by 
Patrikeyev's predecessor in connection with a powerful 
opposition offensive expected in the spring has not been 
justified. 
  There will be a revitalization of the propaganda campaign in 
Dushanbe designed to show on the one hand the peaceful 
aspirations of the government and, on the other, the perfidy of 
an opposition wishing only to return to power. The preparations 
for elections, which are to substantiate the legitimacy of the 
current regime, will be rapid. And with the introduction, in 
May, presumably, of the transitional Tajik-ruble currency in the 
republic the government could establish itself as the guarantor 
of economic stability. All this put together could force the 
Tajik opposition to take a chance on other than peaceful means 
of struggle. Unless, of course, it proves to be prepared for a 
negotiating process which is long and exhausting and not without 
forced compromises. 
  Moscow also will be thinking that the threat of a "second 
Afghanistan" is far from ephemeral.

  [Text] Tashkent--The draft of a general plan for the 
reconstruction and development of Uzbekistan's 
telecommunications networks to the year 2015 has been completed. 
Assumed as a basis were the recommendations of the international 
union of electrical communications, which proceeded from the 
fact of an extremely poorly developed telephone system in the 
republic, especially in the village. 
  More than 2,500 rural population centers in Uzbekistan do 
not 
have a telephone. By the year 2015, the instrument will be in 72 
out of each hundred rural families. In cities where fiber-optic 
communications will be developed, the capacity will grow to 3.3 
million numbers, and out of each 100 families, 90 will have 
apartment telephones. A Transasiatic-European fiber-optic cable 
line passing through the territory of Uzbekistan will unite 
China with Western Europe. To satisfy the internal requirements 
of the mass installation of a telephone system, the republic 
will require not less than $20 billion, which it generally 
cannot afford. But, then, in international business, you cannot 
do without the establishment of joint enterprises and foreign 
investments. The famous German Siemens and Alkatel firms and the 
Japanese association for assistance to international 
cooperation, which unites 216 large companies, have shown a 
serious interest in Uzbek projects.

<F P=106> [Article by Oleg Zhirnov: "Ghosts Have Appeared in the Duma"] </F>
  [Text] Supernatural things sometimes happen in our young 
Russian parliament. On 13 April the state Duma was disturbed by 
the news of the NATO bombing of Serbian positions in Bosnia. 
They decided to consider the situation, as speaker Ivan Rybkin 
put it, "concretely and specifically." And immediately the 
deputies turned their attention to the fact that Andrey Kozyrev 
was not among them at this difficult time. 
  The renowned minister and unknown deputy Kozyrev had failed 
to grace the Duma with his visits previously as well. But here a 
case like this! Some of the Duma members lost their patience. 
Vladimir Semago angrily demanded that "the deputy from the 
Murmanskiy electoral district working also as minister of 
foreign affairs, Kozyrev, be in attendance in our ranks, that he 
be here if only for two or three sessions." 
  Kozyrev did not show up that day and his deputy, Sergey 
Lavrov, answered for him to the people's elect. And yet--and 
here is the supernatural part!--the elusive deputy minister, it 
turns out, was at the session of the state Duma on the morning 
of 13 April. He was--if you are to believe the information from 
the electronic registration. 
  It was not so easy for the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA observer to get 
his hands on this information. Although it is not secret, 
according to a just adopted regulation of the state Duma, 
permission for access to the information from the electronic 
system shall be granted "to individuals other than deputies" by 
the chairman of the committee for organizing the work of the 
lower chamber. They were warned in the committee that granting 
permission depends on the newspaper's position toward the state 
Duma. Ultimately it turned out that OBSHCHAYA GAZETA was "not 
the worst newspaper" and the permission was given. 
  Taking up 27 sheets, the registration table contains a good 
deal of interesting information. Above all--about the diligence 
of the people's elect. It is understandable that the electronic 
system does not know the reasons for the absence of a 
deputy--they can be quite respectable, nonetheless.... 
  First place in terms of the number of sessions missed is 
held 
by a group of deputies who simultaneously hold eminent posts in 
the structures of executive power. And the undoubted record 
holder among them is A. Kh. Zaveryukha: If one is to believe the 
electronic registration, he did not manage to attend a single 
session. Slightly behind him are two other deputy prime 
ministers-A.B. Chubays (attended four sessions out of 50) and 
A.N. Shokhin (six sessions). Minister of Culture Ye.Yu. Sidorov 
as a deputy attended seven sessions, Minister of Justice Yu.Kh. 
Kalmykov--nine, and Minister of Labor G.G. Melikyan--10. Added 
to this group of deputies are A.L. Adamishin, first deputy 
minister of foreign affairs (he was at six sessions out of 50) 
and V.P. Kvasov, leader of the government apparatus (he was at 
eight sessions). 
  Two other "risk groups" consisting of deputies who also seem 
to be engaged on the outside (entrepreneurs and eminent 
scholars) are more disciplined. Most frequently absent is 
academician-economist N.Ya. Petrakov (he attended only 12 
sessions). 
  In this position the journalist has a right to ask a number 
of rhetorical questions. Why, for example, do the voters need 
deputies who do not attend sessions? Does their behavior not 
contradict the spirit and letter of the Constitution, which says 
that "deputies of the state Duma work on a permanent 
professional basis"? Finally, for what services do the absentee 
deputies enjoy the rights, privileges, and benefits granted to 
members of parliament? It is not mandatory to answer these 
questions. Even before the elections it was clear that the 
deputy prime ministers and ministers would not be going to the 
sessions in the Duma. And why they were elected is a question 
not for them but for the voters. 
  But God be with them, the ministers--at least they have 
other 
duties that also are for the state. Moreover, they do not 
receive deputy wages. It is more difficult to understand the 
"free politicians," especially the leaders of factions and 
parties, who do not grace the Duma with their attention either. 
About half of the plenary sessions were missed by Ye.T. Gaydar, 
G.A. Yavlinskiy, and V.P. Lukin, and more than half--by B.G. 
Fedorov. Understandably, leaders of parties, factions, and 
deputy groups have other business than sitting in parliament, 
but none of them was forced to do this, and even today it is not 
too late to refuse the mandate. 
  The "continuous absence" of a number of deputies at plenary 
sessions is, incidentally, only the surface. As it turned out in 
the case with Andrey Kozyrev, attendance registered by the 
electronic system is sometimes worse than out-and-out failure to 
show up. According to the figures from the registration the 
deputy minister was at that morning meeting on 13 April, 
although no one within the walls of the Duma saw him or could 
have seen him. It turns out that this is a fairly simple natural 
miracle: A.V. Kozyrev turned his deputy card over to his 
colleague in the faction, who not only marks the minister as 
present but also, possibly, votes for him. (The OBSHCHAYA GAZETA 
observer could give the name of the deputy who has Kozyrev's 
card in his pocket, but is refraining from this because of 
ethical reasons.) This is an undoubted violation of the 
regulations of the state Duma, not to mention propriety. 
  Unfortunately, turning their cards over to someone else has 
become a bad habit. The pathetic explanation: "Where is the Duma 
subcommittee on ethics looking!"--would sound like a weak report 
on inoffensive pranks. For the essence of the matter is that the 
fictional, "electronic" presence of the deputies raises doubts 
about the results of the voting. More than once already the 
chairman has garnered the votes he lacks literally one by one. 
In such cases one or two fictional votes could bring about the 
most "fatal" decisions.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Protsenko: "To the Kremlin With Your </F>
Desk"] 
  [Text] The chairman of the Coordination Council of 
the Business Roundtable of Russia, Ivan Kivelidi, has written 
letters to President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin. The letters are different. To the president: 
"Participants in the Business Roundtable of Russia are convinced 
that the interests of Russian property owners are alien to 
you..." To the prime minister: "Participants in the Business 
Roundtable of Russia note with alarm a certain distancing of the 
government from the needs and concerns of the Russian 
entrepreneurs...." 
  The letters differ but the essence is the same: The 
entrepreneurs want to have their own organ for administration 
and coordination at the state level. The authorities would also 
like to have some organ for management of the entrepreneurs. But 
the entrepreneurs, in turn, do not want what the authorities 
want. Incomprehensible? 
  Let us begin at the beginning. One cannot say that our 
domestic businessmen are functioning without state oversight 
now. Russian entrepreneurs have at least seven nannies. First, 
the State Committee for Industrial Policy and Entrepreneurship. 
Second, the department for organization of management of 
property and entrepreneurship in the government apparatus. 
Third, the committee for support of small enterprises and 
entrepreneurship under the State Committee for Administration of 
State Property. Fourth, the Federal Fund for Support of 
Entrepreneurship in Antimonopoly Policy. And there are also the 
corresponding departments in the Ministry of Economics, the 
Ministry of Finance, the president's apparatus... 
  We know what happens with seven nannies. Russian 
businessmen, 
gathering as early as October at the constituent congress of the 
Roundtable, decided that they need a single chief. Something 
like a minister, or in the extreme case a state committee 
chairman. So they wrote in their resolution: "An important step 
toward strengthening the union of entrepreneurs and the 
government would be the transformation of the currently existing 
Council for the Development of Entrepreneurship under the 
Government of the Russian Federation into an organ of state 
administration--the State Committee for Affairs of Private 
Business." 
  The businessmen asked and the authorities responded: There 
immediately appeared a project for the creation of a kind of 
Federal Center for the Development of Entrepreneurship with its 
own scientific research institute and All-Russian Exhibition 
Center (VDNKh) as a base. The enterprises, however, howled: We 
do not want a bureaucratic "superstructure," we ourselves want... 
  "The terrible thing was that an organ for directive 
management of entrepreneurship was created," explains the 
official secretary of the Coordinating Council of the Business 
Roundtable of Russia, Aleksandr Orlov. "Although one can 
understand the bureaucrats: The sphere of state business is 
being eaten away and the management structure is spreading. The 
version of 'reorientation' toward private business seems very 
tempting. It is another matter that the idea was stillborn: The 
entrepreneur can only trust another entrepreneur and then not 
all the time. But a bureaucrat... 
  In general private business "formed a solid front"--and the 
idea of a federal center died a noble death. But... 
  "We learned recently that this plan had been exhumed," says 
Aleksandr Orlov. "And now they are trying to push it through in 
a new version, in the form of some kind of 'consolidation 
commission.'" 
  In the opinion of the businessmen the motive force for the 
plan came from bureaucrats in the structures of power, who 
understand that sooner or later Russian entrepreneurs will 
achieve the creation of the kind of coordination-consultation 
organ they need. And then the "seven nannies" will have nothing 
to do. And who wants that? 
  An unseen war is now in progress in the corridors of 
power--the bureaucrats and the entrepreneurs are constantly 
exchanging "responsive-warning blows," trying to work to get 
ahead of the enemy. Ivan Kivelidi made his next move today by 
proposing the draft of the presidential edict "On the Creation 
of a Federal Public-State System for the Development of Free 
Entrepreneurship in the Russian Federation." The main point of 
the plan, of course, is to form in the government structure a 
federal administration for affairs of entrepreneurship which 
would participate in the processes of development of draft laws 
and normative documents, coordinate financial support for small 
and medium-sized business, assist entrepreneurs in acquiring 
state orders, etc. Actually, they are proposing the creation of 
a legal lobbying structure which defends the interests of 
private business at the government level. And not only at the 
government level. The draft of the edict envisions the creation 
of the position of adviser to the president of Russia on affairs 
of entrepreneurship. 
  In general, it seems, Russian private business no longer has 
much hope of a favorable disposition on the part of the 
government. In previous letters from Ivan Kivelidi to Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin one can read, for example, these 
lines: "No recommendation, no warning, and no information we 
have presented to the Council of Ministers has ever been heeded 
or accepted." Or: "Unfortunately, the Council for Development of 
Entrepreneurship has received neither a reaction nor a response 
from the government apparatus to the memorandum submitted to you 
previously. The conviction is growing stronger that certain 
forces are deliberately isolating Russian business circles from 
the government...." 
  Consider that Kivelidi wrote these lines while holding the 
position (public) of chairman of the Council for Development of 
Entrepreneurship under the Government of the Russian 
Federation. That is, this was not some kind of stranger. 
But, as he wrote in another message to the prime minister, "the 
apparatus lobby turned out to be stronger." 
  Now Ivan Kivelidi is the chairman of the coordination 
council 
of an organization which includes more than 80 movements, 
unions, and large private firms and banks of Russia (for 
example, the Most group, Moscow Real Estate, the Stolichnyy 
Bank, the RSPP, the International Brokers Guild, the Volga Union 
of Business Circles, the Union of Entrepreneurs of the Northern 
Caucasus, etc.). But so far it does not seem that this "lobby" 
has gained any respect in the White House. Who knows, perhaps in 
the Kremlin the Business Roundtable of Russia will find more 
attentive patrons.

<F P=106> [Article by Vsevolod Vilchek: "Moratorium on Impeachment"] </F>
  [Text] Although the data of sociological surveys (including 
those of my own service) have to treated with great caution, I 
feel that some things can nevertheless be judged quite 
definitely--for example, what concerned the public most and 
least in recent weeks. 
  The biggest worries were crime, inflation, and insecurity 
(these were named by 40-60 percent of the 2,000 Muscovites we 
polled). What worries them least are the political maneuvers "at 
the top," including those connected with the treaty on public 
accord (around nine percent of the respondents mentioned these). 
  This might seem paradoxical: After all, the accord of 
various 
political forces should give citizens a stronger sense of 
security, promising perhaps not a bright future, but at least a 
less dismal one. There is no paradox here, however. We asked: 
"Do you believe that the different parties, social movements, 
Duma factions, and branches of government can reach an accord 
and work together constructively?" Only 7.5 percent said they 
did believe this, 54.5 percent said they did not, another 25.5 
percent did not say no, but did express doubts, and the rest had 
no response. 
  Our fellow citizens have no doubt at all that the ceremonial 
signing of this kind of paper could take place, but they have 
strong doubts about the authenticity and significance of this 
protocol of good intentions and, in general, are not inclined to 
believe that the main participants in this undertaking represent 
the public interest rather than personal and private interests. 
This is shocking in view of the fact that it has been only 100 
days since the election. When we asked the respondents whether 
they knew the names of their deputies in the State Duma, only 
seven percent answered that they did, and only five percent said 
they still expected the deputies to live up to their 
expectations. 
  If Yeltsin's persistent attempts to conclude a 
supra-constitutional agreement with his opponents have not 
aroused any public enthusiasm and clearly do not have the same 
meaning as last April's referendum, what is their real purpose? 
The sociological data suggested two interrelated hypotheses. 
  The society has reached a definite impasse. Today 65 percent 
of the people in Moscow are living below the poverty line, and 
around 10 percent do not have enough to eat. Hidden unemployment 
in Moscow, judging by an extremely accurate indicator--the 
abnormally high ratings of daytime television programs--has 
already reached 15-20 percent and could take the form of clear 
and obvious unemployment at any time. The people have endured 
even worse problems in the past, of course, but not when they 
have had to watch others race by in a Mercedes or have had to 
see the advertisements for the Harlequin Night Club, for 
example, offering businessmen erotic floor shows, roulette, and 
a dinner menu including lobster and baby alligator ragout. 
  There are extremely strong feelings of nostalgia in the 
society--no, not for the actual past, but for a lost social 
ideal. The ratings for old movies of the socialist realism genre 
provide a more precise indication of this than our ambiguous 
surveys. In reality, however, the ideological vacuum is being 
filled more and more by Orthodoxy, which is being inculcated as 
the state religion, and by a brand of nationalism with an 
emphasis on anti-Semitism, which one out of every four 
Muscovites feels no need to conceal today. 
  The changes are irreversible, of course: Only 15 percent of 
the inhabitants of the capital (half of them retired) believe 
that Russia should get back on the socialist track. In other 
words, people seem to be "in favor of reform." Only 14 percent 
of the Muscovites, however, said that they had the necessary 
qualities to succeed in life and that they feel like outsiders 
in the society. The society seems to be stuck: It does not want 
to go back, but it cannot move forward because it has not found 
a suitable course to follow. 
  The only thing that unites the vast majority of people today 
is their total ignorance of current developments. In the past 
the public was told that the reforms were being obstructed by 
the conflict between the branches of the government. What is 
obstructing them today? Evidently, just one thing: their own 
fundamental infeasibility. If members of the president's team 
have not realized this yet, the purpose of the document on civil 
accord is to provoke discord and find a scapegoat. If they have 
realized this, then the agreement has another purpose: a radical 
adjustment of the reforms, probably in the social democratic 
spirit, to prevent social upheavals, and a consequent change in 
political points of reference. It is the president's job to 
achieve this change in a relatively peaceful manner by 
sacrificing a few secondary officials who can easily be accused 
of corruption and can then fill the vacuum in Lefortovo Prison. 
  There is one important fact, however, that raises questions 
about the value of this hypothesis. We asked the 2,000 
Muscovites whether B.N. Yeltsin had a chance of being re-elected 
for a second term--15.5 percent said yes, 52.5 percent said no, 
24.5 percent were not certain, and 11.5 percent had no response. 
The president's staff probably has comparable data. They could 
be obtained from the counterintelligence service, which managed 
to come within 1-2 percent of the outcome of the December 
election in its predictions. If this is true, then the 
declaration of accord is certainly an ultimatum, as G. Zyuganov 
said, but an extraordinary ultimatum, stipulating the terms and 
nature of payment for the opposition's signature--direct access 
to public opinion, signifying the start of the election 
campaign. Because the text of the agreement says nothing about 
any specific anti-crisis measures, which would warrant 
agreement, the accord is essentially nothing more than a 
moratorium on impeachment. 
  Incidentally, this is also a noble goal: The institution of 
a 
precedent in Russian history for a democratic change of 
government.

<F P=106> [Article by Nugzar Betaneli, director of the Institute of </F>
Sociology of Parliamentarianism, under the rubric "Television": 
"Democracy in Russia: A Lowering of Values"] 
  [Text] All of the 20th century in Russia has passed under 
the "sign of democracy," that is, in the struggle either for or 
against it. Paradoxically, what all of the country's leaders 
have in common, regardless of their real intentions, has been 
and still is an obvious indifference to the democratic 
phraseology: "popular rule," the rights and freedoms of the 
individual, etc. It is no accident that democratic rhetoric is 
to be found in almost equal measure in all Russian 
constitutions--from the "Leninist" one of 1918 up to the 
"Yeltsin" one. During the "Gorbachevian" and "Yeltsinian" 
periods the appeal to the values of democracy reached such force 
that there was hope for irreversibility of Russia's movement 
toward real democracy, toward real freedom. But recently the 
political expectations of citizens of postcommunist Russia have 
begun to assume an uncontrolled internal dynamic. "Flight from 
authoritarianism," it seems, is not happening. The political and 
economic reforms in Russia, which began in the name of 
democratic rights and freedoms, not only did not increase the 
significance of these "general human values" but even began to 
evoke an effect of rejection in the mass awareness. 
  An all-Russian public opinion poll we conducted in December 
1993 in all 12 economic regions of the country (a sampling of 
6,000 respondents) showed that the orientation of Russian voters 
toward the values of democracy and freedom of speech is 
appreciably "dying out." Five years ago it was expressed 
immeasurably more intensively and coincided with the "average" 
figures for the USSR (December 1988, the Union-wide poll with a 
sampling of 4,000 respondents). Here is how the responses to the 
following question were distributed (in percentages) then and 
now:

  Some people will look for the reason for these changes in 
the 
traditional Russian psychology, in the people, their 
"authoritarian past"; some people will look--in the objective 
circumstances, in the historical situation. Although both are 
right in their own way, it would be wrong to think that "an 
authoritarian fate" is hanging over Russia or that the present 
"psychological leaning" is fatal in nature. The problem is not 
with the people but with state policy, which influences the 
sociopsychological situation in society. 
  It is this policy that creates conditions so that, for 
example, one (political, moral, sociopsychological, etc.) type 
of individual succeeds in society, another--barely survives, and 
a third--dies out altogether. In other words, it is the state 
policy, its "successes-failures," that are frequently the 
generator of various social attitudes. 
  The all-Russian poll showed that in all regions of the 
country people are bothered most by problems of purely physical 
survival, particularly living conditions, the economic situation 
(65 percent), the condition of law and order and the fight 
against crime (57 percent), the ecological situation (26 
percent) and, to a lesser degree--the sociopolitical situation 
(8 percent) and the spiritual, moral-psychological situation (15 
percent). The social situation in the country has become fairly 
strained and many are not perceiving the changes that are taking 
place. To the question "can you say that now your time has 
come?" most of the population of the country who were 
questioned--79 percent--answered "no." 
  The type of individual produced by today's political and 
economic situation and the one that takes root in Russian 
society more and more successfully can be seen from the example 
of the dynamic of the mass awareness of Muscovites. A recent 
poll of the Institute of Sociology of Parliamentarianism (31 
March 1994) showed that even in the comparatively "democratic" 
Moscow there has been a marked rise of the level of 
sociopsychological intolerance of people with different views. 
Thus there has been an increase from 28 percent (May 1993) to 43 
percent (March 1994) of the number of people who think that not 
everyone in Russia (people, parties, movements, mass media) 
should have freedom of speech to an equal degree and another 2 
percent think that freedom of speech should be restricted for 
everyone, 13 percent "find it hard to answer," and only less 
than half of the Muscovites (42 percent) are convinced that 
"everyone should have freedom of speech to an equal degree." 
  Every fourth Muscovite exhibits religious intolerance as 
well: 21 percent think that "not all religions in Russia should 
enjoy equal rights" and another 4 percent suggest "limiting the 
rights of all religions." Moreover, every third respondent (32 
percent) thinks that the Russian mass media have too much 
freedom of speech (compare: in May 1993--22 percent) and that 
the Russian leaders should more strictly control the content of 
publications and materials of the domestic mass media (35 
percent). 
  Among certain people social intolerance is not limited to an 
aversion to freedom of speech but extends even to human rights: 
Only 68 percent think that "all citizens of Russia should have 
equal rights," 17 percent, on the contrary, think that "the 
rights of certain citizens should be restricted," and 15 percent 
find it difficult to determine their opinion. The 
"recommendations" of some of the respondents regarding "the 
signs according to which the rights of 'certain citizens' should 
be restricted" are curious: 7 percent of those questioned advise 
limiting rights "according to convictions, affiliation with 
parties and social organizations," 4 percent--"according to 
national and race indicators," 2 percent--"according to official 
position," 1 percent--"according to place of residence," 1 
percent--"according to property position," and 4 
percent--"according to other indicators." 
  To be fair, one must note that the negativism toward 
"others'" rights is strangely interwoven in the mass awareness 
with a surprisingly indifferent attitude toward their own 
rights. Thus 31 percent of Muscovites do not know their 
constitutional rights at all and 39 percent find it difficult to 
name specifically the rights and freedoms that are most 
important in their view. 
  At the same time many are aware that they are living in a 
nondemocratic world. Thus only 14 percent of Muscovites consider 
present-day Russia to be a democratic country (August 1992--21 
percent). And the majority--68 percent--consider present-day 
Russia an undemocratic country (August 1992--59 percent) and 18 
percent--find it "difficult to decide." Nonetheless, the 
"nondemocratism" of Russia perceived by many people is not 
causing mass protest. 
  With this level of knowledge of their constitutional rights 
and with this attitude toward the values of democracy, it is not 
surprising that 30 percent of Muscovites are prepared to 
"support a policy of improving social order and the standard of 
living in the country at the expense of restricting democratic 
freedoms," 28 percent--"find it difficult to determine" their 
position, and only 42 percent say "no" to such a turn of events.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "In a Minute of Distressing </F>
Reflections"] 
  [Text] "I am not the first warrior, I am not the last, 
Russia will be sick for a long time," wrote Aleskandr Blok 
sometime during a moment of doubt, a moment of distressing 
reflections about Russia's fate. Today, almost 100 years later, 
reflections and doubts are no less distressing, but thanks to 
the development of the social sciences we, as opposed to the 
poet, can express them in a more strict, more scientific form: 
"Having lost the status of a superpower, Russia moved swiftly 
into the ranks first of all of the developing and now of the 
regressing countries. It is possible that the danger of global 
military conflict does not threaten us, but internal 
instability, chaos, economic ruin and the psychology of losers 
comprise no fewer threats to national security." 
  This quotation, having a clearly apocalyptic character, was 
taken from the work "The National Doctrine of Russia (Problems 
and Priorities)" which was prepared by the not unknown 
"RAU-Corporation." [For a translation of excerpts from this 
work, see the FBIS Report; Central Eurasia, Number 
FBIS-USR-94-047 dated 4 May 94]. Despite some painful prognoses 
(the transformation of inflation into galloping hyperinflation, 
gorwth of prices, fall of production, corruption of society, 
increase in crime, demographic regression, danger of a social 
explosion, etc.)the book also contains, frankly speaking, some 
unusually optimistic ideas. It is true that these are more 
general in character: "Russia is a great country with a great 
history, a difficult present and a great future. We believe 
that the approaching 21st century is the century of Russia." At 
first glance these prognoses about the near future cancel out 
these hopes for a kingdom of Freedom, Peace, Spirituality and 
Democracy. But this is only at first glance. 
  In recent times one often hears the opinion that the 
situation in Russia cannot be forecast. According to all 
appearances, the very term "non-forecastable 
[neprognoziruyemost]" can, from a historical point of view, be 
understood as "it will be so lousy that there is nothing to even 
talk about." Such a position is accessible to many, although it 
is not very constructive. The authors of the "National 
Doctrine," in no way closing their eyes to today's problems, not 
only try to predict the situation, but also offer some 
short-term goals which may be general, but nonetheless help us 
to see a picture of civil peace and harmony. "As soon as a 
strong and responsible government is consolidated Russia will 
once again become a center of attraction." 
  The reestablishment of Russia as a specific world, as a 
specific civilization, one of the subjects of world 
history--this is the goal for our country. And the main task of 
the patriotic movement is to avoid spontaneity, which can direct 
the development of our country into the channel of reaction. 
Today, in the opinion of the book's authors, we should turn our 
attention to those factors which unite us: The Motherland and 
the state. 
  One more quotation: "The main thing today is to prevent the 
weakening and e disintegration of the state. It is impossible 
to do this only by the traditional administrative-state or 
financial methods: for Russia this is small. We must resurrect 
the Russian idea which forms the basis of unity and the natonal 
doctrine which represents the goals and tasks for developing 
society recognized by the majority..." 
  "The National Doctrine" is not dogma, but an invitation to 
discussion. Reactions to the conclusions of the authors' 
collective, of course, will be extremely varied. The work 
itself is intended for those people who draft and make political 
decisions--first of all for deputies of the Federation Council. 
But not only for them. 
  The new economic structures created as a result of market 
transformations are more and more actively being included in the 
political life of society. And this is understandable: their 
activity, earlier based on purely economic factors depends to an 
ever greater degree today on those processes which are taking 
place in spheres not directly connected with business. The 
possibility of forecasting, of predicting events, is extremely 
important for them, especially under the conditions of political 
and economic instability. It is no accident that many 
entrepreneurs, without any apparent benefits for themselves, are 
cooperating with scientists. Thus the latest work of the "RAU 
Corporation" was partially financed by a private company. The 
TOO [limited liability partnership] "Group MOST" paid for the 
preparation and publication of the "National Doctrine of 
Russia." It required 180 million rubles in order for this book 
to see the light of day. 
  In the words of the leader of "Group MOST's" analytic 
service 
Ye. Ivanov, the sponsors do not completely share some of the 
ideas and suggestions of the "National Doctrine." First of all 
the idea of the economic basis of the doctrine gives rise to 
criticism. In Ivanov's opinion it has a one-sided character. No 
constructive alternative is provided in the criticism of the 
ideas and practices of monetarism. There is no new "model" of 
social-economic progress. 
  The section "Military Security and the Military Policy of 
Russia" received particular criticism. History shows that it is 
better not to have enemies than to fight with them... 
  Nonetheless the leadership of "Group-MOST" sees this work as 
"an interesting and necessary attempt to delineate and to a 
well-known degree work out a set of problems, without which 
thought it will be impossible to move ahead." 
  As regards the authors of the "National Doctrine", in the 
words of the leader of the authors' collective A.I. Podberezkin 
"the RAU-Corporation responded with pleasure to the suggestion 
of Group MOST on writing this work. "If there are new orders in 
the future we are ready to fulfill them--that is our work." 
  Someone, probably I.A.[Joseph] Brodsky said that if we 
elected a government according to their reading experience, and 
not their political program, there would be fewer ills on earth. 
It seems that this statement is just, to a certain degree, and 
in our case the experience gathered in the book "The National 
Doctrine of Russia" should help our society avoid many 
convulsions and cataclysms peculiar to it in the past.

<F P=106> [Excerpts from Eduard Limonov's book "Limonov Against </F>
Zhirinovskiy: Limonov Against Zhirinovskiy: Obscure Facts From 
the Life of the LDPR Leader"] 
  [Text] "Limonov Against Zhirinovskiy" is the title of 
writer Eduard Limonov's new book on the subject of his former 
political ally Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. For a while Limonov was a 
member of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and was even a 
minister in its "shadow cabinet." 
  We are offering our readers excerpts from E. Limonov's 
new book. The book itself will soon be released by the Konets 
Veka publishing house. 
<H5>  Parisian Secrets </H5>
  On 19 September 1992 Zhirinovskiy called me from Moscow and 
said that they were arriving on the 23rd. He me asked to arrange 
for a meeting with the National Front and with Chirac. He also 
asked me to get in touch with the Russian Embassy. He said that 
his hosts in Paris will be "our businessmen, a certain banker." 
  The next day at 0800 I was awaken by Zhirinovskiy: "Eduard, 
please get me the telephone numbers of Chirac and Pasqua. I will 
talk to them myself." I promised that I would, but not before 
1000, and besides, he should not count on me getting their home 
telephone numbers--this is not Russia, you have to follow 
protocol in everything. If I get the numbers of their personal 
secretaries, this will be a great achievement. By 1000 I 
delivered to Minakov the telephone numbers of the RPR [Rally for 
the Republic] chairman and Paris Mayor Chirac and former 
Minister of Interior Pasqua. If only the LDP people knew what 
efforts this had cost me! And what strings I had to pull! 
Zhirinovskiy clearly had an exaggerated notion of his fame. The 
French newspapers did write about him, but not much, during the 
presidential elections in Russia in 1991, but in September 1992 
he remained a "dark horse" for this country. Chiefs of the 
international departments of major newspapers asked me "who?" 
when I called and invited them to a press conference. 
  Political figures who had never heard of him were not 
anxious 
to meet him, while those whose secretaries understood who 
Zhirinovskiy was actively did not wish to meet him. A majority, 
however, completely indifferent to his name, were simply busy; 
besides, meetings with leaders of parties in France are not 
arranged on a moment's notice: "Is is all right if we drop in? 
We are right around the corner, a 10-minute walk." I was 
completely dumbfounded to learn that Zhirinovskiy and his team 
nevertheless made several raids on parties' headquarters, 
uninvited, the only calls being to find out the addresses 
associated with the telephone numbers I gave them. The result of 
these raids, in my opinion, was zilch: They were received by 
whichever party functionary happened to be at the headquarters 
at the time. In most cases these people even refused to provide 
their names. "If Zhirinovskiy always travels abroad this way," I 
remember thinking, "this is a deception." Returning to Russia, 
the LDP will circulate in the mass media reports of meetings 
with leaders of French parties. And the Russian masses, seeing 
among them the name of Le Pen, which they are more or less 
familiar with, will think naively that Vladimir Volfovich 
received a warm welcome in the political establishment of 
France, while at other parties the people who talked to him may 
have been secretaries on duty or doormen. 
  On Friday 25 September I arrived at the hotel Amina (where 
Zhirinovskiy and his team stayed) earlier than 0945, because I 
wanted to make sure that everything was going as it was supposed 
to. 
  We are going to visit Mr. Le Pen at home, not at the party 
headquarters. We drove down the Champs-Elysees. French and 
Kazakh flags were flying everywhere: Kazakhstan's President 
Nazarbayev was in Paris at the time. I think there was only one 
Frenchman who knew that these were Kazakhstan's 
flags--Mitterrand. 
  Passing Montrait Park [as transliterated], we approached the 
cast iron gate of our destination. We were led upstairs to a 
large living room with yellow-ocher wallpaper. Yellow roses 
adorned the coffee table between two yellow leather coaches. A 
couple of marble busts in the corners of the room. The terrace 
to the left of the entrance provided a magnificent view of Paris 
from the Saint-Cloud hill; the right terrace opened to the 
garden. We were left alone. After peeking at the terraces, 
Zhirinovskiy said to Minakov: "See how politicians live 
here, Valentin Nikolayevich. This is how the head of a party 
should live! And I huddle in a two-room apartment..." 
  "Far from all political figures in France have villas, 
Vladimir Volfovich," I interjected. "Jean-Marie Le Pen inherited 
this villa from a deceased National Front member, who left the 
villa to him in his will." Zhirinovskiy stayed on the subject 
and began to talk very seriously about this being a good 
idea--to will property and apartments to a party... and that it 
would be good to include this point in the LDP rules. I thought 
that he was suffering from a middle class complex toward the 
upper class standard of living. If Zhirinovskiy ever comes to 
seize power, he will live in the fast lane and greedily grab 
property. 
  Zhirinovskiy was silent throughout the entire first half of 
the meeting. It so happened that I had to talk more than the 
others. "Aside from the language problem, his knowledge of local 
politics is not great," I wrote in my diary at home the next 
day. In the end he did get into the conversation. His French is 
poor, stammering, university-level, dead, hard to understand for 
the interlocutor, because it lacks precisely the hundred or so 
most frequently used modern words. "Where did these icons come 
from?" I asked Le Pen. It turned out that he had known artist 
Ilya Glazunov for a long time--that is where the icons came 
from. He had not seen Glazunov for about 10 years, though. "What 
happened to him? He used to be nationalist and monarchist a good 
20 years ago." I explained what had happened to Glazunov. We 
started talking about the American penetration of Russia and 
France. Cultural and political. "I would prefer to eat borscht 
in a cellar than an American hamburger in McDonald's on Pushkin 
Square," said Le Pen gaily. 
  Zhirinovskiy then bragged about his only victory: 6.2 
million 
votes in the presidential elections. And said that his LDP is 
the largest right-wing party in Europe. Le Pen, being a polite 
host, did not argue. He in turn asked Zhirinovskiy why his party 
had such an unsuitable name: "Here, Mr. Zhirinovskiy, the 
liberal democrats hate the National Front; they are our 
enemies." Stammering, Zhirinovskiy began to explain that for the 
Russian people "nationalism" brings out an association with 
Nazism (not true, Russians most often use the word "fascism." 
"German fascism," "Italian fascism"); that Russians have not yet 
matured for a party name that would include the word "national." 
As he was saying this he cast sideways glances at me. The 
Russian National Assembly and the National-Republican Party 
already existed, and in October of the same year the National 
Salvation Front [FNS] was launched. Zhirinovskiy was lying. 
  Since the LDP delegation expressed the desire (and Vladimir 
Volfovich louder than everyone else) to visit Paris' dens of 
iniquity, I took the delegation on a tour of the Pigalle with 
its sex shows and sex shops, striptease and massage parlors. The 
driver waited for us at the agreed place. I myself pass through 
this area maybe once every couple years: the noise, colors, 
advertising, dirt, and throngs of tourists are tiresome. I go 
there precisely on occasions like this--to show it to visiting 
friends and acquaintances. They, however, did not limit 
themselves to a passing look. In another seedy area of Paris, 
Saint-Denis, the talkative Vladimir Volfovich stopped several 
times and chatted with prostitutes, while other members of the 
delegation giggled shyly. I invited them all to a sex show. To a 
place where I thought the girls on the photos looked more 
tempting. We barged inside. The place turned out a bit of a dump 
and unpleasant, like a public laundry. Behind the counter was an 
oriental-looking young man, but the noise created by the 
delegation, and most of all by Zhirinovskiy (maybe he was so 
raucous out of shyness) brought out the owner, a short and 
unkempt type of undefinable oriental origin--Lebanese or 
something. The owner dropped tokens onto the counter, turned a 
handle, and left. 
  A naked girl with a face showing that she had been around 
the 
block a few times appeared behind the glass and began making 
movements to the music. We sat there in the dark for quite a 
while; then another girl appeared; they petted each other in 
rhythm with the music, but no "sexual act" promised on the 
marquee ever materialized. The lights went out. We emerged from 
the booth. In the lobby Vladimir Volfovich demanded our money 
back, yelling that the owner was a crook. The noise brought out 
of the establishment's bowels a bow-legged woman in a shawl, 
carrying a cup of tea. She turned out to be Russian! "Vladimir 
Volfovich, the hell with them, let us go!" I said. "What do you 
mean, the hell with them? Let them refund our money, or at least 
half of it. Where is the act? They promised the act, and we did 
not see any act. Did you see the act, Zhebrovskiy?" Zhebrovskiy 
said that he did not. "So let them refund half the money, or I 
will hand them over to the police!"--"Vladimir Volfovich, this 
entire industry rests on deception. If you walk in here, you are 
already permitting yourself to be deceived. One way or another 
they will cheat you." I talked him into leaving. "Who is he?" 
asked the bow-legged woman. "Zhirinovskiy?" She watched us leave 
with her mouth agape. IZVESTIYA recently reprinted from BILD 
magazine a story that had allegedly taken place in Germany: 
Vladimir Volfovich and a Russian-born prostitute. Let this story 
remain on the conscience of BILD magazine. Such an incident 
could have taken place, but I consider its darkly sadistic 
interpretation improbable. Vladimir Volfovich is more of a 
grumbling trouble-maker, who wants to get the best possible 
service for his money. He is an aggressive Philistine, not a 
Dracula. You are a prostitute? I have paid you? Cheats! They did 
not give me a full serving!--this is more his style. 
<H5>  Divorce </H5>
  The first time I saw Zhirinovskiy after Paris was on 24 
October in the hall of the Parliament Center at 2 Tsvetnoy 
Boulevard. As usual, the communists-patriots would not let him 
in their games. He did manage to be admitted into the building, 
but certainly would not let him become a member of the National 
Salvation Front. Zhirinovskiy was willing to sign anything in 
order to be accepted. He was sitting in the audience, expecting 
to be given the floor. Zyuganov, who was increasingly gaining 
momentum then (he had already squeezed out Anpilov), promised 
everything to everyone, and to me, too: "We will make you a 
member of the political council," put me in the presidium and 
let me speak that evening. But the cunning syrupy communist has 
not kept his main promise. 
  I want to dwell a little here on the National Salvation 
Front 
congress. When we speak of Zhirinovskiy, it is impossible to 
ignore the context in which he found himself in the fall. Here 
is what the political status of the opposition was by 24 October 
1992: Anpilov was not included in the Front. Zhirinovskiy was 
not included; he did enter the building but left during the 
second half of the proceedings. On the other hand, 40 boyars in 
tall hats, ceremonial generals--most of them useless or of 
little use--were included in the National Council. 
  At this juncture it should be explained that these boyars 
originated from the perestroyka elite of the Gorbachev period, 
and a considerable number even from the Brezhnev nomenklatura. 
Not a political class, they, sitting on the stage (I sat in the 
first row in the rightmost seat, but was the only one who was 
not a "former") resembled most of all precisely BOYARS--a social 
group that has done a lot of harm to Russia at all times. 
Selected by the voters (in the case of deputies) or by the 
authorities around 1990, mainly for being sympathetic to 
"reform"--then-fashionable among the voters--they were people 
from the country's past, who had an increasingly diminishing 
grasp of its present. They had been selected by rank, by the 
number of stars on their shoulder boards, loudness of voice, the 
weight of their name during the Brezhnev times, and the degree 
of frenzy in their anti-Stalin or antistagnation demagoguery. 
Their merit in 1990 was that they--people of the past--supported 
some vague "civilized" future. Such transitional groups 
inevitably appear during periods of social catastrophe, and it 
is normal that for the lack of a real political class they 
temporarily fulfill this function. I emphasize: TEMPORARILY. 
  It is quite natural that these BOYARS, incapable of 
thinking ahead (political mentality), simply changed obediently 
together with the country and the population. And when the 
country screamed, unable to bear any longer the sadistic 
experiments it had been subjected to by "Yeltsin's team," and 
the people screamed, some of the BOYARS screamed and became 
outraged together with the people, too. The 40 up on the 
stage were mostly of this kind, mere conduits of the country's 
emotions, its fear and pain. There was another group--frankly 
unprincipled ones, far more unprincipled than the CPSU 
nomenklatura had ever been. This group of BOYARS is 
characterized by a complete lack of morals and responsibility, 
as well as disarming opportunism. Just as in the past the 
boyars, their coattails pulled up, ran to Dimitriy the Pretender 
and then back to the legitimate tsar--wherever they thought the 
best opportunity would present itself, quite a few such 
"runners" appeared in the FNS. Well, a majority, to be honest. 
  During a break between sittings I happened upon a backroom, 
where all the members of the FNS organizational committee had 
gathered. They were dividing the leadership pie there, and quite 
unpleasantly at that. Unpleasantly in the sense of being 
quarrelsome and hypocritical. There was an obvious rivalry 
between Zyuganov and Konstantinov, which ended in Konstantinov's 
victory. Baburin, his cheeks flushed, upset over being elected 
only to the political council, was angrily saying something from 
the door. DEN editor Prokhanov--the man who united them all 
together with his communicative temperament and romantic 
imperialism, was silent. Nine cochairmen and a coordinator with 
two aides were elected. Konstantinov was elected coordinator. 
The communists in the leadership were clearly outnumbered by 
bearded defectors, "new patriots"--Astafyev among them. I do not 
like defectors and cannot stand those admitting "past errors." 
Therefore, the presence of some General Sterligov (he was the 
one who went to arrest the GKChP [State Committee on the State 
of Emergency] members) in the FNS was an unpleasant surprise for 
me. While I like writer Rasputin, I remember very well, however, 
that it was Gorbachev's State Council, of which Rasputin was a 
member, that on 6 September 1991 recognized the independence of 
Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. I was not the only one disgusted 
with the backroom bickering over power. An organizing committee 
member--a gaunt man who appeared to be a blue-collar worker--got 
up, noisily pushed away his chair, and said angrily: "Some 
representatives! Now they will start dividing salaries!" And 
slammed the door behind him. The Kazakhstan representative tried 
to appeal to FNS leaders from the door: "What am I to say to my 
people? Kazakhstan's Russians are waiting for concrete 
guidance--`what to do,' and you are doing what!" 
  During the second part of the congress, Zhirinovskiy was no 
longer in the audience. I think this congress pushed his 
patience beyond the limit. He could not know, of course, what 
was happening behind the scenes, but was guided by his 
instincts. He realized that he was not accepted, finally and 
irreversibly. And will not be in the future. (The reasons are 
not that important.) So he decided to look for allies in 
another camp. In order to do this, however, he had to 
change his behavior (albeit temporarily) and change the image of 
the party. There is no question that it was after the FNS 
congress that Zhirinovskiy decided to become a "centrist." Just 
as there is no doubt that it was then that he decided to take 
Jean-Marie Le Pen's advice and "purge" the LDP of "young people 
in leather who will pull his movement toward national-socialism."

<F P=106> [Article by Yakov Berger, under rubric "Central </F>
Asia--China": "`Trip to the West': New Version -- China Feels 
Out the Ground for Cooperation With the Central Asian States"] 
  [Text] Geopolitical position, economic interest, and 
cultural roots -- everything is directing China's chief 
aspirations to the East. The future beckons. In the conviction 
of Beijing strategists, the Asian-Pacific Ocean region [ATR], 
and primarily East Asia, will become in the twenty-first century 
a center of world development -- instead of the North Atlantic. 
A pledge of this is the fact that in our time the states in the 
region -- first Japan, then the "four small dragons," and, 
finally, the other ASEAN countries and, of course, China 
--discovered unparalleled capabilities for dynamic development. 
  China's main trade partners are located in the ATR. The 
basic 
foreign capital investments arrive from there. Linked with the 
immediate southeastern "underbelly" is the most ambitious plan 
for the immediate future: to create a "Large China" that would 
include not only Hongkong, which is returning to the mainland 
bosom in 1997, but also, they hope, Taiwan with its powerful 
industrial-financial potential, and possibly also, later on, the 
ethnically related Singapore. 
  Why Does China Need the West? 
  Nevertheless China, which always considered itself to be the 
center of the world, is not forgetting the three other points of 
the compass, including the West, which, true, is perceived 
chiefly in the distinctively Chinese way. It is not the West 
that, for the European, traditionally opposes the East, but the 
one that, for him, is an inseparable part of the East. We are 
talking about Central and Middle Asia. Those are the specifics 
of the view from China. 
  As long ago as the time immemorial of the first Chinese 
empires on the threshold of our era the Great Silk Route, which 
economically linked China and the West, was laid. Then, during 
the early Middle Ages, Buddhism began to spread in China, from 
India by way of Central Asia. It was by that route that the 
famous travelers came from China to gain secret knowledge. In 
order to reach their goal, they crossed the extremely high 
mountain ranges and burning deserts -- "the refuges of evil 
demons and burning winds", where the only markers along the way 
were the bleached bones of people who perished en route from 
hunger and thirst. 
  The Chinese people created dozens of legends concerning one 
of these travelers, Xuan Zang. In those legends he is presented 
as a hero who, with the aid of his true friends, overcame 9981 
obstacles and finally achieved his cherished goal -- the Western 
Kingdom. 
  Today it is much simpler to travel from China to the West. 
And it is other interests that lead the travelers there: for the 
most part, economic and political ones. 
  The dynamic growth of the Chinese economy in recent years 
has 
been fraught with the aggravation of many contradictions, among 
which the ones that definitely do not occupy the last place are 
the territorial contradictions: the growing split between the 
northern and southern regions of China, and between the western 
and eastern. The fact of the matter is that it is not China as a 
whole that is gravitating toward the East, but primarily its 
eastern and southern maritime region. It is precisely that 
region that is winning more than any other region from the 
course aimed at opening China to the outside world from the 
creation of free economic zones and the attraction of foreign 
capital. The territories within the continent, specially the 
western ones, are lagging considerably behind in economic and 
social development from the maritime region that has gone far 
ahead. 
  Further aggravation of this situation is dangerous. It can 
create in the long run a threat to the integrity of the country 
and can even lead to its disintegration, especially in the event 
of the political cataclysms that are almost inevitable in the 
future. 
  During the years when China followed the Soviet model, the 
territorial differences between eastern and western China were 
artificially equalized, primarily at the expense of restraining 
the economic growth of the eastern territories. Today this 
method is inconceivable. It is necessary to maintain at least a 
relative balance by another method: by creating incentives for 
the laggards. It is in regard that the economic ties with the 
Asian part of the former Soviet Union take on special importance. 
  Kinsmen Neighbors 
  Therefore something that is increasingly important is the 
interaction between China's borderland western territory 
--Sinkiang-Uigur Autonomous Region -- and the former Soviet 
Central Asia and Kazakhstan. The contacts between them go very 
far back into the past. Historically, ethnically, and 
culturally, this is a single region. 
  Living along both sides of the border are either peoples 
which are one and the same, or are related: Kazakhs, Kirghiz, 
Tajiks, Uzbeks, and Uigurs. With the inclusion, obviously, of 
the population that has immigrated -- in the one instance, from 
Russia, and in the other, from internal China. 
  In the twenty-first century the interests of two empires 
striving for expansion collided here: the Russian empire and the 
Manchurian empire. Unresolved border problems have remained from 
those conflicts. The fact of the matter is that it is unusually 
complicated to mark the border here: in some instances the 
border is lost in the unpopulated high mountains, and in others, 
on the contrary, it is supposed to divide pastures that are 
being intensively used on both sides. 
  The crossing of human beings and livestock across an 
imaginary border line is an ordinary matter, although formally 
it is reprehensible. There have also been frequent mass 
migrations. Large Kazakh tribes left Russia and went to Sinkiang 
after the suppression of the uprising in 1916 and during the 
1929 collectivization. Tens of thousands of Uigurs fled Sinkiang 
to the Soviet Union during the starving 1962. 
  The flourishing of Soviet-Chinese friendship in the first 
half of the 1950's enlivened the trade ties with Sinkiang. The 
Soviet Union imported various kinds of products from animal 
husbandry and raw materials, and exported machinery and 
equipment. For the sake of friendship N. S. Khrushchev, in a 
broad gesture, made China a present of a number of joint-stock 
companies that had been created in Sinkiang with the 
participation of Soviet capital. Soviet or Soviet-Chinese 
geological and other expeditions that studied the natural and 
economic resources for the development of that area operated on 
the territory of Sinkiang. 
  Chinese Colonization 
  Since time immemorial the western territories were viewed by 
the Chinese as one of the potential reservoirs for placing the 
excess manpower from the overpopulated eastern part of the 
country, with a small amount of land. The relatively unpopulated 
steppe areas, which seemed, to the Chinese who were accustomed 
to population density, to be boundless. Actually, however, those 
areas could be assimilated for vegetable husbandry only at the 
expense of the vital interests of the local livestock growers. 
  Actually the colonization always occurred only under armed 
guard, and most frequently military personnel were the settlers. 
In the nineteenth century they were Manchurian banner troops, 
and after the creation of the CPR the land was settled by an 
armed army corps of members of the Kuomintang, which was renamed 
the production and construction corps of the Chinese People's 
Liberation Army. It is obvious that this could not fail to cause 
dissatisfaction on the part of the local population. 
  Today, when China's rapid economic development makes it 
possible to lessen the demographic pressure somewhat, the 
country has ben given the opportunity to shift manpower from 
vegetable husbandry to trade, services, and construction, and 
the nature of the colonization of the West is also changing. 
Therefore, one would scarcely think that the former Soviet 
Central Asia and Kazakhstan have any basis for fearing the mass 
penetration of Chinese with the purpose of settling their 
territory and assimilating it for vegetable husbandry. 
  But the intensive use of raw-material resources is another 
matter. Under conditions when the ties between a Russia that is 
experiencing an economic slump and this region have been 
weakened, that region, naturally, turns toward China. If the 
situation does not change radically within the next few years, 
there is a serious danger that the Central Asian region will 
change from an agrarian, raw-materials appendage of Russia, to 
one degree or another, into a supplement to the economy of the 
Eastern giant.

<F P=106> [Discussion with Sergey Shakhray, minister for nationalities </F>
and regional policy, deputy prime minister, and leader of the 
Party of Russian Unity and Accord, at the ROSSIYA editorial 
office, recorded by Andrey Zhdankin; date not given: "I Am Not 
About To Become Involved in Wrangling"] 
  [Text] Politicians are always better informed than 
journalists. This applies also to Sergey Shakhray, minister for 
nationalities and regional policy and deputy prime minister. He 
is, in addition, leader of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord 
(PRES). Sergey Mikhaylovich met with the members of the 
editorial office and shared his vision of the present 
situation. 
  [Shakhray] The picture of the situation will be sufficiently 
full and accurate if it is seen from three positions, three 
levels: the state of society, then the problems and 
contradictions of the economy, and, third, how economic 
interests are superimposed on the political structure. 
  The period of diarchy: the unnatural "cohabitation" in the 
constitution of two types of power, ended tragically with the 
events of 3 and 4 October, which we consider an episode of civil 
war. The state is attempting to "crawl out" of the consequences 
and to find its feet. Society, however, does not have the 
immunity to protect itself. The recent elections confirmed that 
society is in a state of apathy. All the questions of power and 
economics may be decided within the framework of the Sadovoy 
Beltway. 
  Enough has been said about the fact that the economy is in 
profound crisis. From my viewpoint, it resembles a layer cake 
and consists of three levels linked by a system of communicating 
vessels. The upper level is the legal economy, and concerning 
this there are the basic data of the State Committee for 
Statistics, forecasters use them, and the attempts to form the 
budget are based on them. Below is the level of the shadow 
economy, and lower still, the criminal economy. All attempts to 
do anything at the legal level, to raise taxes, for example, 
lead to capital flowing to the shadow and criminal "floors." The 
legal sphere is being squeezed constantly, like shagreen leather. 
  The economic situation is being made worse by regional 
disproportions. Only 22 components of the Federation "feed" 
themselves, and the federal budget is sustained on what is 
produced on these territories, and 67 components are subsidized. 
  The actions of the government, whoever is a part of it, will 
for this reason consist of maintaining a balance between an 
austere financial policy and social explosion. Neither the 
communists nor the patriots nor the democrats (whoever calls 
himself this) can any longer deny either private property or 
land reform or attempts to transform the system of 
administration of the government of the country. Both 
territorially and politically. 
  [ROSSIYA] What should the government's priority measures be 
in this situation? 
  [Shakhray] A set of measures to bring financial discipline 
to 
bear must be engendered in the government: a reduction in the 
burden of arrears, the conveyance of funds to the addressees, a 
fight against the existence of enterprises' parallel accounts. 
It is necessary to prepare for a change in the tax system and 
move toward a sharp reduction in the rate of tax. The sole 
problem whose resolution no one is offering as yet is how to 
live between point A (the moment when taxes are sharply reduced) 
and point B (when, on account of this, there is a revitalization 
of the economy, and the treasury receives the same or even more 
funds). 
  Currently economics has become a hostage of politics. There 
is no time for it at the federal level--an unconcealed power 
struggle is under way. In politics and, through it, in economics 
also everything is being determined by the struggle of three 
politico-economic groups, elites. 
  [ROSSIYA] Which precisely? 
  [Shakhray] There are three determining sectors in our 
economy: the fuel and energy complex, the military-industrial 
complex, and the agrarian complex. The economic and political 
interests of millions of citizens and thousands of enterprises 
are tied up in these complexes. The reflection of this complex 
combination of three sectors with regional structures in 
Moscow's corridors of power signifies a complex configuration of 
the capital's political elite. More than 70 percent of the 
country's entire finance capital here is concentrated in Moscow, 
which means the impossibility of the realization of a single 
serious investment project in any region of Russia without the 
attraction of these bank resources of Moscow. 
  [ROSSIYA] Things are more or less clear when it comes to the 
elites. But what position should the authorities adopt in this 
struggle? 
  [Shakhray] The role of the government, the president, and 
parliament under such conditions is exceptionally big. They must 
assimilate the functions of arbiter among these three main 
groups and their representatives. Unless the Government of the 
Russian Federation finds a format of ascertainment of the 
interests of these complexes and ways of resolving the 
contradictions among them, the situation will become complicated 
and will periodically signify political cataclysms. 
  [ROSSIYA] As we all know, your party "distinguished" itself 
by voting in the Duma for amnesty for the Lefortovo inmates. 
Passions in this connection have not subsided even today. 
  [Shakhray] An analysis of the situation led us to conclude 
that unless there was a change in the situation, society could 
become an overheated steam boiler. It was for this reason that 
the PRES Party consciously voted for the amnesty. Prior to the 
amnesty, everything had been prepared for shooting in April-May: 
an ultimatum to the president and resignation of the government, 
up to and including the power version. The publication of 
Version 1 was a trial balloon for the elimination of the entire 
power Olympus for its replacement by a new administration. But 
society gained a breathing-space. We have time until 
September-October, I believe. All problems of the sharing of 
power must be resolved at the 1996 elections. A shorter 
timeframe would be an attempt to rush to divide up power without 
the rules of the game having been agreed. 
  [ROSSIYA] Sergey Mikhaylovich, the problem of Chechnya is, 
evidently, one of the most acute for Russia. The negotiations 
are proceeding in very contradictory fashion, and there is no 
way out of this situation in sight, it would seem. What is the 
situation now? 
  [Shakhray] The sequence of the decisionmaking chain is this: 
a message of the president, a decree of the government, acts of 
the State Duma and the Federation Council. A common approach to 
the Chechen problem for all organs of power has been observed in 
accordance with this format for the first time. 
  The approach is built on a recognition of the impossibility 
of a power solution of the question. Then, and primarily, 
affirmation of the fact of multiple authority in Chechnya. This 
demands the conclusion that a political settlement of the 
conflict means negotiations with all real political forces: with 
Dudayev and with Nadterechniy District and with the Provisional 
Council and with the illegally dissolved Checheno-Ingush 
Republic Supreme Soviet Presidium. The subject of the 
consultations is a treaty on a delineation of authority and 
terms of reference. 
  The negotiations should begin momentarily, their purpose 
being the treaty. But signatures to it will only be appended 
following free elections in Chechnya. If they are held this 
year, very well, in 1995, certainly. We are not dictating or 
determining the timeframe. At this time we, I allude to the 
federal authorities, are prepared to discuss and tackle specific 
issues. I, for example, am currently dealing with pensions for 
the citizens of Chechnya. 
  [ROSSIYA] Could it be that this prudent path will not be 
realized and that separate negotiations will begin once again? 
  [Shakhray] As long as I am working here, I will be 
responsible for all negotiations. If there is a retreat from 
this format, I will simply step aside because this would then be 
deception. 
  [ROSSIYA] How do you evaluate the policy in respect to the 
Cossacks, does it not look, rather, like flirting? Another state 
committee for the Cossacks is being set up. A democratic 
government is attempting to support a public organization whose 
mission is the restoration of Russia within the 1914 borders, 
which is not taken seriously. 
  [Shakhray] I know what is making this committee's ears 
"stick 
out." It is the manifestation of an amateurish approach, on the 
other hand, the uncoordinated work of two departments--the 
Executive Office of the President and the government. State 
committees may be created only following a recommendation of the 
prime minister and within the system of executive power. The 
formation of the above committee by someone else is the promise 
of a carrot, which will in a week or two be taken away. 
  It is particularly dangerous acting this way in respect to 
the Cossacks. The Cossacks are 2.5 million people, and with 
their families, more than 10 million. They are capable in almost 
any part of Russia of putting together a detachment of 100,000 
men within three days. This is a force which could be 
unconstructive in certain situations. 
  The state should say that the debate as to whether the 
Cossacks are a "people" or "not a people" is for scholars. The 
Cossacks are interested in a state from the viewpoint of public 
service. This is a particular type of public service, military, 
border service primarily, included. The community is issued 
land, and when the Cossack goes "to arms," the community works 
the land for him and supports his family. Land legislation has 
been drawn up on these matters here also. 
  [ROSSIYA] In order for the concept to become a guide to 
action, not simply an interesting idea of Sergey Shakhray's, 
should some documents be signed? 
  [Shakhray] The basic provisions of the concept of official 
policy in respect to the Cossacks and the assignments pertaining 
to the preparation of drafts of the corresponding prescriptive 
enactments have already been signed by the prime minister. There 
is a Security Council decision. 
  For me the revival of the Cossacks is a good opportunity for 
the resolution (albeit partial) of a very serious geopolitical 
problem. Thirty-two million persons reside here at this time 
between the Urals and the Far East. According to the forecasts, 
8-10 million will remain on this entire vast territory by the 
year 2010. China, Japan, and Korea are looking in this 
direction. No wars would be needed with such a development of 
events, territories could "fall away" from Russia of their own 
accord. If the Cossacks are implanted there along the border--if 
they are given land free of charge, taxes for them are 
abolished, and they are allowed to live and work the land--they 
would thereby strengthen the borders. 
  [ROSSIYA] It is being rumored in the journalist fraternity 
that your appointment as deputy prime minister was compensation, 
a counterweight for the departure of Gaydar upstairs, and a new 
rapprochement with the president? 
  [Shakhray] I do not regard Gaydar as an alternative to 
myself. I believe that the dependence here is totally different. 
We have to wait for the allocation of duties. Aside from 
regional and nationalities policy, the government's interaction 
with the media and parliament will, possibly, be entrusted to 
me. I will not ultimately be entrusted with the press--it is too 
important a sector--but I could perfectly well be entrusted with 
exchanging abuse in the Duma. I am not about to become involved 
in wrangling, for that matter, I am of a mind, like the 
government as a whole, for constructive interaction.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Anatolyevich Pashin, department head </F>
in State Legal Directorate of RF Presidential Administration, by 
Leonid Sharov; date and place not given: "Sergey Pashin: `Trial 
by Jury Is Not a Show, but a New Philosophy'"] 
  [Text] Whether we like it or not, jury trials are 
back in Russia. Attorneys, predictably, were immediately divided 
into passionate supporters or imperturbable opponents of the 
restored legal institution. After Igor Tsykunov's article "Jury 
Performance for Foreigners" was published in OBSHCHAYA GAZETA, 
No. 14/39 of 8-14 April, describing the first jury trial in 
Ryazan, people were irritated. It seemed to be just another 
campaign: First they came up with non-alcoholic weddings and now 
they are promoting jury trials. It is easy and safe to reject 
the new and unfamiliar (even when it did exist in the 
long-forgotten past), but paving the way for it, especially at a 
time of pervasive legal nihilism, is a different matter.... 
  That is why we interviewed one of the "pavers"--Sergey 
Pashin, department head in the State Legal Directorate of the RF 
president's administration. 
  [Sharov] Sergey Anatolyevich, it seems there has been enough 
criticism of the State Legal Directorate for the restoration of 
the jury trial.... 
  [Pashin] More than enough. Furthermore, many of our 
opponents 
are doing this because of what might be called a historical 
bias. When they argue the inadvisability of juries, they make 
references to the trial of Vera Zasulich, who fired a gun at a 
tsarist official and was acquitted by a jury, and to Katyusha 
Maslova. The most erudite are also invoking the "Brothers 
Karamazov." Let us take a look, however, at the history of the 
Soviet courts. We could spend months recalling the unjust, 
immoral, and illegal verdicts of our judges. This was a system 
of injustice! It administered revenge. It was a conveyor belt. 
It killed people--and these were real people, not fictional 
characters. 
  [Sharov] How is a jury trial better than a conventional 
trial? 
  [Pashin] The jury is not encumbered by bureaucratic 
duplicity. Anything can be written down on paper: the 
presumption of innocence, adversary procedure.... But what is 
the reality? The conveyor belt I mentioned. The defense of 
strictly corporate interests. Who administers justice in our 
country? It is a bureaucrat! One of the fundamental principles 
of his existence is that one hand washes the other. The opinion 
of the procurator is much more important to a judge than the 
opinion of the accused. Here is what we always hear in the 
courts: Why are you so concerned about the guilty party! You 
see, the defendant is referred to as the guilty party. I know 
one judge who has been on the bench for 18 years and who was so 
surprised when she was told that there are no guilty parties in 
a trial court. After all, a person is guilty only after the 
verdict acquires legal force. Our procurator does not have to 
show up in court to support criminal charges. Many cases are 
tried in his absence. Then the functions of the procurator are 
assumed by the judge, usually involuntarily, but sometimes even 
by choice. Is this done in the interest of justice? If not, then 
what interests does it serve? It keeps the conveyor belt running 
smoothly. In a jury trial the procurator does not simply press 
charges; he has to prove the accusation. There were complaints 
after the very first trial by jury in Saratov and after the 
Ryazan trial with which the readers of OBSHCHAYA GAZETA are 
familiar: The punishment for these hardened murderers was too 
lenient, people said; they should have been sentenced to much 
longer prison terms, if not something worse. What was the reason 
for the mitigation of the punishment, and even the acquittal of 
the defendant in Ryazan? Why did the jurors arrive at these 
verdicts? Because the prosecution's investigators did not 
collect enough evidence, and the prosecuting attorneys did not 
present enough evidence to the court (take note of this: I did 
not say, to the judge). Would you want jurors to arrive at a 
guilty verdict on the basis of the "results" of the usual kind 
of investigation, basing their conclusions on a haphazardly 
prepared case? 
  [Sharov] Wait a minute. Are you suggesting that jury trials 
will change the accepted system of proof in Russia? 
  [Pashin] They will not change it, but they will introduce 
legal principles into the system. This will take the place of 
the notorious expediency we once had. Verdicts should be the 
logical result of the evidence presented. 
  [Sharov] Yes, you could say that there is not much adherence 
to logic in our investigative agencies. The procuracy and the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs with its counterintelligence 
service will be facing a dilemma. It would not be an 
exaggeration to say that all kinds of mistakes, inconsistencies, 
and omissions can easily be found in ANY criminal 
case. 
  [Pashin] It is not surprising that one of our chief 
opponents 
was Stepankov, the former procurator general. He expressed his 
fears: If the poor investigating official's signature is in the 
wrong place, will a criminal be released for this kind of 
inconsequential error? Valentin Georgiyevich was being devious. 
He knew that the people who worked for him were not accustomed 
to assuming the burden of proof. It is interesting, however, 
that this did have an impact. People in the procuracy began to 
worry. They began to learn how to base charges on the 
accumulated evidence. It is now common practice for the 
prosecution to start playing for time when a case is to be tried 
by a jury, and to initiate additional investigations of all the 
facts of the case. 
  [Sharov] This is certainly encouraging, but it is not 
persuasive enough. After all, it will delay trials. People will 
be kept in custody longer and they will be miserable. 
  [Pashin] Would you try to blame this on jury trials too? 
  [Sharov] No, but I do believe that for everything good, 
there 
is also the "other side of the coin." Here is one of the main 
objections: You have launched an experiment for completely noble 
and ethical reasons, but is it right to experiment with 
justice--in the ideal sense of the term? The jury trial is a 
government institution in only five oblasts of Russia.... 
  [Pashin] In nine now. 
  [Sharov] But this still suggests that the inhabitants of 
other regions are second-class citizens. They do not have access 
to the more humane form of proceedings. 
  [Pashin] Let us begin with the fact that the jury trial is a 
constitutional institution. Therefore, it is not an experiment, 
but a sequential fulfillment of the requirements of the Basic 
Law. Furthermore, in tsarist Russia jury trials were also 
instituted gradually, in one province at a time. Even then, not 
all of Russia was "entranced" by them. By the way, the 
institution of this form of legal proceedings is not possible in 
all regions even today. After all, we have to take ethnic, 
historical, traditional, and cultural factors into account. The 
simplest thing would be to announce that jury trials will be 
instituted everywhere tomorrow. The idea would be completely 
discredited. There would be overt violations of the principle. 
Our judges, our procurators, and our public defenders are people 
from the past, whether we like it or not. Their mentality was 
not shaped by current events. They have seen jury trials only in 
foreign films, but they learned the law from books in which 
trial by jury was reviled in the most vehement terms. That is 
why regional judicial authorities were simply asked to consider 
the new form of trial. I cannot deny that the regions which 
decided to institute jury trials expected some kind of bonus in 
connection with this, and we gave it to them as a reward. If the 
Ryazan judicial officials, as OBSHCHAYA GAZETA reported, 
received the magnificent Catherine Palace in place of their old 
shack for the institution of jury trials, more power to them! 
This is certainly a change for the better. Finally, I agree that 
people in different oblasts are not on an equal level, but it 
would have been much more immoral not to institute jury trials 
at all. 
  [Sharov] Another significant objection concerns the high 
cost 
of jury trials. 
  [Pashin] Yes, they cost money. For some reason, people 
believe that the judicial system is the only sphere of 
government activity that entails only expenditures. This is not 
true. Courts generate revenue by charging fees and court costs 
and by confiscating property. If even one-third of this income 
could be used for the maintenance of the courts, we might have a 
different judicial system, but everything goes into the budget. 
Anything deposited in the budget disappears, and subsequent 
allocations are minuscule. This gives rise to the "seditious" 
idea that the outrageous sums the government is spending on the 
renovation of the White House would be more than enough for the 
organization of jury trials everywhere. What more can I say? 
Cheap justice is...cheap justice. 
  [Sharov] But trial by jury is also a complicated process. 
Just assembling the right number of people, providing them with 
hotel accommodations, arranging for the selection of jurors, 
explaining all of their obligations and rights to them, 
answering their questions about legal matters.... Then you have 
to wait for them to arrive at a verdict. I will repeat the 
opinion you "deplored": There will be even longer delays in the 
administration of justice. There will be a long list of people 
choosing trial by jury. These people will have to remain in 
custody for years, waiting and waiting for their trials.... 
  [Pashin] All of that is true up to a point. Only the 
preliminary stages will delay the proceedings slightly: the 
selection of the jury, the administration of the oath, the 
possibility of challenges, and the explanation of rights and 
obligations to the jurors. You know that this will not take 
weeks or days, but just an hour and a half or two hours. The 
complexity of organizing the trial will force the services 
responsible for the normal progression of the proceedings to act 
more precisely and efficiently. The prosecution will not send a 
case to trial when it is full of holes, but will prepare the 
case carefully and conscientiously, in the knowledge that no one 
in the court will overlook its errors. If there is the slightest 
error, then the defendant will be acquitted. But the prosecution 
is bound much more strictly by the judicial calendar and the 
maximum terms of confinement for suspects. The unconditional 
appearance of witnesses, victims, defense attorneys, 
prosecutors, and experts will be the rule in jury trials, and 
some will have to be summoned by subpoena because this kind of 
"complicated process," as you called it, cannot be jeopardized 
by the failure of one or two people to appear in court. There 
will also be changes in escort services. The existence of jury 
trials will also speed up the resolution of some old problems: 
the protection of witnesses and victims, the guaranteed 
appearance of witnesses and victims, and the more precise 
functioning of escort units. Finally, there will be a new 
approach to the choice and use of measures to secure the 
appearance of the defendant. In any case, the 20 or so jury 
trials which have already taken place proved that local 
officials could begin solving these problems in earnest. There 
were no insurmountable obstacles. 
  [Sharov] But these were mainly show trials. There was so 
much 
publicity, and the press, television reporters, foreigners, and 
observers from higher courts were invited to attend. I am afraid 
that everything will go back to normal when this becomes routine. 
  [Pashin] This was not a publicity campaign, but the 
customary 
monitoring of a fundamentally new practice. In addition, it was 
propaganda. It was, you might say, a demonstration. The jury 
trial is not simply another form of judicial proceedings; it is 
a new level of legal awareness, a new mentality, even a new 
philosophy. We want the high standards of work which were 
reached in the first months to be maintained in the future and 
to become the routine. You object to the theatrical nature of 
the jury trial, but I do not see anything terrible about this. 
It is certainly a ceremonial proceeding, a ritual with many 
obligatory elements; it is only in Russia, which has been 
poisoned by legal nihilism, that it is seen as something 
superfluous or contrived. Its effectiveness and impact will not 
be diminished by the absence of television reporters and 
journalists, although I am certain that the latter will attend 
trials by jury much more often than ordinary trials. The main 
thing is that the proceedings held the interest of all of the 
parties involved in the trial--although this might sound cynical 
in reference to the accused or the victim. Something they never 
even dreamed of 5 or 10 years ago was coming to life before 
their very eyes. 
  [Sharov] Was it interesting for the prosecution? 
  [Pashin] You can imagine. Although prosecuting attorneys 
threatened to protest the jury verdicts after some trials, this 
made them look like people who wave their fists after a fight. 
The prosecutors felt like attorneys, instead of bureaucratic 
pawns making the prescribed moves. The institution of adversary 
procedure is a wonderful thing. It forces people to think. It 
involves professional risks. It was the same for the public 
defenders. They finally saw a way to get around the wall they 
kept running into at almost every trial in the past. The judge 
felt like an arbiter, and not a worker on an assembly line. Here 
it is, the new mentality we wanted. This, quite honestly, makes 
the job worthwhile. And just look at what happened: Igor 
Tsykunov's article objectively "promoted" the jury trial, 
because the observant reader will see that the trial in Ryazan 
acted like a searchlight, illuminating the true features of our 
wretched system of justice and revealing the road to improvement.

<F P=106> [Unattributed response to reader inquiry: "How Many Generals </F>
Do We Have?"] 
  [Text] I remember that in 1991 Marshal Akhromeyev, 
chief of the General Staff, stated that there were 1,939 
generals for the 3.8 million servicemen in the USSR Army. How 
many generals are there in today's Russian Army and the 
countries of the CIS? 
  [Signed] A. Lesovets, Vorkuta 
  After August 1991, the Russian Federation Army was rapidly 
reduced in size, and by April 1993 its numbers constituted 
approximately 2.3 million, but the number of generals had grown 
to 2,218. Just prior to last year's referendum the president 
conferred the rank of general on 256 officers. As of today, 
judging by figures that have appeared in the press and that have 
not as yet been refuted by the Ministry of Defense, there 
are approximately 2,500 generals or one general per 720 
servicemen for 1.8 million servicemen in the Russian Army. 
  There are problems with the surfeit of generals in other 
armies of the CIS also. Thus Georgia, for example, has been 
forced to increase the length of service between ranks to three 
years for junior officers and to five years for senior officers. 
The same trend has emerged in the Ukrainian Army, where, despite 
an appreciable reduction in troops, the number of generals has 
tripled. 
  For comparison: the U.S. Army has approximately 1,250 
generals, that is, one general per 1,500 servicemen (not 
counting the reserve). 
  There were 80 more generals in the Russian Army by the 
time of the May holidays....

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Trade Across Eastern Border </F>
Increasing Rapidly"] 
  [Text] Trade between Finland and Russia is continuing its 
explosive growth. During the first three months of this year, 
nearly 390,000 metric tons of export and import goods crossed 
the border. If the trend continues at this rate, the total trade 
in goods will exceed 1.5 million metric tons this year. The 
corresponding figure in 1993, a record year, was just under 
900,000 metric tons. 
  The main increase has been in exports to Russia. During the 
first three months of this year, the flow of export goods 
increased a full 217 percent over the corresponding period last 
year. At the same time, the flow of import goods rose by 4.9 
percent. 
  Most of the export products originate in other countries and 
pass through Finland as goods in transit. During the first three 
months of this year, transit trade totaled 214,000 metric tons. 
That is an increase of 365 percent over the corresponding period 
last year.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Alekseyev, corresponding member of </F>
the Russian Academy of Sciences and chairman of the Research 
Council of the Center for Private Law, conducted by Vitaliy 
Yaroshevskiy; at the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA editorial office, date not 
given: "The Civil Code Is Superior to All the Napoleonic 
Victories"] 
  [Text] 
  [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] Sergey Sergeyevich, the CIS states are 
now 
looking for optimal ways and means of integration. One of these 
means is called the law. What is this: Yet another declaration, 
or something real? 
  [Alekseyev] Our former state adhered to unnatural factors 
that united various peoples, nations, and ethnic groups in its 
framework. Authoritarian power figured as the main factor for 
everyone. It was this that determined political principles not 
only of the former imperial state, but of society as well. There 
is no such factor today. Therefore, we should not foster 
unrealizable hopes associated with the creation of a new Union. 
This is already impossible. Nor will the institutions of foreign 
administrative power, on which some politicians set their hopes, 
"jump into action." Heads of state and members of their 
governments assemble, adopt various documents and statements 
about integration, but there was none and is none. Although this 
does not mean that integration is impossible, or is not 
necessary. Consequently there is a need to find a universal and 
effective factor of unification that is comprehensible to 
everyone. Strictly speaking there is no need to search for it. 
This is the law and the creation of a unified rule-of-law space 
that does not depend on the whim of leaders or any kind of 
official persons whatsoever. 
  [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] However, what does law mean? This, after 
all, is a very multidimensional concept, which in many ways is 
tied to the specific nature of the existence of one or another 
state. 
  [Alekseyev] But I am talking about strictly specific things. 
I have in mind a legal principle that ORGANICALLY operates in 
practically all states and determines a significant part of 
their mutual relations. This is private law. The same that is 
based on Roman law and eternal legal values: property law, 
freedom of contract. Roman law, which spanned the entire history 
of human civilization, has not lost its influence on modern 
jurisprudence. But there is a reason for saying that Rome 
conquered the world three times. First, with force, then with 
religion, finally, with law. It is precisely the postulates 
developed by ancient Roman jurists that unite West Europe today. 
I am asserting this not without proof, but based on my 
experience in work in the court of the European Community in 
Luxembourg and contacts with colleagues who are prominent 
Western jurists in this work. And all of this because this law 
in turn originates from trade and the market economy. This is 
also the main path of integration for the CIS countries. At 
least, because nothing better has been devised. 
  [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] Yes, but with all their similarity, 
different systems of law operate in the Commonwealth states. 
  [Alekseyev] I agree. But a working organ already exists that 
could resolve the "problem of disjunction." It is not necessary 
to reinvent the wheel. There is a center for research on private 
law in Russia. Its activity can be applied to the entire 
territory of the CIS. The task of the center: To develop a draft 
law concerning civil law (and this, really, is private law), 
which in its totality would form a certain unified system. 
  [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] But, after all, CIS members might not 
like 
your draft law. 
  [Alekseyev] Of course. If draft laws of this kind lack 
quality. But the center guarantees precisely quality, inasmuch 
as they are being prepared and will be prepared by the very 
highest class of specialists. Moreover, Nazarbayev has already 
expressed his opinion in the sense that Kazakhstan is preparing 
its Civil Code with the help of Russian jurists. In addition, 
the private law center, even in its strictly Russian role, is 
inviting prominent jurists from the former Union republics to 
collaborate. We are working with Professor Basin from Almaty, 
Professor Krupnyy from Kyrgyzstan, and Ukrainian jurists. Thus, 
we are talking about giving the center the status of an 
organization within the scope of the entire CIS. 
  [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] But what is to be done with the pride of 
the leaders of the republics? They will want strictly THEIR OWN 
national Civil Codes? 
  [Alekseyev] They will not be able to oppose absolute 
necessity. No matter what they say, market relations inside the 
CIS are a reality. They cannot exist outside the law. This means 
that they need an adequate juridical rigging, a form, if you 
wish. But it has turned out historically that there simply is no 
other form, besides the Civil Code, that is built on the 
principles of private law. Otherwise all these discussions about 
a new economy, a free market economic system, and 
entrepreneurship are pointless. As the saying goes, there is no 
alternative. In the whole world, civil society (and all CIS 
members want this) began with Civil Codes. While already in 
exile, Napoleon claimed that the Civil Code of France, which was 
established with his direct participation, was superior to all 
his 40 victories.

<F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Economic Sciences Vera Shirobokova, </F>
adviser of the "Reform" International Fund, followed by 
unattributed report under the general heading "Belorussian 
Ruble's Bid to Jump Hurdles"] 
  [Text] There has been much debate of late over the 
unification of the Russian and Belorussian [Belarusian] monetary 
systems. Viewpoints are at times diametrically opposed. So 
what is really happening? 
  The mechanism for merging the two countries' monetary 
systems 
has been elaborated and agreed over the last three months. The 
commission working on these problems succeeded in making fairly 
good progress. Agreements were reached on many contentious 
issues, and a version of the treaty was proposed by the Russian 
side. However, when agreeing it with experts from Belorussia it 
proved impossible to surmount differences of opinion on four 
fundamental provisions. 
  The first contentious issue concerns the exchange rate of 
Belorussian bank notes against Russian rubles. The Russian side 
believes that revaluation should be implemented according to the 
average value of the purchasing power parity of both countries' 
currencies and their market cross rate against the U.S. dollar. 
It is proposed that this rate be applied both for the exchange 
of cash and the revaluation of other monetary assets. 
  The Belorussian side, however, proposes using a 
recalculation 
rate based on the purchasing power parity of bank notes. It is 
proposed that funds held by the population in savings and 
current bank accounts be revalued at a rate of one to one, but 
subject to a six-month delay before these funds can be withdrawn 
(until the complete withdrawal of Belorussian currency from cash 
circulation). 
  Prices for deliveries of products between both countries' 
economic organizations constitute the next highly significant 
point of divergence. Russian experts propose a gradual 
reduction of export duties (starting with 30 percent) with 
commitments from Belorussia not to levy payment for the transit 
of Russian cargoes across its territory, or rental payment for 
Russian military facilities. 
  The Belorussian side, however, proposes to abolish all 
reciprocal export duties and switch to domestic Russian prices 
for energy sources in mutual settlements as of the date of the 
monetary systems' unification. It is assumed that, in doing so, 
Russia's losses from lowering prices for energy sources will be 
offset by cuts in expenditure on transit and the lack of outlay 
on patrolling its Western border and of expenditure on the 
upkeep of military facilities. Moreover, lowering prices for 
energy sources will make it possible to cut the level of 
production costs for Belorussian output and thus reduce its end 
price for Russian consumers. 
  The other two points of divergence are largely political. 
Since the unification of monetary systems presupposes 
unification of both the budgetary and the banking systems, the 
Russian side is insisting that this process be completed as 
quickly as possible (by the beginning of 1995). But as regards 
the budget, Belorussia is prepared merely to create the 
preconditions for its consolidation by the end of 1994. 
  In order to merge the banking systems, Russia proposes to 
reorganize the National Bank of Belorussia as a branch of the 
Central Bank of Russia, transferring to the latter all assets 
and liabilities and extending to Belorussian territory the 
effect of Russian laws in this sphere, by the end of this year. 
Belorussia, however, is insisting on preserving the status of 
its National Bank while significantly curbing its functions. 
  It seems that the current status of talks on the unification 
of the two countries' monetary systems offers opportunities to 
seek a compromise in solving the aforementioned problems. In 
particular, the adoption of Belorussia's proposal to exchange 
the population's savings at a rate of one to one could be quite 
painless from the point of view of consequences for Russia's 
economy. The sum total of the monetary accumulations of this 
republic's population converted in its entirety into Russian 
rubles represents a quantity which is not significant enough to 
substantially affect the unified system's total amount of money 
in circulation. Moreover, this option for exchanging the 
population's savings provides for the freezing of deposits 
throughout the period of exchanging bank notes. 
  As for equalizing prices for reciprocal deliveries of 
products and abolishing export duties, then here, obviously, we 
ought to proceed from the premise that monetary union is the 
highest stage of economic integration. It must, undoubtedly, be 
preceded by the creation of a customs union with the abolition 
of reciprocal duties and nontariff restrictions, a common market 
with the abolition of obstacles to the movement of goods, 
capital, and labor, and an economic union involving, in addition 
to everything listed above, a high degree of coordination in 
economic policy. Only when these stages of integration have 
been traversed will it be possible to talk about creating a 
monetary union. In this connection, the Russian side's 
unwillingness to opt for the complete abolition of duties for 
imported goods means a restriction on implementing the first 
stage of integration -- the creation of a customs union. 
  Furthermore, the Russian side is taking into account of 
current losses from deliveries of fuel at domestic prices, while 
taking no account of the possible gain (and not only economic 
gain) in the long term. And even the Belorussian side's 
arguments, substantiating compensation for lost profits, should 
be taken into account. After all, in the event of failure to 
sign the agreement on monetary union, Russia will have to set up 
a real border with Belorussia and a corresponding infrastructure 
in order to ensure effectively protect its economic interests. 
Apart from all else, Belorussia may introduce stringent customs 
duties for the transit of Russian cargoes across its territory, 
as well as demanding compensation for expenditure on the upkeep 
of Russian military facilities. All this together is quite 
comparable with that which Russia is losing on deliveries to 
Belorussia of energy sources at domestic prices. 
  But the fate of the agreement in question depends on how far 
the sides are ready to go toward mutual concessions. What that 
agreement may give to both sides, and not only in the economic 
sense, has already been discussed on many occasions. But 
unfortunately, it seems that in this issue, as in all the 
economic processes under way in the CIS, it is not economic 
expediency which prevails when implementing specific actions, 
but political considerations. [Shirobokova ends] 
<H5>  ...And Meanwhile </H5>
  The results of the latest stage in the talks on the 
unification of the monetary systems have been perceived 
ambiguously in Belorussia. National Bank Chairman S. 
Bogdankevich, for instance, stated: "I have no more illusions. 
It must be admitted that the 8 September treaty is not viable, 
it has not been accepted by the Russian side." 
  Some of the republic's political forces have also been quick 
to exploit this for their propoganda ends. Thus, a statement by 
the Belorussian Association of Servicemen, recently abolished by 
decision of the Supreme Court but re-created in the form of an 
organizational council, sharply criticized the government for 
its desire to unify the monetary systems of Belorussia and 
Russia. And it issued an unequivocal warning: "We know the 
names of those who are campaigning to destroy the political 
autonomy of Belorussia, and we consider it our moral duty to 
warn these people." 
  Nevertheless, the republic leaders' views on the unification 
of the monetary systems have not altered. And this, obviously, 
is primarily attributable to the state of the economy. 
According to data from the Belorussian State Committee for 
Statistics, its national income in the first two months of this 
year, compared with January-February last year, fell by 33 
percent. The volume of industrial output stood at 63.5 percent. 
Reciprocal indebtedness rose significantly, and large stocks of 
unsold products have built up. As of 1 March, Belorussian 
enterprises had stock surpluses worth R2.114 billion. Some 88.9 
percent of all outstanding debts comprised debts to Russian 
enterprises. 
  This is why Belorussian Parliament Head Mechyslaw Hryb 
expressed concern regarding the prevailing situation since, 
pending the forthcoming unification, enterprises are standing 
still and trade is paralyzed. "It is neither to our advantage 
nor to that of Russia to prolong this issue further. If we 
cannot work things out, this means that it is necessary to 
elaborate a new content of the bilateral agreement, a 
large-scale treaty between the two states," Mechyslaw Hryb 
stated. In his words, the Supreme Soviet Presidium has already 
resolved this question: A commission has been set up under the 
leadership of Supreme Soviet First Deputy Chairman Vyacheslav 
Kuznetsov, which will work out a new agreement. 
  Vyachaslaw Kebich, head of the Belorussian Government, also 
believes that the final documents will be signed in the 
interests of both states. He stressed that he sees the aim of 
his life as being the actual integration of the economy of two 
peoples, close in spirit and culture, and in mode of thinking, 
who want to be together.

"Public Organization Activists Demand the Freeing of the Leader 
of the `Russian Commune' in North Kazakhstan: Official Alma-Ata 
and Moscow Are Not Hurrying To Clarify the Situation"] 
  [Text] Boris Suprunyuk, leader of the North Kazakhstan 
department of the "Russian Commune" organization, who was 
confined under guard on 12 April of this year, has been brought 
to Alma-Ata for enforced psychiatric evaluation. The prisoner is 
being charged with actions the punishments for which have been 
stipulated in Part 1 of Article 60 of UKK [Kazakhstan Criminal 
Code] (the article is called "Violation of National and Racial 
Equal Rights and the Equal Rights of Citizens Depending Upon 
Their Attitude Toward Religion"). 
  As a citizen of the Russian Federation who is residing in 
the 
Kazakhstan city of Petropavlovsk, Boris Suprunyuk attracted the 
interest of the North Kazakhstan procurator's office as early as 
last summer, after he spoke at the local Cossack Circle, 
criticizing the "linguistic" policy of the city authorities. The 
criminal case that was initiated in this regard languished until 
April of this year. But apparently after Suprunyuk took part in 
the picketing of the Kazakhstan embassy during Nursultan 
Nazarbayev's recent visit to Moscow, the authorities decided to 
let this case go full speed ahead. The leader of the "Russian 
Commune", after his arrest, was in Petropavlovsk for one week, 
and no one, not even his lawyer, was allowed to see him. 
According to a statement made by employees of the oblast 
procurator's office, during the night of 19-20 April, the 
prisoner was taken to Alma-Ata for the purpose of undergoing 
trial-related medical evaluation. But for a period of two weeks 
nothing was known about Suprunyuk: Kazakhstan officials 
completely refused to make any comments on the situation. There 
was a similar lack of success in the attempts made by employees 
of the Russian embassy in Alma-Ata to learn anything about the 
fate of the Russian citizen. 
  The embassy sent notes several times to the republic's 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and statements were also sent to 
the Kazakhstan ambassador in Moscow from the appropriate 
committee of the State Duma. According to Russian diplomats, 
both Nursultan Nazarbayev and Andrey Kozyrev were informed of 
this. By preventing the embassy employees from seeing the 
accused, the Kazakhstan authorities, in the opinion of the same 
diplomats, are violating the Russo-Kazakhstan consular 
convention. In addition, people in the Russian embassy consider 
that the forced psychiatric evaluation is also inadmissible. 
  Last Monday it finally became known that Suprunyuk has been 
brought to the capital of the republic. In his own words, he was 
brought from Petropavlovsk several days earlier than the date 
given by the authorities. And while he was in Alma-Ata, only his 
lawyer was allowed to visit him. 
  On Wednesday the republic procurator's office was picketed 
by 
activists from the Alma-Ata "Russian Commune," the "Harmony" 
movement of Semirech'ye Cossacks, and social democrats. In their 
opinion, there is no corpus delicti in Boris Suprunyuk's 
actions, since he, as a journalist, had the complete right to 
express his opinion with regard to the local policy, so long as 
he did not go beyond the confines of the law. 
  However, one also hears hypotheses concerning a kind of 
behind-the-scenes agreement between the Moscow and Alma-Ata 
officials with regard to Suprunyuk. Otherwise it is extremely 
difficult to explain such an obvious ignoring by the Kazakhstan 
officials of the Russian reaction to the events. Boris 
Suprunyuk, with his aggressiveness in defending the interests of 
the Russian-speaking population of North Kazakhstan, has been 
troubling not only the local authorities for a long time. His 
actions also have been causing dissatisfaction on the part of 
Russian officials who deal with Central Asia, and who definitely 
do not always view the Russians in Kazakhstan as the object of 
their official concerns.

  [Text] 
<H5>  Privatization </H5>
  Immediately after the discussion in parliament on the 
activity of Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee for Management 
of State Property], during which the deputies did not succeed in 
working out a common approach to privatization in its current 
form, representatives of Russian business circles condemned, in 
their turn, the activity of the GKI [State Property Committee] 
on the capital market. 
  At a news conference on 27 April, Director of the Union of 
Stock Exchanges Bykov, president of the RFB [Russian Stock 
Exchange] Suvorov, Cochairman of the Union of Stock Exchanges 
Deryabin, and President of the MTB [Moscow Commodities Exchange] 
Milyukov gave journalists a letter from the Union of Stock 
Exchanges to President of Russia Boris Yeltsin. 
  It talks, in particular, about the critical situation that 
has developed in the stock market, which "is threatening to grow 
into a full wave of scandals and exposures, as a result of which 
the Russian people will end up deceived and robbed. 
  "All of this is occurring first and foremost, because of a 
lack of legislation guaranteeing order in the stock market and 
protecting small investors. In addition, criminality is 
continuously growing in the stock market." 
  The Commission for Securities and Stock Exchanges and 
Goskomimushchestvo, which is behind it, are attempting to take 
the stock market into nonexchange operations and then into cash 
operations. This will make it possible, in the opinion of the 
president of the RFB, to work directly on the laundering of 
criminal money. Depriving the stock market of "clarity," 
reliability of information, and publicity will intensify the 
chaos that reigns in the market. 
  The union is calling for order to be brought to bear on the 
stock market, to protect the population from the stream of false 
advertising and "open deception by unscrupulous joint-stock 
companies, and also to create economic conditions for attracting 
investment in the economy." 
  As is known, not much time is left until the end of voucher 
privatization. Left without work, Goskomimushchestvo is 
attempting to establish a network of new, so-called 
"self-regulating organizations," but under the control of the 
GKI so that, even at the end of voucher privatization it may 
take control of the stock market and, evidently, the investment 
market as well. 
  As the president of the MTB declared, a restoration of state 
forces has occurred, which it is now assumed will be directed at 
"curtailing private activity." The establishment of control, in 
Milyukov's opinion, also threatens the banking system as well. 
  He proposed the establishment of an opposition to the 
Central 
Bank of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Finance, and 
Goskomimushchestvo, by uniting the efforts of dealers. 
  "It was not property that Goskomimushchestvo distributed, 
but 
title," said the MTB president. New stockholders have 
practically no influence on the old management. At many 
enterprises, despite privatization, the former leadership 
remains, and it is incapable of acting under the new conditions. 
The GKI is attempting to resolve the problem of the director 
corps not with economic principles but with regulation of their 
activities. Thus, a concealed transition back to the 
command-administrative system is being carried out. 
  In addition, the main error in the GKI's proposed formation 
of a securities market, in the opinion of attendees at the news 
conference, is its organization according to the regional 
principle. The most promising, as I.V. Suvorov declared, is the 
branch principle, inasmuch as enterprises have maintained mainly 
only horizontal ties. 
  "For the benefit of its own political aims, the GKI is 
ignoring the organized financial and intellectual potential of a 
structure that is already operating on the stock market." 
Nevertheless, it is exactly the stock exchanges, with their 
openness, that are the superior indicators of the reliability of 
one or another security. 
  "Despite the fact that one and a half years ago, in 
accordance with an edict of the president of the Russian 
Federation, a Commission on Securities and Stock Exchanges was 
established that was entrusted with the functions of regulating 
the stock market, this commission was practically idle for the 
entire period of its activity. The clause of the president's 
edict on including representatives of the stock exchanges on the 
staff of the commission has not been implemented to this day." 
  In connection with what was enumerated above, the Union of 
Stock Exchanges submitted a request to the president of the 
Russian Federation for a meeting, with the participation of 
representatives of the exchanges themselves, and also the 
Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of the Economy, and the 
Central Bank. The purpose of the meeting--to set forth a program 
of immediate actions that would facilitate the prevention of 
"the danger that is threatening to turn into serious social 
shocks, and to direct the activity of the Committee on 
Securities and Stock Exchanges to the creation of favorable 
economic conditions for attracting investments in Russia's 
industry." 
  Henceforth, the GKI will fight on two fronts with yet 
another 
serious opponent who is characterized by a far clearer 
formulation of business interests and organizations than the 
deputies of the State Duma.

<F P=106> [Irina Savvateyeva report: "Economists Promise Production </F>
Upturn, But in 1996"] 
  [Text] At the traditional Thursday briefing at the Working 
Center for Economic Reform, journalists met with two "retired 
members" -- Professor Richard Layard of the London School of 
Economics, a former adviser to the Russian Government, and 
Andrey Illarionov, former leader of the Russian Federation 
premier's Analysis and Planning Group. 
  Richard Layard dwelt in detail on the problem of the decline 
in production. The professor claims that it is wrong to view 
the recession in industry -- which in the first quarter of 1994 
was 24.9 percent of the first quarter of 1993 -- in isolation 
from similar indicators in other spheres. Thus, construction 
volumes during this period fell by 24 percent; production 
volumes in agriculture fell by 5.5 percent; market services fell 
by 15 percent; and nonmarket services (services whose prices are 
state-regulated) fell by 4 percent. 
  In all, the national product in the first quarter of 1994 
was 
17 percent down on the first quarter of 1993. This means that 
consumption also fell by 17 percent on average. 
  Admittedly, the question arises of just how accurate these 
figures are. In general it has to be said that our country has 
never had access to reliable information that would allow us to 
calculate the volume of production accurately. In the era of 
general socialist competition it was advantageous to distort 
figures. Now, in the era of universal struggle against the tax 
inspectorate, it is advantageous, on the contrary, to play down 
output volumes. Moreover, the huge amount of all possible kinds 
of small producers -- private plots and small-scale cottage and 
collective labor -- are not officially registered at all. So we 
have to content ourselves with the figures we have. 
  Incidentally, Richard Layard and his colleagues attempted to 
get out of the situation as follows. In calculating GDP levels, 
they took account of Russian citizens' income indicators. 
Figures from the State Committee for Statistics were used. As 
were the results of a survey of cottage industries which this 
organization carried out using methodology recognized around the 
world. 
  Incidentally, research has shown that working people's real 
consumption in Russia increased by 21 percent from the first 
quarter of 1993 through the first quarter of 1994. Consumption 
by pensioners increased by 11 percent. 
  The overall 17-percent drop in consumption is due to the 
fact 
that spending on arms purchases and investment is considerably 
down. And although the London professor sees this trend as 
undoubtedly negative and a result of inflation, he sees the fall 
in arms spending as an indicator of the restructuring of the 
economy. 
  How long could the recession continue? Discussing this 
subject, Richard Layard cited the following figures. GDP in 
Russia has fallen by 50 percent since 1989. The comparable 
indicator in Poland and Hungary is around 20 percent. In 
Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania it is around 40 percent. 
Russia's isolation, in Mr. Layard's opinion, is due to the 
military-industrial complex' greater share of the economy and to 
the collapse of the USSR. 
  The likeliest extent of the further decline in GDP, in the 
professor's opinion, is another 10 percent. GDP growth usually 
comes through two to four years after reforms begin. But 
Russia, Mr. Layard believes, has already gone halfway and can 
expect its upturn in 1996. Provided, of course, that the 
authorities create certain economic prerequisites. Above all in 
the financial sphere -- in the fight against inflation. 
  But Andrey Illarionov, who spoke next, noted that the 
achievements have so far been slight. In particular, 
Chernomyrdin's main adviser sharply criticized the budget 
discussed by the Duma. First, its revenue. In 1993 revenue 
came to 10.6 percent of GDP. In 1994 the Finance Ministry is 
planning for 17.1 percent -- proving that growth is entirely 
possible, since the methods used to calculate revenue have 
changed. 
  But, Illarionov noted, average revenue levels have come to 
just 8.3 percent of GDP in the first three months of 1994. And 
the deficit is 9.2 percent. Yet the deficit in the first three 
months of 1992-1993 was either no more than 1 percent, or there 
was no deficit at all. And in some months there was even a 
surplus -- budget indicators are traditionally good at the start 
of the year. 
  The expenditure side is also bad, in Illarionov's opinion. 
According to the budget, expenditure over the year should be 27 
percent of GDP. But expenditure is already nudging 17 percent 
after the first three months. 
  Andrey Illarionov insists that the government has not made a 
single reformist decision in the first three months of the year. 
  At the same time, Illarionov noted, many other decisions 
have 
been made. And, alongside such well-known decisions as the 
conclusion of the agreement with Belorussia [Belarus] and the 
introduction of import tariffs and a state monopoly on the 
production and sale of alcoholic drinks, there was the 
little-known Russian Federation Government directive of 28 
February 1994 on the presentation to the U.S. and Spanish 
peoples of two statues to mark the anniversary of the discovery 
of America -- the "Birth of the New World" and the "Birth of the 
New Man." 
  Admittedly the works of art will be produced on site, and 
therefore the Russian Government is so far only presenting the 
aforesaid peoples with construction materials. But what a lot 
of materials! Some 60 carloads of cement, 80 carloads of 
fittings, 66 carloads of steel, 11 carloads of glass, and 170 
carloads of copper (or 10 percent of Russia's entire copper 
exports in 1993) will be exported duty-free. 
  These large amounts of construction materials are intended 
for the creation of just one sculpture.

<F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Lantsman under the rubric "Wholesalers": </F>
"Exchanges Attempt To Eliminate Departmental Diktat: Commission 
on Commodity Exchanges Intends To Lobby for Lower Taxes"] 
  [Text] On Thursday 28 April the first meeting of the 
Commission on Commodity Exchanges (KTB) was held at the Russian 
State Committee for Antimonopoly Policy and Support for New 
Economic Structures. The commission considered the procuracy's 
submissions on instances of violation of commodity exchange 
legislation and discussed the question of exchanges' 
participation in forming the charter capital of commercial 
banks. However, the significance of the event lies not in the 
agenda of its first meeting but in the very fact of the 
commencement of functioning of a body that will to a great 
extent set the rules of the game at the commodity and financial 
markets of Russia. 
  The KTB was created in keeping with the Law "On Exchanges 
and 
Exchange Activities" adopted by the former Supreme Soviet in 
1992. The two-year delay is quite explainable, considering the 
structure of the KTB and its powers. The list of powers with 
respect to organization and control of exchange activities 
delegated to the KTB by Russian Federation Government Decree No. 
152 includes issuance and annulment of licenses for organizing 
exchange trading; appointment of state commissioners to 
commodity exchanges; control over accounting documentation; and 
referral of materials to law enforcement organs. In composition 
the KTB is a mixed state-public body. In keeping with approved 
quotas, it includes 10 ministerial functionaries from the 
Ministry of the Economy, MVES [Ministry of Foreign Economic 
Relations], Ministry of Fuel and Energy, Ministry of 
Agriculture, and State Committee on Metallurgy; five delegates 
each from exchange and brokerage unions; and 10 independent 
experts. According to KTB Deputy Chairman Andrey Kashevarov, 
this form creates a real opportunity for a conflict-free 
transition from departmental administration of markets. In his 
opinion, the state-public composition of control bodies will 
make the practice of licensing more democratic and legalize the 
decisionmaking mechanism. At this point, however, by Mr. 
Kashevarov's admission, the departmental power of agencies 
operating on the commodity exchanges still considerably exceeds 
the KTB's real abilities. 
  According to the Russian Federation State Committee on 
Statistics, 177 exchanges and 35,468 brokerage offices were 
operating in Russia at the end of 1993. After the boom in 
exchange trading in 1991 and a sharp decline in 1992-1993, the 
situation has now stabilized. The remaining exchanges have 
shifted toward trading in classic exchange commodities--oil and 
petroleum products, metal, and agricultural commodities. Against 
the background of a considerable decline in total exchange 
turnover, specialists note a sharp rise in foreign currency 
futures deals. In the total turnover of 2 trillion rubles [R] in 
exchange trades registered in 1993, futures accounted for R13 
billion. This year the ratio of deals on commodity and financial 
markets approached 1:4, which corresponds to world standards. In 
the opinion of Andrey Kovalev, head of science at the Institute 
for Organized Market Research, 1994 will produce a peak in 
activities related to foreign currency futures deals at 
exchanges. With the relative stabilization of the ruble exchange 
rate and the high risk involved in operations with securities, 
foreign currency futures, in Mr. Kovalev's opinion, are becoming 
the most attractive segment of exchange trading. 
  Nevertheless, the KTB is ready to increase its activities in 
organizing futures trading in agricultural products, first and 
foremost grain. In June 1994 an international conference on 
problems of the development of grain futures trading in Russia 
will open in St. Petersburg under the aegis of the KTB. 
  In order to stimulate exchange activities, the KTB, 
according 
to its chairman Yuriy Danilov, will lobby for a reduction in tax 
rates for enterprises selling their output through commodity 
exchanges.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Dyshev: "A War Against Taxes Is Going on"] </F>
  [Text] An extraordinary event and, probably, not even on an 
oblast scale occurred in nice provincial Vologda. However, the 
information on it in newspapers was very scant and contradictory. 
  At 11:30 on 11 April a large group of people, which 
represented the popular movement in Vologda and the city's 
entrepreneurial circles, gathered near the building of the 
Oblast Tax Inspectorate and the Administration of the Russian 
Federation Tax Police Department in Vologda Oblast. Mikhail 
Surov, deputy of the Oblast Legislative Assembly, headed this 
gathering. He was the initiator of the preparation of a petition 
on a change in federal tax laws and decrees of the oblast 
administration on local taxation. With this document those 
gathered resolutely headed for the building. 
  The most interesting thing began then and there. The part of 
the building that belonged to the tax inspectorate and to the 
police was under guard. The ordinary passage regime existed 
there, about which two workers warned those that burst into it. 
They proposed that the petition be handed over to the authorized 
person. 
  Next we will refer to the testimony of Lt. Col. Militia 
Vladimir Aleynikov, chief of the Division for the Protection of 
Public Order of the Administration of Internal Affairs in the 
City of Vologda: "When they approached the building, the doors 
were open. No chain of guards blocked the road on the steps, as 
some newspapers wrote. I was the last to enter the building. 
People began to push one another, women looked out of offices, 
some shouted, and hands were already `flying' in front. I rushed 
there, shouting: `What are you doing? Be human!' I confronted 
Surov's group. Only three people from the police in uniforms 
remained behind me..." The gathering and the subsequent 
"assault" were filmed by six(!) videocameras: [by the 
videocamera of] an expert from the Administration of Internal 
Affairs, [by the videocamera of] a worker at the Administration 
of the Tax Police Department, and by four cameras of 
entrepreneurs. Later this entire, not very appealing, action was 
shown on local television and in Mr. Surov's explanation was 
understood as a fight for the happiness and well-being of simple 
folk. 
  Naturally, the author of these lines also became acquainted 
with the video newsreel and met with officers at the 
Administration of the Tax Police Department. Lt. Oleg B. said 
that, together with Capt. Valeriy P., he tried to accompany the 
delegation and to clarify whether there was a permit for 
videofilming. However, Mr. Surov with his assistants roughly 
pushed them away and a crowd surged behind them. Other workers 
were also subjected to beating and physical pressure. Two beat 
up Capt. Oleg I. from the Physical Protection Division (which is 
seen well from the recording), after which he was taken to the 
hospital with a brain concussion. 
  The crowd of 50 people kept the building under siege for 
about 1 hour. Surov, like a true military leader, summoned in an 
emphatic manner "support groups" over the radio-telephone and 
the execution of orders was reported to him. Police workers were 
shamelessly and impudently pressured and threatened and 
unprintable obscene language was hurled at them. Here are only 
some retorts recorded by me during the viewing of the film. 
Vladimir Kirillov: "We will identify all of you at home! All of 
you are photographed. If you want to live in peace... 
(illegible)." Surov: "Enough of eating and drinking with our 
money!" 
  In the end with militia support a semblance of common 
language was found with the overexcited "delegates." Five of 
them headed by Surov were permitted to pass for a meeting with 
Vladimir Zolotov, chief of the Administration of the Tax Police 
Department in Vologda Oblast. A press-conference for the city's 
entrepreneurs was held on the same day. This time there were no 
skirmishes. 
  On 12 April in connection with the breach of public order 
the 
City Administration of Internal Affairs instituted criminal 
proceedings on the basis of Article 206, Part II, of the Russian 
Federation Criminal Code--malicious hooliganism (provides for 
imprisonment for a period of 1 to 5 years). 
  Now something about the personality of the organizer 
himself. 
Mikhail Surov is one of the city's richest entrepreneurs. His 
firm, Provintsial, has stores, a canning line, a hotel, and a 
tourist complex, as well as many other things. Together with his 
associates he declared war on the "Caucasians" in Vologda and, 
in practice, was able to drive them out. During popular open-air 
festivals Mikhail Vasilyevich on a true merchant's scale treats 
people to free drinks and candy. Having become a state figure, a 
member of the Oblast Legislative Assembly, Mr. Surov ever more 
frequently speaks about the revival of Russia and of the city. 
According to him, the road to this lies in an uncompromising 
fight against tax structures. 
  The sociopolitical and humanitarian activity of Surov and of 
the political council of the popular movement in Vologda is only 
the visible part of the iceberg. The invisible part, with its 
entire mass, represents only banal mercenary interests, 
naturally, "in preservation and increase." In 1992-1993 Mikhail 
Surov was forced to pay taxes of several million rubles. He 
tried to enter into "friendly" relations with representatives of 
tax bodies, but nothing came of this. Quite recently he had to 
pay an even bigger sum. Surov sent to the tax inspectorate in 
Vologodskiy Rayon a petition to have the added-value tax on 
export deliveries of cranberries and hides returned to him. An 
additional check was needed. Some documents evoked doubts: 
Accounting at the enterprise was quite entangled. And then 
followed the well-known action by the city's merchants. By the 
way, it is not the first in Vologda's history. A similar action 
occurred on 12 August 1993. Participants picketed the building 
of the City State Tax Inspectorate, carried posters with 
insulting texts, and burned documents of the tax inspectorate. 
Entrepreneurs with a criminal past were among the initiators. 
Incidentally, Surov himself was convicted twice. In all, he 
spent 7 years in a hard labor colony. 
  Tax services in Vologda are under severe pressure. Every 
opportunity is utilized to discredit Veniyamin Alekseyev, chief 
of the Oblast State Tax Inspectorate. Over a period of 2 years, 
not without the influence of certain forces, the oblast 
administration raised the question of dismissing him, although 
there were no grounds for this. Commercial structures tried to 
involve Alekseyev's son in the performance of illegal 
transactions. Knocked out windows in the office and notes with 
threats on the door have already become the norm. Local 
merchants promised to publicly burn the effigy of the chief of 
the tax inspectorate. 
  In March 1994 during a check of the Provintsial Enterprise 
Mikhail Surov tried to detain Lieutenant Stepanov, a tax police 
worker, justifying this by the fact that his identification card 
was forged. After 10 minutes an operational physical protection 
group arrived at the office and, thus, the provocation was 
stopped. 
  It seems that present tax legislation suits no one: neither 
the state, owing to its low efficiency; nor the taxpayer, owing 
to its confusion and the large tax percentage; finally, nor tax 
bodies, owing to criminal "production costs." 
  Gennadiy Khripel, chairman of the Legislative Assembly in 
Vologda Oblast, also believes that the demands of local 
taxpayers are quite reasonable, although most of them are sent 
to the wrong address. It is not for local tax bodies to change 
the laws! And so, was the "deputation" guided by a simple soul 
and ignorance? Alas, the action had quite a clear and tough 
goal: To intimidate inspectors and the tax police and to dictate 
its terms and, naturally, the amount of the suitable tax. In the 
city many realize this perfectly well. 
  However, Vologda businessmen (naturally, not all) are not 
alone in their "holy hatred." More than 100 cases of violent and 
other wrongful acts against tax bodies, employees, and their 
family members were recorded throughout Russia in 1993 alone. 
They include nine cases of arson, explosions, and firing at 
premises of the State Tax Inspectorate; 15 cases of arson, 
firing, and explosions at employees' private property; nine 
bodily injuries were inflicted; 32 threats of physical reprisal 
and insults were made; two cases of compromise; four cases of 
the use of arms. Arson at buildings of the State Tax 
Inspectorate was carried out in cities of Monchegorsk, Ob, 
Iskitim, Sarapul, and Murom. An attempt to set fire to the 
private home of the chief of the Rayon State Tax Inspectorate in 
the City of Iskitim was foiled. A homemade explosive device 
exploded under the gasoline tank of the official car belonging 
to the deputy chief of the State Tax Inspectorate in Kurgan 
Oblast. In Pskov Oblast alone the number of such wrongful acts 
doubled as compared with 1992. 
  I left Vologda and at parting the lads in camouflage 
uniforms 
said: "If similar things are repeated, we will act in a tougher 
and more decisive manner, including the use of arms, as the Law 
on Tax Police specifies."

<F P=106> [Article by Yelena Kotelnikova: "Chubays Will Punish Those </F>
Who Have Dodged Privatization"] 
  [Text] The reversal beginning 1 July of the course of 
the privatization policy of the State Committee on the 
Administration of State Property to the side of the "effective 
owner" (previously "the mass stratum of owners" was priority) 
will be made difficult if the State Committee on the 
Administration of State Property will not be able to guarantee 
all the checks shares of state enterprises. The participants in 
a two-day meeting of the leaders of regional privatization 
organs, organized by the State Committee on the Administrations 
of State Property together with the Federal Property Fund, which 
concluded yesterday in Moscow, have come to such a conclusion. 
It is obvious that the fears of the ideologists of privatization 
relative to the prospects of their activity have been aroused by 
the fact that until now the strategy of denationalization was 
determined exclusively by the political situation. 
  Vice-Premier Anatoliy Chubays considers fulfillment of the 
task of completing voucher privatization before 1 July 1994 "a 
question of the life and death" of his department and its 
regional structures. At the meeting of the leaders of 
privatization organs he stated that all checks which will 
"surface" after the completion of voucher privatization "will be 
aimed point-blank at us." These fears are not unfounded. 
According to the data of the Fund's chairman, Vladimir Sokolov, 
some 48 million more checks "are making their way through the 
hands;" moreover, "about 5 percent of them are in secondary 
circulation." That is why the work of the privatization organs 
will be directed in the immediate future to a sharp increase in 
the scale of the exchange of vouchers for the shares of 
privatized enterprises as well as to identifying secondary 
circulation checks. Otherwise the ideologists of voucher 
privatization will be rather vulnerable not only "from the 
right" (on the part of the opponents of "handing out state 
property dirt-cheap," specifically the mayor of Moscow Yuriy 
Luzhkov and the leader of the YABloc Grigoriy Yavlinskiy) and 
also "from the left" (on the part of the advocates of 
"collective ownership," specifically the communists), since the 
social meaning of "people's privatization" will appear to be 
under question. 
  In Chubays' opinion, one of the basic as yet unutilized 
reserves in the work of the privatization organs is "the 
information-advertising-propaganda component." The vice-premier 
intends to rectify this omission by personal example in the very 
near future. Within the framework of the "100 days until the end 
of check privatization" campaign initiated by the State 
Committee on the Administration of State Property, he will 
address the inhabitants of the regions through local television 
channels and personally explain to them the advantages of 
exchanging the checks for the shares of privatized enterprises. 
  This also will permit Chubays to "make a low-level test-run" 
of the basic provisions of the draft of the new state 
privatization program, which is directed to the redistribution 
of capital (including privatized) in favor of the "rational 
owner" (the expression of vice-premier Aleksandr Shokin) and to 
enlist "popular support" for subsequent activity. Success would 
give Chubays additional trump cards in the struggle to retain 
complete control over post-check privatization. For now the 
final results of check privatization are unclear. The prospects 
for retaining Chubays' department are governed only by the 
intellectual potential of the State Committee on the 
Administration of State Property which has outstripped other 
departments in developing a new concept of denationalization. 
One has to also take into consideration the policy of the "big 
seven," which stimulates the pro-reformer attitudes of Premier 
Viktor Chernomyrdin. It is obvious that after the endowment of 
the head of the Ministry of Economics, Aleksandr Shokin, with 
powers regarding coordination of the ideology of the reforms as 
well as of negotiations with the West regarding questions not 
only of indebtedness but also of loans and investments, not one 
of the trump cards will be superfluous for Chubays. Especially 
as last week parliamentarians already advanced the idea of 
transferring the Federal Property Fund from under the control of 
the State Committee on the Administration of State Property to 
the Ministry of Economics. 
  In this situation the State Committee on the Administration 
of State Property has basically changed its tactics and intends 
to conduct post-check privatization to fit the special features 
of the regions and the departments. However, in the State 
Committee on the Administration of State Property they will be 
unbending with respect to those enterprises which "dodge" 
compulsory privatization. In this case the enterprise will be 
deprived of all the advantages not only of check (privileges for 
the labor collectives) but also of post-check privatization 
support (the direction of the funds gained from the sale of 
state property to an enterprise's disposal).

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Ivanov: "Mayor's Office Removes Traders </F>
From the Streets"] 
  [Text] Order is being brought to Moscow street 
trading. 
  The Moscow authorities have decided to put a complete 
stop to any unorganized street trading, to limit the activity of 
commercial kiosks, and to concentrate all trade at flea markets. 
This is the essence of the city government decree "On Additional 
Measures To Regulate Free (Street) Trading and Organize Flea 
Markets in Moscow" which was issued yesterday for official 
distribution. 
  The decisiveness of the Moscow Government in its struggle 
against street trading is easy to explain. As Moscow officials 
have been constantly emphasizing, unorganized trade brings 
practically no revenue into the budget of Moscow, while 
seriously hurting the city's image. It goes without saying that 
a certain competitiveness between the leaders of Moscow and St. 
Petersburg also played a part here: Comparatively recently, 
Anatoliy Sobchak issued orders "On Regulating Small-Scale Street 
Trading" (KOMMERSANT wrote about this this month) which 
contained draconian measures on limiting street trading. Thus, 
one can observe a certain shift in tendency in the economic 
policies of the mayor's offices of the two major cities: 
Previously the authorities tried to illustrate their market 
economy orientation by encouraging free trade in the streets, 
but now they are trying to strengthen administrative control 
over all, even the most insignificant, traders and to remove 
them from the streets altogether, if possible. 
  According to the new decree of the Moscow Government, any 
unorganized sales done by hand, from stands, carts, or cars have 
to be discontinued. Moreover, the authorities intend to cut down 
considerably on the number of commercial kiosks and stalls and 
to suspend their right to trade in manufactured goods and 
foodstuffs. They will only be allowed to sell soft drinks, 
cigarettes, fruits, souvenirs, flowers, and newspapers (in other 
words, the same goods they used to sell in Soviet times). 
  The document emphasizes once again an idea that has in a way 
become traditional for the Moscow authorities: Concentration of 
all trading at large wholesale and flea markets around Moscow, 
as well as at small flea markets in all municipal districts. The 
administrative district prefects are requested to improve the 
performance of the 70 already functioning municipal markets in 
Moscow. The decree demands that the GUVD [Main Administration of 
Internal Affairs] improve the efficiency of the militia's work 
at markets and periodically replace assigned militiamen. At the 
same time, the government sets the task of opening eight new 
flea markets in 1994. It may be interesting to mention that, for 
the first time in the practice of the Moscow authorities, the 
decree sets specific provisional rules for organizing flea 
market trading: According to the document, admission to the 
market should be free of charge and retail stands are to be 
provided for a fee to all citizens without exception. 
  In order to stimulate the emergence of flea markets, the 
decree provides for the extension of lease terms for plots of 
land utilized for organized sales. Besides, it plans to use the 
plots that were previously earmarked for building storage 
facilities to set up wholesale markets. Finally, it was also 
decided to open additional bus routes to bring traders to the 
markets at special commercial rates.

Trading 
  --the work of a market will be directed by its management, 
which will determine and levy the fees 
  --retail stands will be provided to any citizen who has paid 
the fee. The payee will receive a cash receipt which has to be 
shown to the inspector 
  --admission to the flea market should be free for shoppers 
  --any flea market has to have a paved trade area surrounded 
by a special fence 
  --the following items are prohibited for sale at flea 
markets: weapons, military purpose commodities, precious metals, 
animals and plants, goods for children, foreign currency, and 
securities. [end box]

  -  One-third of the currency sold last year in the 
Moscow Currency Exchange was acquired with funds stolen 
beforehand in false remittances. 
  -  The damage from crimes in the field of banking is far 
worse than the overall damage from all other crimes involving 
money. 
  -  More than half the banks in Moscow are not making use of 
the approporiate means to provide for their own security. 
  -  Russia is becoming an international center for money 
laundering. 


<H8>    * * * </H8>
  Crime in the banking system is continuing to get worse. Some 
indicators of the activity of subunits in the struggle against 
economic crimes, which I will cite below, attest to this. 
  While internal affairs organs exposed 617 crimes associated 
with the theft of money by misappropriation or abuse of one's 
official position and 76 cases of bribery in 1992, they recorded 
4,258 crimes, including 2,076 cases of theft---1,337 of which 
were theft on a large or very large scale--and 164 cases of 
bribery in 1993. 
  As shown by experience in exposing cases of bribery in the 
banking system, apart from consultation and technical 
assistance, the role of banking employees who took bribes most 
often involved the acceptance of fictitious payment documents. 
  Criminal associations which have penetrated the banking and 
entrepreneurial business have skillfully taken advantage of the 
banking system's failure to adapt to the conditions of a market 
economy and the inadequacy of interbank settlements, putting 
hundreds of billions of rubles into circulation with fictitious 
payment documents in the 1991-1993 period. 
  In 1993 alone, about 70 operations investigation groups came 
to the main administration from various regions in Russia to 
work on criminal cases involving use of the banking system for 
the theft of money. We have analyzed and singled out a number of 
factors which make it possible to carry out the shady 
transactions on such a large scale. 
  One of the most important factors is the poor supervision of 
commercial banks by the NTsB [National Central Bureau [of 
Russian Interpol]]. Evidence has been acquired in specific 
criminal cases that in a number of instances, the persons who 
organized the actions to enter funds with fraudulent documents 
were bank employees, and sometimes even the managers of those 
banks which were experiencing a "credit shortfall" and had a 
huge debit balance. 
  A special role in the financial machinations belonged and 
continues to belong to the numerous structures in the market 
economy established by and registered to fictitious individuals, 
utilizing fictitious documents. In most cases, substantial 
amounts of money have been stolen and "laundered" under the 
cover of fictitious enterprises. 
  The GUEP [Main Administration to Combat Economic Crime], in 
interaction with the GUVD [Internal Affairs Main Administration] 
of the city of Moscow, has exposed a criminal group of 25 
persons which opened more than 30 current accounts for more than 
3 billion rubles in Moscow commercial banks, using fictitious 
registration documents and false passports. It turned out that 
the funds in enterprises' current accounts were used primarily 
to obtain foreign exchange. 
  According to our information, no less than one-third of the 
2.63 billion U.S. dollars sold in the Moscow Currency Exchange 
in 1992 and the first quarter of last year were acquired with 
funds stolen beforehand in false remittances. Later the 
criminals concluded contracts with foreign firms for the 
delivery of commodities which did not come to Russia, as a rule. 
This is how currency is being drained to other countries. The 
plan is very simple, but there is no mechanism to provide a 
reliable deterrent to deliberate criminals or laws which provide 
for specific physical persons to be held responsible. 
  Analysis of available materials on foreign economic activity 
shows that numerous organizations and enterprises which make 
advance payments to pay for imports are not submitting documents 
in the established procedure to authorized banks to confirm that 
commodities are entering Russian territory. Many of them say the 
reason for nondelivery of goods is the unfairness of the 
importers, but according to our information, these foreign 
economic transactions are often fictitious in nature. 
  The Law "On Currency Regulation and Currency Control in the 
Russian Federation" stipulates the responsibility for conducting 
currency operations in violation of the established procedure 
and for failure to submit the appropriate documents to currency 
control organs. But in our view, the criminal laws in force 
should also stipulate the responsibility for concealing currency 
income received from foreign economic activity or understating 
its amount and failing to observe the established requirements 
for it to be legally brought into and taken out of the country.

<F P=106> [Article: "A Program To Strengthen the Railroad Transport </F>
Economy: At the RF MPS Collegium"] 
  [Text] An expanded session of the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Railways [RF MPS] Collegium was held on 22-23 
December, at which there was a discussion of the problems, of 
strategic importance for the sector, of further development of 
reforms and of strengthening the railroad transport economy in 
1994-1995. Taking part in the work of the Collegium were O.N. 
Soskovets, first deputy Chairman of the Council of 
Ministers-Russian Federation Government, V.B. Yefimov, Russian 
Federation minister of Transport, S.K. Shoygu, chairman of the 
Russian Federation State Committee on Civil Defense Affairs, 
Emergency Situations and Clearing Up the Consequences of Natural 
Calamities, B.N. Burachenko, chief of the Department of 
Transport, Communication and Social Infrastructure of the RF 
Council, corporation presidents V.A. Brezhnev of Transstroy and 
V.M. Nalivayko of Transmash, a number of other representatives 
of the government, joint-stock and commercial structures 
involved in railroad transport work, and also members of the RF 
MPS Collegium, chiefs of RF MPS roads, administrations and 
departments, authorized representatives of the RF MPS in the 
Czech Republic and Slovakia, Poland and Finland, directors of a 
number of the sector's railroad divisions, enterprises, 
associations, scientific-research institutes and higher learning 
institutions, and representatives of the road committees of the 
trade union for all the railroads. I.A. Shinkevich, L.B. Titova, 
V.S. Myshenkov and Yu.A. Sokhin, from the Central Committee of 
the Independent Trade Union of Railroad Workers and Transport 
Construction Workers, were in attendance. 
  G.M. Fadeyev, RF minister of Railways, chaired the Collegium 
meeting and gave a report. 
  O.N. Soskovets, first deputy Chairman of the Council of 
Ministers-Russian Federation Government spoke at the meeting. 
  It was noted in the main report and the reports of the 
speakers that putting into practice the Program To Ensure the 
Stable Work and Economic Stability of Railroad Transport in 
1993, drawn up at the expanded MPS Collegium in December 1992, 
mobilizing intra-sectorial reserves and state support made it 
possible for the sector in general to achieve the priority tasks 
of providing for the transport needs of the country's people and 
economy. Unified technological and administrative relations with 
the railroads of the CIS and Baltic countries were retained. 
  In 1993, passenger turnover was 273 billion passenger-km, 
i.e., 7.8 percent higher than the level of the past year, and 
1,346 million tonnes of freight were shipped (30.7 million 
tonnes over the plan). The level of fulfilling the train traffic 
schedule and the static load per railcar rose, other indicators 
of rolling stock use were improved, and the operations 
contingent of workers was reduced. The program for protection of 
the social and economic interests of the railroad workers was 
successfully put into effect. The Sectorial Tariff Agreement 
between the Russian Federation Government, the Ministry of 
Railways and the Independent Trade Union of Railroad Workers and 
Transport Construction Workers was on the whole fulfilled. The 
profit for the railroad transport enterprises for 1993 was about 
1.3 trillion rubles [R]. 
  At the same time, this year the sector constantly found 
itself in a difficult financial position, primarily because of 
the insolvency of the consignors, which often interfered with 
prompt payment of wages and made it impossible to renovate 
rolling stock properly or completely satisfy the demands for 
repair of technical devices. By the end of 1993, the consignors 
and consignees owed over R1 trillion for the transport performed. 
  A number of railroads made by no means full use of internal 
reserves, often maintained an excessively inflated operations 
staff and fleet of tractive rolling stock and railcars for the 
transport volume being fulfilled, and did not show the proper 
persistence with respect to a policy of fuel-energy resource 
conservation. Quite a few miscalculations were made in 
vocational training and placement of personnel, and also in 
reinforcing technological and executive discipline, which in 
some cases led to gross violation of traffic safety rules, 
accidents and wrecks. Most of the railroads failed to take 
exhaustive measures to recover debts from consignors and 
consignees for transport fulfilled, which put the sector in a 
very difficult financial position. 
  The collegium devoted its main attention to discussing the 
financial-economic situation in the sector. The report by the RF 
MPS minister and virtually all the speeches of those taking part 
in the conference touched on these problems to a greater or 
lesser extent. As a result, the Program of Action of the MPS, 
Railroads and Other Railroad Transport Enterprises To Develop 
Reforms and Strengthen the Sector's Financial-Economic Situation 
in 1994-1995 was drawn up and approved. It was proposed that all 
production collectives expand organizational work to carry it 
out, considering the milestones and indicators outlined in it to 
be the minimum necessary to strengthen the economy of the 
railroads of Russia and other enterprises of the sector. 
  The Collegium resolved that preparation be made and the 
stage-type transition to a contractual form of interrelations 
with the customers be completed in the first six months of 1994. 
In accordance with an edict of the President of the Russian 
Federation, when concluding contracts, fixed payment periods for 
transport are to be established, a flexible tariff policy, based 
on economic expediency under specific conditions is to be 
followed, tariffs are to be differentiated according to the type 
of freight, and the appropriate rebates are to be offered. 
Naturally, if the payment deadlines are violated, the consignors 
will be deprived of rebates and other benefits, applying to the 
full the economic responsibility measure established by the 
corresponding decree of the Council of Ministers-Russian 
Federation Government. 
  Methodological instructions on the procedure for calculating 
the economic expediency of using a flexible tariff policy for 
each transport operation under specific conditions (business 
plan) are slated to be worked out and sent to the railroads 
before 1 February 1994. In the 1st quarter of 1994, additions to 
the appropriate articles of the Railroad Charter, pertaining to 
the introduction of the contract form of interrelations between 
the railroad workers and consignors and consignees, are to be 
submitted to the Council of Ministers-Russian Federation 
Government for approval. 
  The competitiveness of railroad transport is to be increased 
on the basis of carrying out flexible tariff regulation for 
international transport and raising the throughput and 
processing capacities of the border stations and the quality of 
information and dispatch services. At the same time, freight 
should be accepted for international transport service only on 
condition of pre-payment of the impending transport services. 
  The Collegium devoted particular attention to debit 
indebtedness. As we know, this is one of the main reasons for 
the tension arising in the sector's financial situation. To 
reduce it, in January-February 1994, special subdivisions will 
be created at the RF MPS, railroads and divisions, which will 
deal with offsetting mutual debts between railroad transport 
enterprises, as well as those of the enterprises of other 
sectors of industry. In this case they will first start clearing 
off the debts of the MPS enterprises for fuel-energy resources. 
In addition, in the 1st quarter of 1994, other structures are to 
be created at the MPS and on the railroads to implement clearing 
accounts for the debts of customers, including through obtaining 
their products with subsequent sale on domestic and foreign 
markets and using promissory notes in clearing accounts with 
freight owners. 
  At the same time, the railroads are permitted to increase 
the 
established limit of advance financing, if the assignments for 
the transit railroads and the MPS to transfer funds are 
fulfilled. A procedure will be worked out in the near future for 
settlements with the railroads for sums exceeding their advance 
financing limit. 
  In order to ensure the comprehensive development of railroad 
transport as a unified production system, the Collegium accepted 
the proposals of the railroads, plants and other enterprises and 
organizations of the sector to form the following centralized 
funds and reserves in the RF Ministry of Railways to finance 
general sectorial expenditures: 
  --a railroad transport investment fund to acquire specific 
types of rolling stock and finance a number of construction 
projects and facilities of general sectorial importance, needed 
to support and develop the sector's material-technical base; 
  --a fund to support railroad transport educational 
institutions, in the amount of 0.3 percent of the revenues; 
  --a fund to support central public health institutions for 
the sector, in the amount of 0.2 percent of the revenues; 
  --a financial reserve for the RF MPS, in the amount of 1.5 
percent of the balance profit; 
  --a fund to finance NIOKR [scientific-research and 
experimental-design work] of a general sectorial nature, in the 
amount of 1.5 percent of the revenues. 
  In the 1st quarter of 1994, the level of the norm for 
withholdings for the RF MPS investment fund will be submitted to 
the RF Ministry of the Economy and RF Ministry of Finance for 
approval. In addition, the Statute on Education and Use of the 
Fund for Support of Public Health Institutions of the RF MPS is 
to be updated and submitted for approval. 
  In 1994-1995, a unified all-network automatic accounting and 
statistical information transmission system must be set up. This 
will require revision of the list and volume of sectorial 
statistical reporting, and rescinding of obsolete indicators. 
  The time has come to form a unified banking system for the 
sector. Today, along with powerful, viable financial 
institutions, small-scale institutions, capable of serving, for 
example, the needs of only one depot, are often set up at 
transport enterprises. Determining the main directions for the 
development of the banking system, drawing freight owners into 
the service of this system, and also attracting the savings of 
railroad transport workers and the people are, therefore, very 
urgent tasks. The organization of bank branches on railroad 
divisions is to be completed in the first half of 1994. 
  Ensuring a further rise in the level of passenger transport 
organization is one of the priority tasks of railroad transport. 
Under the conditions of the unprecedented rise in prices for 
air, sea, river and motor vehicle travel, the railroads often 
become the only affordable means of transport for the 
population. Because of this, railroad workers should devote 
priority attention to the problems of satisfying the people's 
demand for passenger, freight and baggage transport, improving 
the standards of service to passengers at terminals and on the 
trains and keeping to the schedule of passenger train runs. We 
must nevertheless also remember the factor of economy in this 
transport. For 1994-1995, therefore, differentiated indexing of 
tariffs is specified for long-distance passenger transport, 
based on the category of trains and railcars. This indexing is 
called upon to ensure that, in 1995, transport shows no loss, 
and after that, shows a profit. Similar measures are outlined in 
suburban traffic, by agreement with local bodies. In this 
connection, it is recommended that the chiefs of railroads and 
divisions continually work with local organs of authority and 
freight owners to regulate local taxation, establish tariffs for 
electric power and allocate funds to finance suburban transport 
and acquire rolling stock, build railroad facilities, and 
provide for other needs. 
  It was also proposed that, on a monthly schedule in 1994, 
the 
need for routine and capital repair of technical devices, based 
on the transport work actually performed, be precisely defined. 
After this, in accordance with the normative requirements, the 
allocation of the necessary resources is to be specified in the 
plans, and no demands for maintaining technical devices for 
transport may be put off. It is time for the roads to examine 
the organization of material-technical support for line 
enterprises and to take measures to reinstate supervisory 
monitoring of the supply of materials and spare parts. 
  The Collegium adopted a resolution to improve the plan for 
scientific-research and experimental-design work in 1994, drawn 
up by the RF MPS and approved by the railroads. Guided by the 
Strategy for Scientific-Technical Policy Under the New 
Conditions of Railroad Transport Work, adopted at the expanded 
session of the Presidium of the NTS [Scientific-Technical 
Council] of the RF MPS, it recommended that, when necessary, 
creative scientific-production groups of specialists be formed 
to draw up priority proposals ensuring the development of 
reforms in railroad transport. 
  In the 1st quarter of 1994, proposals will be prepared 
concerning the idea of improving the system of tariffs for 
freight and passenger railroad transport under market 
conditions, which outlines specification of the form of 
addressed state support of railroad transport enterprises and 
the sectors served by them, and also the necessary volume of 
investments from the republic budget in the development of 
railroad transport, which should be taken into consideration in 
determining the tariff level. 
  Because of the reduction in the network's work volume in 
certain railroad regions, a disproportion has formed between the 
rolling stock fleets required for operational needs and the 
surplus fleets. To bring them into line, it has been specified 
that the surplus fleet of railcars and locomotives be taken out 
of operation, by removing from the inventory, in 1994, 50,000 
railcars which have worked out their service life; that the 
railcars on the roads and at industrial enterprises of the 
sector be divided up; that spare parts, after reconditioning, be 
sent to supplement the working technological reserve, and 
wheelpairs with rolling axle-boxes be used to replace wheelpairs 
with plain-bearing axle boxes. It was decided to transfer, 
during 1994, 100,000 railcars to the long-term MPS reserve, 
carrying out their appropriate preparation and mothballing, and 
determining the storage sites which should be equipped with 
lighting, fire-fighting devices and other measures to be 
fulfilled for the purpose of ensuring the safeguarding of this 
rolling stock. Here it was established that in distributing 
among the roads the expenditures for depot and capital repair 
and updating the freight cars, their depreciation, and also 
payment for exceeding the quota of the railcar fleet indicated 
as a reserve, not be taken into account. At the same time, 
changes must be introduced into the system of statistical 
accounting and reporting for the freight car fleet. Some of the 
locomotives will also be transferred to the MPS reserve, with 
ensurance of their mothballing and placement at reserve bases or 
station and siding tracks specially equipped for this purpose. 
Each road should establish a maximum norm for maintaining 
locomotives in the reserve of the road administration to cover 
the daily fluctuations of transport work, but not over 10 
percent. 
  Guided by the Basic Directions for Work on Fuel and Power 
Conservation in Railroad Transport Under the Conditions of 
Liberalization of Prices for Energy Carriers, adopted by the 
Presidium of the NTS MPS, it was designated that specific 
details be given for the work of the fuel-energy commissions for 
line enterprises of the divisions and roads, directing their 
efforts primarily toward expanding the list of specific norms 
per unit of work or output and increasing accounting and 
monitoring of the use of energy resources. It was decided to 
boost the introduction of resource and energy saving technology, 
reconditioning and reinforcing of parts for repeated use, 
mechanization of work places, non-dismantling diagnostics, and a 
reduction in the wearing out of rails and wheel flanges in 1994 
on the Far Eastern, Transbaykal, October and Krasnoyarsk 
railroads, in 1995 -- on the Sverdlovsk, Gorkiy and Southeastern 
railroads, and in 1996 -- on the rest of the country's mainlines. 
  Safety is a very important problem in transport. To improve 
the state of traffic safety, particularly that of passenger 
trains, the following are to be ensured in 1994: 
  --studying and introducing, beginning in the second half of 
1994, new rules for technical operation, instructions for train 
traffic and shunting operations and instructions on 
signalization on RF railroads; 
  --carrying out technical inspections and checks of the 
railroads, divisions and enterprises, regarding this as one of 
the most important elements in preventive work. Introducing a 
procedure for compulsory personal examination of the results of 
the inspections of enterprises by the chief of a road division, 
of road divisions -- by the chief of the railroads, and of 
railroads -- by directors of the MPS; 
  --developing and introducing the newest technical devices 
increasing train traffic safety, specified by the assignments of 
the State Program for 1994-2000; 
  --ensuring fulfillment of the requirements for observing 
safety measures when transporting hazardous freight and 
performing shunting operations with railcars loaded with this 
freight; 
  --organizing the training and instruction of workers 
involved 
in processing hazardous freight and rolling stock loaded with it. 
  A competent solution to social problems is one of the most 
important conditions for a successful solution to the problems 
facing railroad transport. It is because of an efficient policy 
in this sphere that the railroad workers have managed to avoid 
many social conflicts, which have literally shaken other sectors 
of industry. Because of this, the Collegium feels that, to 
ensure the social protection of the railroad workers in 
1994-1995, its main task should be considered to be fulfilling 
the Sectorial Tariff Agreement, following a coordinated policy 
in the sphere of wages and ensuring the comparability of wages 
by railroads and regions, on the basis of the conditions, 
intensiveness, difficulty and quality of labor. The sectors are 
to maintain, in 1994-1995, the rates of housing construction 
achieved, drawing in the resources of enterprises, cooperatives, 
railroad workers and other sources of financing. 
  Reinforcement of lawfulness and legal procedure and 
unswerving adherence to existing legislative and normative acts 
in the subdivisions of railroad transport must be ensured in 
transport. Business contacts with law-and-order authorities must 
be strengthened, and preventive and legal education work put 
into practice with their participation. When violations of the 
law are revealed, efficient measures should be taken to 
eliminate them, making the guilty workers answerable. 
  In order to increase the discipline of workers involved in 
train traffic, and particularly those involved in passenger 
service, it is recommended that the directors of enterprises use 
the contractual form of concluding labor agreements, and specify 
in them, in accordance with labor legislation, the 
responsibility for proper execution of service duties. 
  By decision of the Collegium, the executors responsible for 
each point of the Program were determined, and plans were made 
to establish periodic monitoring of the course of its 
fulfillment at enterprises and in associations -- monthly; on 
divisions and railroads -- quarterly, with a report to the MPS 
for the road as a whole; in the MPS administrations -- 
quarterly, with a report to the deputy minister. To monitor the 
course of fulfilling the decisions of this Collegium, a work 
group, directed by O.A. Moshenko, first deputy minister, was set 
up to assist the roads. A procedure was established for 
quarterly summing up of the results of fulfilling the 
assignments of the Program, with analysis of the success of the 
measures being carried out. This work group is entrusted with 
the preparation, in the first half of 1994, of proposals for the 
improvement of the sector's administrative system.

<F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Economic Sciences T. Dementyeva and </F>
Candidate of Economic Sciences I. Pikan, experts of the TOR 
marketing center of the newspaper EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN: "Without 
Embellishments and Black Paint"] 
  [Text] If one looks at the present situation in 
Russia's economy without embellishments (which is practiced by 
the governmental and presidential team) and without blackening 
(as do their opponents), the following picture appears. 
<H8>  Basic Results of the First Quarter </H8>
  The following (based on offical data) basic factors 
characterize the situation in Russia's economy in the first 
quarter of 1993 in the opinion of EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN's experts. 
  First of all, a deepening of the production crisis which has 
manifested itself in a drop in the output of the majority of the 
types of industrial purpose products and consumer goods. Even 
though a decrease in production at the beginning of the year was 
predicted by practically all experts, no one had guessed its 
scale right--instead of the expected 10-12 percent reduction in 
the industry-wide level of production, the real drop had come to 
25 percent of the level of the first quarter of 1993. 
  At the same time, for the quarter as a whole the level of 
inflation had come to a value that is a record-breaking low for 
the last two years--146 percent. Moreover, it should be recalled 
that the inflation rates in the first two-three weeks of 1994 
were very high (5-7 percent a week), but have steadily declined 
subsequently. 
  The non-payments crisis has drastically intensified. The 
volume of overdue debt in industry has risen and as a 
consequence problems in the sale of finished products have 
increased substantially and the number of work stoppages and the 
complete shutdown of enterprises has grown. The financial 
instability of enterprises has increased and the amount of 
profit obtained has fallen. A drastic growth in the number of 
unprofitable enterprises and consequently a growth in the amount 
of the losses has taken place. 
  To a decisive degree the activity of the government was 
determined by the struggle with inflation, the rates of which it 
has tried to reduce by all means possible. 
<H8>  Gross Domestic Product </H8>
  In the first quarter the gross domestic product (GDP) had 
dropped by 4.9 percent in comparison with the fourth quarter of 
1993, and by 15 percent in comparison with the analogous period 
of last year. The drastic decrease in the production of GDP in 
January (by 29.3 percent in comparison with December) was 
accompanied by subsequent monthly growth--18.5 and 6.7 percent. 
However, the situation which developed during the quarter as a 
whole continued the trend of a steady decline in the GDP. 
  A tendency for change in the structure of the GDP has also 
been noted: the share of the production of goods has shrunk 
(from 49 percent to 43 percent), the share of services has risen 
(from 38.5 percent to 48.5 percent), and the share of net taxes 
on products and imports has fallen (from 12.5 percent to 8.2 
percent). 
  The reduction in the volumes of GDP is connected, first of 
all, with the continued shrinkage of the volumes of industrial 
production. However, the rates of the fall of the GDP are 
significantly lower than the rates of the fall of the volumes of 
industrial production. This is due to the increase of the share 
of services in the GDP. Thus, during the first quarter the 
volume of industrial production had come to no more than 75 
percent of the level of the fourth quarter of 1993. At the same 
time the services of trade and the housing economy have remained 
approximately at last year's level. The volume of financial 
services increases while the decrease in other services did not 
exceed 20 percent. 
  Thus, somewhat unexpectedly one has succeeded in achieving a 
more market structure of GDP formation, as in the western 
countries, where the share of services comes to no more than 50 
percent of GDP. In future, in our view, the GDP structure which 
has developed will not undergo serious changes--the anticipated 
limited increase in the volumes of production will be 
accompanied by an equal increase in the volume of services. 
<H8>  Material Production </H8>
  Crisis phenomena have increased in the sphere of material 
production during the first three months. 
  The trend of a fall in production observed throughout last 
year (the average-quarterly rates of the fall in comparison with 
the fourth quarter of 1992, according to our calculations, had 
amounted to 12-13 percent) has not only survived but has even 
grown noticeably stronger. During the quarter as a whole the 
drop had come to 26.6 percent in comparison with the fourth 
quarter of 1993, whereas production had fallen by 13.7 percent 
in the fourth quarter of 1993 in comparison with the third 
quarter. 
  A further "weighting" of the sectorial structure took place 
in the first quarter. The fall in production had amounted to 
about 27-28 percent in the processing sectors and 10-11 percent 
in the extractive sectors. Production is more and more acquiring 
a "raw material character." 
  It follows from an analysis of production in the branches of 
industry (see table) that the most stable situation was observed 
in the fuel and power complex (the rates of fall in comparison 
with the first quarter of last year were 7-9 percent). The drop 
in ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgy (fall rates of 15-17 
percent) as well as in the food industry (18-20 percent) was 
markedly lower than the industry-wide drop.

[.sup]*[/]Estimate.[.sup]**[/]Forecast. 


  A very difficult situation in the first quarter was noted in 
machine-building where the level of production had come to 55 
percent of the corresponding period of 1993, in the chemical and 
petrochemical industry (level of production--67-68 percent of 
the level of the first quarter of 1993) as well as in the 
timber, wood processing and pulp and paper industry. 
  The production of shoes, hosiery products, all types of 
fabrics, and sewn goods had declined significantly (the depth of 
the fall had exceeded 60 percent of the corresponding level of 
last year for individual groups). A similar picture was observed 
in the production of building materials (a decrease in the 
production of materials for general construction use by 30-35 
percent, of asbestos cement products by 50-60 percent, of panels 
for large-panel housing construction by 35 percent, etc.). 
  Beginning with the end of last year the crisis of 
non-payments in industry is intensifying against the backgound 
of continuing inflation and the growth of wholesale prices and 
the number of unprofitable enterprises has increased. 
<H8>  The Financial Situation of Enterprises in Industry </H8>
  If by the summer and at the beginning of autumn of last year 
the situation with non-payments in industry had remained 
approximately at a single level, the amounts of overdue debt had 
begun to grow beginning with the second half of October 1993. 
Thus, for industry as a whole the volume of overdue debt to 
suppliers had amounted to 10.99 trillion rubles by the end of 
January and had increased by 43.1 percent in comparison with 
September. At the same time the share of overdue debt to 
suppliers in the total volume of output produced had increased 
during this period from 46 percent to 68.8 percent. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-USR-054-20A>      Dynamics of the Change in the Share of Overdue Debt </FIG>



  An analogous situation developed also with the overdue debt 
of buyers, the volume of which had increased by 38.1 percent 
during September-January. The share of debt in the total volume 
of output produced had increased from 59 percent to 95 percent, 
i.e., buyers are not paying for practically the monthly volume 
of output produced. A situation has developed in which they 
don't take products because they're not needed but because 
there's no money and it's uncertain when there will be. 
  Analysis of the status of non-payments broken down by 
sectors 
indicates that the fuel industry, ferrous metallurgy, chemistry 
and petrochemistry, and machine-building have the greatest share 
of overdue debt. The amounts of non-payments in the building 
materials industry, light industry, and the wood processing and 
food industries are considerably smaller. This situation once 
more confirms the pattern that sectors which work to a greater 
degree for the consumer market are more stable in regard to 
finances and that their output is orienting itself to effective 
demand earlier than the rest. The sectors which produce raw and 
other materials react significantly slower to demand, continuing 
through inertia to produce what is required already in far 
smaller volumes. 
  In January 1994 the branches of industry had received a 
profit in the amount of R2.6 trillion, i.e., the volume of 
profit had fallen by a factor of three in comparison with 
January 1993 (taking inflation into account). At the same time, 
a reduction in profit by almost a factor of two had taken place 
during October-December 1993, and by 45.6 percent during January 
in comparison with December, i.e., by a factor of almost 1.5. 
  The fall in the volumes of profit in industry was also 
accompanied by a decrease of their share in the volume of 
industrial production--from 22.6 percent in September 1993 to 
16.2 percent in January of this year. This implies a further 
curtailment of investment demand and consequently also the 
absence of changes in the structure of the fixed capital of 
enterprises. The latter are not buying new technologies and new 
equipment and nearly not putting new products into production. 
In the best case the catalogue and quality of the products 
produced remains unchanged. 
  The dynamics of the ratio of the monetary funds of 
enterprises and the overdue debt to suppliers is also 
characteristic. In the first half of 1993 the monetary funds of 
the enterprises exceeded overdue debt by 20 percent, by the end 
of 1993 they covered half of it, and 40 percent by February. 
  The possibilities of increasing the effective demand of the 
enterprises through credit investments are very limited. 
  Analysis of the dynamics of the change in the volumes of 
credit investments indicates that, beginning with the second 
half of 1993, the rates of their increase had begun to shrink 
(in the third quarter the rates of their increase equalled 48 
percent, and in the fourth--30.3 percent). 
  Credit investments in the economy had increased by 6.8 
percent (compared to December 1993) during the month of January 
and by 11 percent during January-February. For the quarter as a 
whole the increase in the volume of credit investments will be 
two times less than the increase during the fourth quarter of 
1993. 
  As of the beginning of February the relative share of 
centralized credits in the total amount of credits had come to 
26 percent. In February its relative share had increased 
somewhat and reached a level of 29 percent. However, in 
connection with delays of receipts into the budget (by the end 
of March 1994 more than R4 trillion had not been transferred to 
the budget in the form of taxes) and the surviving high level of 
the budget deficit (8-9 percent of GDP), the possibilities of 
increasing the volumes of centralized credit are very limited. 
The latter is allotted mainly for the needs of the 
agro-industrial complex (44 percent) and the military-industrial 
complex, for deliveries to the Far North, etc. The situation 
with the use of the credits of commercial banks is no better. 
Under conditions of instability it is not profitable for the 
banks to grant credit for a protracted period. Short-term 
credits take up 86.5 percent in the total volume of credit 
investments and have a tendency to grow. 
  Against a background of the growth of the volumes of 
short-term credits and of bank interest, and also taking into 
account the increase in the number of unprofitable enterprises 
(in January their share had come to 16.2 percent as compared 
with 9 percent in December 1993, while the amount of losses had 
more than doubled in the past five months), the possibilities of 
increasing the effective demand of the enterprises through 
credits are becoming more and more limited. 
<H8>  The Status of Monetary Circulation </H8>
  It follows from an analysis of the structure of the money 
supply that the share of cash in the total supply of monetary 
funds had a steady tendency to grow throughout the entire 
preceding year and had risen during the year from 24 percent to 
38 percent (for comparison--in the USA this share comes to only 
a few percent). At the same time the rates of increase of the 
supply of cash constantly outstripped the rates of increase of 
the total money supply. 
  The situation had changed in the beginning of 1994. 
  In the first place, in January the share of cash in the 
total 
money supply had declined by 2.6 percent compared to December. 
Secondly, in January 1994 the volume of cash and non-cash funds 
had increased by 4.9 percent relative to December while the 
volume of cash had declined by 2.4 percent. This trend had also 
been preserved in February. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-USR-054-21A>      Dynamics of the Change in Per Capita Monetary Incomes </FIG>


  The contraction of the volume of cash in January had been 
one 
of the reasons for the lowering of the rates of inflation in 
February and the beginning of March. The currency emission in 
the amount of R1.6 trillion carried out at the end of February 
will undoubtedly stimulate an acceleration of the rates of 
inflation in April-May. 
  The velocity of the circulation of cash and non-cash money, 
according to data from the State Committee for Statistics, had 
been kept at last year's level in January-March: cash money 
circulates twice as fast as non-cash money. 
  In January 1994 the volume of GDP had declined (in 
comparable 
prices) by 29.3 percent in comparison with December 1993, while 
the volume of the total money supply in circulation had 
increased by 4.9 percent. 
  Since the growth of monetary funds has not been supported by 
a real growth in production, the money in the accounts of 
enterprises will be converted subsequently into cash, which will 
emerge as payment funds not backed by goods and will give rise 
to a corresponding growth of prices. 
  In analyzing trends of the change in the money supply, one 
needs to bear in mind that its growth does not mean an increase 
in the capital actually circulating. An increase in prices, 
especially wholesale, will result in its contraction. At the 
same time capital is depreciated more rapidly than the money 
supply grows. Thus, during January the money supply had 
increased by 4.9 percent while wholesale prices had increased by 
19 percent. 
<H8>  Inflation and Wholesale Prices </H8>
  Against the background of the worsening situation in 
industry 
a sharp surge of inflation had taken place in January of this 
year with a subsequent dampening of the rates of the growth of 
inflation: December 1993--113 percent; January 1994--121 
percent; February 1994--110 percent and March 1994--108-110 
percent. The level of inflation has come to 145-146 percent 
during the quarter. This is the lowest level during the last two 
years. 
  The surge of inflation in January was dictated by a number 
of 
the factors we have already mentioned. Insufficent effective 
demand had restrained an increase in prices in subsequent 
months. The state had not settled up its debts either with the 
miners, or the agro-industrial complex, or the 
military-industrial complex. The crisis in production had 
resulted in a significant shutdown of enterprises (some 4,280 
enterprises stood idle in February as against 3,789 in January 
and 2,407 in October 1993; production had come to a complete 
stop at 428 plants in February) and, consequently, in a 
reduction of the volumes of wage payments to industrial workers. 
The tense financial state of the enterprises had led to a growth 
of overdue debt with respect to the payment of wages of 2.2 
times in January and by 18 percent more in February, which had 
also caused a drop in demand on the consumer market. 
  The state intends to retrieve part of its debts in April. To 
a certain degree these measures will result in a revival of 
effective demand. The seasonal surge in the demand for a number 
of construction and light industry goods also will contribute to 
the growth of inflation, the level of which, according to our 
estimates, will come to about 15-16 percent a month by the end 
of the second quarter. 
  Despite an anticipated convergence of the rates of growth of 
wholesale and consumer prices even under conditions of a growing 
sales crisis, Russian industrialists, as before, do not see 
another way out besides a mechanical increase in the prices for 
their products. 
  For industry as a whole wholesale prices had increased by 19 
percent in January, 16 percent in February, and 15-17 percent in 
March. The index of the growth of wholesale prices during the 
quarter has come to 158-159 percent. 
  The correlation of the rates of growth of consumer and 
wholesale prices at the beginning of the year was analogous to 
the correlation of their growth rates in the second half of last 
year: on average wholesale prices are growing 15-20 percent more 
rapidly than consumer prices during the quarter. 
  The surviving financial strain in industry will become one 
of 
the factors in slowing down the growth rates of wholesale prices 
in the second quarter. Many enterprises, in striving to survive, 
will try to sell their product, even if only very cheaply. 
However, at the same time the abolition of state regulation of 
prices for the products of monopolists, the proposed allocation 
of credit to enterprises on the strength of clearing off the 
state debt, the increase of the prices for electric power and of 
transport rates will stimulate a further growth of prices. The 
superimposing of these two contradictory trends will lead to a 
moderate growth of wholesale prices which, according to our 
estimates, will amount to 60-65 percent during the second 
quarter.

<H5>  Prices for Consumer Goods and Services </H5>
  Over the period 12 to 19 April 1994 prices for consumer 
goods and services rose by 1.6 percent, including for 
foodstuffs--by 1.3 percent, nonfood items--by 1.9 percent, and 
for-fee services for the population--by 3.5 percent. The 
greatest increases in prices for foodstuffs were registered in 
the Urals and East Siberian regions (1.8-2.2 percent) and 
Kaliningrad Oblast (3.3 percent); food prices remained at 
practically the same level in the Volga region. Prices for 
nonfood items went up most in the Central region and West 
Siberia (2.3-2.8 percent), while in East Siberia they remained 
practically unchanged over the week. 
  Indices of prices for consumer goods and services in the 
consumer market were as follows (percentage of the preceding 
date):

the population 



  Since the beginning of the month prices have risen by 
6.3 percent, including for foodstuffs--by 3.7 percent, nonfood 
items--by 5.4 percent, and for-fee services for the 
population--by 36.5 percent. 
<H5>  Foodstuffs. </H5>
  Since the middle of March weekly price increases with 
respect 
to foodstuffs have become perceptibly smaller and amounted in 
Russia as a whole to 1.3 percent as compared to 3.2 percent in 
January-February. In April the rate of price increases for basic 
foodstuffs in nonorganized trade was almost twice as high as 
that in organized trade. Over the period 12 to 19 April prices 
in nonorganized trade rose by 2.1 percent, and in organized 
trade--by 1.1 percent. 
  Price changes by main categories of food products are shown 
below (percentage of the preceding date): 


                     Total           Including:

vegetables 


  In organized trade, similar to preceding weeks, 
vegetable prices rose at an anticipatory rate: prices for 
onions, beets, fresh cabbage, and carrots rose by 4-9 percent. 
Prices for some varieties of macaroni items, cereals, and bread 
and bakery products increased by 2-6 percent. There has been 
practically no change over the week in prices for meat, butter, 
vegetable oil, sugar, eggs, vodka, and potatoes. 
  Since the beginning of the month prices for macaroni items, 
cereals, salt, fruit, and vegetables have increased by 8.5-13 
percent; milk and milk products--by 4.9 percent; meat and fish 
products--by 2-2.6 percent. The average level of prices for 
sugar, eggs, and vodka changed insignificantly. 
  Similar to organized trade, the greatest price increases 
in nonorganized trade were registered with respect to 
fresh produce: for onions and garlic--by 11-13 percent, fresh 
cabbage and carrots--by 5-7 percent. The rate of price rises 
with respect to meat products increased somewhat in April (1.7 
percent). Since the beginning of the month prices for these 
products have increased by 5 percent. Prices for milk products 
and eggs remained practically unchanged. 
  The cost of the consumer basket of 19 basic 
foodstuffs increased over the week by 2.1 percent and as of 
19 April amounted to 46,900 rubles [R], calculated on a monthly 
basis. The price differential between monitored cities measured 
a factor of 4.4; the highest cost was registered in Magadan 
(R126,200), the lowest--in Ulyanovsk (R28,500). In terms of 
consumer basket cost, Moscow and St. Petersburg and Moscow 
ranked 32d and 40th among 132 monitored cities (R51,600 and 
R49,900 on a monthly basis). 
<H5>  Nonfood Items </H5>
  Since February prices for nonfood items have been rising at 
a 
somewhat higher rate than those for foodstuffs. Over the elapsed 
week of April gasoline prices rose more significantly--by 5 
percent. Prices for garments, knitwear, fabrics, and footwear 
rose over the week by 1.9-2.3 percent. Price rises with respect 
to cultural and household goods and tobacco items were 
insignificant (0.5-1.4 percent). 
  Since the beginning of the month prices for main categories 
of nonfood items rose by 4-6 percent. 
<H5>  For-Fee Services for the Population </H5>
  There were no significant price increases with respect to 
for-fee services over the elapsed week. Fees for consumer 
services increased by 2-3 percent; the cost of rail 
transportation, communication services, and sanitariums and 
resorts increased by 1.3-2.5 percent. 
  Since the beginning of the month rates have increased almost 
1.4-fold. Intercity train fares doubled, and rents in 
municipally owned apartments increased 1.5-fold. Electric power 
rates and notary fees changed insignificantly. 
<H5>  Industrial Production. </H5>
  Over 17 days of April 1994, of the 163 most important 
categories of products counted in periodic reports, average 
daily production, as compared to the corresponding period of 
1993: 
  --increased with respect to eight items, 
(including metal-cutting machine tools with numeric program 
control, city telephone cables, video cassettes, school 
notebooks, pencils, and tea), or 5 percent of the total number; 
  --decreased with respect to 149 items, or 91 
percent of the total number; 
  as compared to the corresponding period of March 1994: 
  --increased with respect to 86 items (including 
coking coal, diesel fuel, steel, finished rolled metal, mineral 
fertilizer, synthetic ammonia, tires for trucks and agricultural 
vehicles, large electric machinery, alternate-current and 
low-power electric motors, self-propelled cranes, woodworking 
machine tools, freight railcars, automotive graders, buses, 
truck trailers and semi-trailers, tractor hitches, friction-free 
ball bearings, paper, matches, high-grade asbestos, cement, 
rolled roofing and insulation materials, decorative ceramic 
tile, refrigerators and freezers, washing machines, electric 
vacuum cleaners, electric irons, radio receivers, tape 
recorders, bicycles, motorcycles, silk fabrics, nonwoven 
fabric-type materials, hosiery, coats and short coats, light 
coats, jackets, suits, dresses, slacks, shirts, skirts, 
footwear, meat, butter, high fat-content cheeses and feta 
cheese, canned meat and milk products, cereals, macaroni items, 
and vegetable oil), or 53 percent of the total number; 
  --decreased with respect to 71 items, or 43

  Based on the dynamics of production of the most 
important varieties of industrial output, it is estimated that 
average daily production in industry over the elapsed period of 
April 1994 amounted to 74 percent of that for the corresponding 
period of last April. 
  Output of main categories of industrial products over 17

<H5>  Agriculture. Agricultural Producers Production Plans for 1994 </H5>
  Before the beginning of spring field work (as of 1 March of 
this year), statistical organs jointly with the Center for the 
Current State of the Economy under the Government of the Russian 
Federation conducted a survey of intentions of 1,117 
agricultural enterprises and 1,510 peasant (private) farms on 20 
territories of the country on the subject of production of 
agricultural output in 1994. The surveyed farms account for 5 
percent of agricultural land in the country and represent all 
the main soil and climatic regions of Russia. 
  The results obtained show that the surveyed agricultural 
enterprises intend to keep the planting of grain crops and 
sunflower at last year's level, and to reduce somewhat the 
planting of sugar beet (by 9 percent) and vegetables (by 5 
percent). No expansion in the planting of fodder crops is 
planned. The gross yield may be negatively affected by the 
shortage of mineral fertilizer, and with respect to some crops 
also that of planting material. As of 1 March of this year, 
mineral fertilizer stocks at all surveyed enterprises as a whole 
amounted to no more than 30 percent of need. 
  In animal husbandry, a slower rate of herd reduction is 
envisaged with respect to all varieties of livestock except 
sheep. 
  The survey showed that peasant (private) farms, which have a 
lower level of material and technical support, show greater 
economic flexibility and intend to increase by 5 percent the 
planting of grain crops, particularly the planting of sugar beet 
and vegetables, while leaving sunflower planting at last year's 
level. The area they plan to use for planting of fodder crops is 
envisaged to increase by 15 percent. In animal husbandry farmers 
plan to increase the herd of main categories of livestock by the 
end of the year, especially the herd of swine. 
  The selective survey program included evaluation of 
enterprises' financial and economic status. Almost 90 percent of 
surveyed agricultural enterprises believed that their financial 
and economic situation had worsened in 1993, and only 5 percent 
of enterprises said that it had improved. The overwhelming 
majority of enterprises (97 percent) appraised the state of 
animal husbandry as average or bad, and only 3 percent 
considered it good. The appraisal of the state of plant-growing 
was somewhat better: 61 percent of enterprises consider it 
average, 32 percent--bad, and 7 percent--good. Only 4 percent of 
surveyed agricultural enterprises believe that their situation 
will improve in 1994; 78 percent are convinced that it will get 
worse. 
  Peasant farms view their situation in 1994 in a somewhat 
more 
optimistic light: One-quarter of them believe that their 
financial and economic situation will improve; however, one-half 
of farmers believe that it will get worse. 
<H5>  Animal Husbandry </H5>
  In the first quarter of this year as compared to the 
analogous period of 1993 the volume of sales of livestock 
and poultry for slaughter declined at all categories of 
farms by an estimated 10 percent, production of milk--by 11 
percent, and eggs--by 6 percent. At agricultural enterprises, 
which are the main producers of animal husbandry products, the 
volume of meat and milk production decreased by 15-16 percent, 
and eggs--by 6 percent:

  Production of animal husbandry products on personal plots 
remained approximately at the level of the corresponding period 
of last year. 
  The decrease in the size of the livestock herd is 
occurring mainly at agricultural enterprises, where the pace of 
horned cattle and swine herd reductions has stabilized at the 
level of 10-13 percent as compared to the corresponding month of 
last year, and cows--at 6-7 percent. An especially significant 
decline has occurred in the herd of sheep and goats (by 21-23 
percent).

  The remaining stocks of fodder at these enterprises as of 
the 
beginning of April of this year amounted on average to 6 
quintals of feed units per standard head of livestock, as 
compared to 5.3 quintals of feed units by this time last year. 
  In the first quarter of this year, 1.1 million tonnes of 
livestock and poultry (26 percent less than a year ago) were 
procured from agricultural producers for federal and 
regional food reserves, as well as 3.4 million tonnes of milk 
(22 percent less), and 5.5 billion units of eggs (9 percent 
less). At the same time, agricultural enterprises increased 
sales of animal husbandry products at farmers markets, through 
their own stores, the public catering system, and through barter 
operations. They sold 17 percent of the total volume of 
livestock and poultry, 4.5 percent of milk, and 7 percent of 
eggs outside the procurement network, as compared to, 
respectively, 11 percent, 2.7 percent, and 7 percent last year:

<H5>  Sales of Fresh Produce </H5>
  By 28 March of this year agricultural enterprises sold 
through all distribution channels 17,500 tonnes of greenhouse 
vegetables (24,200 tonnes in 1993). Of this, 12,800 tonnes (73 
percent of the total volume) were sold to procurement 
organizations, which is one-third less than last year:

  Sales of these products through other distribution channels 
increased. Since the beginning of the year, 4,700 tonnes of 
greenhouse vegetables (27 percent of the total volume sold) have 
been sold at farmers markets, through their own stores, and the 
public catering system, as compared to 4,200 tonnes (18 percent) 
last year. 
<H5>  The Farmers` Movement </H5>
  The process of creating peasant (private) farms in Russia is 
proceeding more slowly this year than last. Over three months of 
this year 7,300 new farms were set up (47,000 over the first 
quarter of last year) and by 1 April they numbered 277,300, with 
a total land area of 11.8 million hectares (43 hectares per farm 
on average). By the beginning of the spring campaign 
approximately 10.9 million hectares of agricultural land were at 
farmers' disposal, of which 7.9 million hectares were plowed 
land, or, respectively, 5.2 percent and 6.0 percent of the total 
area in the Russian Federation. 
  Surveys conducted by the State Committee for Statistics 
indicate that farmers are in a difficult financial situation. 
Production and social infrastructure of peasant farms are 
extremely weak; there is no mechanism for implementation of 
measures of state support for farmers, and money allocated for 
these purposes frequently does not reach the intended 
recipients. To a considerable extent it was for these reasons 
that 4,100 private farms ceased operation in the first quarter 
of this year (2,500 over the first quarter of last year). On 
average, for each 100 new farms in the first quarter of this 
year, 36--as compared to 14 last year--went out of business. 
  The dynamics of start-ups and disintegration of private 
farms 
by quarter in 1993 and 1994 are shown in the table (thousands of 
farms):

<H5>  Capital Construction </H5>
  In the first quarter of 1994, enterprises and organizations 
of all forms of property on the territory of the Russian 
Federation utilized R12.3 trillion of capital investment from 
all sources of financing, including R6.9 trillion, or 56 percent 
of the total volume of investment, for construction of 
production facilities (60 percent in 1993). 
  The investment dynamics are characterized by the following 
data:

  The main source of capital investment financing is 
enterprises' own resources; in the first quarter they accounted 
for R7.9 trillion, or 64 percent of the total volume of 
investment; means from the federal budget--R1.9 trillion, or 16 
percent; and local budget--R1.4 trillion, or 12 percent. 
  In the first quarter of this year capital investment in 
equipment, tools, and supplies comprised R1.574 trillion, or 52 
percent of the corresponding period of last year, including R464 
billion for equipment requiring installation (29 percent of the 
total volume). As of the end of the first quarter of this year, 
R3.955 trillion worth of uninstalled equipment requiring 
installation accumulated in warehouses in the capital 
construction sector, including R740 billion worth of imported 
equipment. 
  In the first quarter of this year some production 
capacities and facilities were put into operation: 240 km 
of power transmission lines with a voltage of 35 kV or higher on 
the territory of Bashkiria and the Mari Republic, Maritime Kray, 
and Volgograd, Voronezh, Moscow, Rostov, Saratov, Sverdlovsk, 
Tyumen, Chelyabinsk, and other oblasts; 29 km of gas pipelines 
in Kursk Oblast; 83 km of intercity communication cables in 
Samara Oblast; 761 oil and eight gas production wells in Tyumen 
Oblast; and capacities for production of 20,000 cubic meters of 
wood-chip board and 12 million units of construction brick in 
Krasnodar Kray, 150,000 cubic meters of non-ore materials in 
Kemerovo Oblast, 13,500 cubic meters of prefabricated 
ferroconcrete components and items in Altay Kray, and others. 
  The limit of state capital investment financed out of the 
federal budget for the implementation of measures aimed at 
elimination of the consequences of the Chernobyl nuclear power 
station disaster for 1994 is set in the amount of R578.1 
billion (in forecast prices); in the first quarter of this year, 
R33.2 billion (in current prices) has been used for these 
purposes. As part of the "Chernobyl" program, 10,400 square 
meters of residential housing have been built (4.5 percent of 
the annual target), and a hospital for 25 beds (5.9 percent). 
  In the first quarter of this year, R0.9 trillion in capital 
investment from all sources of financing has been used for 
development of the agro-industrial complex, which is 
half as much as last year. Investment of state-owned enterprises 
comprised 36 percent of total investment in the agro-industrial 
complex; privately owned--33 percent; and mixed Russian 
ownership--29 percent. Of this, R0.6 trillion, or 62 percent, 
was utilized for construction of production facilities. 
  Only a few facilities for processing and storage of 
agricultural output have been put in operation. Over 
January-March of this year, capacities for production of 3.1 
tonnes of bakery products a day were put on line in Moscow and 
Kurgan Oblasts, and for production of 95 tonnes a shift of 
whole-milk products in Kaluga, Sverdlovsk, and Tambov Oblasts. 
  Of the most important agro-industrial complex projects not 
completed in 1993, the only production facilities that were put 
in operation in January-March of this year were production 
capacities at a canning plant in the city of Urukh in 
Kabardino-Balkaria and at the Rosvyanskiy repair plant in 
Kurovskoye settlement, Kaluga Oblast. 
  In construction of social sphere projects, R5.4 
trillion was used in the first quarter of this year, which is 11 
percent less than the first quarter of 1993. The share of 
investment in the construction of nonproduction facilities is 
continuously increasing. 
  In the first quarter of 1994, R3.1 trillion, or one-quarter 
of the total volume of capital investment in the national 
economy, was spent on housing construction. Residential housing 
with a total living area of 4.0 million square meters was 
commissioned, which comprises 95 percent of the January-March 
1993 level and 50 percent of that in 1990:

  New apartments were received by 5,500 families of military 
servicemen, members of internal affairs organs, and persons due 
to be relocated from closed and stand-alone military bases. For 
them, 330,000 square meters of general housing were built, 
including 285,000 square meters in keeping with the plans of 
ministries and agencies that have military units. 
  Construction of education and health care facilities over 
the 
elapsed period was not extensive. Enterprises and organizations 
of all forms of ownership built general education schools for 
9,000 pupils, preschool facilities for 2,600 placements, 
hospitals with 1,674 beds, and ambulatory facilities for 1,960 
visits a shift. 
  Also put into operation were nursing homes for the elderly, 
disabled, and disabled children for 298 placements and 
orphanages for 100 placements. 
  During the current year 94.3 km of operational running water 
networks were put on line on the territory of Russia, or 81 
percent of the level of January-March 1993; 24.2 km of sewage 
lines (73 percent); 19.6 km of heat distribution pipes (111 
percent); and 836.5 km of gas pipes (94 percent). 
  Construction organizations of all forms of ownership on the 
territory of the Russian Federation performed R8.5 trillion 
worth of contract work in January-March of this year, which is 
24 percent less than over the corresponding period of last year. 
  The volume of contract work performed by

  As of the end of the first quarter customers had not paid 
for 
about 50 percent of the work performed over that period. In 
state organizations the share of such work comprised 44 percent, 
joint-stock--50 percent, and leased--55 percent. 
<H5>  Adherence to the Timetable of Passenger Trains and Aircraft </H5>
  In air transportation in the first quarter of this year the 
number of actual flights declined by 15 percent as compared to 
the analogous period of last year. The number of aircraft 
arriving late declined from 24 percent to 22 percent. About 1 
percent of scheduled flights were canceled or not carried out. 
  Adherence to the timetable of aircraft arrival at flight 
destination by different types of air service is characterized 
by the following data: 


                       Number of          Proportion of       Average delay, 
                       delayed flights,   late arrivals in    hours

  More than half of the domestic flights of the Vnukovo 
Airlines company arrived on average 4.6 hours late; of those 
carried out by enterprises under the umbrella of the Kamchatka 
regional civil aviation administration--60 percent, with an 
average delay of 7.7 hours; of the Far East regional 
administration--49 percent, 8.1 hours; of the Domodedovo 
production association--45 percent, 8.3 hours; and of the 
Mineralnyye Vody production association--42 percent, 2.7 hours. 
  On rail transport of the Russian Ministry of Railways, in 
the 
first quarter of this year 111,400 passenger trains (not 
counting suburban) arrived at their final destination--2 percent 
less than in the first quarter of 1993. 
  The number of late trains comprised 4 percent of the total 
number of arrivals as compared to 6 percent over the 
corresponding period of last year. Average delay time was 1.4 
hours (1.3 hours in the first quarter of 1993). 
  The greatest proportion of late trains was registered at the 
Kaliningrad (52 percent of all arrivals on that railroad), North 
Caucasus (9 percent), and Moscow (8 percent) Railroads. 
  The greatest delays were noted in train arrivals at 
destination stations of the East Siberian (average delay--2.5 
hours), Kemerovo (2.3 hours), Moscow, Baykal-Amur (1.8 hours), 
Sverdlovsk (1.7 hours), and South Urals (1.6 hours) Railroads. 
  In March of this year the number of departures of suburban 
trains declined as compared to January of this year by 5,400 (2 
percent). On the West Siberian Railroad 1,300 (13 percent) fewer 
trains departed; October Railroad--1,100 (3 percent) fewer, and 
Far Eastern Railroad--1,100 (25 percent) fewer. 
  Delays were registered in the departures of 1,900 (1 
percent) 
suburban trains. Average delay was 25 minutes. The greatest 
delays in suburban train departures were noted on the 
Kaliningrad, Gorkiy, Northern, South-Eastern, Volga, Sverdlovsk, 
Kemerovo, and South-Urals Railroads (average delay in departures 
was between 28 and 54 minutes). 
<H5>  Urban Passenger Transportation Services for the Population </H5>
  Currently 1,357 cities in the Russian Federation have a bus 
service, 113 cities--ground electric transportation, and 
six--subway. 
  Urban transport (excluding taxicabs) serves 110 million 
passengers daily, which is five times as many as served by 
suburban and intercity transportation by all types of transport. 
  Urban passenger transportation operates with great 
difficulty; the level of passenger service is declining, 
especially with respect to bus service. In 1993 the number of 
bus runs performed declined by 11 million, or 5 percent, as 
compared to 1992, and by 33 million, or 15 percent, as compared 
to 1991. 
  The deterioration of transportation services is also 
indicated by the results of a selective survey conducted by 
statistical organs at the end of 1993 in oblast (kray, republic) 
centers of Russia. Of 23,000 respondents, three-quarters noted 
that the operation of urban public transportation has become 
worse. Their opinion is supported by comparing it with the data 
received as a result of analogous surveys conducted by 
statistical organs in 1989 and 1990. 
  The average time spent commuting to work (school) increased 
by 8 percent (from 40 minutes in 1989 and 1990 to 43 minutes in 
1993). The proportion of passengers who spend 40 minutes to one 
hour, or more than one hour, commuting is high: 30 percent and 
19 percent of respondents, respectively (in 1989--27 percent and 
16 percent, in 1990--29 percent and 17 percent). 
  Considerable time is spent waiting for rolling stock to 
arrive. Because of greater intervals in the schedule of city 
transportation, one in four streetcars and trolley bus 
passengers and one in three bus passengers have to wait for more 
than 20 minutes at the stop (in 1989, respectively, one in 11 
and six minutes, and in 1990--one in six and four minutes).

  The average waiting time at a bus stop is 16 minutes, 
trolley 
bus--14 minutes, and streetcar--13 minutes. 
  The highest number of passengers waiting for buses at bus 
stops for more than 20 minutes were noted in Saransk, Maykop, 
Vladivostok, Astrakhan, Ulyanovsk, Yakutsk, Orenburg, 
Blagoveshchensk, Nalchik, Kaliningrad, Tver, Barnaul, Kyzyl 
(56-76 percent of passengers surveyed); for trolley buses--in 
Magadan, Groznyy, Saransk, Tyumen, and Vladivostok (53-100 
percent); streetcars--in Tver, Groznyy, Voronezh, and Ufa (50-60 
percent). 
  Greater concentration of riders on rolling stock creates 
additional inconveniences for passengers. Overcrowding of 
rolling stock during rush hours was noted by 86 percent of 
passengers using buses to commute to work (school), 82 percent 
of trolley bus users, 67 percent of streetcar users, and 53 
percent of subway users. 
  The main cause of such a situation is underutilization of 
the 
carrying capacity of the rolling stock. In 1993 more than half 
of ground passenger transportation remained unused daily in 
Astrakhan, one third--in Kaluga, Smolensk, Tambov, Samara, 
Stavropol, Nalchik. Kemerovo, and Blagoveshchensk. Half the 
buses and streetcars and one-third of the trolley buses were 
idle in Moscow and Tomsk. More than one-third of trolley buses 
were not sent on route runs daily in Elista, Magadan, Yakutsk, 
and Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy, where they are the only available 
kind of urban passenger transportation. 
  More than half of idle time is caused by repairs because of 
the great wear and tear of the stock. In common carrier 
automotive transportation, almost one-third of buses have been 
fully depreciated, and more than 10 percent of trolley buses and 
streetcars are being utilized beyond the term of their useful 
life. 
  The unsatisfactory technical condition of the rolling stock 
is causing a decline in the regularity of scheduled runs in 
passenger transportation. In 1993, 85 percent of urban buses ran 
on schedule, 92 percent of trolley buses, and 90 percent of 
streetcars. However, in a number of cities regularity of service 
was considerably below that: More than one-third of scheduled 
bus runs were not made in the city of Moscow, in Vologda, 
Voronezh, Kursk, Astrakhan, and Kaliningrad Oblasts, Khabarovsk 
Kray, and the Republics of Tuva and Chuvashia. One in three 
scheduled streetcar runs were not made in Ufa, Tomsk, Tver, 
Lipetsk, and Astrakhan. One in five trolley bus runs were 
canceled in Abakan, Barnaul, Vladikavkaz, and Tula. 
  There has been no improvement in transportation services for 
people working second and third shifts, 88 percent of whom use 
urban passenger transportation after work and only 6 
percent--their own enterprise's buses. Dissatisfaction with the 
operation of urban transportation at night was expressed by 69 
percent of surveyed bus passengers and more than half of trolley 
bus and streetcar passengers. 
  The survey showed that no work is being done to make 
transportation route grids more convenient for the population. 
As in previous surveys, only 46 percent of passengers surveyed 
do not have to change lines in commuting to work (school); 34 
percent make one change, 17 percent--two, and 4 percent of 
passengers--three or more changes. One-quarter or more 
passengers have to change lines twice in commuting to work 
(school) in St. Petersburg, Moscow, Abakan, Novosibirsk, and 
Cheboksary. 
  Passengers experience a certain discomfort in using urban 
transportation because of lack of information on stops. 
Practically all passengers of buses and trolley buses, in 
response to the question as to whether the drivers announce the 
names of stops, answered "sometimes" or "no." Only one in six 
streetcar passengers answered this question affirmatively. 
  The survey conducted by statistical organs revealed 
passengers' opinion on measures that would help improve the 
operation of urban passenger transportation. Among them were: 
maintaining schedules (noted by 32 percent of respondents), 
shortening intervals between runs (27 percent), modernizing the 
rolling stock (22 percent), opening new routes (11 percent), and 
restoring canceled routes (8 percent). 
<H5>  Migration Processes </H5>
  The migration-caused increase in the population of the 
Russian Federation over last year exceeded 430,000 persons and 
was the highest in the postwar period. The migrant flow was 
distributed as follows: 


                          Total, thousand    Including: 
                          persons

countries of: 

near abroad               922.9              565.3            357.6

Departed--total           495.2              380.8            114.4 

including to the 
countries of: 

near abroad               379.3              304.0            75.3 

far abroad                115.9              76.8             39.1 


  The high positive migration balance is mainly the result of 
reductions in the number of Russians moving to near abroad 
countries. The number of such emigrants was 380,000, which was 
1.7 times less than in 1992. Those moving to Ukraine numbered 
190,000 as compared to 342,000 in 1992; to Kazakhstan--63,000, 
as compared to 94,000, respectively; to Belarus--47,000, as 
compared to 64,000; to the Transcaucasus states--15,000, as 
compared to 62,000; and to other states--64,000 as compared to 
85,000. 
  As before, the population of Russia grew mainly due to the 
arrival of inhabitants of Central Asian states, the 
Transcaucasus, and Kazakhstan: They accounted for two-thirds 
(619,800 persons) of the total number of migrants to Russia. The 
number of those who have left the place of their former 
residence not of their own volition among all arrivals 
increased: In 1993 Russian Federal Migration Service offices 
registered as refugees and forced migrants 234,000 persons, or 
one in four immigrants. 
  A negative balance persisted in the interstate exchange 
between Russian and far abroad countries, Belarus, and Ukraine. 
Russian emigration to far abroad countries exceeded somewhat the 
level of previous years. As compared to 1992, 10,900, or 11 
percent, more persons received permission to move abroad 
permanently from MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] organs, 
bringing the total to 115,900 persons. As a result of a decline 
in the outflow of population to Belarus and Ukraine, Russia's 
migration losses dropped to 13,000 persons as compared to 
170,000 in 1992. 
  In developing the data on foreign migration, information was 
received for the first time on the gender, age, and education 
level of migrants. It showed that as a result of population 
migration the country got 105,000 more children under 16, 
261,000 more persons of work-capable age, and 64,000 more 
persons of retirement age. Migrants' distribution by age 
differed as compared to the structure of Russia's population at 
the beginning of 1993 in that the former had a higher share of 
work-capable contingents (60.7 percent as compared to 56.5 
percent) and a lower share of persons above work-capable age 
(14.9 percent as compared to 19.8 percent, respectively). The 
distribution of migrants by gender was more even: There are 928 
women per 1,000 men, with the average indicator for Russia being 
1,131. 
  Among the immigrants, 18.6 percent had a complete or 
incomplete higher education; among the emigrants--respectively, 
19.5 percent (22.8 percent of the number of those who left for 
far abroad countries, and 18.6 percent of those destined for 
near abroad countries). The share of persons with such education 
in the entire population of Russia was, according to 1989 census 
data, 13 percent. About 28 percent of migrants had secondary 
vocational training (19 percent according to the census).

<F P=106> [Article by Mariya Kara, "The Death of the </F>
Interregional Reform Bloc (MBR)"] 
  [Text] The "historic" and "fateful" parliamentary 
elections ended by reinforcing the parliamentary corps with the 
implacable champions of "internationalism" and social justice in 
the East and the no less aggressive fighters for "nationalism" 
and social justice in the West. Although there is no shortage of 
both sets of "champions, and we are guaranteed more futile 
verbal battles between them and the continuation of the endless 
Ukrainian serial of "A Madman at the Microphone," that is not 
the point. A diverse and motley centrism has entered the arena 
of Ukrainian politics, the most controversial current of which 
is represented by the Hrynyov-Kuchma bloc, popularly known as 
the Interregional Reform Bloc [MBR]. The fate of this entity is 
very important for Ukraine. 
  The original version of the political orientation of the MBR 
was quite simple. In economic terms, this meant "moderate" 
reforms modeled on Chernomyrdin's the the Civic Union's -- a 
script for building an amorphous state capitalism for the 
"parties of moneybags" controlling the cleaned-up Communist 
Party treasury and for "unaccountable owners" --the nomenklatura 
and the corps of directors. In the sphere of statehood, the MBR 
was openly heading towards federation and crawling to Moscow, 
back to the familiar system of ideas and concepts. These were 
the declared principles. But reality has taken a different turn. 
The MBR set out on the election marathon armed with such popular 
slogans in the East as Russian as an official language, 
federation, ties with the CIS and, above all, Russia, and 
economic reforms. This enabled it to effortlessly "beat" all the 
national-democrats. However, having been put together in haste, 
haphazardly, and without much thought, the Hrynyov-Kuchma team 
that was elected to parliament proved to be unusually 
heterogeneous. The seed of discord was already present in the 
leaders. L. Kuchma, ex-party organizer, ex-director, and 
ex-prime minister, relied on the only support available to him 
-- the directorial structures of the defense industry that he 
himself comes from. He was, is, and will be the spokesman for 
their interests, expressed by a formula as simple as 
H[.sub]2[/]O: state paternalism, a vertical structure, a 
state feeding trough, no worries, and a single [economic] space 
with the maternal teat of the Russian defense industry and the 
industry of polluting smokestacks and eternal nonliquidity. 
  On the other hand, Hrynyov and his team represent the money 
of the Party nomenklatura that has been laundered through mixed 
ventures [MP], joint ventures [SP], limited liability companies 
[LTD], etc.; they specialize in castles in the air and rosy 
clouds. This group is interested in eternal chaos and fears a 
strong government, which could put an end to their boisterous 
activity. The only common denominator between the two groups is 
their orientation towards Moscow. In addition, both these 
"leaders" have huge ambitions and a minimum of political culture. 
  The election results did not improve the situation. The MBR 
leaders in Dnipropetrovsk, Balashov and Co., suffered a 
devastating defeat because of unanimous opposition to Kuchma by 
practically the entire monolith of local directors and the party 
of power, headed by Pustovoytenko, whose favorite financial 
corns Mr. Kuchma had trimmed in the fight for the "market." They 
opposed Balashov as Kuchma's protege, even though essentially he 
is closer to Hrynyov's branch of the MBR than Kuchma's. As a 
result, the "disaffected" are inclined to blame Leonid 
Danylovych personally for this outcome. Things went even more 
badly in Zaporizhzhya and Kremenchuk, where the directors will 
not forgive Kuchma "until their dying day" for the case 
involving oil, the raids by law enforcement organs, and the 
formal terror they were subjected to during the MBR leader's 
tenure as prime minister. 
  Things were very difficult in the South, especially in 
Odessa, where Kuchma encountered something he had not 
anticipated -- he was forced to support Hurwits and his team 
because the local Russian-speaking niche is firmly occupied by 
Forum, which is both anti-Hrynyov and anti-Kuchma. And so he put 
together an absolutely incongruous hotchpotch made up of 
Hurvits, the Communist Bodelan, and Rychahov, the vociferous 
Russian chauvinist from the Social-Democratic Party of Ukraine 
[SDPU]. Included on this same quasi-MBR slate were Mr. Shyshkin 
(the former procurator) and Mr. Yevdokymov (Union of Lawyers). 
In other regions, they took what they could, as long as they 
were Russian-speaking and not from Kravchuk's party of power. 
These two qualifications were decisive. They did not stop to 
think that these two categories cover a political spectrum as 
wide as the Black Sea. 
  As a result, a very heterogenous bunch of people rode into 
parliament on the shoulders of the MBR. Most of this crowd is of 
the already fairly well established species of regional business 
leader and much more rarely administrative and scientific 
origin. Their worldview is based on pure pragmatism. Building 
the state means building the economy. Most are young people 
without any ideological complexes, whose ideal is to live as the 
West lives. For this camp, Moscow is a point to push away from 
rather than a point of attraction. This youthful, 
Russian-speaking crowd fosters liberalism in sensu 
stricto [i.e., in a narrow sense]. They are very far from 
Kuchma's economic and Hrynyov's geopolitical orientations, 
because in their defense of "their earthly interests and the 
native Ukrainian feeding trough" they will prove even more 
aggressive supporters of statehood than all the 
national-democrats put together. The political membrane that 
separates them from the Party of Democratic Rebirth of Ukraine 
[PDVU], Rukh, and the Ukrainian Republican Party [URP] is very 
thin and will give way in two or three months' time. They will 
consolidate not in the direction of the MBR, but in the 
direction of the spectrum named above. This camp's 
disillusionment with Kuchma was already in evidence at the 
congress of the USPP [Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and 
Entrepreneurs]. 
  Meanwhile, twenty-four hours later, an event took place in a 
cosy and comfortable hall near the Ministry of Justice that 
defined the process quite clearly: the founding congress of the 
thirty-third party to register --the Human Rights Party [partiya 
"Prav lyudyny"]. To sum up this event very briefly, this was a 
very small and harmless meeting of liberal-democratic lawyers, 
headed by Mr. Onopenko, the minister of justice. The views of 
this esteemed company were one hundred percent identical to the 
views of businessmen and economists of similar orientation, only 
focused on legal issues -- balancing the rights of the 
individual and the state, limiting state paternalism, "inherent 
rights," and other such liberal European classic concepts. 
  Among the founders of this new party are Shyshkin, Musiyaka 
(Kharkiv), and Sherepil (Sevastopol). As late as the eve of the 
congress, two of them were counted as members of the MBR. Taking 
into account that Shyshkin nd the other lawyers from the South 
ran as a united front, it is not difficult to predict that they 
will group together in parliament. On the other hand, there is 
no hope whatsoever that this moderate centrist team comprised of 
national-democrats, the more sober segment of the party of 
power, and liberals will support Mr. Kuchma or Mr. Hrynyov in 
their "revolutionary plans." The Human Rights party will foster 
a market economy "like theirs" with the same enthusiasm as the 
liberal economists and work to evolve a legal system based on 
Western models. 
  In the heat of battle, the MBR rashly pulled through the 
remnants of the PDVU under its banners, losing Volodymyr 
Filenko, the politician most loyal to Hrynyov in this party, 
along the way. In contrast, most of those from this party who 
won seats cannot imagine themselves in the same team with 
Hrynyov in their worst nightmares. Thus, in parliament, a large 
segment of the MBR will wander over towards the party of power 
and the national-democrats. 
  There will also be a flight to the left. The reddish 
spectrum, which Kuchma gathered together across the land under 
the single slogan of "Down with Kravchuk!", will not long remain 
under this partocrat's control. And so, such figures as Bodelan 
and Rychahov and Co., whom Kuchma supported, will move to take 
their place under the banners of familiar color and join the 
more congenial company of Petro Symonenko and Oleksandr Moroz. 
Others will head for the party of power, which they left for the 
duration of the elections for purely tactical reasons. 
  The prognosis regarding the fate of the MBR is evident from 
what has been said above. This heterogeneous group will unravel, 
causing the groups to which it gives political voice to do the 
same. 
  The liberal-democrats will unite with the more sober circles 
of national-democrats and will most likely abandon Kuchma. The 
Reds and reddish elements will support any leader from the ranks 
of the CPU, who has rid himself of all semicapitalist fancies. 
Consequentely, they, too, will no longer need Kuchma. Hrynyov's 
moneybags will continue pursuing their own goals and will remain 
a separate group that has clashed with Kuchma's group. And the 
corps of directors and their party of power in the central 
industrial region will fight Kuchma as an enemy of their lobby 
interests. 
  In these circumstances, Leonid Danylovych may end up with 
very few supporters and lose a significant portion of the 
electorate in the South and East. Even now, their number is not 
very large in Right-Bank Ukraine. Thus the parliamentary faction 
of the MBR may become a political myth.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The New Parliament: In Anticipation </F>
of Compromises? Some Thoughts After the Elections"] 
  [Text] The 1994 elections have provided a genuine criterion 
of specifically what the concept "political party" means for the 
population. It was revealed that--due to the throngs of 
independent candidates--voters were inclined to prefer persons 
who represent those political forces with whom they can identify 
as to convictions and personal likes. Given the lack of 
well-known names on the ballots of most Ukrainian election 
districts, for many voters a candidate's political affiliation 
became almost the only criterion of his convictions. 
Moreover--as attested to by data from pre-election sociological 
polls conducted by the "Democratic Initiative" 
Center--candidates' party affiliation was a plus for 71 percent 
of the voters. The information which motivated a voter 
identified his convictions with certain stereotypes of public 
opinion: the communists--with a revival of the super-state and a 
"Brezhnev-type" economic stability, or with "Russification," 
repressions, and hunger; the nationalists--with strength and 
order, or with hostility and rancor; the professionals and 
centrists--with economic reforms, or with marking time. Also of 
great importance for the course and end results of the elections 
were regional specifics--the decline of prosperity in Ukraine's 
traditionally industrial regions added to the votes cast for 
members of the communist and socialist parties. The socialists 
influenced voters by their special interests in solving the 
problems of rural inhabitants and those of Western Ukraine--a 
region which has traditionally favored right-wingers. Quite a 
few voters in Galicia and in Central Ukraine gave preference to 
those representatives of the national-democratic forces who 
advocated a path of gradual political and economic reforms. As a 
result, out of the 340 deputies to the new parliament, a 
preponderant majority (242 deputies) represent political parties. 
  The practical activity of this past parliament indicates 
that--one way or another--non-party deputies still gravitate 
toward this or that political force. From this point of view it 
seems feasible to present the non-party Ukrainian people's 
deputies within the general context of political forces in our 
country's newly elected highest legislative organ. 
<H8>  Representatives of Right-Wing, Non-Democratic Forces </H8>
  As expected, the right-wing political forces were unable to 
achieve any great success in the elections. Despite all the 
advertsing ballyhoo, none of the leaders or members of the 
extreme right-wing Docial-National Party of Ukraine could "make 
it" even to the second round. And of the persons supported by 
the associations known as the "State Independence of Ukraine," 
only Anatoliy Makhlay "made it" to the second round in the 
Vinnitsa region, but he lost therein. The Ukrainian Conservative 
Republican Party came though the elections with slightly better 
results. The leader of this party--Stepan Khmara-was elected in 
the very first round, and a member of this party--Roman 
Kuper--prevailed in the second round. A certain degree of 
success was also achieved by the UNA [Ukrainian National 
Assembly]. The following three candidates of the UNA were 
victorious in the election "lottery": Yuriy Tym, who "captured" 
the votes of Chortkov's voters right in the first round, Oleh 
Vitovych, who "got by" the chairman of the Lvov Oblast 
Council--Mykola Horyn--and Yaroslav Illyasevych, who beat the 
well-known economist--Zoryslav Romovskyy. The practical work of 
the parliament will show whether Ukrainian politics will be 
influenced by this 0.9 percent of the deputies' seats which have 
swung to the right. 
<H8>  National Democrats </H8>
  The best results among the right-wing parties were achieved 
by the KUN [Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists]. Although the 
leader of the KUN--Slava Stetsko--was unable (for reasons beyond 
her control) to take part in the struggle for a deputy's seat, 
three members of the KUN--Roman Krutsyk, Ivan Bilas, and 
Mykhaylo Ratushnyy--were elected to the office of Ukrainian 
people's deputy in the very first round, and in the second round 
three more members of this party were victorious--Hryhoriy 
Demyan, Taras Protseyat, and Lev Glukhivskyy. One deputy--Petro 
Shvydkyy--will represent the political position of the 
Nationwide Movement of Ukraine in the parliament; its 
leader-Larysa Skoryk--was not elected to the parliament. 
  These elections turned out to be a stunning defeat for the 
KNDS [Congress of National Democratic Forces]--a fact which many 
analysts have connected with the erroneous tactic of the KNDS in 
supporting structures which have lost the trust of Ukrainian 
voters. Elections were lost by the leaders of the 
association--Mykhaylo and Bohdan Horyn, Mikhaylo Batih, Roman 
Ivanychuk, Pavlo Kyslyy, Dmytro Pavlychko, Oles Shevchenko, and 
Oleksandr Hudym. It is already clear that this political force 
has no future prospects, and even its members acting separately 
will not be able to create a strong faction in the parliament. 
Although two members of the Democratic Party--Volodymyr Mulyava 
and Stepan Volkovetskyy--were able to become people's deputies 
as a result of the very first round of elections, this party's 
chairman--Volodymyr Yavorivskyy--was unable to win right away. 
And, therefore, the parliamentary faction of the Democratic 
Party, which consists of five members of parliament, will not be 
able to play an independent role. The situation in the Ukrainian 
Republican Party is similar. The absence of this party's leaders 
in the parliament will certainly not be compensated for by its 
deputation of nine members, among whom the best-known are Mykola 
Horbal and Yevhen Pronyuk. 
  The success of the NRU [People's Movement of Ukraine (Rukh)] 
in the first round of elections can be termed an event worthy of 
amazement. The election during the first round of this party's 
leader--Vyacheslav Chornovil--plus its leading activists--Serhiy 
Holovatyy and Les Tanyuk--as well as Volodymyr Lanovoy, whom 
Rukh supports, together with a continuation of the election 
struggle by 43 NRU members and 45 independent candidates also 
supported by Rukh, attests to the fact that the NRU faction in 
parliament will become the nucleus of the national-democratic 
opposition; the latter will be joined by the remaining deputies 
with the same orientation. The elections have dispelled yet 
another myth concerning the NRU--namely that this organization 
is predominantly one of a Western Ukrainian nature. During the 
second round Rukh representatives came to the fore in almost all 
the election districts in Kiev and Kiev Oblast, as well as in 
many districts of Vinnitsa, Dnepropetrovsk, Kirovograd, Sumy, 
Kherson, and Zaporozhye oblasts. As a result of this second 
round of the elections, the NRU faction--with 32 members of 
parliament-has clearly emerged as the largest parliamentary 
faction of national democrats. 
  Despite the defeat of its leader--Vitaliy Zhuravskiy--the 
Ukrainian Christian Democratic Party still has two deputies' 
seats and sent non-party candidates to fill another three 
deputies' seats; they were supported by the "Ukraine" Democratic 
Association, which is under the leadership of Levko Lukyanenko. 
Six representatives were elected to parliament from the 
non-party organization--the Union of Ukrainian Officers. 
<H8>  Right-Wing Centrists </H8>
  Even more modest were the results achieved by the 
once-powerful Party for the Democratic Rebirth of Ukraine. One 
of its ideologists--Ihor Koliushko--won the election marathon 
right away thanks to support from the "New Wave," which is 
influential in Galicia. And another two members of this 
party--Taras Stetskiv, who also came from the "New Wave," and 
Serhiy Sobolev--won a competitive struggle in a different 
precinct. To be sure, Sobolev would probably have been assured 
of support in any case not only from the PDVU [Party for the 
Democratic Rebirth of Ukraine], but also from the MBR 
[Inter-Regional Bloc for Reforms]; however, the leader of this 
party--Volodymyr Filenko--was not helped to win by such "double 
support," and he has dropped out of the parliamentary game. The 
Social Democratic Party of Ukraine remains on the brink of 
defeat, from which it will be difficult to escape. 
<H8>  Independent Candidates </H8>
  Among the 108 non-party candidates who were elected to 
parliament, 17 have taken political stances somwehere between 
the left-centrist parties and the centrist, pre-election blocs. 
To be sure, it is quite difficult to find glaring contradictions 
between the former vice-premier Lanovyy and the president of the 
Ukrainian Financial Group, Babych. It may well be anticipated 
that the people's deputies who belong to this group will--in the 
various parliamentary discussions--be on the side of or in favor 
of the Rukh-type national-democrats (Holovatyy, Pynzenyk). 
Moreover, we cannot absolutely rule out the formation of a 
separate parliamentary faction or a centrist-type Inter-Regional 
Bloc for Reforms. 
<H8>  Centrists </H8>
  The 1994 elections were not good elections for centrist 
political parties. The chances of the MBR to secure victory for 
certain of its members obviously did not correspond to its 
clamorous advertising activity. The leader of the MBR--Leonid 
Kuchma--and his "comrade in the party"--Oleksiy Dmytrenko--won 
during the first round; but during the second round the MBR 
added only 10 deputies. Moreover, the Bloc's other 
leader--Volodymyr Hrinev--was able to win only with great 
difficulty. It is possible that the MBR, together with 2 
deputies from the Civic Congress of Ukraine and another 1 from 
the Liberal Party of Ukraine, 2 independent Crimean deputies, 
and 25 businessmen, whose pre-election programs were not 
essentially different from those proclaimed by the MBR, will be 
able to form some kind of centrist nucleus within the parliament. 
<H8>  Left-Wing Centrists </H8>
  These political forces are characterized by a greater 
orientation toward supporting the state sector of the economy 
than is the case even with the MBR. This is true inasmuch as 
there are a great many representatives of the power structures 
among the members of the left-centrist parliamentary trend. 
Among these 66 deputies (19.6 percent) one can single out 
certain subgroups: 24 directors of large-scale industrial 
enterprises, 9 representatives of local councils, 19 
representatives of the government and state administrations at 
various levels, 4 editors of newspapers, and 4 representatives 
of law-enforcement organs. With regard to the remaining 
representatives of this parliamentary group, we could relegate 
another 26 (7.7 percent) members of parliament--members of the 
Peasant Party of Ukraine who advocated the path of prudent, 
sensible, evolutionary changes in the former composition of the 
Supreme Council--to this parliamentary faction. Although many 
representatives of the Peasant Party of Ukraine's power 
structures (for the most part, chairmen of collective farms or 
their deputies) were supported during the elections by the 
Communist or Socialist parties, right now it is hard to say 
whether this circumstance is still of decisive importance during 
the parliamentary voting and whether it was useful for 
stimulating the electorate. 
<H8>  Left-Wingers </H8>
  It would also seem obvious that it is hard to discern the 
difference between the left-centrists and the left-wing 
political forces. The grounds for such a differentiation may be 
seen, however, in the fact that only one representative of the 
Peasants' Party of Ukraine--Oleksandr Cherenkov--was entered on 
the lists of deputies as a member of the CPU [Communist Party of 
Ukraine]. On the other hand, it is difficult to see any 
essential difference in the political orientations of the 
official-left-centrists and the five representatives of the 
Labor Party, among whom are also several members of the 
Ukrainian government. Be that as it may, the left-wing forces 
have acquired significant representation in the parliament. Such 
a conclusion could have been drawn even after the first round of 
the elections, in which victories were gained by one of the 
leaders of the Socialist Party of Ukraine--Volodymyr 
Marchenko--and the first secretary of the CPU Central 
Committee--Petro Symonenko. On the whole, left-wing forces are 
represented by 114 (33.8 percent) of the deputies' seats. 
  It is difficult to unequivocally assess the results of the 
elections for the left-wingers. Of the 29 members of the 
Socialist Party of Ukraine and those persons supported by that 
party, only 17 managed to win deputies' seats. Of the 153 
contenders for deputies' seats from the Communist Party who made 
it to the second round, 85 were elected to the office of deputy, 
while another 5 members of the Communist Party of Crimea also 
won deputies' seats. 
  However, such a number of contenders from the left-wing 
forces cannot be regarded as sufficient for a parliamentary 
majority. Furthermore, the elections demonstrated that the 
left-wing forces are quite heterogeneous. For example, the 
political programs set forth by members of the Communist Party 
of Crimea are characterized--more so than the others--by the 
motif of "Slavic unity," whereas the predominant majority of the 
Communist Party of Ukraine's deputies consists of 
representatives from Lugansk and Donetsk oblasts, from the 
Crimea, and--to a certain extent--from Zaporozhye Oblast. Such a 
"regional" approach by the communists may be largely attributed 
to a nostalgia among the voters in these regions for the times 
when average wages there were 20-25 percent higher than for 
Ukraine as a whole. 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  Although the newly elected parliament has not yet begun its 
work, some preliminary forecasts regarding its activity can be 
made already. The composition of this new parliament provides 
scant grounds for anticipating its ability to work effectively. 
Analysis of the election results from the 110 election districts 
bordering on those where people's deputies were elected 
indicates that the subsequent election of deputies will hardly 
make any substantive changes in the composition of the Ukrainian 
Supreme Council. There is no complete parliamentary majority, 
and the parliament will inevitably split on most of the matters 
to be brought up for a vote. The supporters of a certain 
economic course will most assuredly have to be satisfied with 
creating not exactly a faction, but rather certain tactical 
blocs for the purpose of solving particular problems. 
  The election results attest to the fact that quite a large 
group of Ukrainian political figures have henceforth lost a 
parliamentary rostrum. Furthermore, the Supreme Council has 
lost such political antagonist as Filenko Fokin, Skoryk, 
Barabash, Altunyan and Meshcheryakov, the Horyn brothers and 
Kotsyuba, Charodeyev and Shevchenko, Pravdenko and Matviyenko, 
as well as many others. The extra-parliamentary factor of the 
presure which will flow from these politicians in Ukraines's 
public life will also have its own influence.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Kolinko: "Former Minister's Legacy"] </F>
  [Text] Kiev--A portrait of former Defense Minister 
Konstantin Morozov, a principal candidate for the office of 
president of Ukraine, has been published in the nationalist 
UKRAINSKAYA GAZETA. The ex-minister has been demonstrating an 
enviable political assertiveness as of late. He is sharply 
criticizing the present Ukrainian leaders. In a book that has 
just appeared, for example, he ruthlessly shows the hypocrisy of 
the president of Ukraine, publishing details, carefully 
concealed by the Ukrainian side, of the Massandra negotiations 
between Yeltsin and Kravchuk. The ex-minister's critical attacks 
are being given credence, it would seem. But is there anything 
positive and creative in his political experience permitting a 
moral claim to the presidency? 
  ...Major General Konstantin Morozov, commander of the 17th 
Air Army, was appointed minister of defense after the August 
putsch of 1991, when he appeared to be virtually the sole 
commander in Ukraine who supported the idea of the creation of 
independent armed forces. In fact, Leonid Kravchuk had no choice 
in this appointment. The main role at that time was performed 
not by military professionalism and breadth of outlook but 
political orientation and trustworthiness. 
  Virtually the sole achievement of developed socialism in the 
USSR were the armed forces. Ukraine had the best part of them, 
both organizationally and technically. So that in the creation 
of its own armed forces there was no need to perfect or 
modernize anything. It was sufficient to preserve what had been 
acquired, changing merely the system of the chain of command. 
  But the minister of defense went his own way. He began the 
organizational development of the armed forces with the 
ideologization of the army. Ukraine had decided that the 
soldier's main weapon was his selfless patriotism. A so-called 
sociopsychological service of the armed forces was formed. 
Whereas previously political officers had coached the career 
personnel in the postulates of the classics of Marxism-Leninism, 
they now began with the same zeal to inculcate the ideas of 
Ukrainian sovereignty. A campaign to eradicate from people's 
memory the heroic pages of the history of the Soviet Army was 
mounted. The straightforward implantation of the traditions of 
the Ukrainian Insurgent Army and the ideology of Petlyura, 
Bandera, and Mukhevich began in place of this. Konstantin 
Morozov appointed to the position of leader of the 
sociopsychological service Vladimir Mulyavu, who had in two 
years made dizzying career progress from sergeant of the reserve 
to major general in the field. 
  This patriotization turned out as might have been expected: 
nihilism, increased desertion, and the flourishing of hazing. 
  Konstantin Morozov removed from the leadership of the 
Ministry of Defense the best professionals--for, more often than 
not, the simple reason that against their background the 
professional level of the minister himself seemed quite insipid. 
Thus General Sobkov, chief of the Main Staff, General Oleynik, 
deputy minister for armament, and General Ignatenko, deputy 
minister for personnel, quit their posts. 
  An idea that has as yet no counterpart in the armed forces 
of 
other countries, on the other hand, was realized: unification of 
the navy and the air defense forces. It was in this way 
confirmed that in military matters Ukraine would be going its 
own, original way. 
  Considerable losses were sustained by military research and 
military education thanks to the activity of the newly fledged 
General Yuriy Prokofyev, who was appointed chief of the Ministry 
of Defense Directorate of Education. Of the 34 academies and 
schools, he retained only nine military training institutions, 
having eliminated, for example, the Kiev Combined-Arms Command 
Military School, one of the best in the former USSR, and having 
destroyed during the reorganization the unique equipment of a 
number of training centers. 
  ...Mariya Cherednichenko, an inhabitant of the Onufriyevka 
community of Kirovograd Oblast, believes that army commanders 
made her son a criminal. After having been drafted into the 
army, the young man ended up in a strategic aviation unit not 
far from Kiev. The Busol association, which uses military 
aircraft for commercial transportation, operates at the 
long-range bomber unit base, apparently. The stores for housing 
arms and military equipment were stuffed with footwear, 
clothing, perfumery, home electronics, sugar, butter--goods 
which practical fellows from the Caucasus were ferrying on 
military aircraft on commercial routes known only to them. At 
night the soldiers would be roused at the command of toughs in 
leather jackets to load up another aircraft. 
  Guarding the storehouse with the commercial odds and ends, 
Mariya Cherednichenko's son was unable to withstand the 
temptation, stole, was caught, and was committed to trial. "I am 
not excusing him," his grief-stricken mother says. "But I did 
not send him to the army for him to guard the property of 
profiteers and mafiosi who had built a thieves' nest in an 
operational military unit...." 
  In Konstantin Morozov's years at the helm of power the army 
become a huge proving ground for economic activity. 
  Inasmuch as in the former Soviet Union Ukraine had, as a 
consequence of its geographical location, been the key component 
in a possible conflict between the countries of NATO and the 
Warsaw Pact, the republic was literally larded with the most 
modern military equipment and represented a principal arsenal of 
the USSR. Aside from this, an immense quantity of military 
equipment and munitions had been concentrated here in recent 
years in connection with the withdrawal of Soviet forces from 
the Warsaw Pact countries and Germany. With Ukraine's 
proclamation of independence, all this material wealth became 
its property. 
  And, simultaneously, a base for criminal business. 
  As Grigoriy Olmechenko, colonel of the Security Service and 
people's deputy of Ukraine, believes, a substantial part of the 
$12-16 billion which annually ends up in overseas banks in the 
personal accounts of a few hundred citizens of Ukraine is the 
result of commercial deals involving military hardware and 
equipment. 
  Theft and economic crime have affected all army strata: from 
the privates through the generals. The crime list abounds in 
reports of the sale by soldiers of grenades, automatic weapons, 
pistols, and grenade launchers stolen from military stroes. The 
level of the "commercial activity" of the officers is somewhat 
different: the sale for cash of trucks, tractors, bulldozers, 
equipment, gasoline, and building materials which have allegedly 
been written off. 
  As far as the generals are concerned, the horizons of 
activity are far wider here. 
  In accordance with an order of Konstantin Morozov, a 
Commercial Center for the sale of military equipment and weapons 
was formed more than two years ago under the auspices of the 
Ministry of Defense. The monies earned were to have been 
channeled into the construction of housing for the servicemen 
(several tens of thousands of officer's families are without 
apartments in Ukraine today). 
  But it was ascertained right from the start of the center's 
activity that even the highly modest monies which it was earning 
were being channeled mainly into the replenishment of accounts 
in various banks, foreign banks included, for the purchase of 
prestige automobiles for the generals. The Commercial Center was 
created, incidentally, in defiance of legislation of Ukraine, 
was not a legal entity, and was not, therefore, licensed for the 
activity in which it was engaged. The deputy prosecutor general 
wrote to Konstantin Morozov about this 18 months ago. He did not 
receive a response to his message, and he himself was retired 
shortly after. 
  The Commercial Center, meanwhile, was involved in very 
curious actions. Such as, for example, the deal involving the 
sale of 13 warships, including the Leningrad, Provornyy, and 
Komsomolets Ukrainy ASW ships, the Dmitriy Galkin tender, and 
several patrol craft for a total of... just R35.1 million! In 
experts' opinion, this is tens of times less than their true 
worth. At least, as was ascertained subsequently, the 
Ukraina-AKHTIAR joint-stock partnership, which acted as the 
middleman, made some R129 million for just two ships from these 
13. 
  At approximately the same time the Commercial Center sold 
various authorities eight military bases and three individual 
buildings and did so in such a way, what is more, that the 
Ministry of Defense of Ukraine was caused a loss of more than 
R110 million. 
  Such transactions followed one after the other. Information 
to the effect that approximately 80 tanks were sold abroad last 
year and that the proceeds constituted only $375,000 filtered 
into the Ukrainian press. 
  And although the Commercial Center was ultimately disbanded, 
the public never heard of any of its leaders being punished. 
  Although, no. There was one such instance, but in accordance 
with the well-known rule of "rewarding the nonparticipants, 
punishing the innocent." This happened when 23 Tu-16 long-range 
bombers were written off at a military unit located in Lvov 
Oblast. The Commercial Center concluded a recycling contract at 
that time not with the state-run Ukrtvortsvetmet, as required by 
law, but with the Asper (Kiev) small enterprise. The value of 
the 23 bombers being written off was put at 1.2 million 
Ukrainian karbovantsy. According to the commodity-exchange rate, 
however, a tonne of such scrap metal has a value of not less 
than $1,000. The agreement was signed by the leaders of the 
Commercial Center with the blessing of Lieutenant General G. 
Zhivitsa, deputy chief of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine 
Main Staff. When, following the intervention of the Security 
Service of Ukraine, however, this deal was canceled, the person 
punished was... Major Gubanov, the commander of the military 
unit at which the Tu-16 bombers had been based. A person who had 
had nothing to do with the deal concluded in Kiev. 
  General Vladimir Tolubko, leader of the "hawks" in the 
Ukrainian parliament, who has insistently demanded the 
preservation of nuclear weapons in Ukraine, has prospered and 
continues to prosper. Appointed 18 months ago the leader of the 
Kharkov Military University, he has shown himself there to be 
primarily a magnificent businessman. And it is not only a 
question of his apartment-dacha epic, which was successful, but 
which raised a considerable clamor. The general has conducted a 
number of large-scale commercial transactions: He has sold for a 
pittance practically new trucks in the guise of ones that had 
been written off and leased to commercial entities premises of 
the military university with an area of more than 3,000 square 
meters (what price a military secret here!). And the university 
understands full well why tens of millions of karbovantsy have 
been transferred to the Dobrodiy Commercial Bank: The general 
himself is a cofounder of this bank. I have absolutely no reason 
to believe that the former minister was involved in this 
malfeasance or that he is in the least way mixed up in dirty 
machinations. But what use is a leader who cannot bring if only 
elementary order to bear in the area entrusted to him?

<F P=106> [Article by Vasyl Shevchuk, deputy minister of environmental </F>
protection of Ukraine, doctor of economic sciences: "The Effect 
of Harmful Wastes. Ways To Integrate Economic and Ecological 
Reforms in Ukraine"] 
  [Text] Centralized administration of Ukraine's economy over 
a prolonged period of time caused it to develop with huge 
structural disproportions. The ecological problems it inherited 
are primarily the esult of the improper use of natural resources. 
  The inefficient economic system with ownerless property and 
administrative redistribution of funds promoted wasteful use of 
resources and inefficient energy consumption in monopolized 
production. Heavy industry with its resource-intensive 
technologies accounts for 61 percent of the gross domestic 
product in Ukraine's economy as against 34 percent in the 
economies of EC countries. The power-output ratio in Ukraine's 
gross national product is the highest among the countries of the 
former Soviet Union. It is nine times higher than in the 
countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation 
and Development [OECD], and nearly four times greater than in 
countries with higher than average per capita income. 
  This is what has created the "Ukrainian phenomenon" in the 
economy, which combines world prices with meager wages and a 
scarcity of goods. This same situation provides a key to 
defining the ways and methods for conducting economic reforms. 
The transition from centralized planning to a market economy 
must also include improving the environment by imposing harsh 
penalties for massive, unwarranted squandering of resources. 
  The principal factors that could promote progress in 
improving the state of the environment include ending political 
and administrative interference in price formation and setting 
wage rates, introducing a system of incentives through taxes and 
payments, using economic methods to equalize starting conditions 
in state enterprises and sectors, eliminating the 
interdependence of prices and revenues and material outlays, 
demonopolizing and restructuring production potential, 
restricting the access of enterprises to government money 
(budget restrictions), and abolishing subsidies for the use of 
such natural resources as energy, minerals, and water. 
  The decline in production is significantly reducing 
pollution. Market reforms provide an opportunity to preserve and 
reinforce this effect for the next decade by encouraging a shift 
towards resource-conserving and clean technologies and forms of 
activity. As industrial capital renewal proceeds, the dumping of 
most substances that pollute the environment can be maintained 
at a stable level or even reduced if there is rapid economic 
growth. Industrial restructuring will affect water pollution to 
a lesser degree, because most of these wastes come from 
agriculture, household plots, and public utilities. 
Consequently, in the long term, attention will have to shift 
from air to water pollution. 
  In the process of economic reform, we may discover 
advantages 
in stimulating investments in environmental protection in the 
private sector, especially if it can reduce undesirable results. 
Investments in environmental protection in the industrial and 
power sectors must conform to the lowest-cost principle and to 
the process of making decisions in the private sector. On the 
whole, the key factor in improving the state of the environment 
lies in the integration of environmental needs with the 
structure of sectorial policy. Abolishing subsidies for energy 
will result in reducing consumption and promote the use of new 
resource-conserving and cleaner technologies. 
  As a result of the critical shortage of available resources, 
divergences between economic and environmental interests will 
grow. Some of the old enterprises will continue to operate, 
because closing them would cause substantial social losses. Such 
enterprises must be required to implement environmental 
protection measures that do not require large financial outlays. 
Improvements can be achieved at most old enterprises simply by 
introducing "efficient management" (more painstaking repairs, 
combatting waste, installing improved regulating and monitoring 
equipment, applying more stringent standards in managing 
production and processing methods). These measures are very 
important, because it is not possible to introduce clean 
technologies on a large scale until new markets for the sale of 
various kinds of production are created and until the economic 
capability of enterprises is assured. 
  Privatization will promote market reforms. The government 
can 
speed up privatization and promote progress in the field of 
environmental protection by establishing clearly defined rules 
regarding responsibility for causing damage (harm) to the 
environment in the past and by making new owners liable for all 
pollution by toxic substances that results from their activity. 
In many cases, the state itself must assume responsibility for 
causing damage to the environment in the past. An audit of 
balance sheets (inventory) in the field of environmental 
protection must be conducted immediately in order to distinguish 
between the pollution caused in the past and that being caused 
now. And if production at privatized enterprises does not meet 
the necessary standards, stricter antipollution standards should 
be gradually phased in. 
  In the future, the structural reorganization of industry 
will 
lead to a reduction in the harmful effects of pollution on human 
health in a specific region as those employed in inefficient and 
harmful industries, which are subject to closing, are provided 
with opportunities to find new jobs, as economic activity picks 
up, and as the surviving enterprises accumulate sufficient funds 
to invest in new technologies. 
  Conducting an ecological and technological audit will enable 
us to collect the most important data on enterprises that do not 
lend themselves to privatized operation and to plan tasks for 
the short term. 
  In an economic system based on achieving gross production 
indicators, the state allocated less than half a percent of the 
gross national product for environmental protection, which 
failed completely to compensate for the damages and losses 
caused by the technogenic volume. Until now, an enterprise's 
economic liability for polluting the environment has been purely 
symbolic and has not exceeded 1.5-2.0 percent of its profit. 
  The creation of a new economic system of environmental use 
and environmental protection measures as part of the transition 
to a market economy must become an integral part of the system 
for managing and regulating the economy. 
  The principal elements of this economic mechanism must be: 
  payment for special use of natural resources; 
  payment for polluting the environment; 
  a system for financing and extending credit for 
environmental 
protection measures (state and local budgets, environmental 
protection funds, banks, enterprise funds, foreign investments, 
etc.). 
  To ensure that these fundamental goals are achieved and to 
create a system for financing environmental protection measures, 
a fixed percentage of the gross national product must be 
earmarked in the state budget for spending on measures to 
protect the environment. According to estimates prepared by the 
ministry of environmental protection and the ministry of the 
economy, this amount can and must be no less than 0.9-1.0 
percent of the GNP. The greater portion of this money should 
come from payments for the special use of natural resources 
(water, minerals, etc.) and payment for land. The remainder of 
the environmental protection costs should be met by the local 
budgets, ecological funds, and the enterprises' own funds. An 
effort should also be made to encourage the development of 
ecological business enterprise and the extension of credit by 
banks for investment in environmental protection. Taking into 
account the present ecological state of Ukraine, it is necessary 
to increase the proportion of environmental protection 
expenditures to 3-5 percent of the GNP. 
  The funds earmarked in the state budget of Ukraine for 
environmental protection measures should be kept separate and 
used to finance priority national and regional programs and 
measures. The construction of environmental protection projects 
using centralized capital investments must be conducted on the 
basis of government contracts. The ecological funds and banks 
must protect these funds against inflation. It is also necessary 
to create a favorable climate for investments and an effective 
system of realizing foreign investments in the Ukrainian economy 
in general, as well as in the protection of the environment.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Plyushch, chairman of the Supreme </F>
Council of Ukraine, by Anatoliy Mykhaylenko; place and date not 
given: " 'To Survive, Mankind Must Master the Lessons of 
Chernobyl' -- Said Supreme Council Chairman Ivan Plyushch in a 
Conversation with our Correspondent"] 
  [Text] 
  [Mykhaylenko] Ivan Stepanovych! Eight years have passed 
since 
the day of the tragedy that affected not only all of Ukraine, 
but, as we now know, the entire planet. Much has been said about 
Chernobyl, but not everything. As chairman of the Kiev Oblast 
Executive Committee at the time, you took part in liquidating 
the effects of the accident from the very first day. However, in 
all these years, you have virtually kept silent, only rarely 
referring to your participation. In light of all that we now 
know about Chernobyl and in light of the office that you held, 
is it not time to return to those days in April of 1986? 
  [Plyushch] I remember the first fire I ever saw. This was 
after the war, and it was my aunt's house that was burning. The 
memory of that fire has stayed with me all my life. Since that 
time, I have known the rules at work at a fire. First, there is 
the superstitious belief that you must not take anything from 
the site of the fire because it brings bad luck. Second, people 
rush to a fire to help: to carry water, or to beat down the 
fire, but not to stand by and pass judgment. And no one I knew 
ever bragged that he had done the most to put out a fire. In 
other words, when that terrible Chernobyl fire, that global 
catastrophe, broke out, the first thing we had to do was to put 
it out. 
  I think that everything that has been said and written about 
Chernobyl consists of first impressions and does not tell the 
whole truth. These things do not begin to explain the real 
meaning of Chernobyl, why it happened, and what needs to be done 
to make sure that nothing like it ever happens again. 
  [Mykhaylenko] Do you believe that the whole truth will be 
told in our generation's lifetime? 
  [Plyushch] That will depend on the direction in which our 
society moves. If it evolves in the direction set down in the 
Declaration on the State Sovereignty of Ukraine, I am certain 
that we will still have the opportunity to say and write and 
hear the whole truth. Above all, about the real causes and 
effects of this accident. I urge you to read Vitaliy Sklyarov's 
book, And Tomorrow There Was Chernobyl. I wrote a 
foreword to the book, in which I stressed the service that 
Sklyarov performed by describing the Chernobyl problems. As a 
citizen and a professional, as a person who was in Chernobyl 
from the very beginning, he told the truth. We were there 
together, getting covered with radioactive dust together and 
washing it off together at the bathhouse of the rayon electric 
power system. 
  [Mykhaylenko] Perhaps I was not completely accurate when I 
said that you have kept silent all these years. Undoubtedly, 
many people remember the speech you made at a session of the 
Supreme Council of Ukraine on 16 February 1990 during the 
discussion about the ecological situation in Ukraine. You spoke 
of Chernobyl in a way that none of the party or state leaders of 
the time dared to speak. In effect, you accused the then 
existing system from a high tribune of causing Chernobyl to 
happen. Were you not afraid to say this at the time? 
  [Plyushch] After a tragedy of that magnitude, after 
everything I had seen and experienced firsthand at Chernobyl, 
there was nothing left to fear. Following a meeting of the 
Government Commission in Chernobyl that ended in the early hours 
of 1 May 1986, I had to return to Kiev because a blood test 
showed that the dose of Roentgens I had received exceeded 
acceptable levels. Shcherbyna, the commission's chairman, 
surprised me by saying to me: "Ivan, you have turned out to be a 
weakling." Not understanding the real meaning of his words, I 
took his remark as a verdict that meant the end of me. 
  By fall, my blood had returned to normal, and on 15 
September 
I took up the watch a second time, this time to put the 
ill-fated third reactor in service. It had to be put into 
operation by the October anniversary celebrations no matter 
what. To make it appear as if nothing had actually happened at 
Chernobyl. 
  Thus, anyone who experienced Chernobyl firsthand, anyone who 
went through the hell there, has nothing left to fear... 
  [Mykhaylenko] Let us return to your speech at the session. 
You said: "The Chernobyl accident was not an elemental calamity. 
There are specific culprits involved who should pay for the 
losses they caused." You then went on to name those responsible 
for the accident: the specific Union ministries and departments 
-- the Ministry of the Nuclear Power Industry, the Ministry of 
Energy, and the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. Did these 
entities ever attempt to compensate the losses they caused, be 
it even partially? 
  [Plyushch] If we had lived in a civilized, rule-of-law 
state, 
then the departments which had run the nuclear power station for 
many years and earned large profits from it would have been 
compelled to pay for the losses. But the situation was quite 
different in the society in which we then lived. Although it was 
operated under Kiev's jurisdiction for the benefit of the whole 
Union and a number of foreign countries, the station did not 
contribute a single kopeck into the oblast budget. The local 
authorities had to carry out the station management's demands 
unconditionally and provide everything that was necessary for 
the maintenance of its personnel. We were all the station's 
drudges -- the Prypyat city authorities, the oblast authorities, 
and even the republican government. Even Kiev had no 
jurisdication over the Chernobyl AES. The station's managers 
feared only the Central Committee, because this body could expel 
them from the CPSU and that meant that it would take a long time 
to find another job. They disregarded all other authority. 
  When we were in the former Union, we worried where to get 
the 
one billion karbovantsi we needed to provide medical care for 
the residents of Kiev Oblast and to meet the needs of public 
education. This program cost 1.7 billion karbovantsi in the 
prices of the time. For a long time, we did not know where this 
money would come from. But when the Chernobyl disaster occurred, 
just in 1986 alone, close to 9 billion karbovantsi disappeared 
seemingly without a trace to cover the costs of liquidating the 
effects of the accident. For that, the money was found... But 
that was for putting out the fire as soon as possible. 
  Thus, no one in Ukraine believed that anyone would 
compensate 
us for the losses we had suffered. Although the economy of the 
former Union was strong, and it was easier to liquidate the 
effects of the accident then than it is now. 
  Ukraine's national economy is only rising to its feet, 
whereas, according to our modest and far from complete 
estimates, the work that needs to be done requires over 15 
percent of the budget annually. This would be too much to handle 
even for developed countries. 
  Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to 
apologize 
to the people who suffered losses and for whom the state is 
unable to show the concern they deserve. No matter how difficult 
things are for them, I ask them to be patient and be assured 
that as the national economy grows, the appropriations for their 
needs will also grow. Because it is hopeless to count on any 
significant aid from the outside world at this time. Of course, 
the European and world community, which is showing some interest 
in providing humanitarian assistance in liquidating the effects 
of the accident, could do more to help us in our trouble... 
  [Mykhaylenko] At that same session, you spoke of the need 
for 
an integrated state program involving large-scale scientific, 
medical, and socioeconomic measures. How urgent are these 
problems today, eight years later? 
  [Plyushch] Just as urgent as they were then. This program 
was 
developed and is being implemented. But we lack the funds to 
finance it adequately. I was present at a meeting of the Council 
of Europe in Strasbourg when they discussed the safety of the 
population that had suffered the effects of the Chernobyl 
catastrophe. Leading specialists from the International Atomic 
Energy Agency had prepared a thick volume of documents. But in 
their speeches, they argued that no definite conclusions had 
been reached whether, for example, it is safe for children to 
live in Kiev. 
  I said to them: "There are nearly 70 of you here, discussing 
a painful issue. After listening to the experts, you have 
reached the conclusion that science has so far not demonstrated 
that living in Kiev poses a danger to children. Yet we have no 
idea how this will affect their health in the future. Which of 
you will volunteer to go and live there yourself or send his 
children?" Everyone present at the meeting smiled sadly. I then 
said to them: I beg you not to draw any more such conclusions, 
because they are inhuman and cruel. Just because there is no 
money for financing assistance at this time does not mean that 
we need to prove that this program is unnecessary. No, we need 
to make an effort and look for funds. I believe that our public 
organizations need to be more persistent in their appeals to 
developed European countries and to other countries of the world 
for help -- at least in providing medical treatment for children. 
  [Mykhaylenko] Four years ago you said that sympathy had been 
dulled for people who require maximum consideration and 
kindness. Has this insensitivity not increased even further with 
time? 
  [Plyushch] We have been brought up in the spirit of 
conducting campaigns. There were sowing campaigns, harvesting 
campaigns, meetings, celebrations, anniversaries, etc. And once 
these were over, we forgot about them. But Chernobyl is the kind 
of tragedy that only grows more painful with time. Even back 
then, in 1986, not all of those who should have been sensitive 
to human pain by virtue of the offices they held exhibited such 
sensitivity. 
  Only some five months after the accident, they were forcing 
us to return the people evacuated from 14 settlements to their 
homes. We returned people to two villages, but not the rest. I 
was crucified for this by high-ranking officials. I remember 
Col. Gen. Kozlov, who insisted at the time: "The commission 
members have already drunk water from the well, and yet you keep 
putting off bringing the people back into the zone." I told him: 
"We will not send the people back until we are sure that it is 
safe for them to live there." And we did not bring them back... 
  Naturally, all wounds heal with time. But Chernobyl is not 
an 
ordinary wound. This is the first wound of its kind in the 
history of mankind. It will hurt even more, and it will fester. 
Most radioactive elements need dozens of years to decay. The 
results will be known in about seventy or eighty years. It is 
our unlucky lot to be hostages of the atom, to be subjects of 
the largest ever experiment -- to determine the effects of 
radiation on man and on the rising generation. 
  The tragic experience of Ukraine, which has been burned by 
nuclear fire, is not solely our internal affair. To survive, 
mankind must master the lessons of Chernobyl. 
  [Mykhaylenko] Yes, Chernobyl is a phenomenon of worldwide 
significance. But in all likelihood Ukraine will be left to 
fight its aftermath on her own. Speaking at the UN conference on 
the environment and development in Rio de Janeiro on 12 June 
1992, you urged: "Let us make of Chernobyl a sphere of global 
partnership and joint actions to decontaminate the destroyed 
reactor at the Chernobyl AES, to decontaminate large territories 
of land and water sources, to bury the radioactive wastes, and 
to solve the painful human problems resulting from this 
catastrophe." There was also an appeal from the president of 
Ukraine to create an International Chernobyl Fund. Did the world 
hear these appeals? 
  [Plyushch] I have not missed a single opportunity when 
travelling abroad to broach some aspect of the Chernobyl 
problem. Just as I did at the international environmental forum 
in Rio de Janeiro, which was attended by representatives from 
118 countries. These included such prominent world leaders as 
Bush, Major, Demirel, Mitterand, Castro... I cannot say that the 
world has remained indifferent. We received assistance. Although 
it was not always used in the best way possible. But these 
issues need to be repeated and raised at every European and 
world meeting in order to draw public attention to Chernobyl so 
that the world not grow complacent. 
  I would like to say some kind words about Cuba. This country 
is going through a difficult time. But the old popular saying 
still holds: a poor man is more generous. Cuba has assisted 
Ukraine in the past and is still providing assistance in the 
form of medical treatment for our children. We are sincerely 
grateful for this. I do not want to say that the rich are not 
helping, but their possibilities are much greater than Cuba's. 
  [Mykhaylenko] You stated that humanitarian aid is not always 
used in the best way. 
  [Plyushch] Our legislation requires that all aid be 
distributed under public supervision. The public organizes 
unions and elects the leaderships of these unions. When any kind 
of abuse is discovered, we look for someone in these unions to 
put things in order. These public organizations and the leaders 
of these organizations must be held accountable for any abuses 
that occur. 
  [Mykhaylenko] Such expressions as "before Chernobyl" and 
"after Chernobyl" have become part of popular usage. Just as 
once we had "before the war" and "after the war." What does this 
boundary mean to you personally? 
  [Plyushch] In my mind, this boundary has two dimensions. The 
first is that nuclear energy is a Satanic form of energy. I am 
convinced that Ukraine has not exploited all her available 
natural resources in order to not have dangerous nuclear 
reactors on her territory. Chernobyl was like a cold shower that 
sobered us up. If it had not brought us to our senses, there 
would be new reactors and nuclear power plants going up in 
hernobyl, Crimea, and other places. In Odessa, there were plans 
to heat buildings using water from the nuclear heat and power 
station. Anatoliy Petrovych Aleksandrov used to say: the time is 
not far off when even peasant houses will be heated with nuclear 
fuel. Thank God that we never got that far. 
  The second dimension is that we feel the breath of Chernobyl 
every day on our health... 
  [Mykhaylenko] Speaking of global problems, it would be 
interesting to hear more of your firsthand impressions of the 
events in which you were personally involved during those 
terrible days. 
  [Plyushch] I heard the news of the accident at two o'clock 
in 
the morning at my dacha. They telephoned to tell me that a fire 
had broken out at the Chernobyl nuclear power station. It just 
so happened that a civil defense exercise had been planned for 
the next morning throughout the oblast! 
  I thought that perhaps the telephone call was part of the 
exercise, and so I rang the oblast administration of internal 
affairs. They confirmed that there had indeed been a fire at the 
fourth reactor but that the fire brigades had arrived and the 
fire had been put out. When I arrived at the oblast executive 
committee, I called the civil defense headquarters. They 
informed me that they were determining the scope of the fire and 
the degree of danger. 
  At seven o'clock in the morning, we were gathered together 
by 
the first secretary of the oblast party committee and assigned 
our tasks in the planned civil defense exercise. Carrying out my 
assignment, I started out for the rayon where the reserve 
administration center was located. Instead of going to 
Chernobyl, we traveled in the opposite direction. When I reached 
Kaharlyk, I received a message that Shcherbyna, the chairman of 
the Government Commission, and other commission members were 
flying out of Moscow, and that I had been included in this group 
and should return immediately [to Kiev], meet them at the 
airport, and accompany them to the zone of the accident. 
  I did as ordered. From Zhulyany to Chernobyl, I rode in the 
same car with Academician Valeriy Oleksandrovych Lehasov, Borys 
Yevdokymovych Shcherbyna -- God rest their souls -- and Mykola 
Fedorovych Nikolayevych, the deputy chairman of the Council of 
Ministers of Ukraine. In Prypyat, we familiarized ourselves with 
the situation. At seven o'clock that evening, we held the first 
meeting of the Government Commission. 
  Shcherbyna reported to the highest leadership in Moscow that 
everything was normal, that the people were reacting normally, 
that several weddings had been held. At the same time, just in 
case, preparations were being made to evacuate the residents. 
Unfortunately, we were lying to ourselves and to the people. Not 
deliberately lying. Incidentally, the evacuation was conducted 
not because of radioactive contamination or radiation, but in 
case the reactor should explode. If there had been complete 
certainty that it would not explode, there probably would have 
been no evacuation. 
  This tragedy, more than anything, showed the "advantages" of 
our administrative-command, totalitarian system. On the one 
hand, a crudely low standard of technical design and equipment, 
and, on the other hand, a wholly unwarranted lack of concern and 
an irresponsible attitude towards people. Had anyone known that 
the time would come when they would be held responsible, no one 
would have built such stations... 
  [Mykhaylenko] You spent a lot of time in all at the station 
and in the zone, did you not? 
  [Plyushch] I think I spent a total of eighty-seven days at 
Chernobyl. A lot of days and a lot of Roentgents... 
  [Mykhaylenko] What do you think of the books about 
Chernobyl? 
  [Plyushch] I have tried to read the authors I know and whom 
I 
believe. I have no time to read books by those who wrote on the 
basis of the accounts of others. I recall one brochure by a 
doctor of physico-mathematical sciences who was also there from 
the first day. What he wrote was not long, but it was the truth. 
He also mentions me. He describes that the chairman of the 
oblast executive committee was extremely economical and did not 
understand what was happening around him. To load the sand they 
were using to put out the fire in the reactor, the helicopters 
were landing on the clover. This was early spring, the grass had 
grown beautifully, and I ran around begging: "Careful, you'll 
trample a lot of grass!" I knew how badly the farms needed this 
grass. The author describes this with goodnatured irony. But 
this fact itself shows that we did not realize the real scale of 
the accident at the time. 
  [Mykhaylenko] There is frequent mention these days of the 
notorious May Day demonstration held that year. They blame its 
organizers... You remember it too? 
  [Plyushch] I do... I left Chernobyl at one o'clock in the 
morning of 1 May and arrived in Kiev sometime after three 
o'clock. In the morning, I was standing on the official 
reviewing stand, and it seemed to me that the tower on the trade 
unions building was swaying the entire time... I stood there 
until the demonstration was over and then went to the 
polyclinic... 
  Today we know that these festivities harmed people. But how 
could we have known this at the time, if a top ranking official 
in the USSR civil defense force reported at the meeting of the 
Government Commission: "Two buildings have already been washed 
down in Prypyat, there is zero radiation, the people can be 
brought back." Specialists and officials were sending such 
reports both to Kiev and to Moscow... 
  [Mykhaylenko] On what note would you like to conclude this 
conversation about the planet's greatest tragedy? 
  [Plyushch] Let us pray to God that the people of Ukraine and 
the world never experience another Chernobyl or anything like it.

<F P=106> [Article by Volodymyr Yavorskyy: "Political Ruminations: </F>
Democrats, Nationalists, Communists and Others..."] 
  [Text] No one can deny that the majority of Ukrainians are 
extremely inert, both in politics and every aspect of human 
endeavour. This unbelievable passivity includes business, in 
which Ukrainian interests are by-and-large limited to narrow 
consumerism. "Go with the flow", "don't rock the boat," "don't 
look for trouble" and "don't think too much" are aphorisms that 
fit such people. This general apathy is the reason that other 
nationalities are beginning to dominate all new businesses and 
commercial enterprises. 
  This fact of life sharply differentiates Ukraine from other 
countries and a fact of life that Ukrainian politicians have to 
live with. 
  In practical terms this means that a small well-organized 
and 
determined group can take over Ukraine if it is dynamic enough. 
There is no need to bother with moral support from the Ukrainian 
masses. The latter will follow once they feel they are being 
adequately governed. The formation of a society always depends 
on a strong center of power, be it an individual or an 
organization, that has demonstrated a will to rule and organize. 
  What are the main political groups in Ukraine today? We hear 
mostly about democrats, nationalists or communists. What do they 
want? (Unfortunately, little is said about liberals and Russian 
chauvinists.) 
  There is much confusion about what they want and, in fact, 
about differences among them. This is largely due to misuse of 
terminology and a deliberate attempt by some politicians to 
obfuscate things rather than speak openly about their views. 
  Nevertheless, we shall attempt to clarify matters. 
  Every political group has an ideology that represents a 
value 
system and gives the group its name. 
  Democrats value the concept of democracy as the greatest 
good, i.e., a state of tolerance of various viewpoints. 
  Communists value the concept of the commune as the greatest 
good, i.e., communality, equality, and sharing. 
  Nationalists value the concept of the nation, i.e., 
preservation and protection of the national and cultural 
existence of a people. 
  Are these values contradictory and require a confrontation? 
Even if between the democrats and communists there is some 
degree of dissonance because of democratic tolerance and 
communist mandatory sharing of property, there should be no 
disagreement between communists and nationalists since their 
main values are not contradictory. Yet nationalists and 
communists are perceived as diametrically opposed forces. 
  Why should communists struggle with nationalists? After all, 
the most important thing to the communists is a communist 
society and to the nationalists a national Ukrainian state. The 
latter concentrate on statehood and the former on social order. 
The nationalists are unconcerned about the social order and the 
communists about Ukrainian statehood, 
  In short, there is no rational basis for a conflict between 
the nationalists and communists and they could cooperate in 
founding a communist Ukrainian state. Even the democrats could 
participate in this venture without too much trouble since a 
national state does not preclude democracy. In addition, the 
philosophy of tolerance allows the democrats to reach an 
understanding with the communists. 
  In theory, all three groups could accommodate each other to 
some extent in Ukraine. But reality is something else, and we 
see an uncompromising confrontation between communists on the 
one hand and the democrats and nationalists on the other. 
  But the struggle in Ukraine is not for democracy or 
communism 
or an analogous philosophy, but for the very notion of statehood 
for the Ukrainian nation. 
  In addition to democratic principles, the democrats advocate 
national statehood which to them is just as important as 
democracy and for that reason they have been called 
national-democrats. The communists propose--more-or-less 
openly--liquidation of Ukrainian independence and resuscitation 
of the Russian-communist empire known as the USSR. In this they 
are in agreement with the Russian chauvinists who long for a 
Russian empire regardless of its social order. 
  The key question is whether communism or the Russian empire 
is the real preference of the communists in Ukraine. If 
communism is their primary goal then liberals, advocates of 
individual freedom and private property, should be their primary 
adversary. But that is not the case. The communists have 
targeted nationalists and national-democrats--not liberals or 
garden-variety democrats--as their primary enemies, i.e., 
advocates of the Ukrainian national statehood. 
  Accordingly, since their primary goal is the liquidation of 
Ukrainian statehood and renewal of the Russian empire, they are 
better identified as Russian communists/chauvinists rather than 
as simply communists. 
  It is imperative that we have a clear understanding of the 
political goals of every movement in order to understand the 
social processes occurring in Ukraine. Any confusion as to the 
orientation of the key players can have catastrophic 
consequences. 
  Every citizen of Ukraine should understand that the struggle 
in Ukraine is not about democracy, communism, capitalism, etc., 
but for the very existence of Ukraine and the Ukrainian nation. 
The political forces in Ukraine are divided into only two 
groups: for and against national statehood. The first category 
encompasses nationalists, national-democrats and other political 
movements (including Marxists) who support Ukrainian national 
independence. The second category is made up of communists or, 
more accurately, communists/chauvinists or simply Russian 
chauvinists and others who want to destroy Ukrainian 
independence. 
  Since the very existence of Ukrainian statehood is at stake 
we must take care not to be distracted by secondary issues such 
as democracy, communism, market economy, etc., at the risk of 
losing our independence. The people have to be educated to 
defend the Ukrainian state against its enemies and not dissipate 
their energies struggling against communism or for democracy, 
capitalism or even Christian ideals. Ukrainian independence must 
be the primary goal for which we struggle. Other considerations 
are important but take a back seat when Ukrainian existence is 
at risk.

<F P=106> [Article by A. Panov and N. Preobrazhenska: "Be </F>
Careful--Don't Eat `Kovboy!'"] 
  [Text] The Zelenyy Svit [Green Earth] association had 
appealed to the General Procuracy of Ukraine as early as 1992 
with the request to verify the facts of gross violations of 
legislation for the purchase and use of pesticides in 
agriculture. 
  The General Procuracy took up this issue and ascertained 
significant violations of the law, as well as financial abuses 
on the part of some officials. It was thus determined that 
Ukrahrokhim, the Radykap plant and the Ukrayina AG had been 
buying up hundreds of tonnes of pesticides in various countries 
whose use is prohibited in those same countries. The IkrDITOKS 
Institute, or more precisely its leaders, who should have been 
standing guard against the penetration of poisonous mixtures 
into Ukraine, gave permission for their use. 
  It has been established that the damages to the state as a 
result of the actions of these individuals are valued at 18 
million dollars. Seven criminal cases have been filed based on 
these crimes. Investigation is now underway, but a question has 
arisen here: how can it be that we, ordinary mortals, are using 
pesticide products that are poisonous abroad? Not an easy 
question, the more so as the people affiliated with it are 
continuing their dirty work. 
  A governmental commission was created by request of the 
procuracy that was to halt the use of unsafe mixtures and punish 
the guilty officials, but this has not happened. Director M. 
Motuzynskyy and his assistants A. Podrushnyak, A. Bolotnyy and 
S. Omelchuk, removed from their positions at UkrDITOKS on the 
recommendation of the General Procuracy, were asked to be 
experts at the State Chemical Commission of the Cabinet of 
Ministers--that is, the chief judges of their own criminal 
actions. 
  The head of that state commission himself, V. Petrunyak, 
authorized the bringing of the unregistered mixtures into 
Ukraine. The chief sanitary physician of Ukraine, V. 
Mariyevskyy, who signed the authorization for the use in 
agriculture of a whole series of mixtures that are not safe for 
people, holds a senior position in the Ministry of Health to 
this day. 
  Carcinogenic, mutagenic and allergenic pesticides that are 
not even registered in the producing countries are being shipped 
into Ukraine with the blessing of high persons even today. And 
one can imagine what is being hidden on the farms if in the 
capital oblast alone--in Boryspilskyy rayon--mixtures without 
even names were being produced. The kolkhozes in Obukhivskyy 
Rayon have been using Kovboy and Satis mixtures, which are not 
listed among those permitted. In Vasylkivskiyy rayon, clear of 
radionuclides, they are polluting their fields to a significant 
extent with pesticides, while in Poliskyy the Ahroindustriya 
Scientific-Research Center is offering farms the unregistered 
Kovboy. Wherever you look, we are thus being polluted, robbed 
and poisoned--and no supervisor is being brought to liability. 
  The Ukrainian Zelenyy Svit ecological association has 
appealed to the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine with the request 
for the immediate removal from their posts of the people who are 
promoting the poisoning of the already quite polluted Ukrainian 
lands through their unprincipled and criminal actions. 
  Zelenyy Svit is also appealing to the citizens of Ukraine: 
people, be careful! Demand complete documentation for pesticides 
and herbicides, and certificates for their use in agriculture. 
Demand, from monitoring bodies of stores and markets, guarantees 
of the quality of agricultural products. Do not permit the 
poisoning of yourself and your children.

<F P=106> [Article by D. Khrushchov, F. Ovcharenko, B. Horletskiy, Ye. </F>
Motorin and Ye. Yakovlev: "Keeping Toxic Wastes From Sinking 
Into the Sea"] 
  [Text] Considerable amounts of highly toxic wastes (VTVs) 
from production in various sectors of industry have accumulated 
on the territory of Ukraine. These wastes are located in special 
storage areas on the grounds of the producing enterprises and in 
storage areas of various degrees of preparation outside the 
boundaries of those enterprises, as well as in unequipped dumps 
and random locations of unsanctioned burial areas. 
  Each of those places could be a hazard to the environment. 
The storage areas at the enterprises are most often concrete 
pools that are not safe against leakage as a consequence of 
technological defects, earthquakes, soil settlement and the 
entry of poisons into the atmosphere. Other locations of the 
VTVs are also not safe, with the poisons getting into 
underground and surface waters or carried off by the wind, 
animals and people. 
  Some 102 million tonnes of VTVs each year are produced in 
Ukraine today, with 22 billion tonnes of various types of 
uncategorized class I--IV wastes accumulated in storage areas 
(350,000 tonnes are buried in deep storage areas). 
  What to do with all of this stuff? It must be: 1) 
categorized 
(as much as possible) and 2) isolated. Useful components can be 
attempted to be extracted in recovery operations, with the rest 
used as a raw material, for example, in the production of 
building materials, glass and ceramic dyes. If that proves to be 
impossible, the wastes are immobilized (reducing the degree of 
hazard) by means of solidification, and encased in a matrix. 
  Two types of isolation are envisaged: long-term safekeeping 
and burial (final removal). Long-term safekeeping permits the 
extraction of substances that are preserved for final 
reprocessing to the extent of the development of new 
technologies and (or) burial. Requirements and technical 
specifications for the long-term safekeeping and burial vary. 
Storage areas at the surface, and sometimes the spent workings 
of mines and quarries, can be used for long-term safekeeping. 
  Burial can be safe only in stable geological formations. 
This 
requires the observance of a whole set of strict requirements, 
higher even than those for the burial of RAO--radioactive 
wastes. This is explained by the fact that in the opinion of 
some scientists, RAO loses its activity with the passage of 
time, while many VTVs retain their toxicity forever. 
  There are plants for the reprocessing and recovery of VTVs 
in 
many of the developed countries (United States, Germany, 
Australia and others). Methods of isolating them are being 
realized at the same time. Both surface-type storage areas and 
burial deep underground, chiefly in salt formations (Germany, 
Russia), are being used for this purpose. Both treated (for 
burial) and unprocessed (for long-term storage) wastes are being 
removed. There is experience in Russia in the creation of 
underground spaces using a contained explosion in clays for the 
burial of toxic agricultural chemicals (this method, true, has 
substantial shortcomings). 
  Ukraine scarcely has, or will have, ecologically clean 
technologies for the reprocessing and neutralization of VTVs 
today or in the near future, first and foremost for economic 
reasons. It would thus be expedient to develop technologies 
today for the isolation of VTVs, with their subsequent burial or 
placement into long-term storage. Ukraine has sufficient 
scientific potential to perform that work. Some has already been 
done--a system has been developed for the categorization of VTVs 
in accordance with international principles (based on the 
recommendations of the Basel convention), an information and 
analytical base has been developed and preliminary models have 
been developed for standardized technologies for the 
reprocessing and recovery of VTVs. Three geological regions have 
been designated that are potentially favorable for burial: the 
Ukrainian craton, the Dnipro-Donetsk depression and the 
northwestern Donbass. Plans have been developed for matrices for 
the principal types of VTVs according to the hydrogeological 
systems of the geological formations in which isolation is 
possible, and the fundamental types of isolation sites and the 
basic technologies for building or equipping them have been 
planned. 
  The problem of handling the VTVs--their production, 
gathering, sorting, transport, reprocessing, recovery and (or) 
isolation--should be solved within the framework of a unified 
state program, and on the basis of a scientifically 
substantiated conceptual framework. The creation of such a 
framework would be the first real step toward protecting the 
citizens of Ukraine against toxic wastes. The scientists are 
ready. A collective has already been formed that includes 
prominent scientists and specialists from many 
scientific-research, design and production 
organizations--institutes of geological sciences, geochemistry, 
mineralogy and ore mining/creation, biocolloidal chemistry, 
geography, the State Committee for Geology, Kiev University and 
the Kievproyekt Institute, among others. It is now the turn of 
the government.

<F P=106> [Article by Adam Hela, honored physician of Ukraine and </F>
chief physician, "Kashtan" Sanatorium, Truskavtsi, and Stepan 
Trokhymchuk: "Our Diseases Ride Railways"] 
  [Text] Misuse of our natural resources, environmental 
pollution and the generally poor state of sanitation have had a 
very negative impact on the health of our population. We wish to 
address one such problem and bring it to the attention of the 
government, ecologists, health workers and the citizenry. 
  Almost two million Ukrainians ride the railways every day, 
representing some four percent of the population. The average 
trip is 110 km and takes about three hours. Later the passenger 
comes down with furunculoses, digestive disorders, headaches and 
even viral hepatitis, diphtheria, dysentery or some other 
infectious disease. Rarely are these conditions connected to the 
railroad trip, the most popular and easily accessible form of 
transportation for local and long-distance trips. 
  The fact is, modern railroads are a serious health hazard. 
They are used for the transportation of vast quantities of solid 
and liquid substances that spill along the tracks and at 
railroad facilities and threaten every living thing. These 
substances include coal, petroleum products, acids, alkalis, 
poisons, mutagens and carcinogens. The most dangerous factors 
are infectious agents that contaminate passenger cars and are 
derived from human wastes that foul areas adjacent to the 
railroads. 
  In addition to the colon bacillus, human fecal matter also 
contains hundreds of other infectious agents, among them 
viruses, rickettsia, streptococci, staphylococci, pneumococci, 
vibrios, bacilli, protozoan cysts, eggs of intestinal worms, 
fungi, and so on. Many of them survive outside the human body 
and pose a danger for days or weeks, and some even persist for 
months and years. 
  In addition, unsanitary conditions in lavatories lead to the 
spread of other agents via expectorations and saliva responsible 
for tuberculosis, diphtheria, syphilis, typhus, and malaria. 
Soviet press informed us at the end of the 80s--in connection 
with the pre-perestroika and pre-glasnost amnesty of political 
prisoners-- that of the almost one million prisoners in jails 
and concentration camps 100,000 suffered from tuberculosis, half 
of them with open cavities. On his way home from a 
`re-educational' institution a single such returnee was in a 
position to infect three to five other passengers. 
  In general, 25-50 passenger trains move along the major 
corridors in a day; on some days this figure approaches 80. The 
average trains consists of 15 cars with 50 passengers, or 750 
passengers per train. If only one passenger uses a lavatory and 
flushes 100 grams of feces, then one kilometer of the track 
becomes covered with 5-10 kg of fecal matter every day, which is 
equivalent to 2- 3.5 tons a year. It would take a heroic effort 
to estimate the numbers of viruses, bacteria, protozoans and 
fungi that accumulate along the trains, are stirred up by the 
train movement, and then enter the compartments as aerosols via 
windows and doors to pollute the internal air and settle on all 
the surfaces. They are disseminated for distances that measure 
tens of meters away from the railroad tracks, contaminating 
plants, soil, ground and subsurface waters and infecting 
thousands of humans. 
  In addition, the number of foreigners using our trains is on 
the increase. Many of them are from tropical countries and serve 
as carriers of disease agents to which we have no immunity and 
physicians lack experience in dealing with them. This matter is 
all the more serious since the general level of immunity in our 
population diminished two-fold during the last half century, 
particularly after the Chernobyl tragedy, rendering us more 
susceptible to communicable diseases. As a result, infections 
are becoming more severe than was common previously. Not only do 
the train passengers suffer, but so do their families and all 
who come in contact with their infected clothing, possessions, 
and food. 
  Conductors, engineers, maintenance and service personnel are 
also exposed, and have a higher morbidity than the population at 
large. In fact, there are special tuberculosis sanatoria for 
railroad workers. 
  Our bacteriologic studies at the Lviv railroad station on 
passenger trains and other sites were yielded devastating 
results and would have had a shocking effect if published in the 
popular press. 
  Control of human waste is easy and inexpensive. Special 
removable containers can be attached to railroad lavatories and 
at the end of the trip emptied into methane tanks. The latter 
produce methane fuel as a result of fermentation, while the 
solid residue is transformed into high quality fertilizer. 
Biotechnological processing of human waste is ecologically 
sound, cost effective and socially beneficial as it protects 
public health. Finally, sanitation of the railroad cars also 
must be improved, including sterilization of air in lavatories 
with quartz lamps. Surely our lives and health are worth such 
efforts.

<F P=106> [Interview with Petru Lucinschi, chairman of the parliament </F>
of Moldova, by Arkadiy Romm; place and date not given: "You Need 
To Dress for the Weather"] 
  [Text] Petru Lucinschi, the present chairman of the 
parliament of Moldova, was not that long ago Petr Kirillovich 
Luchinskiy, first secretary of the Moldavian Central Committee 
and then secretary of the CPSU Central Committee. 
  One of "yesterday's men who has surprisingly discovered 
the present and, in addition, has a pretty good views for the 
future. The smile of fortune or the art of political survival? 
What does Mr. Lucinschi himself think about this? 
  [Romm] Brazauskas, Aliyev, Shevardnadze, Lucinschi.... One 
has the feeling that the former republics of the USSR have begun 
to pine for the leaders of the CPSU. Perhaps it is a question of 
the increased "buoyancy" of the former party leaders--they 
emerge from all scrapes? 
  [Lucinschi] Forgive me, but who started these "scrapes"? No 
one today cares to recall the ideas we presented in those times. 
That same Brazauskas and Shevardnadze, how they came in for it 
in those days! I was hit also, and there was reason--just read 
our public speeches of that time. Yes, we wanted change, how 
everything turned out is another matter. Not the best it could 
have been, to be blunt. 
  That which is new gradually grows out of the past. I do not 
believe that we are people of the old system because we not only 
proposed transformations but took part in them also. This is the 
first point. The second: In the old days also I was not so much 
appointed as elected, from the elections to the Kishinev 
University Hostel Council to election as secretary of the CPSU 
Central Committee. If people elect, consequently, they value. 
  We change together with life. I do not recognize politicians 
of whom it is said that their position is unshakable. When a 
person goes out, and it is raining, he opens his umbrella. Is 
dressing for the weather a retreat from principles? Of course, 
there are constant human values: kindness, love of motherland, 
integrity, finally. Political reference points are conditioned 
by life's demands. In one case one thing is suitable, in 
another, something else. It does not seem to me that in the 
former republics of the USSR people are being racked by 
nostalgia for the former times. It is more a desire for 
stability. And we are required to satisfy this desire of the 
people. If we cannot, we will be replaced by others. 
  [Romm] Today's political type and the Soviet political 
type--how much do they differ, in your view? 
  [Lucinschi] The former was more beset by complexes and 
oriented toward restrictions, stereotypes. There could be no 
dissertation, no speech, say, without quotations from Lenin and 
Brezhnev. There was more of a bifurcation at that time: There 
was politics "on the job" and "domestic" politics. Although we, 
the last generation of politicians of the Soviet Union, adhered 
less to the canons and argued more. Now, however, a politician 
is more unfettered and more decisive not only in his views but 
in his actions also. True, many people are commenting that there 
is too much argument and far from always on a point of 
substance. The lack of inhibition sometimes exceeds all 
permissible bounds. 
  Previously everyone understood that it was necessary to get 
along with those at the top. If you were held in some esteem 
there, your career was assured. Now, on the contrary, 
politicians orient themselves only toward those below them. Our 
members of parliament, say, it is quite difficult to unite them 
for collective action. Everyone tries to please his electorate 
first and foremost. 
  [Romm] Does it not seem to you, Petru Kirillovich, that had 
you not fallen foul of the first putsch, you would have fallen 
foul of the second? 
  [Lucinschi] Possibly. Too much is usually demanded of a 
politician--an instantaneous response to complex events. The 
national leadership at that time criticized us for our slow 
response to the events of August 1991. During the second 
putsch--rebukes once again, aimed at the Russian leadership this 
time. But this is life. And had things taken a different turn? 
Restraint is needed in such cases. Had I fallen foul of the 
second putsch, once again I would have been in no hurry. 
  [Romm] Can you distinguish in yourself, as a politician, 
your 
strongest and weakest traits? 
  [Lucinschi] My strong side is my weak side also--I do not 
form "my team," I rely on those with whom I happen to work. 
Trusting those around me, I have, of course, been "burned"--not 
everyone next to one is sincere. But it is better this way than 
trusting no one. 
  [Romm] Whether it is true or not, it is said that you feel 
quite lonely on Moldova's political Olympus. 
  [Lucinschi] Before becoming speaker of parliament, I held 
dozens of election meetings and socialized with thousands of 
people. Aside from planned meetings at enterprises, there was 
informal street contact also. It seemed to me that many people 
link their particular hopes with me. This restrains me each time 
it suddenly occurs to me to change the nature of my occupation. 
Am I lonely in this office? No, I do not experience loneliness. 
I experience another feeling--regret. It jars on me when our 
bureaucrat, having built a home and purchased a car, puts up one 
further little mansion and purchases yet another Mercedes--with 
dishonest money. Ours is a small republic, everything is in 
public view. If it is lonely, it comes from helplessness at 
being unable to bring order to bear. 
  [Romm] What will it take for this? You once said that 
Moldova 
needs 1,500 laws. When will you have prepared and adopted them? 
  [Lucinschi] A great deal of time will be needed, of course. 
But the present parliament, elected according to the 
proportional system, did in the first several weeks as much as 
the previous one did in six months. I said before the elections 
even that if one of the 13 parties that were fighting for seats 
in parliament were to obtain a majority, this would be the best 
thing. Otherwise we would once again be bogged down in 
intrapolitical struggle. I do not know of an instance in world 
practice of some member of parliament being answerable for 
having voted wrongly. It is usually the party that won the 
elections that is responsible. Had we not had a victorious 
majority here, we would have the same situation as in Russia, 
say. For what and to whom is Zhirinovskiy with his 22 percent of 
the vote responsible? Our Agrarian-Democratic Party, however, 
with which I am affiliated, has 54 percent of the seats in 
parliament. The parliamentary majority has formed a government 
accountable to both parliament and the people. An effective 
mechanism of power has come about. 
  [Romm] It was this, evidently, which secured the swift 
ratification of the treaty on Moldova's membership of the CIS 
also? 
  [Lucinschi] It was not so much politics as economics that 
prompted this decision. The manufacturers were telling us: Give 
us an outlet to the market. What kind of a parliament are we 
unless we create the necessary conditions for them? I was asked 
whether we would not be politically dependent on the CIS 
countries here. I replied: Of course we will be. What small 
countries are not politically dependent on big ones? This 
dependence does not frighten me, I failed to understand right 
from the outset why we had to reject the CIS. 
  [Romm] Will this ratification change relations between 
Moldova and Romania, in your view? 
  [Lucinschi] I would not say so. We have emphasized 
repeatedly 
right from the start that Moldova wants to develop as an 
independent state in friendship with neighbors and other 
countries. That some politicians of Romania view our decision as 
a sign of a cooling and even of a break with them altogether is 
another matter. But what there is in our common history, in the 
culture--this is here to stay. The common language itself 
presupposes closer human contact. The statements of our previous 
parliament and of a number of political parties were presented 
such that the people of Moldova want to unite with Romania. But 
sociological surveys have said that this is not so. It was no 
accident that the party that advocated unification with Romania 
mustered only 0.3 percent of the vote at the last elections. 
  [Romm] We have heard in Moldova repeatedly: We are not 
Moldovans, we are Romanians. You do not consider yourself a 
Romanian? 
  [Lucinschi] My parents and my forebears were Moldavians. 
Hence, I am a Moldavian also. And the majority of inhabitants of 
our state feels this way. After all, Moldova has had its own 
history since the 14th century. This was, as we know, the 
northernmost province of the Roman Empire, this was why the 
ethnonyms "Roman" and "Romanian" became prevalent. Some people 
call themselves Romanians now also. I am not allergic to this. 
If this is what you call yourself, so be it. 
  [Romm] The previous parliament relinquished its authority on 
account of it being unable to untie the "Tiraspol knot." Will 
not the present parliament depart for the same reason? 
  [Lucinschi] That corps of deputies was unable to handle any 
serious problem, specially such a major one as this. Now, 
however, we have quite a number of pragmatists who are not 
obsessed with extremes. The Tiraspol leaders themselves are 
saying that with the accession to power of the 
Agrarian-Democratic Party a real opportunity for resolving this 
problem has appeared. 
  [Romm] And what have you personally done to bring the banks 
of the Dniester closer together? 
  [Lucinschi] Inasmuch as the 14th Army is in the Dniester 
region, inasmuch as the self-proclaimed republic is supported by 
certain forces in Russia, and inasmuch as Russia is linked with 
this conflict in general, settling it without it is impossible. 
This is why I insisted that Russia appoint its representative, 
who would assume the role of mediator and be constantly up to 
date. Moscow agreed, and negotiating is now easier. 
  [Romm] You are being called the future president of Moldova. 
Is there any basis for this talk? 
  [Lucinschi] We will have presidential elections here in 1996 
so there need be no hurry. When I began my work in parliament, 
the press began to constantly set Snegur and myself against one 
another. It would like, evidently, to organize some conflict. I 
believe, however, that since we have been elected, we should 
work together--otherwise it will be bad for everyone. In a word, 
all in good time. Who knows what the alignment will be in 1996? 
I have experience of how changeable society's affections are, 
and I am not forecasting my presidency--this would get in the 
way of work.

<F P=106> [Article by Tiit Made: "Estonia's Foreign Policy 1993: `The </F>
Flying Minister' and Timidity"] 
  [Text] 
  On February 17, Riigikogu [Estonia's parliament] 
discussed Estonia's foreign policy, and listened to the 
government's plans for the future. Foreign Minister Juri 
Luik made a presentation on behalf of the government. It did not 
include any analysis of the previous year. Predecessors were 
praised, the Meri-Manitski-Velliste line was proclaimed, and a 
promise made to continue along that line. The Foreign Commission 
of Riigikogu limited itself to a statistical report of its work. 
The greater part of the government coalition was not interested 
in the discussion. The government, or rather its foreign 
ministry, was represented by only a few people. The independent 
media was enthusiastic about the minister's presentation. The 
session hall of Riigikogu was aglow, if not sold off, in a 
glitter of pretense. 
<H5>  We Lost Time in 1993 </H5>
  Estonia's foreign policy was not as successful as it was 
made 
out to be. We have lost time and missed out on international 
initiative. Actions taken have not always been sensible, nor 
have they been to the benefit of Estonia alone. We were too 
yielding, perhaps, to the wishes of super-states. We have given 
too much leeway to international organizations to dictate to us. 
The foreign politicians and officials visiting Estonia dispelled 
our vigilance, when they tapped us on the shoulder for human 
rights. Thus, we let United Nations stick us with an 
uncomfortable resolution regarding human rights. Now it is not 
quite clear whether we are violating it or not. 
  The priorities and the orientation of our foreign policy 
have 
also remained unclear. Out of Estonia's political elite, every 
person has his or her own vision of what state or what 
organization we should be dealing with. We didn't quite 
understand it ourselves, who is responsible for foreign policy 
in Estonia, or who has the last word. There was a power struggle 
between factions. That also irritated Estonia's friends abroad. 
  We waxed enthusiastic about international organizations. The 
rules of the game for UN, NATO, the European Union, CSCE and 
GATT were obviously not too well understood. We did not quite 
know the balance of power in UN and CSCE, which is controlled by 
Russia. For us, CSCE is a meaningless organization altogether, 
because it was created by the Soviet Union to further its 
imperialistic aims. Russia is very comfortable there. After all, 
representatives of CSCE have been promoting Russia's cause in 
Estonia quite unashamedly, gotten involved in our internal 
affairs, and fanned up international tensions in Narva. You can 
still remember what happened with the laws on aliens and local 
elections. 
  I watch with trepidation, how the theoreticians and 
practitioners of our foreign policy adopt the theories of CSCE 
emmissaries on integrating aliens into Estonian society. This is 
both dangerous and harmful. Such integration will subject us to 
the control of a stronger nation, ruin our culture, make us into 
a biligual country, dilute our pragmatic attitude to life, and 
reduce the necessary immunity to resist harmful foreign 
political influences. 
<H5>  Timidity About Russia </H5>
  During 1993, we have made many concessions harmful to the 
state of Estonia in the course of our dealings with our eastern 
neighbors. They had their way in fixing our sea borders. They 
have skilfully managed to delay removing troops and military 
pensioners from Estonia. They have been able to tell the world 
at large, without any protest from us, whatever they please 
about Estonia. They are about to get their way with the 
connecting regions treaty that is very harmful to Estonia's 
state security. They got voting rights for their legal and 
illegal citizens to participate in our local elections. They 
want to turn Estonia into an officially bilingual state. Their 
efforts toward changing the language law are continuing. They 
want Estonian citizenship for all of their people. This has 
already encouraged our governing officials to think about toning 
down the citizenship law. They have already obtained the right 
to apply for a residency permit for a portion of their military 
pensioners. They are not interested in economic cooperation. 
They are asking for greater political concessions, instead. 
  With the tacit approval of the Western states, Russia has 
taken us into its sphere of influence. No protest. Velliste's 
foreign ministry explained that there was no need to react to 
anti-Estonian statements made by Russian politicians. That was 
supposed to increase the sympathy level toward us. However, 
Russia kept hammering away, but no sympathy was forthcoming. The 
government kept assuring us that the Western states and NATO 
would not leave us in trouble. How big would that trouble have 
to be? The government consoled us that there was no need to 
worry about the limited contingent of Russian troops in Estonia. 
They were supposed to shrink anyway, and not be dangerous at 
all. We were beginning to believe. Now we are told that they 
cannot leave because of cold weather. Up until August 30, we 
will go on believing that they will be gone by August 31. Just 
as the government wanted us to believe in their departure by the 
end of 1992, and then again by the end of 1993. 
<H5>  The Foreign Commission of Riigikogu </H5>
  made repeated attempts during 1993 to encourage the foreign 
ministry to action that would be geared more to the interests of 
Estonia. Repeatedly, there has been talk of the conservative 
activity of our UN delegation, of the liberal stance of our 
negotiations with Russia, and of our lack of progress in setting 
up visa-free travel with other countries. The foreign commission 
asked why Canadian citizens can come to Estonia without a visa, 
while our citizens must pay 500 kroons for a visa. The need to 
set up rotation within our foreign delegations was pointed out 
to the foreign ministry. There have been detailed explanations 
of reasons why it would benefit our state to have the foreign 
ministry initiate a wide-ranging propaganda campaign to explain 
our positions. Members of the foreign commission recommended 
that the foreign ministry protest against the anti-Estonian 
statements made by the Russian politicians, and other acts 
harmful to the state committed within Estonia's territory by the 
"political tourists" from CSCE. 
  Riigikogu and its foreign commission had to take the 
initiative, because motivating the government did not bear 
fruit. Now, the international public is aware of Riigikogu's 
position on the growth of imperialistic tendencies in Russia'a 
foreign policy. And also of the position of the foreign 
commission on negotiations being held with Russia and the 
presence of Russian troops in Estonia. Riigikogu has turned to 
parliaments and governments of the world asking them to 
influence Russia that it, as the legal successor to the Soviet 
Union, would acknowledge the occupation and annexation of 
Estonia. But even these undertakings had their opposition. Why 
irritate Russia? There have been quite a few members of the 
foreign commission and of Riigikogu who cannot stop their 
endless editing, which keeps putting off the passing of the 
resolution. 
  Riigikogu's involvement in foreign policy issues seems to be 
paying off. The harsh statements made by Russia's politicians 
and members of the government have diminished in number. On 
February 20, Ostankino's [Russia's major network] News program 
referred to Riigikogu's statement about the precipitation of 
Russia's imperialistic tendencies. It was done with a touch of 
annoyance, but containedly. Russia does not respect neighbors 
who are whining, subservient or without opinions of their own. 
<H5>  Foreign Ministry Like a Sailor's Wife </H5>
  The busy staff of the foreign ministry spent the year of 
1993 
either expecting or sending off its minister. The `flying 
minister' spent almost half of his work-year abroad explaining, 
at press conferences, that Estonia is regarded everywhere with 
benevolence and respect. We are being supported, we have 
learned. Last fall, however, when this support was needed at UN, 
we didn't get it because our `friends' threatened to walk out on 
the meeting. That was the way it was explained to us to justify 
the failed maneuvers in the matter of the human rights 
resolution relating to Estonia and Latvia. We found out that 
abstaining from the vote was a diplomatic coup and a concession 
to Latvia. We were told that the two Baltic states would be left 
at the mercy of the African countries, who would be happy to 
support Russia. Our `flying minister' had not yet gotten through 
to the African tribes. 
  Now, one can always come back to the human rights problem. 
At 
Russia's insistence (or proposal), UN has even appointed a 
special counsel to the executive secretary for that purpose. We 
are wrapped up tightly with Latvia now. That is why we also have 
to share some other issues. Like that of the Skrunda radar 
station. I don't think that giving Russia the station is an 
internal matter for Latvia. This sly maneuver is as hazardous to 
their security as it is to ours. 
  The staff at the foreign ministry is different from those 
found at other state offices. It includes many individuals whose 
thinking has evolved in other parts of the world. The 
rank-and-file Estonians often find it hard to share some 
high-ranking official's understanding of Estonia's situation, 
its relations with its neighbors, and its tactics for handling 
foreign relations. I can well understand how convictions that 
have been implanted in people in some distant motherland, can be 
different from those held in our native country here. Prominent 
figures from the other side of the Atlantic may think that 
Estonia should be yielding, accommodating and considerate of the 
complicated political and economic situation of our great 
neighbor. For that we should keep our state egotism at bay. One 
can assume that this is the order of the day in the minds of 
many ministry officials from some foreign land and that it 
becomes part of the policy being pursued. I sincerely hope I am 
wrong, although this is what we are seeing. 
  I want to reiterate here to the columnist from HOMMIKULEHT 
(see HL April 18, 1993) that I was not `making faces' from the 
podium of Riigikogu and `believed sincerely' that the chief of 
foreign ministry's political department stated the momentary 
stance of some North-American country, maybe also that of the 
exile-Estonian leaders at the foreign ministry, to keep Estonia 
from approaching NATO. This young official reacted to 
Lithuania's desire to join NATO quite clearly: 1. it can cause a 
counter-reaction in the West; 2. it is not realistic; 3. we 
should wait to be invited. No commentary has been forthcoming. 
  Riigikogu has difficulty understanding the Estonian language 
of the foreign ministry. Riigikogu received some documents that 
have caused anxiety. Like ratification of the famous 
`buttonhole', `sidecar' or the Baltic states economic 
cooperation law. Riigikogu has accommodated the foreign ministry 
to the maximum, and even violated its own procedures to get the 
matter settled fast. I am not complaining that the foreign 
ministry exerted a certain pressure on Riigikogu. We were even 
being lobbied by some of Estonia's outstanding industrial 
leaders. We believed their argument that unless this document is 
ratified during 1993, the Estonian industry will collapse. 
Nothing tragic happened, however, because the law is still not 
in effect. It would be nice to have less panic in the work of 
the foreign ministry in the future. 
<H5>  Situation Is Far From Hopeless, </H5>
  even though we cannot give a satisfactory rating for the 
foreign policy of 1993. That part of the foreign minister's 
presentation at Riigikogu that deals with visions for the future 
of our foreign policy is quite factual. It seems that the 
orientation for foreign policy that has been quite confusing up 
until now, is beginning to take shape. Providing a logical 
direction for staff activity at the foreign ministry is also 
essential. The current staff needs a good airing out. Other 
countries have been imposing too much of their will and their 
ideology on us. 
  The idealization of leading Western countries is bound to 
come to an end soon, as we start looking for allies among such 
countries that can sense the danger emanating from Russia on 
their own skin. Those who don't sense that danger get out from 
under every time an important resolution needs to be passed. 
They simply do not wish to spoil their relations with Russia for 
some small Baltic state. 
  It's a good thing that the foreign minister spoke seriously 
about the need for close cooperation in the Baltic region. Such 
cooperation was hard to come by in 1993. A few visits or 
meetings between high ranking officials do not necessarily 
signify profound and coordinated relations. Due to our reserved 
stance toward countries with leftist governments, cooperation 
between the Baltic states was hampered because of Lithuania. 
Listening to Juri Luik, one is likely to get the 
impression 
that we will also be seeking contact with such CIS countries, 
who would be our allies in the fight against imperialism. 
  So, what if a theoretical course is taken for joining up 
with 
NATO and the European Union. For the time being, it will amount 
to nothing more than taking a political stance. But even that is 
something. I fear, though, that CSCE is an organization that is 
completely hollow and harmful to us, in addition to being a 
waste of time and money. The Western states we get our 
orientation from do not take this artificial organization 
seriously. This, too, affords an opportunity to demonstrate our 
attitude. 
  There are problems with the UN. The latter is influenced 
largely by Russia and its satellites. We should have a strong 
delegation in New York who could stand up, at least to some 
degree, to the experienced diplomacy of Russia. It would be a 
shame if the presently known plans for restructuring our UN 
delegation were to be carried out. 
  I fully agree with the expert opinion of HOMMIKULEHT, 
maintaining that foreign policy be left to the professionals. 
And therein lies the problem. It will take some time to turn 
amateurs into professionals who are capable of analysis and 
interaction. Right now, it's more like the twin games of the 
north: there are those who jump well, and others who ski 
splendidly. Winners would be those who can not only jump far, 
but also ski fast.

 the 
Ministry of Agriculture: "Estonia's Wheat Makes Good Flour for 
White Bread"] 
<H8>  We'll Be Planting More Summer Wheat in the Spring </H8>
  [Text] 
  Estonia needs anywhere from 85,000 to 90,000 tonnes of 
eating wheat a year. That, provided that the million-and-a-half 
people living here consume 67,000 to 70,000 tonnes of white 
bread (123 grams per person per day), 5,000 to 6,000 tonnes of 
macaroni and 1,500 to 2,000 tonnes of farina. 
  We consume 235 to 250 tonnes of wheat a day. The stocks are 
being depleted daily and need to be replenished. Right now, it 
is not really important how big the state's total wheat reserve 
is (we know the amount in the State's Silo). What is important, 
however, is that all of Estonia's bakers, confectioners and 
others involved in baking buy their flour from our millers, and 
that these millers, in turn, buy the good wheat grown by our 
farmers. Unless, of course, the millers and bakers prefer to buy 
foreign flour? The determining factors here, of course, are the 
quality and the price of grain and flour. 
<H5>  Quality of Grain </H5>
  Can Estonia's grain growers produce the kind of wheat that 
makes for good white bread? I think that most of them can! 
  Over the past few years, scientific and experimental 
facilities have studied the combatibility of our own and foreign 
breeds of wheat, especially those from the Nordic countries, 
with Estonia's climactic and soil conditions. Seeds for 
preferred breeds of wheat have been bought and also received as 
aid. Instruction has been made available to those who have 
requested it. 
  The growing of wheat has also made progress. In 1993, the 
yield per hectare was roughly 2.5 times bigger than it was in 
1989, while the total yield, over the same period, is down by 
one third. Last year's results showed that, even in poor weather 
conditions, the grain growers managed to turn out a good crop of 
wheat. 
  According to the center for testing the quality of grain, 
the 
wet gluten content was 23 percent or more (that meets the 
requirements of high quality wheat) for 40 percent of winter 
wheat and for 85 percent of summer wheat. A shedding rate of 180 
or more was noted for 70 percent of summer wheat and 80 percent 
of winter wheat lots. The requirements of high quality eating 
wheat were met by roughly 60 percent of the summer wheat and 30 
percent of the winter wheat yield or, by volume, somewhere 
between 36,000 and 40,000 tonnes (not including seeds). And 
that, I repeat, in a year unfavorable to wheat! 
  The highest gluten content was noted for a breed called 
Heta--29 percent (32 percent for 1991, and 37 percent for 1992). 
Wheat with a wet gluten content of 28 percent or more is 
considered to be extra-high quality. The planting area of Heta 
made up two fifth of the total planting area for summer wheat. 
  Figures are free of emotion and indicate our actual 
potential. With the right selection of breed and proper 
technological methods, we can even grow wheat for making 
macaroni. 
<H5>  The Price of Grain </H5>
  It is hard to predict where the world prices for quality 
wheat will be by fall. According to the first issue of 
AGRARWIRTSCHAFT for 1993, volume prices of soft wheat were $143 
a tonne at the ports of Western Europe between September and 
November of 1992. Depending on grain quality, lot size and 
seller, the prices varied up to two times. Including the cost of 
transportation (at $13 a tonne) the average price of imported 
soft wheat at the port of Tallinn is at about $155 or 2,128 
kroons a tonne. 
  What will be the cost of wheat to the producer this year? 
Most likely between 1,300 and 1,400 kroons a tonne (expert 
estimate). No doubt there are big differences between producers. 
If we purchase all the weed- and pest-control materials, 
fertilizers, fuel and lubricants, which will make up close to 40 
percent of the production prices, then we would have to spend 
between 45 and 50 million kroons. To import all of the wheat at 
average prices, however, would call for spending somewhere 
between 180 and 190 million kroons. 
<H5>  Should We Be Importing Production Resources or Grain? </H5>
  Undoubtedly, there are importers who bring in wheat below 
the 
average price. But that does not necessarily mean that white 
bread made out of this is any cheaper, nor do we know much about 
the quality of the wheat being imported. I, as a tax-payer and 
an ordinary consumer of white bread have yet to notice any 
stabilization of prices, only escalation. I dare say that the 
wheat brought in by way of aid in 1992 was of lower quality and 
with a lower gluten content. 
<H5>  In Summary </H5>
  As long as neighboring countries and super-states have laws 
or other legal measures regulating the grain market, Estonia's 
grain market would also have to be protected by similar 
legislation. 
  In 1992, the total of wheat planted was 2.7 times that of 
the 
1989 total. The amount of summer wheat planted last spring was 
the same as it was a year ago, while the winter wheat planted in 
the fall was less than half of that. That indicates that our 
grain market was not functioning effectively, and that our grain 
trade is poorly organized. 
  In countries with a normal market economy, long-term 
contracts are in place between the growers of grain, millers and 
bakers. This creates a feeling of security for all concerned, 
even for tomorrow. It is time for us, too, to start negotiating 
agreements and be done with that by the time spring planting 
starts. 
  In one year, we have consumed the amount of wheat it took us 
two years to grow. The planting area of winter wheat has 
diminished and, whatever was left, suffered damages during the 
winter. Wheat reserves are not infinite. How about planting more 
summer wheat in the spring! We should have enough seed for 
24,000 to 25,000 hectares. 
  Growing wheat would help secure a higher level of employment 
in the rural areas--by providing employment for at least 470 
families. 
  Growing our own wheat is also more favorable to the consumer 
price-wise--by being cheaper by one third. Growing wheat will 
also help stabilize the foreign trade balance, by adding 130 to 
140 kroons to the plus-side.

<F P=106> [Report summary from Economic Desk: "Cost of Living Up 5.2 </F>
Percent in February"] 
  [Text] 
  According to the Bureau of Statistics, February's 
consumer price index was up 5.2 percent, compared to January. 
Food items went up by 6.8 percent, and manufactured goods only 
by 0.9 percent. February's increase in the price of services 
amounted to 6.3 percent. 
  The only drop was noted in the price of eggs, down by 16.1 
percent. Going up, at the same time, were prices of fish and 
fish products, by 21.3 precent; milk by 20.5 percent; fruits and 
vegetables by 15 percent; and alcoholic beverages and tobacco by 
10.3 percent, due to the increased excise tax on alcohol. 
Relatively steep increases, compared to other categories of 
merchandise, were also noted for cooking fats (9.7 percent) and 
soft drinks (6.9 percent). 
  Also up, in February, were shelter prices by 5.1 percent, 
and 
transport and communications services by 5 percent. Expenditures 
for health care were up 1.4 percent, and expenditures for 
housekeeping up 2.4 percent from January. 
  During the year, the prices of consumer items and services 
went up 43.1 percent on the average. The biggest increases were 
noted in the prices of fish products and eggs (88.7 and 83.3 
percent respectively). Significant increases were also noted for 
such vital items in the shopping basket as meat (relative share 
10.3 percent and price increase 68.3 percent), shelter (19.7 and 
68 percent respectively), and transport and communications 
(relative share 13 percent, annual price inrease 48.3 percent). 
The relative share of soft drinks in the shopping basket is only 
0.5 percent, but their price went up 72.8 percent.

  The increase in the cost of living has been even greater 
lately as, in January of this year, it amounted to 5.5 percent 
(see tabulation). As one can recall, this year's inflation had 
been projected as high as 20 percent earlier, and at least 30 
percent by some of the more recent estimates. Even that later 
figure is subject to correction pretty soon, due to the price 
increase boom of March 1.

<F P=106> [Article by Tiiu Metsa: "Direct Investments In Estonia Kept </F>
Growing In 1993"] 
  [Text] 
  During the year of 1993, investments of foreign 
companies that were made in their joint ventures in Estonia 
amounted to 2,232.4 million kroons, while direct investments of 
Estonian companies made abroad amounted to 103.6 million 
kroons. 
  Estonia's investments abroad may be small, compared to the 
influx of capital coming our way, but what matters, in the 
opinion of Tiiu Metsa, head specialist at the Bank of Estonia, 
is that these were made basically during the second half of the 
year. 
  Fifty-five percent of direct investments in Estonia came 
from 
increases in venture capital, 29 percent from increases in loan 
capital, and 16 percent from reinvested proceeds. 
  Viewed by the total volume of direct investments 
made in Estonia, Finland placed first with 32.3 percent, 
followed by Sweden (29 percent), The Netherlands (5.9 percent), 
Switzerland (4.4 percent), Italy (3 percent), Russia (2.6 
percent), and Germany (2.4 percent). 
  Investments of venture capital, so vital to 
Estonia, kept growing during 1993, amounting to 1,233 million 
kroons. Foreign investors poured 764 million kroons into new 
ventures started in 1993. The capital resources of joint 
ventures already operational were increased by 388.6 million 
kroons. Proceeds from the privatization of state enterprises to 
non-residents yielded 80.4 million kroons, while 63.3 million or 
close to 80 percent of that amount came to Estonia during the 
fourth quarter. 
<H5>  Who Are the Partners? </H5>
  According to the Bureau of Statistics enterprise register, 
the greatest number of joint ventures were formed with Finnish 
companies (1,551), followed by Sweden (301), Russia (253), and 
Germany and the United States, with 126 companies each. But 
looking at the average volume of capital invested per 
enterprise, we see Hungary taking the lead (4.7 million kroons), 
followed by Italy (4 million), United States (1.5 million), The 
Bahamas (1.2 million), Turkey (1.1 million), Sweden (0.9 
million) and Switzerland (0.8 million). 
  By the average amount of venture capital invested in each, 
however, Finland ranks 34th, Russia 30th, and Germany 24th among 
the 56 countries that have started new business ventures in 
Estonia. Thus, most of the joint ventures formed with Finland, 
Russia and Germany were relatively small. 
  Currently, Swedish investors are making significant 
cooperation partners for Estonian companies. Even though Sweden 
holds second place after Finland for the number of new ventures, 
it is way ahead of Finland by the volume of capital invested in 
them. During 1993, Swedish companies invested 272.4 million 
kroons in new Estonian ventures (the corresponding indicator for 
Finland is 188 million kroons). 
  The flow of capital into joint ventures already operational 
is made up of 228.9 million kroons or 59 percent coming from 
Swedish companies; 108.9 million kroons (or 28 percent of the 
total) coming from Finland; and 35.5 milliom kroons (or 9 
percent of the total) coming from Switzerland. The rest of the 
countries contributed considerably less to the influx of 
capital, adding up to a combined total of around 4 percent. 
  For 1993, the difference for investors between disbursements 
and repayments of long term loans was 169.3 million 
kroons. Since obtaining long-term loans does not follow a steady 
pattern, the difference between their disbursements and 
repayments varied quite a bit for each quarter. Most of the 
long-term foreign loans came to Estonia during the second and 
the fourth quarters. The largest extenders of long-term loans 
were direct investors from Finland and Austria (143.3 million 
kroons and 101.4 million kroons respectively). 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Structure of Direct Investments for 1993                                     | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Type                     |Total (million kroons)   |Percentage               | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Venture Capital          |1,233.0                  |55                       | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Reinvested Proceeds      |364.6                    |16                       | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Long-Term Loan           |169.3                    |8                        | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Short-Term Loan          |465.5                    |21                       | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  The difference between disbursements and repayments of 
short term loans (including commercial credit) and 
reinvested proceeds grew considerably during 1993. 
Even though these growth items were somewhat smaller for the 
fourth quarter than they were for the third, one can conclude 
increased momentum and effectiveness in the cooperation of 
Estonian companies with their foreign partners. 
  The economic sector preferred by foreign investors 
last year was industry, where 45 percent of the direct 
investments were channeled. That was followed by wholesale and 
retail trade (26 percent), finance (8 percent), real estate, 
leasing and business services (7 percent).

<F P=106> [Article by Maria Romantschuk: "Finnish Mediation Discussed </F>
During Rybkin's Visit"] 
  [Excerpt] Ivan Rybkin, speaker of the Russian parliament's 
lower house, the Duma, thinks it would be good if Finland could 
mediate in the conflict between Russia and Estonia regarding the 
withdrawal of the Russian troops from Estonian territory. 
  The question of troop withdrawals and potential Finnish 
mediation was on the agenda during the speaker's visit to 
Finland, which was concluded yesterday. 
  "I think it would be quite good," said Speaker Rybkin and 
said that it could be useful to have a third party in the 
negotiations between Russia and Estonia. 
  This, at least, was the conclusion that could be drawn from 
the not too complete interpretation of Rybkin's message. 
  The negotiations between Russia and Estonia have not been 
completely suspended, but they also have not progressed. Russia 
has pledged to withdraw its troops from the Baltic states by the 
last day of August of this year. But no agreement with Estonia 
has been reached as yet. The fact that the troop withdrawal can 
be accomplished according to the established timetable is one of 
the conditions for Russia's acceptance by the European Council. 
  The Russians have not submitted any actual appeal for 
mediation help, but the question was discussed with both 
President Martti Ahtisaari, Prime Minister Esko Aho, and Foreign 
Minister Heikki Haavisto. 
  Rybkin did not want to enter into how the Finnish hosts 
reacted to the question. 
  Aho has previously taken a reserved position on a potential 
mediation task, while President Ahtisaari has said that if 
Finnish advice is needed the question must be treated seriously. 
  In any event, Ivan Rybkin is of the opinion that the sooner 
the Russian troops are gone from the Baltic the better. 
  "Best of all would be if not a single Russian soldier 
remained outside the borders of Russia."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Training of Estonian Policemen </F>
Useful for Finland as Well"] 
  [Text] The training of Estonian policemen in Finland has 
gotten under way. In early spring the Police Institute in Espoo 
already had a few Estonian policemen for a brief course. At the 
Police School in Tampere a crime investigation course, in which 
Estonian investigators participate for the first time, is under 
way right now. 
  The police department of Finland's Ministry of the Interior 
and the head of Estonia's police have agreed on intensified 
cooperation in training. This year about 30 Estonian policemen 
will take courses in Finland. 
  Chief Inspector Matti Launiainen of the Interior Ministry's 
police department says that the training of Estonian policemen 
also gets the Finnish policemen used to international relations. 
Finland also benefits from the Estonian policemen by acquiring 
current information about crime in the east. 
  The first experience from the training cooperation is good. 
The language represents the biggest problem, but it is not 
insurmountable. The training language is Finnish. 
  Criminal investigator Ain Balder from Tartu says that 
economic criminals in Estonia have a five-year lead over the 
police. This lead is what one is now trying to shorten with the 
training in Finland. 
  The strong moral self-esteem of the Finnish police appeals 
to 
the Estonian policemen, says Balder. In Estonia there are 
problems of suspicion about receiving bribes. This is ballast 
from the Soviet era that one should get rid of, he says. 
  Balder believes that personal contacts across the Bay of 
Finland will make criminal investigation in both countries more 
efficient. It is surely better to get help through direct 
contacts than via Interpol or other official international 
channels, he says.

<F P=106> [Article by Grant Gukasov: "For Whom are Russians Kith and </F>
Kin?"; first paragraph is introductory paragraph] 
  [Text] The Representative Assembly of the Russian-Speaking 
Population was instituted a year ago in Estonia as the only 
organization for non-citizens which has been officially 
registered and is permanently functioning as a party to the 
round table under the auspices of the President of the Estonian 
Republic. Its leader, Nikolai Yurantsev, was interviewed by MN 
correspondent in Baltic countries. 
  MN: Who are the Russians in Estonia? Are they splinters 
of the empire? Or is it already a new community with its own 
world views and interests? 
  N.Yu.: The Russians diaspora in Estonia consists 
of many layers: it includes the old indigenous Russians from the 
time of the Russian Empire, and the most numerous postwar 
emigration wave, and two subsequent ones --dating back to the 
mid-1960s and the early 1980s. No one doubts any longer that all 
of us, the permanent inhabitants of Estonia -- Byelorussians, 
Ukrainians, Russians, Koreans and Armenians are Russian-speaking 
people --and we have been trying to unite on the principles of 
an association of fellow-countrymen, language and 
non-citizenship. The latter has been engendered by the political 
partialities of national-radicals, become embodied in a number 
of ER laws on the state language and on foreigners, and turned 
into a veritable calamity for a third of Estonia's population. 
We are already the Baltic Russians. Our association is more 
necessary for the indigenous inhabitants who must understand 
that living next to them are "their own Russians." 
  MN: Today the image of a Russian looks like that of a 
rabid foe from the East whose only occupation was to oppress, 
enslave and occupy... 
  N.Yu.: Forgetting that the West has perpetrated 
more troubles here than the East. But the position of many 
present-day Estonian politicians is this: all evil comes from 
the East. Even the period of the war from 1941 to 1944 is being 
repatterned to fit a simple and very clear theory of the main 
enemy being nearby. 
  Life itself has repeatedly given the lie to this obstinately 
imposed stereotype. From the very beginning of perestroika, the 
"native" Russians have repeatedly demonstrated their loyalty to 
the independent Estonian state. For instance, last year there 
was a referendum in Narva and the question was formulated as 
follows: "Are you for national-territorial autonomy as part of 
the Estonian Republic?" The majority said "yes," but the result 
was an attack on the part of governmental structures and the 
non-recognition of the referendum's results. The situation was 
fraught with power confrontation. But the "reds", as the 
government called the Narva leadership, recognized the verdict 
of the State Court on this referendum as being valid and final, 
that is, their reaction to the "attack" was obedience to the 
law. A similar referendum took place in Transdniestria, 
whereupon a war broke out there. The result: Transdniestria 
remained Transdniestria, and Moldova remained Moldova. Here, 
however, the Leningrad highway was not blocked with 
ferroconcrete slabs, as both sides displayed sense. 
  MN: Citizenship is the key problem today. The wisest 
decision on this question has been taken by Lithuania. And not 
because there are few Russians there or because they are 
especially loved... 
  N.Yu.: Evidently because the politicians there 
understand what a state is. And they do not put up countless 
fences which they themselves will have to climb over, turning 
their problems inside out before Europe. Europe's orientation is 
clear and accurate: the peoples of the Baltics must 
independently decide the problems of relationships with Russia. 
In the wake of Lithuania, Latvia has defined its attitude on the 
question of citizenship. And has found a common language with 
Russia. 
  The 1988 Law on Citizenship in Estonia could have solved the 
entire problem had it been carried into effect from the first 
paragraph to the last. But it was tailoured with a simple 
resolution on putting the law into effect, deleting the 
paragraphs which did not suit the national-radicals. But to 
Europe the law was shown as a whole. And Europe was delighted -- 
they had no such liberal laws. In accordance with this law, 
permanent inhabitants, i.e., inhabitants with the permanent 
Estonian domicile registration, who have lived here for more 
than ten yeas, actually receive their citizenship in the zero 
variant. The ruse of the national-radicals was that the 
resolution introduced the countdown not from the actual time of 
residence, but since 1990. A temporary residence permit is now 
granted for a term of up to five years, and only coupled with a 
passport does this document give one a right to stay in the 
country. The term of the general civilian passport's validity 
expires in July 1995. And one fine day you will get your 
residence permit in the shape of an insert into the passport 
with the loss of the latter's validity. And then you will be 
able to live in Estonia on legal grounds for a mere 24 hours. 
  "There is need to fight for this residence permit" -- such 
is 
the meaning of the statement issued jointly by the 
Representative Assembly and the Russian Community of Estonia. 
Everyone must decide the problem radically for himself. If he 
stays to live here, it means that he can follow two roads. The 
most correct thing, we believe, is the acquisition of the 
Estonian citizenship. 
  MN: How does Russia assist the Russians' integration in 
an independent Estonia state? 
  N.Yu.: Let me answer bluntly to a blunt question: 
in no way. Needless to say, any word uttered by Russia in 
defence of the Russian diaspora carries weight. But today this 
is no longer enough. Russia's policy towards Russians must be 
normal protectionism which is widespread all over the world. 
But, it seems, Russian protectionism extends solely to the 
retired military servicemen, and this is a partial problem. 
There are hundreds of thousands of people who worked at the 
Union enterprises. Russia only singles out but a handful of 
retired servicemen from among hundreds of thousands. This tends 
to trigger these Russians' surprise and dislike for both retired 
servicemen and for Russian politicians. Russia has never 
formulated its policy in relation to Russians in the near abroad. 
  There are some fragmentary general declarations, but there 
is 
no tangible political line which is clear to everyone. In the 
past few years we have witnessed many sanctions: economic and 
political, as well as the President's formidable statements. And 
all this, as a rule, boomeranged at the Russian-speaking 
population and failed to reach its objective. Of the same nature 
is the decision on raising custom tariffs beginning with March 
15 of this year -- this again hits at the Russian-speaking 
population. 
  During the past year we have had more understanding with the 
West than with Russia, which can only be regretted. When a 
crisis broke out in connection with the Law on Foreigners, five 
ambassadors, accredited in Estonia from European Community 
countries, undertook a political demarche as a result of which 
this law was sent to the Council of Europe for an examination by 
experts. Those were the ambassadors of Italy, France, Germany, 
Denmark and Sweden. The Russian ambassador was not among them. 
  MN: Are you under the impression that Russia has been 
sliding more and more towards power solutions already inside the 
CIS? 
  N.Yu.: As I see it, democracy the Russian way must 
be a rigid system ensuring the controllability of the whole 
country, but this does not mean that its feet in high boots must 
stick out in neighbouring countries. 
  The latest elections to the local self-management bodies in 
Russia have demonstrated a system of anarchy. When, however, the 
government of Estonia granted non-citizens the possibility to 
elect to self-management bodies, the majority came to the 
polling stations. At Tallinn's City Assembly there are 32 
Russians among the 64 deputies. But electors first had to 
register, then go to the polls. They came on both occasions in 
contrast to people in Russia. The government made a little step 
to meet them half-way, and it received a splash of loyalty.

<F P=106> [Article by Peteris Lakis: "Commentary"] </F>
  [Text] As shown by the results of our public poll on the 
municipal elections, citizens should show ample participation in 
these elections. As could be expected in an early preelection 
phase, over one-third of the respondents have not made up their 
minds with respect to their voting ballot preferences at this 
time. It should be noted that only general sympathies have been 
polled, and every political power will have representatives in 
each electoral district. It is obvious that the personalities 
appearing on the ballots will play a major role. 
  The results of the study also confirm a degree of inertia 
with respect to public opinion -- to a large extent, the 
positions held by the various political powers are similar to 
those in the Saeima election. It is true that the situation 
could be fundamentally changed by the creation of new political 
unions, and in particular -- on the basis of coalition 
formation, and, of course, by increased campaign activities. In 
any case, the results of this poll should only be considered as 
a first survey of public opinion, and the prediction of the 
possible election outcome on the basis of these is overly risky. 
A truer indication of this or some other outcome with respect to 
how the voters will express their sympathies can only come after 
the lists of candidates are published.

<F P=106> [Article by I. Randers: "The Impact of Unemployment on </F>
Internal Politics and Crime"] 
  [Text] State Labor Minister A. Berzins submitted a report 
to Prime Minister V. Birkavs on the impact of unemployment 
on the stability of internal politics in the state and the 
necessity of initiatives to reduce unemployment. 
  The report states that in many areas of Latvia, especially 
in 
the Latgale rayons, the unemployment rate is two to three times 
higher than the national average, and that such areas are 
becoming increasingly more numerous. The problem primarily 
affects the small cities and rural districts of Latvia, which 
contain a large majority of Latvians (according to the 1989 
census data -- 74%). These are areas where enterprises 
based in 
major industrial centers had established branches at one time, 
but have now ceased their activities, for the most part. 
  Under these conditions, the situation cannot be improved 
through unemployment compensation nor by extending the period 
for receipt of such (the Cabinet of Ministers has compiled a 
list of such cities and rural districts in the rayons of 
Aluksne, Balvi, Dobele, Jekabpils, Kraslava, Madona, Preili, and 
Rezekne, where unemployed workers have the right to extend their 
unemployment compensation for up to 12 months -- I.R.). 
  The increase in the number of those unemployed has created 
economic problems (nonpayment of rent and communal services, an 
increase in the number of those requesting and receiving social 
assistance, etc.), promotes a polarization of the political 
views of the inhabitants and, overall, promotes crime in the 
state. 
  In Western nations, there is an assumption that each 
percentage increase in unemployment, on the average, increases 
the rates of crime by 4% and suicide by 5.6%. 
While not 
attributing this assumption to Latvia, in its entirety, the 
State Labor Minister mentions these facts: the start of 
unemployment was recorded at the end of 1991, and the crime rate 
per 1,000 inhabitants rose from 129 in 1990 to 235 in 1992 (an 
increase of 82%). The suicide rate (759 cases in 1991) in 
1993 
has increased to 1,088 cases (43%). 
  In order to stabilize the internal political, economic and 
crime situation in rural Latvia and its small cities, the 
following is proposed: first, create a state commission which 
would develop a special program for rayons with a high rate of 
unemployment, in order to promote commercial activities, secure 
existing enterprises or reorganize former branches, and also 
attract the interest of businessmen to start, continue or expand 
their businesses; second, in the Privatization Agency, create a 
division which would examine enterprise privatization projects 
from the standpoint of saving jobs, and only after this has been 
accomplished, propose a selling off price for these projects.

<F P=106> [Interview with Janis Adamsons by Ieva Stale: "Border Guards </F>
Have New Commander"] 
  [Text] On Thursday, Defense Minister V. Pavlovskis signed 
an order appointing Command Captain Janis Adamsons, the present 
Deputy Commander of the Naval Forces to the position of Border 
Guards Brigade Commander. Thus, control of the land borders will 
be overseen by a Navy man. In this connection, "Labrit" is 
offering a brief short-order interview with the new Border 
Guards Brigade Commander. 
  [Stale] Did you agree to this position willingly? 
  [Adamsons] I am an officer, and in the Army it is assumed 
that the orders of a higher ranking officer are to be followed, 
regardless of whether they concern changing over to another post 
or retirement. I was satisfied with my present post and also 
with the work I had contributed in forming the Naval Forces. The 
actual offer to become the Border Guards Brigade Commander was 
unexpected, although I am a professional coast guard. 
  [Stale] How did you become a coast guard by profession? 
  [Adamsons] I studied at the Russian Naval War School. For 13 
years, I served in the Far East in various leadership positions 
as a coast guard. I was last stationed in Russia at the Coast 
Guard Training Center in Nahodka, where I served as deputy head 
of the training center. 
  [Stale] In your opinion, what is the weakest point in the 
present overland border protection plan? 
  [Adamsons] I will be able to answer this question one month 
from now, after I have familiarized myself with all overland 
border problems. I guarantee that the information will be 
available to the press. 
  [Stale] What are the main activity objectives of the new 
Border Guards Brigade Commander? 
  [Adamsons] To strengthen overland border control, protection 
and defense, involving the participation of those people who are 
serving in the Border Guard at present. The main objective is to 
organize regular cooperation among the state institutions 
involved with border control -- the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs, National Guard, Customs. Until now, while serving in 
the Naval Forces, there was good cooperation among these 
institutions. I hope the situation continues.

<F P=106> ["Declaration of the Russian Union of Local </F>
Self-Government": "Russia, Our Home"] 
  [Text] The adoption of legislative acts on local 
self-government, initially in the USSR and then in the Russian 
Federation, set the foundation to the process of forming the 
legislative base in the sphere of self-government and provided 
the impulse for development of the system of self-government in 
Russia. In addition to securing certain guarantees with respect 
to the rights of self-government, the laws adopted provided an 
opportunity for a number of Federation entities to adopt 
legislative and normative resolutions determining proper 
jurisdiction of organs of local self-government and deciding 
issues in the formulation of local budgets, land use, and the 
composition and management of municipal property. 
  The natural process of formation and development of the 
system of local self-government was cut short by the events of 
September-October 1993, as a consequence of which the 
representational organs of local power were dissolved. Among the 
first edicts signed following these events, however, were the 
edicts of the Russian Federation president regarding guarantees 
of the rights of local self-government. As these edicts emerged, 
we were able to trace a certain evolution in the views of 
presidential structures on the system of self-government. In 
particular, the change in status of the head of local 
administration may be considered a positive factor. Whereas in 
the initial variant the head of a local administration was 
recognized as the head of local self-government, later edicts 
reflect the elected head of local self-government as becoming 
the head of local administration. Unfortunately, some of the 
issues in these edicts were resolved not in favor of the 
development of self-government. Thus, the budgetary rights of 
population centers were significantly encroached upon, the 
quantitative composition of representational organs was 
determined by presidential volition, not the will of the voters, 
and the scope of authority of these organs was restricted, 
thereby restricting the ability of citizens to adopt one form or 
another of self-government in their territory. 
  The Russian Federation Constitution adopted 12 December 1993 
devotes a separate chapter to questions of self-government, in 
which its presence is acknowledged quite definitively and 
guarantees are presented with respect to its rights and the 
separation of organs of local self-government from organs of 
state authority. But despite the thorough preparation that went 
into this fundamental document, certain wordings make it 
possible, on its basis, both to create a developed system of 
self-government and to in fact eliminate this entirely. 
  Based on the historical experience of foreign countries and 
Russia as reflected in the European Charter of Local 
Self-Government and the Declaration on Local Self-Government in 
the Russian Federation adopted by the Union of Russian Cities 
and supported by the Russian Union of Local Self-Government, we 
consider the following as necessary features of the presence of 
self-government: 
  --acknowledgement of the population center and its 
surrounding territory as the primary entity of local territorial 
self-government; 
  --presence of a general infrastructure securing the vital 
activity of the populace; 
  --opportunity for the populace to effect realization of 
direct and representational democracy (specifically--elections 
of the organs of self-government); 
  --possession by the organs of local self-government of their 
own jurisdiction, including fundamental jurisdiction in the 
sphere of municipal property, local taxes and budgets, and use 
of land in their territory. 
  In accordance with the edict of the Russian Federation 
president, elections of organs of local self-government should 
take place prior to June 1994. In this regard, Federation 
entities are afforded the right, taking historical, ethnic, and 
other traditions and particularities into account, to adopt the 
Statute on Self-Government and Statute on Elections to Organs of 
Local Self-Government in their territories. Even a cursory 
analysis of the above-mentioned statutes in a number of Russian 
oblasts leads to the depressing conclusion that self-government 
has been curtailed, and rigid, centralized rule has been 
reestablished. Models of pseudo-self-government are being 
proposed for implementation that are not only far distant from 
the views of self-government recognized throughout the world, 
but are even remote from the progressive provisions contained in 
the president's edict. Here a departure from the Constitution 
justified on the principle of "revolutionary expediency" is not 
recognized as any serious violation. 
  In order to return to the civilized path of development of 
local territorial self-government, we consider it necessary as a 
measure of first order to review a number of existing 
legislative acts and adopt new ones, in particular--the Russian 
Federation Laws "On Principles of Local Self-Government," "On 
Principles of Administrative-Territorial Structuring," and "On 
the Budgetary Rights of Local Self-Government," and we appeal to 
the deputies of the Federal Assembly of Russia with proposals: 
  --to legally secure the basic principles of local 
self-government in Federal Law as soon as possible; 
  --to review presidential edicts on matters of local 
self-government over the period September 1993 through the 
present, verifying their conformance with the Russian Federation 
Constitution and repealing provisions that contradict it; 
  --to conduct parliamentary hearings dedicated to the course 
of reform of local self-government in Federation entities, 
engaging the participation of all-Russian and regional social 
and political organizations, representatives of the organs of 
self-government, and all other interested parties. 
  We appeal to the residents of cities, settlements, and rural 
villages. 
  We appeal to the CITIZENS of Russia! 
  Self-government is the business of citizens themselves--it 
is 
a job for you and us. 
  It is necessary that we stand up for our right to establish 
the power of authority in the localities. There is only one 
solution--to attain the REALIZATION of what appears in words in 
existing legislation: the principle of ELECTING and REPLACING 
AUTHORITY on a systematic basis. In the cities, settlements, and 
villages, everywhere our lives are in process, everywhere that 
is our HOME. 
  And if we can influence living conditions in our own home, 
in 
our own city, then all of Russia will become our home. 
  The interests of Russia are first and foremost the interests 
of the people of Russia. 
  We are up to the task, if we just get to work!

<F P=106> [Article by ROSSIYSKAYA FEDERATSIYA correspondent Tamara </F>
Aleksandrova: "Will the Provinces Revive Russia?--Comments Upon 
Introduction of the RSMS"] 
  [Text] There is no end to the number of new parties and 
movements, their press conferences and introductions. And so, at 
a meeting of leaders of the Russian Union of Local 
Self-Government (RSMS), everything went according to the 
standard arrangement with journalists--questions and responses 
on the aims of the new sociopolitical movement, on near-term 
objectives. It would seem to be too early to judge what kind of 
force has appeared in our society--better to wait and see. All 
the same, however, this first meeting with RSMS left the 
impression that the organization might be able to appreciably 
influence our lives, becoming a significant counterweight to the 
super-centralization of government. While trusting the plain 
truth of our first impression, it does no harm to delve into 
where it comes from. 
  RSMS is not the fruit of a dozen capital 
politicians who drafted a program and approached people 
with populist slogans. The emergence of this union is the 
logical development of a self- organization of cities. Already 
15 diverse city organizations-- unions and associations--are 
involved, from which many of the leaders of the new movement 
come. Convinced of the productivity of jointly resolving various 
economic and management problems, they became convinced of 
something else as well--that the rights and interests of city 
and village residents must be protected by political methods, in 
developing and consolidating local self- government. 
  Appearing in a natural way, the movement immediately 
acquired a solid foundation. Its constituent assembly was 
held in June of last year, and its first (constituent) 
congress--in October. Presently there are 80 branches of the 
RSMS in 48 Federation entities. They unite people who hold dear 
realization of the concepts of decentralization of authority, 
and the dominance of law over arbitrary rule by the state 
apparatus. 
  The main objective of the RSMS--implementation of the rights 
of citizens to participate in management of the life of society 
and the state on all levels, from block, street, and city, to 
Federation-- determines its specific tasks: protection of the 
rights and interests of local self-government entities, 
participation in the lawmaking process, the nomination and 
provision of support to candidates in elections of the organs of 
local and state authority... 
  Who are the leaders of the RSMS counting on seeing among 
their supporters, as their allies? They are relying on employees 
of the organs of local and state authority who have become 
convinced, on the basis of personal experience, of the need to 
develop self- government; active citizens from block and 
community committees, and veterans' unions, who have always 
protected the interests of territorial associations and diverse 
groups; employees in the municipal sphere--public health, 
education, culture; and representatives of small and mid-size 
business whose interests are directly related to a specific 
territory. 
  The RSMS is prepared to engage in extremely close 
cooperation 
with unions and all regional associations of cities, with the 
Zemstvo Union... 
  I believe this alone is sufficient to overcome any doubt 
that 
this movement is a significant one, with a grand future. And 
Karamzin's concept to the effect that Russia is strong by virtue 
of its provinces occurred not just to me that evening, 
apparently. After all, the leaders of RSMS are primarily 
representatives of the provinces (if, of course, you consider 
that the provinces begin just beyond the Moscow Ring Road). 
  Viktor Ivanovich Dorkin, chairman of the RSMS 
Central Council, is mayor of the city of Dzerzhinskiy, outside 
Moscow, a city under rayon jurisdiction. Along with city 
residents, he has come to feel the entirety of the injustice 
incorporated in this status. And being a Russian people's 
deputy, he sees another "disconnect" between the life of the 
localities and the lawmaking process. 
  "In the former Supreme Soviet only a third of the deputies 
voted with a knowledge of the business of problems of 
self-rule..." 
  Svetlana Nikolayevna Yurkova, deputy chairman, is 
also the mayor of a city well known to all--Shlisselburg. But 
whereas for us this city represents history primarily, for her 
it is a burden of troubles and cares about what is most 
essential. 
  "In a small territory, every citizen feels the ill effects 
of 
legislation on local self-government," she believes. "The city 
is deprived, its residents are deprived, and the local authority 
is too feeble to help. Today it is important for people and 
groups of people to learn to defend and stand up for their 
interests. Then we will be able to talk about the development of 
a civic society, then the most diverse forms of self-government 
will emerge on their own and develop. In our city, for example, 
the committee for community self-government emerged in the 
territory of a former departmental kindergarten which was 
intended for sale to private owners. The parents rose up and 
defended their interests and the interests of their children..." 
  Vasiliy Fedorovich Andreyev, member of the Central 
Council, historian from Novgorod, chairs the Russian History 
Department at a university. 
  "Is it possible to revive the zemstvo?"--he repeated the 
question in a resounding manner. No, probably not. But we must 
study the zemstvo. We must find guidance as much in our rich, 
productive experience as we do in our sad, national experience. 
The history of the zemstvo movement reminds us of the short 
history of contemporary self-government--pressure, a cry from 
above..." 
  Naturally a question was also asked about the numerical 
strength of the new movement. 
  Membership in the movement is not stipulated, RSMS leaders 
explained, and no one is fighting to get membership in the 
multi- millions. The important thing is rather that RSMS slogans 
permeate the minds of as many people as possible, and that they 
vote for them--for democracy based on local self-government. 
There simply cannot be any other kind of democracy. RSMS leaders 
consider this introduction of the organization as the beginning 
of their preparation for the elections to the State Duma, Second 
Convocation.

historical sciences, senior research associate at the Institute 
for the United States and Canada of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences: "The Future of NATO: Interests of the United States 
and Interests of Russia"] 
  [Text] With the end of the Cold War, the destiny of NATO 
has increasingly been a worry on the minds of American 
strategists. This military-political alliance, established at 
the end of the 1940's to provide for the collective defense of 
Western Europe under U.S. leadership from a possible "invasion 
of communism from the East," has presently fulfilled its main 
historical mission. It would seem logical, with the dissolution 
of the Warsaw Pact, disintegration of the USSR, and 
disappearance of the threat of invasion, that we might expect 
the disbandment of NATO as well. Adherents of this point of view 
are to be found in the West, including in the United States. 
  However, the voices of those who are fighting for 
preservation of the bloc, its transformation, and even expansion 
and adaptation to the new realities of postcommunist Europe, are 
ringing out with far greater volume. What arguments and 
proposals are being advanced in this regard? To what extent do 
they conform to reality and to Russia's interests? What kind of 
policy can the Russian Federation have with respect to NATO? 
  This article makes an attempt to find answers to these 
questions. Serving as a starting point for the search is the 
work of American analysts R. Asmus, R. Kugler, and S. Larrabee 
from the well-known RAND research corporation--"Building a New 
NATO," recently published in the journal FOREIGN AFFAIRS. 
(Footnote 1) (FOREIGN AFFAIRS, September-October 1993, p. 28-40) 
The arguments of proponents of preservation of the bloc are 
propounded most clearly and concisely here. 
<H5>  Arguments `For' </H5>
  American analysts justify the need for maintaining the 
alliance proceeding from a unique understanding of the problems 
of European security in the postcommunist era. In their view, 
threats to security on the European continent are at present 
issuing chiefly from two "arcs of crisis," "zones of 
instability"--eastern and southern. The eastern arc encompasses 
the area between Germany and Russia, from Northern Europe to 
Turkey, the Caucasus, and Asia Minor. The southern arc--Northern 
Africa, the Mediterranean Sea region, Near East, and Southwest 
Asia. 
  The greatest danger is presented by the eastern arc, whose 
states have been oversaturated with arms following the collapse 
of the USSR. They are unstable, infected with "aggressive 
nationalism," and at the same time incapable of defending 
themselves. "Central and Eastern Europe are saturated with 
potential mini-Weimar Republics, each of which is capable of 
unleashing an avalanche of violence upon the others," the 
authors write. 
  In addition, there exist strong fears with respect to a 
rebirth of imperial Russia, which itself is manifesting signs of 
instability and a possible shift to the right. All this, in the 
opinion of the American analysts, demands that the structure of 
security in the region be preserved. 
  In what manner, according to the authors' concept, should 
the 
West react to the most dangerous challenges? They believe a 
"general strategy" must be developed for "the propagation of 
collective defense, democracy, and security along the arcs of 
crisis." 
  The obvious instrument for implementation of such a strategy 
is NATO. In the opinion of the authors, the Persian Gulf War and 
the crisis in Yugoslavia have shown that the European Community 
(EC) is incapable of handling such a task, insofar as consensus 
among the 12 EC member states is virtually unattainable. Even 
less suitable for such a role is the Conference for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), which consists of 53 members. 
"Only NATO, with its tested command structure, developed 
logistics network, and effective arsenal, is capable of dealing 
with challenges to the security of Europe following the 
conclusion of the Cold War," the authors believe. But if NATO is 
unable to accomplish its mission, its existence will then be all 
the more inappropriate. 
  In order to implement such a strategy, in the view of the 
American analysts, certain significant steps must be carried out. 
  First and foremost, NATO, as an organization based on a need 
for collective security against a specific threat, must be 
transformed into an alliance directed towards the propagation of 
democracy, stability, and regulation of crises in the broad 
strategic sense. 
  A second measure, directed towards realization of the 
"general strategy," must be the conclusion of a new 
"trans-Atlantic agreement" between the United States and Western 
Europe, i.e., intensification of the role of the European states 
within the framework of the alliance, in other words, the 
"Europe-ization" of NATO. To this end, the United States will 
have to abandon its ambiguous attitude towards European 
integration within the EC framework. It will have to support 
this more energetically and thus encourage a more active role 
for France, which does not recognize American hegemony in Europe 
and without whose consent it will be impossible to transform 
NATO. 
  In addition, to successfully transform the bloc the authors 
believe it is necessary to have a strong Germany, more 
interested than any other party in maintaining the stability of 
its eastern borders. The political leaders in Bonn should 
abandon their present passive role. Germany should be actively 
included in ground operations outside the borders of NATO's 
"zone of responsibility." 
  The American political experts believe that another 
important 
means of transforming NATO is expansion to the east, primarily 
by virtue of including within it states of the "Visegrad 
group"--Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and possibly 
Slovakia. These countries must be simultaneously included within 
the EC. Entry into NATO can be accomplished gradually, in 
stages, and non-simultaneously. 
  The authors understand that until now the West has related 
negatively to the possibility of NATO moving eastward out of 
fears of encroaching upon Russia's security interests. In their 
concept, however, the attitude of the Russian Federation towards 
possible expansion of the alliance by virtue of the former 
socialist countries would depend only on Russia itself. They 
write: "Expansion of the alliance to the east should be 
perceived more as a step taken by the West towards Russia than 
as a step taken against it. As a partner to the West, Russia 
could play a decisive role as a pillar of security and stability 
in Europe and Asia. Whether expansion of NATO to the east 
becomes a new offer of partnership or a step towards formation 
of an anti-Russia alliance depends almost exclusively on the 
outcome of internal transformations in Russia itself... But 
turning the future NATO into a hostage to the outcome of Russian 
transformations--is a way to eliminate the alliance." 
  The authors believe that development of a "constructive 
policy" with respect to Ukraine is an important step in 
"movement eastward." In their view, in light of the 
indeterminate nature of prospects for democracy in Russia and 
the geopolitical position of Ukraine as "an important strategic 
buffer between Europe and Russia," Ukraine is "the best 
guarantee against a Russian imperial rebirth, bearing in mind 
Eastern Europe and especially Poland." The West therefore "must 
strongly resist any attempt by Russia to again incorporate 
Ukraine" within any kind of confederation. The Europe-ization of 
Ukraine must also be encouraged--the development of close ties 
between Ukraine and Central Europe, Ukraine's entry into common 
European and regional structures. 
  These, in abbreviated form, are the main arguments and 
proposals of the American analysts regarding the need for 
possible transformation of the NATO bloc at this time. 
<H5>  Interests of the United States </H5>
  If we are to critically analyze the main provisions of the 
article written by RAND researchers, the first thing that 
strikes us is the farfetched nature of their assertions--as 
though the former socialist countries of Central and Eastern 
Europe represent just about the main threat to European security 
in the postcommunist era, constituting a kind of regional powder 
keg ready to explode at any moment. 
  It is entirely inappropriate to compare these countries with 
minor versions of Germany at the time of the Weimar Republic. 
There, as we know, a fragile democracy was unable to confront 
the rise of militant German chauvinism, and this led in the 
final analysis to the emergence of a fascist dictatorship 
inimical to the West. We also know that in addition to 
everything else, this German fascism was the reaction of Germans 
to the colossal national degradation they experienced as a 
result of their defeat in the First World War. 
  The fall of the communist dictatorships in the countries of 
Eastern Europe was accompanied by directly opposing 
processes--emancipation, the rectification of nations, the 
acquisition of their proper dignity, clearly pro-Western 
tendencies. If here and there there have been flare-ups of 
"aggressive nationalism," these have been mainly anti-Russian in 
orientation, which aspect is explained by decades of Soviet 
domination. Therefore, a view of these countries as potentially 
fascist mini-dictatorships simply fails to conform to reality. 
  Naturally there exists among the former socialist countries 
certain friction and contradictions, and there is the threat of 
their "Balkanization." But if we compare the degree of intensity 
of these contradictions with the levels of conflict and national 
irreconcilability in the former Yugoslavia, or in the Caucasus, 
where we see underway the bloodshed of interethnic wars, it is 
then clear even to the casual observer that this is on the whole 
a fairly prosperous and tranquil region. The peaceful division 
of Czechoslovakia without conflict into two sovereign states 
provides further confirmation of this. 
  Why do the American analysts need to artificially demonize 
the former European socialist countries to such an extent? It is 
not difficult to find the answer if we proceed primarily from 
the "national interests" of the United States in Europe. 
  NATO always was not only an organization for ensuring 
collective defense, but also a major instrument for 
domination--hegemony, if you will, of the United States in 
Europe. The preservation of NATO following conclusion of the 
Cold War is necessary primarily, according to the proponents of 
such a point of view, to avoid losing the role of leadership in 
European affairs. This explains to a significant degree the 
energetic search by the Americans for various new pretexts and 
justifications for prolonging the existence of the bloc. This 
search includes establishment of the North Atlantic Cooperation 
Council, a distinctive forum for discussion of security issues 
which the former socialist countries and states of the CIS have 
joined; adoption of resolutions on the possible conduct by NATO 
of peacemaking missions by mandate of the United Nations or 
CSCE; the striving of the leadership of the alliance to effect 
release from control by the United Nations, in particular with 
respect to the possible conduct of operations in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina. (Footnote 2) (See NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, 17 September 
1993; SEGODNYA, 23 September 1993) 
  It is in this vein that we find the proposal of R. Asmus, R. 
Kugler, and S. Larrabee on the movement of NATO eastward to join 
the "Visegrad Group." It appears that the deliberate 
demonization of these countries is just a means of concealing 
their true intentions--of maintaining the dominant role of the 
United States in Europe. It should be noted that these proposals 
are supported most energetically by Germany which, as has been 
noted, is interested more than others in the stability of this 
region, and by the leadership of the alliance, in particular its 
Secretary General M. Woerner, who has expressed support for the 
swift joining of Poland and the Czech Republic but called for a 
more cautious approach with respect to Hungary and Slovakia, 
which are categorized as "regions of potential disturbances on 
ethnic grounds." 
  Membership of these countries in NATO is advantageous to 
Washington at present, insofar as the geopolitical situation 
makes them interested to a significant degree in preserving the 
bloc and in maintaining the dominant role of the United States 
in it. Historically these states found themselves in the sphere 
of geopolitical confrontation between Germany and Russia. Today 
they fear not only a threat on the part of Russia, but on the 
part of the West as well--though to a lesser degree--in the form 
of a possible revival of Bonn's hegemonist aspirations. They 
view the United States and NATO as a counterweight and 
protection from the one as well as the other. It is from this 
consideration that the striving of these countries to join the 
alliance quickly proceeds. 
  American analysts do not hide the interest of the United 
States in the former socialist countries. They write: "Their 
inclusion in NATO would strengthen the Atlantic orientation of 
the alliance and would ensure more significant internal support 
for U.S. positions on key security issues." At the same time 
they strive to present this as an unessential, secondary factor. 
  With the end of the Cold War, the American Congress has 
appreciably reduced the military budget. The pull-out of 
American troops from Europe is proceeding fairly intensively and 
certain military bases and facilities are being closed. An 
appreciable reduction is being seen in the number of American 
officers in NATO command structures. Although they continue to 
reserve key positions for themselves, the armed forces of 
Germany are playing an increasingly significant role in the 
joint forces of the alliance. 
  The process of integration of Western Europe within the EC 
framework is proceeding in parallel fashion. Following 
conclusion of the Maastricht accords and their approval by EC 
member states, a definitive course has been charted towards 
gradual transformation of the community into an economic and 
political alliance, and in the longer-term perspective--into a 
federation, i.e., a unified state. The military function has 
been entrusted to the West European Union, which should become a 
unique kind of ministry of defense of the European Community. 
(Footnote 3) (See USA--EPI, 1993, No. 2) 
  France and Germany constitute the motive power for West 
European integration. In addition to everything else, they have 
set about creating a joint French-German army corps with 
strength of up to 35,000, which should become the nucleus of a 
future European army. The Euro-corps is subordinate to the West 
European Union but, as observers note, it could be transferred 
under certain circumstances to NATO command as well. On the 
whole, the West European Union is also considered to be the 
"European support" of NATO, but the relationship between the two 
organizations is far from finally resolved. 
  While supporting West European integration in words, the 
United States is in actuality rather uncomfortable at the 
prospect, viewing this, and not without justification, as the 
emergence of a new competitor in the world arena. But the EC 
leadership is unambiguous in placing in doubt the advisability 
of NATO's continued existence and the current role of the United 
States in Europe. (Footnote 4) (Speaking in Brussels in 
September 1993, J. Delors, chairman of the Commission of 
European Communities, stated that NATO entails tremendous, 
unproductive expenses, that Europeans do not understand the 
meaning or necessity of the presence in peacetime of hundreds of 
thousands of American soldiers and dozens of military bases in 
Europe. He believes that even if NATO is preserved, Europeans 
must still create their own reliable defense, that it is 
intolerable for the United States to endlessly continue carrying 
out its mission in Europe--See NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, 17 September 
1993.) 
  By virtue of this, the proposal of the authors of the 
article 
in FOREIGN AFFAIRS to actively support West European integration 
can hardly be expected to find a response in the Clinton 
administration. After all, the stronger the European Community 
and West European Union are, the less the need on the part of 
West Europeans for security guarantees from the United States 
and NATO will be and the more inappropriate their presence in 
Europe. 
  It is interesting that in calling for the Europe-ization of 
NATO, the authors in fact pay no attention to the main issue: To 
what extent is the United States prepared to allow a stronger 
role to be played by Europeans within the alliance, the Germans 
and French primarily? 
  The answer, though veiled, can be found in the following 
passage: "Europe-ization of the alliance is just as much in the 
interests of the United States as it is in the interests of the 
Europeans. The United States may lose the ability to play 
a leading or significant role (emphasis mine--S.S.) 
in guaranteeing European security, unless it becomes part of a 
more equal partnership." In other words, the proposals on 
developing a new "general strategy" of the West, a new 
"trans-Atlantic agreement" between the United States and Western 
Europe serve in actuality only to conceal the following 
objective: in leaving Europe, to remain in it--and not just 
remain, but play "a leading or significant role." 
  It is proposed that Europeans, Germany and France primarily, 
actively involve their armed forces in peacemaking and other 
missions of NATO outside the bounds of its "zone of 
responsibility" (in this regard, the strength of American forces 
in Europe is diminishing significantly; in the long term they 
may be withdrawn entirely). But the Americans intend, as before, 
to command the armed forces of the alliance--otherwise "a 
leading or significant role" will not be maintained. 
  Incidentally, the U.S. leadership and NATO are proposing 
that 
Russia employ its armed forces in the execution of peacemaking 
missions of the alliance under similar conditions ("your 
soldiers--our command"). (Footnote 5) (See IZVESTIYA, 31 March 
1993) It is not difficult to discern behind such approaches one 
of the traditional principles of American foreign policy--to 
attempt to secure its national interests using the hands of 
others. 
  It is understandable that France, the most European-oriented 
country, might have every justification under such a version of 
NATO Europe-ization to continue to suspect the United States of 
hegemonistic aspirations. It is no accident that French Minister 
of Foreign Affairs A. Juppe stated in September 1993 that the 
country's foreign policy would continue to reject the 
possibility of dictatorship on the part of other states and 
would be aimed against aspirations to world leadership on the 
part of any country whatsoever. France sets European solidarity 
as the main priority, insofar as it cannot in isolation 
"maintain an equal footing" with the United States or with the 
rapidly developing countries of the Asian Pacific. Paris places 
Atlantic solidarity, i.e., cooperation with the United States 
and NATO, in second place as a means of guaranteeing security. 
  As far as Germany is concerned, that country can hardly be 
expected to sharply broaden its participation in NATO operations 
as the American researchers are proposing, unless its role in 
the command structures of the bloc is appropriately enhanced. 
  At the same time, if in the future a "Franco-Germanization" 
of NATO takes place in some manner, i.e., if the United States 
loses its command role in the alliance, the bloc will then be 
not NATO, not a trans-Atlantic organization, but rather a West 
European security structure. At that time, the need for 
existence of the West European Union may disappear as well. 
American taxpayers and the Congress, however, can hardly be 
expected to agree to finance U.S. presence in a 
military-political alliance in which their country is not 
playing the major role. 
  Thus, the future of the North Atlantic alliance is not 
determined, and the proposals of R. Asmus, R. Kugler, and S. 
Larrabee regarding its "transformation" turn out upon close 
examination to be just new methods of attaining an old 
geostrategic objective--the preservation of United States 
leadership in Europe into the postcommunist era. 
  How do the aspirations of the United States to preserve NATO 
and its position in Europe correlate with Russia's 
European-oriented interests? Is it really true, as the American 
analysts believe, that Russia's posture towards NATO and its 
possible expansion eastward will depend only on Russia 
itself--on whether democracy will be victorious or the country 
will revert to authoritarianism? How realistic are the West's 
opportunities to geopolitically "sever" Ukraine from Russia, as 
the American researchers propose? 
<H5>  The Interests of Russia </H5>
  The main national state interests of Russia, including those 
oriented on Europe, proceed from the main historical mission 
Russia must resolve today. This mission may be concisely summed 
up as follows: Russia must transform itself in a historically 
brief period of time from a military superpower with an 
ineffective, half-destroyed economy and fractured 
self-consciousness into a great multinational, democratic power 
which is confident of itself, which possesses economic might and 
a high level of spiritual and moral authority. 
  Clearly, Russia's natural partners in the outside world may 
come from among those centers of economic might that strive more 
than others to objectively cooperate with it and are prepared to 
render it assistance on nondiscriminatory terms. Russia's most 
natural partners are primarily its geographical neighbors who, 
proceeding from their own security considerations, are 
interested in preserving a stable--and consequently, a 
territorially integral--Russia. In Europe this is the 
integrational nucleus of the European Community--France and 
Germany. 
  It should not be forgotten, of course, that the Roman-German 
civilization has historically related to Russia in a haughty and 
guarded manner. At the same time, however, history has taught 
Western Europe that the preservation of stability throughout the 
European continent depends to a great degree on the situation in 
Russia. The fact that the European Community, at the initiative 
of France, reacted instantaneously to the dramatic events in 
Moscow on 3-4 October 1993, through proposals to expand 
cooperation--is further confirmation of this. 
  Naturally, if the United States is uncomfortable at the 
prospect of unification of, let us say, its Western civilization 
fellow comrades within the EC framework, a West European-Russian 
rapprochement can be expected to arouse in them far greater 
fears. And there can be no doubt but that the main instrument of 
opposition to this rapprochement may be NATO, as the simplest 
and most effective lever for exerting pressure on the West 
Europeans. In other words, in retaining command positions for 
the United States, NATO constitutes one of the main obstacles 
and impediments over the long term, standing in the way of 
resolving the Europe-oriented aspects of Russia's main 
historical mission. 
  Thus, the strategic and long-term interests of Russia are 
served either by the dissolution of NATO, or by its unambiguous 
Europe-ization. Also running counter to the strategic interests 
of Russia is the possible eastward expansion of the alliance as 
a means of strengthening and "Atlant-izing" it. Does the 
foregoing mean that Russia should immediately demand that the 
alliance be dissolved? No, it does not. 
  First of all, the future of NATO is basically a problem of 
American-West European relations, and Russia cannot seriously 
influence the fate of the alliance. But an interest is present 
on the part of Western Europe to preserve the alliance primarily 
on an anti-Russian basis. As researcher A. Arbatov writes, 
justifiably: "...the chief reason for preserving NATO in the 
foreseeable future remains all the same the unpredictability of 
the further development of events within Russia and the 
evolution of its foreign and military policy. (Footnote 6) 
(NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, 1 October 1993) This is inevitable until 
such time as Russia either establishes a durable and stable 
democracy, or the West European defensive structure becomes so 
strong that it is able to replace the United States and the 
present NATO in the role of guarantor of security. 
  Both of these processes will most likely require more than a 
decade to achieve. Over the course of this lengthy period of 
time, it is perhaps foolish for Russia to propose initiatives on 
the dissolution of NATO. Especially since preservation of the 
alliance during the transition period also meets certain of its 
interests, those related primarily to the German problem. 
  Presently it is unclear as to what limits and in what forms 
the most powerful economic country in Europe--united 
Germany--intends to augment its political role in the world. Its 
striving to become a permanent member of the United Nations 
Security Council is just one orientation of this augmentation. 
Without a doubt, the FRG is today an integral part of the West, 
through its system of bilateral and multilateral agreements, and 
its return to the military imperialism of the past is 
impossible. But it is also a fact that fears exist among the 
West European countries under Nazi occupation during the years 
of World War II regarding a revival of German hegemonism, 
perhaps in an economic form. 
  Historical memory is also alive in Russia with respect to 
the 
misfortunes and horrors brought by the war against Nazism. 
Russia is therefore interested first and foremost in preserving 
NATO during the transition period as a tried and tested 
instrument of exerting control over Germany on the part of the 
West. Here the interests of the United States and Russia 
coincide. How long interest in this question remains depends 
chiefly on the course of Germany's foreign policy. 
  But NATO is unsuited to the role of effective peacemaker in 
Europe, a role R. Asmus, R. Kugler, and S. Larrabee are 
promoting, despite the presence in it of the required military 
command and control and logistics infrastructure, and the low 
efficiency of the EC and CSCE in settling interethnic conflicts. 
  As Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs A. Kozyrev noted, the 
expansion of NATO itself will not accomplish the tasks of 
providing effective counteraction to interethnic conflicts, and 
will even "lead inevitably to a unique kind of hidden 
confrontation, and thus in the final analysis--to instability." 
(Footnote 7) (MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI, 26 September 1993) 
  Moreover, NATO has retained its anti-Russia orientation even 
after the end of the Cold War. Following President B. Yeltsin's 
statement in Poland on Russia's understanding of the problem of 
Poland's possible entry into NATO, steps followed in factual 
disavowal of this statement. Specifically, a letter was sent to 
Western leaders bearing the president's signature which 
expressed a warning against NATO expansion by virtue of 
inclusion of the former socialist countries of Eastern Europe, 
and which proposed that the security of this region be provided 
through joint guarantees on the part of the alliance and Russia. 
(Footnote 8) (IZVESTIYA, 2 October 1993) 
  In addition, the very existence of NATO, in the mass 
consciousness of Russians, at a time when the Warsaw Pact and 
the USSR have collapsed, is perceived as a symbol of national 
humiliation and as the victory of the United States in the Cold 
War. Whether or not these ideas--emerging from decades of Soviet 
propaganda--are false is a separate issue. But the ideas are 
entirely real. In other words, the very existence of NATO, not 
to mention the possibility of its eastward expansion, creates a 
foreign policy background favorable for the strengthening within 
Russia of the positions of anti-American political forces. 
  In this sense we cannot help but share the view of O. 
Harris, 
editor in chief of the American journal NATIONAL INTEREST, who 
writes: "To attempt to incorporate Eastern Europe within NATO's 
sphere of influence, at a time when Russia is in a state of 
dangerous disarray and its national prestige and self-confidence 
are deeply undermined, would definitively constitute an act of 
extreme stupidity." (Footnote 9) (Quote from FOREIGN AFFAIRS, 
October 1993, p. 43.) In his opinion, extremist and chauvinist 
elements both within Russia itself and outside it would use this 
against the West. He believes that with the disappearance of the 
Soviet threat, the need for a political organization of the NATO 
variety has also disappeared. 
  Possible NATO actions would not remain outside the field of 
view of Russian public opinion and would exert an influence on 
the political leadership of Russia regardless of who is in 
power. Russian public opinion would most likely react negatively 
to NATO operations in the former Yugoslavia if Serbian positions 
were subject to bombing or if peacemaking operations were 
carried out near the Western Russian borders, i.e., in the 
eastern "arc of instability," especially in territory of the 
CIS. A mandate from the United Nations or CSCE would hardly 
change anything. The reaction of Russians to possible NATO 
expansion by virtue of including the former socialist countries 
would most likely be negative. 
  In this manner, active peacemaking by NATO beyond the 
confines of its own territory on the European continent or 
possible NATO expansion eastward with the objectively retained 
anti-Russia orientation of the alliance--is not a path towards 
enhancing stability but, on the contrary, will intensify 
mistrust and alienation between the West and Russia. 
Consequently, in the final analysis this is a path of 
intensifying instability in Europe. 
  What are the possible outlines of Russian policy with regard 
to NATO? It is felt that in the long-term perspective, the 
existence of NATO contradicts the strategic interests of Russia 
in Europe, insofar as the anti-Russian orientation of this 
alliance is objectively maintained in the postcommunist era. 
NATO has fulfilled its basic historical mission, and the 
continued existence of this alliance can be viewed only as a 
temporary measure necessary for a transition period, until such 
time as a new security system in Europe is built naturally. The 
structural foundation of such a system must be West European and 
Russian forces, the "blue helmets" of Europe. 
  It is felt that Russia must abandon any provision of support 
to initiatives aimed at artificially prolonging the existence of 
NATO. In particular, it must not move towards active interaction 
with the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, should not support 
the striving of the alliance leadership to remove itself from 
United Nations control, and must be especially rigid in opposing 
the possible expansion of NATO eastward. Insofar as continued 
existence of the alliance meets most of all the national 
interests of the United States, it is best to allow the American 
politicians themselves to justify before the world community, 
Europeans, and their own people the need for extending the life 
of their offspring even following the end of the Cold War. 
  At the same time, it is not in the interests of Russia to 
fight in favor of immediate dissolution of the alliance, first 
and foremost because of the German problem. A gradual, natural 
process is underway of withdrawal of the Americans from Europe, 
the Europe-ization of NATO, and simultaneous strengthening of 
the European Community and West European Union, which suits the 
interests of the Russian Federation. It would be foolish to 
attempt to incite these processes onward--as they are mainly 
outside the realm of Russia's influence. Time will tell as to 
what form and which of the two (or even both military-political 
alliances) will survive in the final analysis. It is important 
for Russia that there be no organized structure in Europe 
capable of effectively opposing the expansion of its cooperation 
with the West Europeans. 
  But if during the course of the transition period, an armed 
conflict flares up near the western borders of Russia that 
demands NATO involvement, a settlement of the conflict must be 
pursued only jointly with Russia, in which regard not only the 
peacemaking forces themselves must be united, but their command 
elements as well. 
  With regard to security guarantees for the former socialist 
countries of Eastern Europe, in my view Russia should encourage 
their convergence with the EC and West European Union and 
strongly oppose their striving to join NATO. It seems that such 
an approach will find the support of the Europe-ists and 
Germany. And this will secure for the former socialist countries 
the Western guarantees of security they so desire. 
  The main road leading to creation of a system of common 
European security must be transformation of CSCE from an 
amorphous mass into a strong international organization with its 
own Security Council and its own peacemaking forces capable of 
swiftly and effectively providing warning and extinguishing 
armed conflicts. The directive organs of such an organization 
could be located in the former socialist countries of Central 
and Eastern Europe.

<F P=106> [Article by Doctor of Historical Science A.I. Utkin, leading </F>
researcher at the United States and Canada Institute of the 
Russian Academy of Sciences: "United States--West Europe: The 
Changing Role of Germany"] 
  [Text] There is no doubt that the West European region, due 
to its social propinquity to the United States, is important for 
the realization of a policy ensuring a world order favorable for 
the latter. However, Atlanticists and their imitators are 
gradually losing the exclusive positions they once held in the 
U.S. political arena as well as in American political science. 
It would be an exaggeration to present this process as a massive 
turn away from Europe, as an unequivocal rejection of solid 
political, economic, and military ties with the West European 
region. There is hardly any need to convince anyone how 
important for the United States are NATO, OECD, GATT, and the 
annual forum of the seven most developed countries. But it is 
equally important to point out the significant changes being 
observed in the U.S. ruling elite in terms of the vision of the 
American place in the future world. In the past, the 
pro-Atlantic strategists saw it in the creation of a "North 
Atlantic Community" (the blueprint for which was drafted by J. 
Kennedy in 1962) as the first stage of all other combinations. 
Now the very issue of institutionalizing the ties with West 
Europe has been practically abandoned and it is indicative that 
among the variants of development for the year 2000 (and beyond) 
one does not see anything that would assume some sort of North 
Atlantic statehood. The people who chart the U.S. foreign policy 
course see many different roads ahead, but not this one--it has 
lost its attraction. 
  In the final analysis NATO will probably exist for some 
time, 
but the loss of a common goal, the asymmetry of the bloc, the 
disengagement of interests will further reduce the 
attractiveness to the United States of the West European region 
as a global ally. Washington is facing a practical question: 
With whom specifically to do business in Europe? There is a 
lively debate underway in the United States as to who should be 
America's main partner in Europe. There are three contenders: 
Great Britain, France, and Germany. But the old "special 
ally"--Great Britain--has lost economic positions, having become 
somewhat marginal in the process of West European integration. 
France chose to reorient itself towards Bonn, and the United 
States was left with practically no choice. 
  It is logical in every sense that a significant number of 
political scientists name Germany as a key partner. It would be 
orientation towards the largest country in West Europe, a 
potential future predominant force in the region. The choice is 
almost certain--but just as certain are doubts that the new 
Germany will be as loyal and convenient a partner as the old FRG 
had been. Overall, the Americans are aware that when the 
communist East Germany disappeared in October 1990, the old West 
Germany, the familiar and ready-to-help ally, also disappeared. 
Even the strictly pro-German researcher R. Livingston 
acknowledges that increasing the FRG population by 16 million 
provides grounds not only for quantitative but also qualitative 
changes: It is clear that "the united Federative Republic will 
inevitably be more powerful, but it is not yet clear how it will 
use this might."[.sup]1[/] By all parameters (with the 
exception of nuclear weapons) Germany is already perceived in 
the United States as the future leader of Europe. But while the 
United States is willing to count on the new Germany as its main 
privileged ally in Europe, it would be somewhat premature to 
speak of reciprocal willingness on the part of the Germans. 
  "The German corporate approach allows it, as it does Japan, 
to concentrate its economic might towards achieving political 
goals abroad."[.sup]2[/] The hasty recognition by Germany of 
Slovenia and Croatia is a clear example of how the new, more 
powerful Germany will (at least periodically) act in its own 
interests, without looking not only to the opposite shore of the 
Atlantic but even to neighboring Paris and London, let alone its 
small neighbors. The recognition of Croatia in 1991 is seen as a 
distant thunder: Germany has regained the self-confidence it 
lost with the defeat of Hitler. American experts predict that 
Germany will dominate East Europe (and even see in it already a 
source of Russian-German conflicts). And the fact that 
Chancellor Kohl already has demanded the right to use troops 
outside the NATO sphere of action cannot fail to suggest certain 
food for thought. 
  In the past the United States looked for and emphasized the 
common in the political climate and mentality between Germany 
and the West as a whole. Now it carefully emphasizes the 
peculiarities of the largest country in West and Central Europe. 
In particular, American specialists note that Germany lacks 
universities that could produce an internationalist elite, as 
Oxford and Cambridge do in England, the Ecoles Superieures in 
France, and Tokyo University. In the opinion of the same 
Livingston, with unification Germany once again assumes the 
historic role of a Central European power, whose interests in 
the East are no less serious than in the West. West Germany 
oriented towards the Atlantic, the way we knew it during 
1949-1990, was a deviation from the norm of German history. 
Russian power is currently on the wane once again in East 
Europe. And, as has happened more than once in the past, German 
power is replacing it here." 
  What do Americans see in the Germanized East? Small states 
of 
Croatia and Hungary type already are awaiting directives from 
Germany. Slovakia, acquiring independence, immediate fell into 
the German orbit. The Czech Republic and Poland are in 
inevitable economic captivity. Ukraine may also end up there. 
Russia is looking for an economic foothold, and may find it only 
in Germany. 
  Germany has surpassed all Western countries taken together 
with respect to credits, subsidies, and credit guarantees for 
the entire East Europe. The former Soviet Union alone had 
received 75 billion marks by the middle of 1992. Another 30 
billion marks went to other East European countries. German 
investment in the East is incommensurably greater than that of 
others, and the FRG's trade with the East surpasses all Western 
trade taken together. 
  While in the European Union ((EU)) Germany tries to act 
together with France, and in NATO--in coordination with the 
United States, in the East Germany has a free hand. Neither do 
the Americans fail to notice that the EU is becoming practically 
a German domain. In 1991, despite the strain caused by 
absorption of five Eastern lands, Germany accounted for 53 
percent of the entire EU market (is it comparable with the U.S. 
share of 6 percent?). Now Germany has a population that is twice 
as large as that of its historical rivals--France and Great 
Britain. The population of the united Germany grew to 80 
million, and Germany's economic share in the EU has increased 
from 26 to 31 percent. Kohl immediately used the factor of 
Germany's increased might and began to demand that the German 
language be given a status equal to that of French and English 
in the EU. There is no doubt that acceptance into the EU of such 
countries as Austria or the Czech Republic (now Germany's 
client) will increase the proportional weight of Germany even 
more. 
  The United States and NATO, maintains Livingston, formerly 
vitally important for vulnerable West Germany, will now be 
relegated to the second or third level of priority, since with 
the end of the cold war Bonn has less need of an alliance with 
Washington. 
  The situation is far from simple. On one hand, the Unites 
States has sufficiently strong positions in Germany--not only 
military-political, but also economic. Let us recall that direct 
American investment in the German economy comprises $25 billion, 
while direct German investment into the American economy 
comprises $34 billion. Germany, which exports one-third of its 
gross domestic product [GDP], and the United States, whose 
exports have exceeded 10 percent of GDP, are becoming 
increasingly more interested in a world system of free trade. On 
the other hand, it is quite obvious that Germany is in no 
particular rush to compete for the right of the United States' 
most-favored partner in the West when it has such prospects in 
the East. And this policy towards the East has deep historical 
roots. 
  Before World War II Germany owned one-quarter of all trade 
with East Europe. It is not surprising that now Germany is again 
becoming a leading trade partner for Russia, Hungary, Poland, 
the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. Germany's positions probably 
will be strongest in the Czech Republic, Croatia, Slovakia, and 
the Baltics. American economists, historians, and political 
scientists see in the future a Germany which will find a huge 
new (old) sphere of influence all the way to St. Petersburg, 
expand this sphere of influence, and the memory of old friends 
across the ocean will remind it only of the old days of 
humiliation. Americans note that Germany has already begun to 
"play down" the importance of NATO by creating pan-European 
organizations, such as the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, 
which includes states of the former Warsaw Pact. Now it is 
Germany that is lobbying to accept into the EU Hungary, Poland, 
the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. 
  The objective result of Bonn's new external activities 
certainly is not neutral with respect to the United States. 
Germany is actually acting in its own name rather than "on 
behalf of the West," as a vanguard of the union led by America. 
The results of this are already affecting the European 
disposition of forces. In W. Hyland's opinion, in Europe 
"American influence is falling, German, rising."[.sup]3[/] 
Some American specialists have no doubt that the most important 
factor is Washington's nonparticipation, induced by 
circumstances, in forming the new Europe. 
  One way or the other there is a growing conviction in the 
United States that the German question not only has not been 
resolved but that it is only now emerging in all its complexity. 
The question is which direction German foreign policy will move 
from here. Who will control Central Europe, and hence, the 
entire continent? 
  At this point the dark forebodings and fears are entertained 
predominantly by historians, political scientists, and 
economists, but not the general public, which still believes in 
"German loyalty." Even among those who remember the history of 
the 20th century, attitudes have not yet taken final shape. Only 
the results of Germany's behavior in Europe will dot all the 
"i's." 
  Hyland reassures his compatriots regarding Germany: 
"Fortunately, Bonn of the 1990's is not the Weimar of the 
1920's. The unified Germany is fixed in the structure of unions 
and organizations; its democracy has deeper roots; its foreign 
ambitions and wishes have been fulfilled. No more of the 'knife 
in the back' legend; no more of the irredentist movement." 
  Germany is different now, but what is it? It is already 
clear 
to everybody in Washington that as a result of Germany's rise a 
global shift of forces has occurred. What conclusions should we 
draw from this? Specialists' opinions diverge. Some want to 
extract some gain for the United States by establishing special 
relations with Germany; others advocate measures to nip the 
geopolitical rise of Germany in the bud. 
  Energetic supporters of the former, "pro-German" approach 
are 
the aforementioned R. Livingston, E. Pond, General W. Odom, and 
P. Tarnoff. They argue the need for rapprochement with Bonn. 
  Livingston, director of the German Research Institute at 
Johns Hopkins University, believes that fears of a unified 
Germany are exaggerated. It has changed in a fundamental way 
during the postwar period, he says. Its foundation--West 
Germany--over four decades has been "de-Prussified, Westernized, 
and highly commercialized." It has moved a great distance away 
from the Kaiser, Weimar, Nazi country that challenged the world 
and has sublimated its nationalism in the pathos of European 
build-up. 
  E. Pond works on the premise that in the new 1990's system, 
which is currently in the process of being built, the two 
critically important forces are the United States and the 
European Union led by Germany. The researcher believes that NATO 
has already become a "postnational" institution, and advocates 
shifting the burden of the main efforts in this union to the 
European half as a whole, and within that--to Germany first. The 
Americans should welcome this positive self-assertion of its 
"partners in leadership," she writes, urging them not to worry 
(as the nervous French do) "about the subject of Germany 
creating a special sphere of influence in its 
region."[.sup]4[/] If not Germany, who will be able to 
mobilize the immense resources of Europe to the defense of the 
common interests of the West, or even the North as a whole in 
its developing confrontation with the developing South? 
  General W. Odom, director of the Hudson Institute's Security 
Issues Research Program, has no doubt that "Germany is the key. 
The Atlantic house, which includes Britain, France, and some 
other smaller countries, cannot ensure peace; it must include 
Germany... When ties between Germany and the United States are 
solid, Europe is stable. The absence of such ties leads to 
war."[.sup]5[/] 
  Famous political scientist and futurologist P. Tarnoff also 
provides arguments in favor of Washington's orientation toward 
the European capital that will determine the course of history, 
that is, Bonn. Washington can still delude itself for some time 
regarding the dominant function of its "special relations" with 
London, but this already constitutes a disengagement from 
reality. For the third time in the history of the 20th century 
the United States must choose among the European elite, and this 
time the choice must be Germany.[.sup]6[/] 
  The Americans (like many before them) hope that the Germans 
will not forget the good deeds: the Marshall Plan, the aid 
during the Berlin blockade, and the help in the cause of German 
reunification. Let us note that in its time Russia also (in 
1870) counted on Bismarck's gratitude. As did Gorbachev, for 
that matter. Livingston believes that by taking upon itself the 
role of Western bulwark in Central and East Europe, Germany will 
enable the United States to be active in the Near East, Latin 
America, and the Pacific Ocean basin. America, on the other 
hand, should not encroach on its partner in the latter's sphere 
of influence. In the final analysis, believes R. Livingston, a 
Europe reaching to the Urals is so big that it will tie up 
German energy for many decades to come. The only question is 
whether Germany will stop there. (The creators of Locarno also 
dreamed of Germany "having its hands full" in the east.) 
  Many Americans count on German gratitude for the fact that 
in 
1989-1990 it was distant America, less burdened by European 
historical experiences, that supported German reunification to a 
much greater extent than its nearby European neighbors. They 
also point out how many Germans have found their new homeland in 
the United States: The biggest ethnic community now is German 
(according to the results of the 1990 census there are 58 
million persons of German descent living in the United States, 
as compared to 38 million of Anglo-Saxon origin and 32 million 
Irish). 
  Still, wary American observers note that neither World War I 
nor World War II resolved the issue of accommodating Germany in 
the European order of powers. Now this question arises again, in 
the 1990's. Moreover, the disintegration of the Soviet Union 
intensified the issue of the future place of Germany in Europe, 
where it no longer has a powerful Russian counterweight. 
Alarmists recall that it was a combination of the unification 
and industrialization of Germany under Bismarck that caused 
World War I and all subsequent misfortunes of our century. It 
was then that Germany forced the countries of the world to face 
a choice: agree to Germany's unprecedented power or fight it. 
Then, as in 1941, the world chose the former. Now the United 
States faces a similar choice. 
  Another side of the issue is whether Bonn will agree to have 
"special relations" with Washington. American critics of the 
"pro-German" course note that such a union would put the Germans 
in a deliberately subordinate position. It is unlikely that they 
will be willing to consciously fix their dependent status. More 
likely, they will seek Western support first and foremost in the 
practically dependent France. 
  A supporter of the latter approach--critical with respect to 
Germany--L. Xiang (Yale University) notes that "latent 
anti-American and anti-NATO feelings among Germans are a 
tremendously important part of the outlook of both the left and 
the right in Germany, although they are kept beneath the 
surface. United Germany has proved to be a fertile soil for 
xenophobia. There are no grounds for excessive faith in the 
restraining nature of NATO... As the 'Russian threat' 
disappears, there is nothing for the United States to do in 
Central and East Europe, where the vacuum is being filled by 
another superpower."[.sup]7[/] 
  And the United States has been at war with this new 
superpower twice in this century. 
  The critics of the pro-German preoccupation feel that a 
special accent on the German direction is a mistake. "Germany 
did not choose to form close ties with the United States during 
the postwar (after the cold war--A.U.) period. It should be 
noted that Germany, while providing $6.6 billion in the course 
of the Gulf War, completely refrained from participating in 
combat operations, shifting all the burden onto the United 
States. At the same time there are no historical or cultural 
factors that would make cooperation between America and Germany 
inevitable. On the contrary, many well-informed Germans are 
against the presence of foreign, especially American, troops on 
German soil and, as pressure along the East-West line weakens, 
question the very necessity of it."[.sup]8[/] 
  Those representing the critics dismiss the hopes that 
preserving NATO would be enough to keep Germany's development 
under secure control. Currently nobody in Europe can exert 
serious controlling influence on Germany. Only the United States 
has the real power to do so, but its resolve is waning. Xiang 
puts the question straight: "Is NATO up to the dual task of 
maintaining Germany's orientation toward the West and containing 
the growing German nationalism and ambitions?" 
  Yes, the geostrategic situation of Germany has changed 
beyond 
recognition in the early 1990's. For the first time over almost 
half a century Germany can again concentrate on Central Europe, 
which was its main sphere of interest in 1914 and 1939; on that 
very historic "Mitteleurope" which was the base for Germany's 
designs for world domination. As for the United States, for the 
first time in half a century it is facing a question: Will a new 
powerful Germany not choose leading positions in Central Europe 
over a subordinate place in the West? 
  American political scientists, who take a stand against 
encouraging such a turn by pointing out the danger of alienating 
the German superpower, emphasize the weak point in the current 
American policy: On one hand the United States apparently 
guarantees Germany's security through NATO, but on the other 
opens for it the freedom of practically uncontrolled action in 
the eastern direction, where such newborn countries as the Czech 
Republic, Slovakia, and Croatia are agreeable in advance to a 
German protectorate. In a certain sense the situation today is 
such that the United States in a way is pushing Germany to move 
in eastern and southern directions instead of its previous 
course towards the Atlantic peace. An increasingly greater 
number of German analysts link their future and the future of 
their country with the creation of a German zone of influence 
aimed at turning the former Yugoslavia and the countries of the 
former Warsaw Pact into grateful German clients. 
  Belatedly, American analysts have indeed discovered that 
both 
the left and the right in Germany (from their own positions, 
guided by different aims and plans) have come to the conclusion 
that the future of the country may lie to the east. Their former 
pan-European stance has acquired a complex Central European 
coloration. As a result, both of the largest parties in the FRG 
currently have a special vision of European development--they 
link it with the return to a zone of "historical influence." 
German propagandists still energetically vouch for their 
adherence to Atlantic peace, but harsh facts of modern times 
tell us that German nationalism is on the rise and the false 
German pan-European stance may turn out to be a cover for the 
nationalistic upturn in the unified country. 
  How naive the old serious academic conclusions which 
contended that the FRG has lost its German identity now 
look.[.sup]9[/] Now, thanks to U.S. and NATO support, German 
nationalism is gaining momentum utilizing respectable moral 
baggage. Nationalists in England and France look like dinosaurs, 
but in Germany they use the West's victory in the cold war as a 
justifying premise for moving forward. Membership in NATO allows 
Germany to expand its sphere of influence in the east and south 
without alarming the objects of its political offensive as they 
are being absorbed. For this, Germany should be grateful to the 
United States. But should the United States be grateful to its 
shortsighted politicians? The United States also practically 
ignored the reaction of the first victims of Germany's 
elevation--Great Britain and France. The Americans found 
consolation in the fact that neither London nor Paris ever 
figured out what to do over those months and years when Germany 
was regaining the Bismarck zone of influence. Now, however, the 
unified Germany has rendered practically meaningless the 
Gaullist idea of preserving strategic independence. And no 
matter how much the French may want now to strengthen NATO ties 
(contrary to the theory and practice of Gaullism), "the bird has 
flown the cage." This was pointed out as early as 1990 by the 
experienced Flora Lewis--THE NEW YORK TIMES correspondent in 
Paris.[.sup]10[/] 
  London, on the other hand, being in strained circumstances, 
while holding back European integration in fact reserved the 
right to turn to Washington so that, by remaining its closest 
European ally (in the event of frightening turns in Europe) for 
the third time in this century is finding salvation in ties with 
the United States. The Americans saw clearly that London was 
much more irritated by German unification than Paris, which left 
everything to fate. England sort of froze, looking at America, 
quietly hoping that NATO would still work as an Anglo-Saxon 
brake on Germany. But London already began to see in the German 
"pressing in favor of a United States of Europe (cynics talk 
about a "Federal Republic of Europe") the pursuit of old 
nationalist goals by new methods."[.sup]11[/] 
  And what about America? 
  Berkeley University Professor A. Wolfe predicts that 
"suspicion toward communism, which has left such an imprint on 
the American past, may turn into suspicion combined with envy 
toward Germany and Japan as they become increasingly important 
players in the world arena."[.sup]12[/] 
  American specialists believe that "the conflict between 
American and German interests will acquire an acute form at a 
time when the need will arise to resolve the problem of the 
future of American arms in Germany."[.sup]13[/] It is being 
noted in America that already many Germans are speaking of the 
inevitable death of NATO, since it does not create conditions 
for realizing their dreams of Mitteleurope. But NATO must 'die a 
natural death only after it has served its purpose for German 
national interests.'"[.sup]14[/] 
  Germany has in the future the same three options to choose 
from as it has had over the preceding century and a half: 1) act 
alone; 2) union with Russia; 3) union with the United States. 
Twice in this century the Germans have attempted to take the 
first option, and twice were defeated. At the time, union with 
Russia helped Bismarck and Hitler (in 1939), but neither was 
able to preserve German primacy in Europe. Germany chose union 
with America only under Adenauer in 1949, and it produced as a 
result the reindustrialization of Germany, its unification, the 
introduction of democracy, a long period of peace, and most 
importantly, Germany gaining its true place in Europe. 
  Still, the question remains: What will be the Germans' 
current geopolitical choice? To what use will they put the 
freedom of action they have gained for the first time? They have 
all the old options open to them; they may consider desirable 
both union with Moscow and their own way of strengthening 
influence in East Europe. "A dark past and decades of foreign 
military presence have reinforced deep-seated feelings," 
believes General Odom, "which in Germany may turn out to be 
stronger than a cool-minded appraisal of objective interests." 
  Alarmed Americans say that this is precisely the time, when 
many Germans are still afraid to be left without the umbrella of 
NATO, to exert a decisive influence on the evolution of 
Germany's foreign policy course. Fear of an unknown future may 
still help the Americans. American support for Paris and London 
could help rein in German ambitions. The French could become a 
particularly good conduit of Western influence. Actually, Paris 
does not have any choice: Otherwise, it will find itself 
completely in Germany's shadow. 
  Is this not the time to revive the old Gaullist ideas of a 
"directorate"--a multilateral governing body that would include 
the United States, England, France, as well as Italy and 
Germany--asks Xiang. 
  The weakness of this idea is in that it is odiously 
undemocratic in its intent to "lure" Germany into this new 
structure that would give it new opportunities. Hastily hatched 
plans to find anti-German support in London and Paris have a 
downside as well. Yes, American researchers admit that much 
depends on West Europeans. However, if England, France, Italy, 
and others begin to get nervous at the sight of the new German 
might, Germany will turn to East Europe and possibly to Moscow 
as well. For the United States this would be the worst-case 
scenario. 
  Great Britain and France, however, do not have that much of 
a 
choice. As in 1914, they are facing the fact that the two of 
them cannot contain the German colossus. The revival of German 
nationalism would inevitably reverberate in London and Paris. 
This time America will not have that much time to make a choice. 
A traditional question: "What will be the future of Germany?" is 
hanging like a sword of Damocles over the pacified Europe, which 
had so many hopes for a "golden age" after the end of the cold 
war. The possibilities of the Swiss, Japanese, and Swedish model 
of political development of the FRG are being considered. 
  By now, however, such discussions look obsolete. Realism 
does 
not permit us to see Germany as merely "a big Switzerland." 
Meanwhile, given West German money and East German ties, truly 
mind-boggling prospects are opening in the east. Germany 
strategic interest in the EU may wane in light of these eastern 
prospects. It is hardly a matter of contention that the 
emergence of German might was the most important factor of 
European history of the 20th century. The point of contention is 
how the Germans will use their new might this time. 
  Most American specialists believe that the United States 
could solve the German problem only by strengthening NATO--a 
sort of "straitjacket" for Germany. But merely choosing Bonn as 
the most important partner actually does not resolve the problem 
but rather begets new ones. New difficulties are arising for the 
Americans. First, this time they are not the ones to hold the 
initiative--it is in the hands of the Germans. Second, both 
France and especially Great Britain find it difficult to adjust 
to living in the German shadow. This factor will inevitably 
affect inter-Atlantic relations. Third, Moscow "in its 
misfortunes" may turn to a benevolent Germany, and this will 
again bring back the feelings of 1922 and 1939. Finally, fourth, 
NATO may simply disintegrate, and the Americans will have no 
effective levers left to influence the common European process. 
According to G. Treverton, a staff member of the New York 
Council on International Relations, "nobody on either side of 
the Atlantic knows how to reform American ties with Europe after 
the disappearance of the Soviet threat, and whether they need to 
be revised in the first place. Americans still see NATO as the 
most serious defense alliance that provides the United States 
with the ability to influence the development of events in 
Europe. But NATO is not suitable for solving the future problem 
of European security: New Yugoslavias are expected here, rather 
than Soviet troops marching into the North German 
plains."[.sup]15[/] 
  At the current stage the United States is leaving Europe in 
the military sphere, but increasing pressure in the economic 
one. (For instance, during the Uruguay round of GATT 
negotiations, for instance, it is demanding that subsidies to 
European agricultural producers be cut by 75 percent over 10 
years--in a way, America demanded from Germany payment for 
consent to unification). There is no doubt, however, that as the 
new Europe with a new leader comes of age, relations between 
"the benefactor and the grateful recipient" will change 
radically.

Integration Models."] 
  [Text] 
<H8>  First Article </H8>
  In a series of articles the author attempts a 
comparative analysis of what leading international organizations 
(NATO, CSCE, and the UN) can really do to facilitate the 
settlement of conflicts on the territory of the former Soviet 
Union, as well as to achieve early involvement of the new 
countries of Eurasia in multilateral cooperation in the field of 
security. 
  The end of the Cold War, the failure of communism as a 
global 
political ideology, the collapse of the world socialist system 
and disintegration of the Soviet Union have created 
fundamentally new opportunities for overcoming divisions within 
the international community. Virtually all leaders of the 
countries of Central Europe and the new nations of Eurasia have 
proclaimed "returning to the community of civilized nations" and 
close cooperation with former political and ideological enemies 
in the most diverse areas as their primary foreign policy 
objective. Western leaders, for their part, have all welcomed 
this desire of the post-communist countries and expressed 
readiness to facilitate their rapid integration into 
multilateral Western structures and institutions. 
  However, soon serious obstacles began to appear in Central 
Europe on the road to such integration. The very fact of new 
nations taking the place of the USSR, Czechoslovakia and 
Yugoslavia has complicated the work of international 
organizations and made multilateral negotiations and assessments 
of subregional balances of political and military forces more 
difficult. The appearance of Ukraine--the largest European 
nation after Russia--on the map Europe has in itself produced 
major changes in the continent's entire geopolitical landscape, 
requiring extremely cautious and well thought-out reaction on 
the part of the West[.sup]1[/]. At the same time, all 
military-political structures and institutes created by the West 
during the Cold War period (even those not designed specifically 
for confronting communist countries) have been faced with the 
need to redefine their functions and tasks and prove their 
suitability for work in the new conditions. 
  Another factor that makes the integration of post-communist 
states into the Western community more difficult is nationalism. 
As expected by many scholars, nationalism has become one of the 
prime movers of the political process in the east of the 
European continent. The rise of nationalism has been, as far as 
one can judge, an inevitable consequence of the crisis and 
failure of communist ideology and the communist system, which 
had for a long time impeded the establishment of mature forms of 
social relations on both the domestic and international levels. 
Following the anticommunist revolutions of 1989-1991, 
national-ethnic self-identification became one of the main forms 
of social existence in countries where no civic society in the 
western sense had ever been established. Of course, in some 
countries of Central Europe other forms of socialization 
continued to exist all through the communist period: in Poland 
the ferment of civic society was the Catholic Church and, from 
the early 1980s, Solidarno; in Czechoslovakia (in the Czech 
Republic to a greater degree than Slovakia) a stable 
semi-underground dissident subculture persisted even after 1968; 
in Hungary the party-state leadership headed by Janos Kadar 
inclined towards liberal experimentation. However, most 
post-communist states lacked even such modest counterbalances to 
ethnic nationalism and statism. 
  Nationalist movements also thrived because considerable 
segments of the former communist elites in the countries of 
Central and Eastern Europe readily embraced the ideology of 
nationalism in an effort to use it as a new source to legitimize 
their power. Nationalistic ideas were frequently popularized by 
the surviving machinery of communist propaganda, though now it 
was directed not so much against the West as against adjoining 
neighbors among the post-communist countries; such propaganda 
contributed to rising xenophobia and a sense of national 
exclusiveness. Nationalism often went hand in hand with 
right-wing populism, and in some cases with various forms of 
fundamentalism. 
  The integration of Russia and other former soviet republics 
into the political, economic and military structures of the West 
was complicated by the fact that it had to be effected in the 
context of the formation of a fundamentally new balance of 
forces in the world, and especially the European continent. By 
the time of the disintegration of the USSR unified Germany was 
already becoming the dominant economic and political force in 
Europe. It possessed the greatest capabilities for extending 
financial aid to Central European countries, as well as to the 
republics of the Soviet Union. The role of NATO in the future 
Europe became a topic of animated debate in the course of which 
it became apparent that by the end of the decade a large part of 
U.S. armed forces would be withdrawn from Western Europe. It was 
suggested that even before the advent of the 21st century 
Western Europe would become an independent military force. The 
process of economic integration in the EC framework acquired new 
dimensions, with people gradually getting used to the prospect 
of confederation. 
  At the same time, the West was unable to avoid a degree of 
political destabilization associated with the end of the Cold 
War and the profound crisis of most left-wing political parties, 
as well as with accumulated socio-economic problems. By the 
early 1990s extreme right-wing groups and movements were gaining 
strength in almost all countries of Western Europe, with the 
rising popularity of nationalistic leaders (the most vivid, 
though far from only, example of this trend was the rapid growth 
of Le Pen's party in France). The further development of 
West-European integration, to say nothing of the possible 
expansion of the European Community, aroused concerns in some 
countries for the preservation of independence and national 
unity. Fears of the prospect of millions of immigrants pouring 
in from the East and apprehensions about the influx of cheap 
goods into West-European markets from the post-communist states 
also contributed to rising xenophobia and even nostalgia for the 
collapsed "iron curtain." 
  Discussions concerning the integration of Russia and other 
former soviet republics became especially acute after the 
1990-1991 political crisis in Yugoslavia escalated into a bloody 
civil war. The question here is not only of human sacrifices and 
material losses on a scale unknown to Europe since World War II. 
The Balkan conflict has clearly demonstrated that the West is 
not ready to develop and enforce any more or less consistent 
strategy towards the post-communist world. The need for 
collective action and establishing a system of incentives and 
sanctions for the former Yugoslav republics was apparent already 
at the initial stage of the crisis, yet neither NATO, the CSCE, 
the EC, nor the UN were able to demonstrate the requisite 
readiness for action or propose solutions commensurate with the 
problem. 
  Throughout the entire initial phase of the civil war in 
Yugoslavia (1990-1991) many Western experts predicted that the 
internal conflict in that country would be quickly localized and 
isolated from European big politics[.sup]2[/]. This view was 
apparently based on the notion that, with the end of the Cold 
War, the main threats of the escalation of regional conflicts 
were no longer cogent. However, the civil conflict quickly began 
to acquire international aspects: Hungary expressed concern over 
the situation of the Hungarian minority in Yugoslavia and, 
according to some reports, even declared the possibility of 
intervening[.sup]3[/]; Greece and Bulgaria displayed 
heightened interest in the fate of Macedonia, and Albania was 
concerned with the situation in Kosovo. This course of events on 
the territory of Yugoslavia substantially undermined hopes that 
possible conflicts on the territory of the Soviet Union could be 
fenced off from the rest of the world. 
  It should be noted that since the debate began in 1991 it 
was 
conducted as it were on two levels. On the one hand, there was 
(and still is) an insistent need for urgent, immediate solutions 
capable of preventing a repeat of the "Yugoslavian variant" in 
different regions of the former Soviet Union. On the other, 
there is the no less apparent need for long-term strategic 
programs that would make it possible to organically merge CIS 
countries into regional and global systems of international 
relations. Whereas in the former case the main role was to be 
played by existing institutions (NATO, CSCE, EC, UN), in the 
latter qualitatively new mechanisms and structures could be 
built. However, in the course of the debate these two levels 
were frequently mixed, which led to confusion and mutual 
misunderstanding. 
  Confusion was also caused by different interpretations of 
the 
very concept of "integration." Some politicians and scholars 
viewed the concept as cultural-civilizational in content. To 
them, the formal inclusion of Russia in Western structures 
seemed essentially a secondary matter, a derivative of her 
ability or inability to master and accept the basic values of 
Western democracy, the Western view of human rights, etc. 
Accordingly, the demands on Russia were extremely severe and the 
process of integration (or, more precisely, of 
cultural-civilizational assimilation of Russia) was viewed as 
historically protracted and spanning at least several decades. 
More, justifiable doubts were expressed as to the very ability 
of Russia to meld completely with the West. 
  Another interpretation of the concept of "integration" 
centered mainly on its political and military-strategic aspects. 
The task of the quickest accession of Russia, as well as other 
former soviet republics, to Western security structures was 
considered to be much more important and urgent than the vague 
prospects of their cultural-civilizational assimilation. That is 
why, at least during the first stage of integration, the new 
nations of Eurasia were faced with less stringent demands, 
bearing, moreover, almost exclusively on their foreign and 
military policies. As stated in a special workshop report of the 
Center for National Security Negotiations in Paris, "basically, 
Russia must continue to develop in a direction that does not 
lead to the emergence of a new military threat against the West. 
Even a Russian nationalist government could meet that 
requirement: for example, an authoritarian regime relying on 
centralized economic planning, provided such a regime 
concentrates on the solution of domestic problems, without 
attempting to restore its lost hegemony in Europe."[.sup]4[/] 
According to this viewpoint, interaction among state political 
institutes should precede interaction among societies as such, 
creating the prerequisites for subsequent cultural integration 
while at the same time resolving the most important, from the 
Western point of view, problems of regional and global stability. 
  One of the most widespread variants of Western strategy 
assumes the gradual integration of Central and Eastern Europe 
into Western security structures using NATO 
mechanisms[.sup]5[/]. The first step in that direction was 
the inclusion of former republics of the Soviet Union in the 
North Atlantic Cooperation Council, which is frequently regarded 
as a "connecting link" between NATO and the CIS. Along similar 
lines are proposals about forming a bilateral Russian-American 
military political alliance which would either be a component of 
NATO or would operate in close connection with it[.sup]6[/]. 
  In the opinion of American experts, this integration variant 
could be of special importance for preventing the proliferation 
of nuclear weapons on the territory of the former USSR. It is 
hardly possible to create a stable balance of forces on this 
territory; without an element of nuclear deterrence, any 
anti-Russian coalition of republics would inevitably be loose 
and unable to function. Consequently, the U.S. and NATO could 
face a difficult choice: either provide some countries of the 
region (for instance, Ukraine) with reliable security 
guarantees, including against potential threats from within the 
region itself, or accept the prospect of nuclear proliferation 
with vague but possibly dangerous consequences. Many Ukrainian 
leaders, including President Leonid Kravchuk, directly link 
Ukraine's nuclear disarmament with providing Kiev with reliable 
Western security guarantees. Naturally, only NATO is capable of 
assuring security guarantees commensurate with the possession of 
nuclear weapons. 
  NATO supporters suggest taking advantage of favorable 
political conditions to ensure maximum internationalization of 
Russia's nuclear weapons, as well as of nuclear arsenals in the 
West. In their view, NATO mechanisms can be used to integrate 
Russian nuclear weapons at least at three levels: 1. Financing 
the work of Russian nuclear specialists and research institutes, 
help in implementing the provisions of the SALT-1 and SALT-2 
treaties, increasing the safety of nuclear facilities in Russia, 
and keeping Russian nuclear technology and nuclear weapons 
components from going abroad; 2. Coordination of nuclear 
planning, expansion of confidence-building measures in the 
nuclear field, exchange of information about trends in the 
development of nuclear technologies; 3. Creation of joint 
multilateral nuclear forces of NATO and Russia. Noting that 
"multilateral nuclear forces [were] an old NATO objective which 
was never realized because of the imbalance between America and 
its European nuclear allies, as well as because of European 
distrust of the American strategy of expanded deterrence," 
supporters of this point of view note in a book published 
recently in the U.S. that "this goal can be achieved if Russia 
places a portion of its nuclear systems in a 'dual key' system 
with NATO. The formation of multilateral nuclear forces could 
commence if Ukraine transfers the nuclear systems on its 
territory to NATO for subsequent destruction or 
internationalization. Since Ukraine does not want to transfer 
nuclear weapons to Russia before receiving security guarantees 
from NATO, the transfer of nuclear systems directly to NATO may 
prove to be a reasonable solution."[.sup]7[/] 
  Of course, the creation of NATO multilateral nuclear forces 
is hardly possible without fundamental changes in the nuclear 
strategy of the Western countries themselves. The key issue is 
whether the U.S. is prepared to place a portion of its nuclear 
arsenal under the control of a new multilateral structure. So 
far this idea has not been seriously considered in Washington. 
  Supporters of this variant of integrating the former USSR 
republics into Western security structures consider it 
attractive because at present NATO is beginning to diversify its 
functions. Along with traditional military-political tasks, NATO 
agencies are seeking to contribute to the solution of problems 
of converting military production and ecology, coordinate the 
scientific and industrial policies of member countries, etc. 
Thus, linking with NATO is especially worthwhile for the former 
republics of the Soviet Union, while NATO, for its part, 
receives another important lever for influencing the new 
countries' foreign policies and defense strategies. 
  Expansion of the North Atlantic alliance's "zone of 
responsibility" in the east of Europe would, in the view of 
supporters of this variant, answer two fundamental NATO 
questions: concerning the new role of NATO in the current 
transitional period in the development of the European situation 
and the basic possibility of preserving the bloc in the longer 
term. As is known, the creation of NATO in the latter 1940s was 
prompted by the United States' desire to resolve three 
interrelated problems: creation of a force center in Western 
Europe capable of withstanding Soviet military might and 
political influence; creation of a structure for controlling the 
postwar development of Western Germany in the political and 
military spheres; and the establishment of mechanisms capable of 
overcoming, or at least alleviating, contradictions within 
Western Europe. In addition, the U.S. had a fourth objective, 
apparent to all but never expressed officially: the formation of 
reliable instruments of American influence on the European 
continent. 
  These objectives were never fundamentally revised over the 
course of four decades of Cold War and guaranteed the 
maintenance of a stable consensus in questions of NATO actions 
among its participants. Moreover, even the unofficial fourth 
objective was never challenged in Western Europe (except for 
Gaullist France in the 1960s), since American political 
leadership created an additional guarantee of stability on the 
continent. 
  The end of the Cold War and disintegration of the Soviet 
Union, coupled with the changed correlation of forces between 
Western Europe and the U.S., as well as the process of 
West-European integration, cast doubts on the earlier objectives 
of NATO, albeit not to the same degree. The first--confronting 
Soviet might--had virtually disappeared. Although some NATO 
generals and Western politicians claim that even given all the 
changes in the geostrategic situation Russia remains a major 
military power of the continent, an objective assessment of 
Russia's offensive capabilities (to say nothing of an analysis 
of her political objectives) indicates the absence of any 
military threat from her against Western or Central Europe. 
  At present the quantitative ratio of the military potentials 
of NATO and Russia is approximately 3:1, with NATO's clear 
superiority in the quality of its weapons and the combat 
readiness of its troops. When assessing the force ratio between 
Russia and the rest of Europe (including the countries of 
Central and Eastern Europe) the figure is approximately 1:6. 
That is why many Western military experts have a much more sober 
and restrained assessment than politicians of the actual 
prospects of a "new threat" to Europe from a right-wing regime 
in Russia. 
  The rationale of preserving NATO for the purpose of 
preventing or settling Western contradictions or conflicts is 
also strongly questioned. In the last few decades political and 
economic structures have been set up outside the NATO framework 
to deal precisely with the resolution of such problems, and in 
many cases they operate much more effectively than NATO. 
Moreover, the center of gravity of problems dividing 
West-European countries has shifted from the military-political 
to the commercial, economic and social spheres, i.e., to areas 
in which NATO has neither the requisite experience nor authority. 
  The possibility of maintaining NATO out of concerns on the 
part of West-European countries to keep a unified Germany in a 
rigid NATO framework also appears to be fairly problematic. In 
general, it is hard to imagine how a leading European nation 
(when the unification process is completed Germany will have a 
quarter of the population of Western Europe, its industrial 
potential will be the second in the world, and its GNP will be 
equal to the combined GNP of France and Great Britain) can be 
kept in modern conditions in any kind of "rigid framework." 
Already in 1990, Germany's position with regard to the crisis in 
Yugoslavia differed significantly from that of other 
West-European countries, as well as from American approaches to 
the crisis. Moreover, neither consultations within NATO nor 
coordination of the foreign policies of EC countries brought the 
Germans to an "Atlantic common denominator." Apparently, 
Germany's attitude towards the Yugoslavian crisis can be seen as 
a precedent for its future policy, and in future it may be even 
more clearcut. 
  At the same time, it would be unrealistic to expect Germany, 
with thousands of economic and political ties with the U.S. and 
West-European countries, to opt for any open confrontation with 
its NATO partners by taking a nationalistic course and acting 
unilaterally. Germany's policy will be guided for the coming 
years, if not decades, by balancing between multilateral and 
unilateral solutions, between preservation of Atlantic 
cooperation and the building of a "Middle Europe." It is, 
however, obvious that NATO's impact on Bonn's foreign policy 
decisions will increasingly decline. 
  For the United States, the question of the potential for 
NATO 
intervention in affairs on the territory of the former Soviet 
Union is additionally linked to the broader question of the 
future role of the U.S. itself in NATO. As noted before, one of 
the bulwarks of the bloc's existence throughout the entire Cold 
War period was America's desire to use NATO mechanisms as a 
means to secure its political interests in Western Europe. 
Washington's readiness to carry a disproportionate burden of 
NATO expenses allowed it to overcome many differences among the 
allies. Today the need for, or even expediency of, preserving 
NATO as a conduit of American influence in Europe is being 
increasingly challenged, both in Europe itself and the United 
States. The shifting of the center of gravity of relations 
between the U.S. and Western Europe to the sphere of trade, 
finance, competition in world markets, etc., in large measure 
devalues NATO mechanisms created to coordinate actions in the 
military-political sphere. The Americans were unable to adjust 
NATO to U.S.-EC relations even during the Cold War years, still 
less since the end of the Cold War. 
  That is why, ever since the beginning of perestroyka in the 
USSR and the development of Soviet-American cooperation in the 
latter 1980s, anti-NATO sentiments have been on the rise among 
the American political elite, both liberal and conservative; 
questions of reorganizing the bloc and reducing U.S. armed 
forces in Europe are more than ever linked with reduction of the 
federal budget and "redistribution of the financial burden" 
among members of the alliance. A wide range of arguments in 
favor of "getting out of Europe" have been presented. Some 
political scientists and public figures were guided primarily by 
financial considerations[.sup]8[/]. Other experts felt that 
reducing the American presence would make U.S.-European 
relations more stable and help consolidate political mechanisms 
of cooperation. They also called for expanding economic links 
between the U.S. and Western Europe to prevent it from becoming 
a closed center of regional integration[.sup]9[/]. Still 
others felt that the close linkage of the U.S. to West-European 
security restricts the maneuverability of American policy and 
impedes the use of opportunities opening up in other regions. It 
has been suggested that politically Western Europe, if not 
losing its significance for the U.S., should at least give way 
to East Asia (or in some cases the Western Hemisphere) as the 
main area of American foreign policy strategy[.sup]10[/]. 
Finally, some claim that large-scale American military presence 
is simply meaningless, insofar as the linkage of American 
security to Western Europe can be secured by purely symbolic 
contingents of U.S. troops on the continent and that a sharp 
reduction in American forces will have no effect on nuclear 
deterrence[.sup]11[/]. 
  President Bush, who undertook the initiative to develop a 
NATO disarmament plan in 1990, proceeded from the idea that U.S. 
forces in Central Europe should not go below 195,000. One year 
later the Republican administration revised its plans in the 
direction of further reductions down to 150,000. Senator Sam 
Nunn, who favored an alternative approach, called this 
"unrealistic" even before the disintegration of the USSR and 
called for a reduction down to 75,000 over five years. The 
Clinton administration has supported the "Nunn plan," with 
emphasis on preserving the potential for rapid transfer of 
American troops from the continental U.S. to Europe in case of a 
crisis. However, even more radical proposals have been aired in 
the new Congress, including the complete withdrawal of American 
troops from Europe and a revision of U.S. military commitments 
towards its allies. 
  From this point of view the plan to integrate the new CIS 
countries into Western security structures through NATO has the 
purpose of stabilizing the situation not only in the East, but 
in the West as well, giving the bloc new functions and new 
incentives for development. It is not accidental that it is 
actively supported by American politicians and experts close to 
the bloc's leadership. More, certain steps have already been 
made in that direction: throughout 1992 NATO representatives 
were involved as intermediaries in negotiations between Armenia 
and Azerbaijan over the Nagorny Karabakh problem[.sup]12[/]. 
Here the concept of "integration" is interpreted very broadly, 
not only in the military-political sense, but in the 
historical-philosophical as well: NATO is seen as a mechanism 
facilitating the modernization of societies, the overcoming of 
nationalism, the formation of new political elites, 
etc.[.sup]13[/] 
  Historically, four models of integrating individual states 
into NATO's political and military mechanisms have already 
formed. The first (the "German" model) presumes complete 
integration of a state's armed forces in NATO structures. The 
second ("French") model, on the contrary, is restricted to 
political cooperation while retaining complete independence in 
the military sphere, which does not preclude consultations and 
collaboration on specific military issues. The third ("NATO" 
model, which applies to most of the other European NATO members) 
provides for subordinating the greater part of national 
contingents to the NATO joint command in case of war or a major 
crises, while retaining autonomy in military planning, command 
and control in peacetime. Finally, the fourth ("American") model 
provides for allocating a smaller portion of national forces 
(deployed in Europe) to the joint NATO command, with a 
commitment to place approximately one-half the national forces 
deployed in other regions of the world under it. 
  Which of those models is applicable to Russia? The most 
conservative authors consider that the most plausible, at least 
in the foreseeable future, is the "French" model of integration, 
since any other would require too much painful restructuring 
within NATO. Besides, exponents of this point of view note, at 
present Russia is not ready for closer ties with NATO; like 
France in the 60s and 70s, it must go through a period of 
nationalism (if even in moderate and nonaggressive form), 
including in foreign and defense policies. Only after 10 or 20 
years would it be appropriate to speak of Russia's full 
integration into NATO political and military institutions. 
  The "American" model also has its supporters. They note a 
certain "symmetry" in the location of America and Russia 
vis-a-vis the European continent. Since Russia, like the U.S., 
is not a purely European power and its strategic interests 
extend to other regions of the world, it is hardly worth 
insisting on total geographic integration. On the other hand, 
the other old, and possibly new, NATO members are hardly 
interested in automatically making any commitments with regard 
to the southern and eastern borders of the Russian Federation. 
  At the same time, from the point of view of the interests of 
strategic and political stability in Europe, both the "French" 
and "American" variants of the integration of Russia may prove 
inadequate. In the final analysis, the main problem of Russian 
foreign policy in Europe is not a shortage of political links 
with the West but the fact that most of Russia's immediate 
western neighbors, both former soviet republics and in Central 
Europe, view Russia as a potential threat to their security and 
even existence. One may argue over how justified such fears are 
and whether it is legitimate to regard Russia as a direct 
successor of imperial policies. But one cannot deny the 
existence of distrust and suspicion in the capitals of 
neighboring states with regard to Moscow's policies. 
  In that sense the problem of Russian integration into the 
Western security system indeed has much in common with the 
problem of integrating West Germany into NATO in the 1950s. 
Germany after World War II, like Russia today, was faced with 
distrust and suspicion on the part of its immediate neighbors, 
which, actually, was what required the development of a special 
"German" model of integration. It was precisely the complete 
integration of Germany into the North Atlantic alliance, the 
"dissolution" of the Bundeswer in NATO structures, that made it 
possible to overcome anti-German fears and suspicions in Western 
Europe. 
  It is hard to imagine that the "German" model of the 1950s 
could be literally copied for Russia in the 1990s, if only 
because Russia is not a conquered and occupied country, its 
sovereignty is not restricted, and its war machine is far from 
destroyed. But if we are speaking of incorporating Russia into 
NATO, such an inclusion would be politically significant only if 
it were comprehensive and far-reaching. The higher the degree of 
internationalization of Russian armed forces, the easier it will 
be for Russia to resolve its political problems with its 
immediate neighbors. 
  In the view of proponents of the integration of Russia and 
other CIS members into NATO structures, an additional incentive 
for them could be a proposal to create a single 
American-European-Russian market of weapons and military 
technologies, in which Russia and Ukraine would occupy a worthy 
place. Such a market would envisage standardization of basic 
types of weapons, the removal of restrictions to the access of 
former soviet republics to Western military technologies, the 
adoption of uniform rules of producer competition in the 
framework of a common market, creating a system for controlling 
exports of military technologies to developing nations, etc. In 
addition, as noted before, in a NATO framework it would be 
possible to coordinate efforts to convert military enterprises, 
in the sphere of political and military intelligence, and also 
to develop and deploy a multilateral system of strategic 
antimissile defense. 
  Radical restructuring of NATO, changing the composition and 
functions of this military-political alliance, and the creation 
of new mechanisms and institutes--all this raises the question 
of revising the North Atlantic treaty. Indeed, the necessary 
changes are so great that they could hardly be codified in 
several new protocols supplementing the 1949 treaty. New 
negotiations, a new treaty and, perhaps, even a new name for 
NATO would seem preferable for a number of reasons. Firstly, 
such an undertaking would be a clear demonstration that both 
West and East are ready for really radical changes. Secondly, 
negotiations would make possible a frank discussion of problems 
unrelated to the legacy of the Cold War. Thirdly, they would 
involve states truly interested in creating a security system in 
Europe, while those NATO members which favor preserving the 
status quo would not be able to prevent the signing of a new 
treaty. 
  At the same time, such negotiations and a new treaty also 
have some drawbacks. First of all, a break with the old North 
Atlantic treaty would signify a rejection of established 
traditions. For all its shortcomings, NATO enjoys a certain 
legitimacy which may not necessarily be inherited by a new 
organization. Furthermore, the current international situation 
(the end of the Cold War, acute economic conflicts between the 
U.S. and Western Europe, isolationist trends on both sides of 
the Atlantic) do not contribute to the acceptance of rigid 
binding documents by the participants in future negotiations. In 
such circumstances the new treaty could prove to be a step back 
rather than forward. This problem could be resolved if the 
parties to the negotiations committed themselves in advance to 
preserving the basic principles of the NATO alliance in a future 
treaty. 
  However, this variant of Western strategy gives rise to 
serious objections, including from experts close to the current 
Democratic administration. On the one hand, it is not hard to 
predict that the U.S. and NATO will try to avoid providing any 
reliable security guarantees to the countries of Central and 
Eastern Europe so as to avoid being drawn into a conflict 
against their will. It should be said that historically the U.S. 
has always carefully selected its military-political allies and 
allowed various interpretations of the concept "allied 
relations." The tendency toward more restrictive interpretations 
clearly took the upper hand after the American defeat in 
Vietnam, when President Nixon identified the group of U.S. 
allies for which Washington was "prepared to fight." That 
privileged group included the members of NATO and the ANZUS 
bloc, Japan and Israel. These are the allies which can be viewed 
as full-blooded military-political partners of the U.S. All 
others would be more correctly characterized as aid recipients, 
as clients belonging to the zone of American influence. The U.S. 
has especially many such semi-allies in its own hemisphere (for 
example, the OAS, countries that signed the Rio de Janeiro 
Treaty in 1947), as well as in Asia (South Korea, Taiwan, the 
Philippines, Thailand, Singapore). 
  Equally apparent is the rigid hierarchy of 
military-political 
alliances to which the U.S. belongs. Thus, it is apparent even 
from diplomatic rhetoric that the Rio de Janeiro Treaty does not 
rank among priority links like the North Atlantic alliance or 
the American-Japanese treaty. A graphic example of the practical 
choices of American diplomacy was the Falkland crisis, when 
prior to the active phase of the conflict the U.S. expressed 
allied sympathies with both Great Britain and Argentina, but 
during the conflict itself unequivocally sided with the former. 
It is obvious that with respect to the former republics of the 
Soviet Union the U.S. will seek to apply the second model of 
allied relations which, in particular, provides no guarantees of 
automatic military help in crisis situations. 
  But even if it provided such guarantees NATO would hardly be 
capable of convincingly confirming their veracity. (We could 
recall the years of debate between Western Europe and the U.S. 
concerning the reliability of American security guarantees to 
Europe; throughout the entire Cold War American leaders were 
never able to fully convince their West-European colleagues that 
U.S. security was inseparable from the security of its NATO 
partners.) Furthermore, the new role of the U.S in NATO and 
NATO's new role in the world is still an open question, and the 
integration of new states into the system of Atlantic relations 
may complicate its solution even more. 
  The transformation of NATO into an embryo of a new security 
system for Europe is also being criticized from another aspect: 
the phases of integrating East-European countries remain 
unclear, as well as the criteria to be used in selecting 
candidates. If in the first phase NATO were to include countries 
from Central Europe, the former republics of the USSR could 
justifiably claim discrimination. If in the second phase the 
alliance were joined by Ukraine, Belarus and the Baltic states, 
then Russia would be in a highly vulnerable geostrategic 
situation. If progress in democratization and movement towards a 
market economy are adopted as criteria the political landscape 
of Europe may acquire the weird shape of an incorrectly 
assembled child's jigsaw puzzle. In addition, selective 
participation of countries of Eastern and Central Europe in NATO 
could indirectly provoke new conflicts on the continent. For 
example, if Hungary became a NATO member while Rumania did not, 
Budapest could doubtlessly be tempted to take advantage of its 
new status and the institutional support of the West to increase 
pressure on Bucharest concerning the issue of Transylvania. 
Selective inclusion in NATO of individual republics of the 
former Yugoslavia is also capable of changing the balance of 
forces in the Balkans, with possible negative consequences. 
  Finally, it is extremely doubtful that NATO can radically 
expand its zone of responsibility in the east of the continent, 
to include such distant areas as, say, the Caucasus or Central 
Asia. According to optimists, NATO's reaction to the Persian 
Gulf crisis in 1990-1991 could serve as a model for other crisis 
situations, including on the territory of the former USSR. 
Indeed, when NATO policy towards the Iraq-Kuwait crisis was 
being formulated none of the alliance members had any 
reservations about participating in a confrontation not 
associated with the Warsaw Pact organization. More, all members 
stressed the need to display a united front, using the NATO 
infrastructure in place in Europe. This was all the more 
significant as the U.S. and its European allies had frequently 
clashed over so-called security interests outside the "NATO 
zone." West-European allies have traditionally opposed 
Washington's attempts to expand NATO's role beyond its charter 
tasks. 
  It would, however, hardly be right to draw any conclusions 
regarding NATO's capabilities in Eurasia or even in Central 
Europe from this experience. The Persian Gulf crisis was in many 
ways a unique case, when the strategic and economic interests of 
the leading Western powers coincided, it was possible to gain, 
as a minimum, favorable neutrality on the part of Moscow, 
achieve unity in the UN Security Council, clearly define 
military objectives, and conduct the military operation in the 
shortest possible time. None of these conditions will be present 
in potential conflicts in post-soviet territories. The economic 
and strategic interests of the U.S. and Western Europe will not 
coincide (for example, in the Caucasus and some Central Asian 
countries they may not be apparent at all), Russia will take a 
position of its own, which will in large measure determine 
NATO's capabilities, there may be no clearcut military goals, 
and instead of a quick war one may expect protracted 
"low-intensity conflicts." In fact, the Yugoslavian experience 
(the apparent inability of NATO to influence events in the 
country despite their impact on the strategic security interests 
of at least two of its members, Greece and Turkey) is in most of 
its parameters much more applicable to the CIS than the 
experience of the Gulf war[.sup]14[/]. 
  Besides, the idea of expanding the "NATO zone" clashes with 
trends towards strengthening the role and significance of the UN 
Charter, which are increasingly manifest in today's 
international relations and gaining growing support in Europe 
and the world. Extension beyond the sphere of the NATO mandate 
is a violation of provisions of the UN Charter regarding the 
right to regional defense and the creation of regional security 
organizations. More importantly, it is getting harder and harder 
to define where the "NATO zone" ends. If Russia became the 
bloc's eastern frontier, like Germany was during the Cold War, 
and the "NATO zone" was extended to the Pacific Ocean, the bloc 
would objectively acquire an anti-Chinese and anti-Islamic 
aspect, which hardly corresponds with U.S. objectives. 
  It is hardly accidental that in late 1993 it was Washington 
that actively resisted attempts of some West-European countries 
to consider the question of giving Poland, Hungary and the Czech 
Republic NATO membership and appealed to its partners to make 
greater use of other mechanisms to integrate the East-European 
nations into Western security systems, in particular, CSCE and 
UN mechanisms.

security guarantees for countries of Central and Eastern Europe; 
3) Discussion of nonmilitary problems of transatlantic 
relations; 4) Securing a place for united Germany in the system 
of Western democracies; 5) Maintaining an "insurance mechanism" 
in case of a rebirth of Russian expansionism; 6) Maintaining an 
infrastructure to support operations outside the area of NATO 
responsibility, for example, the Middle East; 7) Development of 
instruments to prevent nuclear catastrophes and minimize their

<F P=106> [Article by Valentin Vasilets: "The Diplomatic Conference in </F>
Vladivostok"] 
  [Text] On March 14 a diplomatic conference took place 
in Vladivostok at the bedside of a patient who had started to 
develop an ailment--Russian-American relations. The necessity 
for the consultation was evident: For a number of weeks already, 
on both sides of the Atlantic--in the American, European and 
Russian press--a great deal has been said about the noticeable 
deterioration in the health of this "patient", who became the 
victim of the collateral consequences of the espionage horrors 
and the, in the opinion of the West, too independent initiative 
of Moscow in Yugoslavia. 
  In Washington people simultaneously took offense and were 
distressed. They took offense when they discovered a Russian spy 
in the CIA. They were distressed since the Kremlin did not even 
consult with the White House in taking decisive steps in regard 
to the guarantee of the security of Sarajevo. However, Russian 
Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev, who met on the Far 
East shore with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, saw 
the problem in a different light: The signs of disharmony that 
called forth alarm are only growing pains. Moscow realized that 
it should not play in world affairs the role of the "younger 
brother" of the United States, which the creators of policy in 
Washington regarded as quite suitable for the former superpower. 
The Kremlin clearly declared its equality. Before the beginning 
of the talks, Andrey Kozyrev told an ITAR-TASS correspondent: 
"We are conducting this meeting at the remote edge of our land 
and we will hold talks from the positions of mature strategic 
partnership." Very likely, "mature partnership" are the key 
words that determined the position of the Russian side. In 
Vladivostok it had to be clarified how the Americans view this 
declaration. 
  The prelude to the negotiations--a visit by Kozyrev to the 
anti-submarine ship "Admiral Panteleyev"--is also perceived as a 
demonstration of the justification of the Russian claims. Here 
the minister uttered all the words necessary for the occasion. 
"A fleet," he declared, is one of the most powerful and flexible 
instruments of statehood." The guest of the Far East sailors 
spoke for the expansion of the Russian presence in the World 
Ocean, having added that "in so doing our partners will only 
respect us more." Vice-Admiral Igor Khmelnov, who received the 
minister, picked up the subject, having mentioned that this ship 
completed a cruise in the Persian Gulf and cooperated there with 
ships of the United States naval forces. In the words of the 
admiral, the exercises confirmed that "the military technology 
and training of our ships is not at all worse than among the 
Americans." 
  Christopher flew to Vladivostok a bit downcast. The day 
before he had held talks in Beijing that had proceeded in a 
rather harsh tone. Psychologically, the U.S. secretary of state, 
it seems, was ready to listen more favorably to Russian 
independence considerations: What diplomat will assume 
responsibility for the deterioration of relations with two great 
powers in the course of one trip! Although, of course, 
Christopher in the main followed the scenario worked out 
earlier. In the words of a WASHINGTON POST correspondent who had 
flown to Vladivostok, Christopher cautioned Kozyrev against 
"uncoordinated actions" that could have an impact on the Mideast 
peace process. 
  According to information of a NEW YORK TIMES correspondent, 
the secretary of state made it clear to Kozyrev that "the United 
States does not perceive Moscow's actions as something natural 
and tried to dissuade him from too independent steps in such 
regions as Bosnia and Hercegovina, as well as the Near East." In 
his turn, Kozyrev explained that Russia cannot be kept on the 
sidelines when global problems are decided. 
  Among correspondents, however, the impression was created 
that the discussion was quite civilized, because Christopher 
understands very well when Washington will act jointly with 
Moscow and thereby will reserve for itself the possibility of 
influencing the policy of its partner. It seems that Kozyrev, 
too, had no reasons for rejecting the American proposal with 
respect to a fuller exchange of information and consultations. 
  Moreover, the Russian minister took away from Vladivostok a 
number of tangible confirmations of the readiness of the United 
States for "mature partnership." I have in mind, above all, the 
agreement of the Americans to Russia's participation in the work 
of the Coordination Committee for the Control of Arms Exports 
(COCOM). This organization in its time was created basically for 
the purpose of blocking the Soviet Union's access to Western 
technology. Kozyrev was also "completely satisfied" with the 
United States position on the transformation of the "Big Seven" 
into the "Big Eight" leading states through the inclusion of 
Russia. In short, Christopher and Kozyrev agreed that there are 
no serious threats to the health of the patient, and after 
Vladivostok he will recover completely. "Mature partnership" 
does not exclude disagreements, but there is no need to draw 
far-reaching conclusions from them.

<F P=106> [Interview with Nikolay Grigoryevich Zaytsev, former deputy </F>
director of the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of Latin 
America and now trade representative to Mexico, conducted by 
Vladimir Krestyaninov, the journal's editor in chief; date and 
place not given] 
  [Text] In late 1993, Nikolay Zaytsev, who for several 
years held the post of deputy director of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences Institute of Latin America, was appointed trade 
representative to Mexico. On the eve of his departure, he 
visited the journal's editorial office and answered the 
questions of editor in chief Vladimir Krestyaninov. 
  [Krestyaninov] You, Nikolay Grigoryevich, are a doctor of 
sciences and an economist who has worked in the Academy of 
Sciences system and is suddenly leaving for the foreign trade 
sphere. What is the reason? 
  [Zaytsev] Mr. editor in chief, there is no secret here and 
it 
can seem strange only superficially. Now is generally a time of 
surprise appointments, but as for me, up to now I have 
considered myself a cadre foreign trade employee: my first job 
was the Ministry of Foreign Trade. Specifically I was involved 
in the problems of Cuba and Latin America. My work in 
Switzerland was also connected to foreign trade. I do not think 
that I am leaving academic activity, and academic regalia will 
not be an obstacle. I am simply returning to what I began with, 
and I am traveling to work in Mexico with a good, business-like 
attitude. 
  [Krestyaninov] In your opinion, what is the level of 
Russia's 
trade-economic ties with Mexico as of today? 
  [Zaytsev] I cannot answer that question unequivocally. 
Traditionally the flow of goods in the two directions was 
relatively small. The situation has been the same in recent 
years. The volumes of trade are no more than 40-50 million 
dollars, which is not much for countries like Mexico and Russia. 
But it is noteworthy that in recent years very interesting 
contracts have been signed to supply sets of equipment from the 
former Soviet Union, from Russia now, and from a number of other 
CIS republics, above all Ukraine. These deliveries are 
concentrated in the power engineering sphere. Russian companies 
are exporting equipment for large GES's [hydroelectric power 
station] which are being built in Mexico. There are also 
deliveries for other energy installations. We have good 
prospects for the incursion of other types of equipment; among 
others Khimmasheksport [Chemical Machine Export] is actively 
working on this market. A contract for exporting equipment to 
produce prussic acid has been signed and is being realized. A 
contract for assembling tractors produced at the Lipetsk and 
Vladimir plants continues to be realized, though not at as rapid 
a rate as before. These machines are the same ones which were in 
demand in Mexico back in the 1970s, although the market, I 
repeat, is complex and practically no operations to ship 
components to assemble them have been carried out this year. 
There is also some progress in such directions as deliveries of 
aviation equipment--above all helicopters--and Ural trucks, 
which may also arouse the interest of Mexican buyers. Although 
it must be admitted that this was done in previous years. 
  As for imports, instead of a number of the traditional 
Mexican goods, we continue to buy large batches of pipe. The 
import of particular types of consumer goods like coffee, above 
all instant, cigarettes, and certain other goods is being 
expanded. And characteristically, this is being done to a 
significant degree by independent commercial structures. 
  [Krestyaninov] Will the signing of NAFTA in some way help 
or, 
on the contrary, hinder the development of our ties? 
  [Zaytsev] That is a very interesting question. You know, I 
think that 17 November, that is, the day when American 
legislators in fact responded positively to the North American 
Free Trade Agreement, will determine the development of 
economics and politics in the northern part of America for the 
long-term perspective. And, of course, NAFTA will both directly 
and indirectly affect Russia's interests, and I may be wrong, 
but it is more likely to be negatively. Serious additional 
competition may appear for us in the United States and Canada 
for a number of those goods which we can still move and are 
moving onto those markets. In the medium term, as our economy is 
normalized and becomes more competitive in terms of realizing 
international deals, I think that NAFTA must be treated as a 
kind of given. Undoubtedly this bloc is not closed but half 
open, and I assume that in the future one could in fact conceive 
of categories for setting up particular competitive production 
facilities, say, on Mexico's territory, like the "maquiladoras," 
in order later to move this output onto the markets of the 
United States and Canada. And there are already some concrete 
proposals in this direction. Among others, those small 
production facilities which we have, in Canada for example, I 
think could in time be more profitable in Mexico and could 
support commercial interests in the entire subregion. I repeat 
that this question has not yet been raised on the practical 
level. So one of the first tasks for me right away will be to 
figure out seriously and in detail what this means for Russia's 
foreign economic interests. 
  [Krestyaninov] But in addition to that, what in your opinion 
hinders the more serious development of our trade-economic ties 
today? 
  [Zaytsev] I think there are traditional obstacles of an 
objective nature and some new difficulties. As for the 
traditional factors, I think that all the same I must 
unequivocally say that Mexico and the Soviet Union and Mexico 
and Russia have essentially never opened their doors to one 
another and have not even tried to. Mexico is traditionally 
oriented to the northern market, that is understandable. But its 
policy of diversification of foreign-economic ties is notable, 
even with the signing of NAFTA, and I think that even Russia 
will sooner or later but inevitably be included in it. And on 
our part, the new entrepreneurial circles have not yet marked 
the position which Mexico will take in their export and import 
strategy or in the movement and attraction of foreign 
investments. In my understanding, this country is no longer a 
traditional developing state. In the past 5-6 years, in 
conditions of very great economic difficulties, Mexico was able 
to realize an exceptionally powerful set of structural 
transformations. Today Mexico has a modern infrastructure and 
competitive industry and has every possibility of another leap 
into the future. I do not think that a Latin American "tiger" 
such as Mexico should escape our attention. 
  Among the difficulties of a traditional nature I would add 
distance, since what can be saved or lost on freight is quite 
important. I will also mention the circumstance that by no means 
do we always have adequate potential to finance export-import 
transactions. 
  As for difficulties related directly to the present stage, 
the instability of our economic situation must be singled out of 
course. I mean those problems which we still have and sometimes 
are even accelerating on the level of realizing foreign economic 
operations, including a weak legislative base and the 
inexperience of some new commercial organizations, which for now 
are not always qualified to work on the new markets. But I 
believe it is unproductive to speak only of difficulties. I 
would raise the question above all of the possibility of and 
need to assist Russian and Mexican entrepreneurs find one 
another, since up to now a certain number of trade operations 
have not been conducted directly but through third countries. 
  [Krestyaninov] But apparently our legislation does not allow 
us to establish serious cooperation either? 
  [Zaytsev] Absolutely, although we are more viable and our 
foreign trade organizations now are in the process of preparing 
to work in the new conditions. I have had meetings and contacts 
with 35-40 Russian foreign trade associations and banks, not to 
mention talks in the Ministry itself. And it seems to me that 
foreign economic enthusiasm is fairly strong among 
entrepreneurs. If domestic matters are arranged, I think the 
Russian mind will lay and already is laying a unique path. 
  [Krestyaninov] Our entrepreneurs have very little 
information 
on what Mexico is like and what Mexican goods are like. 
  [Zaytsev] I agree with that absolutely. 
  [Krestyaninov] That obviously applies to conditions for 
importing them too. 
  [Zaytsev] And both the Ministry of Foreign Economic 
Relations 
and the trade representation are to blame for that, I believe. 
Tuning up information channels should be one of the most 
important tasks. But on the other hand, it seems to me that for 
now Russia's entrepreneurial circles are still unaware of the 
unique possibilities for realizing their own interests they can 
obtain by cooperating closely with the trade representatives' 
apparat. To be honest, that disturbs me, since very often they 
go right out and find unreliable firms and frequently get 
"burned," while the trade representations were in fact created 
for that very reason, to find reliable partners and provide 
information on markets. Trade representatives send an enormous 
flow of information to Russia but, unfortunately, it by no means 
always finds the consumer.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Vladimirovich Kuzmishchev, scientific </F>
associate of the RAS [Russian Academy of Sciences] Institute of 
Comparative Political Studies and candidate in historical 
sciences: "Latin America, Which We Are Losing"] 
  [Text] Back in the time when the Russian MFA [Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs] was making its first efforts to formulate our 
country's foreign political doctrine (end of 1992), its 
leadership held a series of scientific-practical seminars on 
regional--including Latin American--problems. Representatives of 
the community and scientific circles were invited to these 
seminars. As a participant in this measure, I can bear witness 
to the fact that, at the general conference summarizing these 
seminars, the words "Latin America" were never once pronounced. 
  They generally appear in the speeches of our country's 
politicians and leading officials only for comparison with the 
situation in Russia. Either these are examples of the fruits of 
authoritarianism, which are so attractive to certain proponents 
of "Democratic Russia," or they are passionate assurances of the 
fact that our country is not some kind of "banana" republic. 
This image is especially popular among the national-patriots and 
communists. For the sake of fairness, I will note that similar 
motifs slip through from time to time also in the speeches of 
rather highly placed officials, evoking puzzlement among Latin 
American diplomats. 
  Recalling all the official actions of the Russian Federation 
in regard to Latin America for the period since August of 1991, 
it is easy to note that they have in fact been disavowed by life 
itself. I am referring to the visits by Vice President A. V. 
Rutskoy to a number of South American countries, and the trip of 
the MVES [Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations] delegates 
along the same route. As well as the Supreme Soviet's creation 
of groups for developing policy in regard to several of the 
leading Latin American states. 
  Rutskoy is currently in Lefortov. Former MVES Minister S. A. 
Glazev has fallen into disgrace. The Supreme Soviet has been 
disbanded. As for Russian-Latin American relations, they have 
never gotten off the ground. We might add, how many months has 
Russia not had an ambassador to Mexico? And how long have our 
ambassadors to Equador and Argentina not been appointed? 
  It seems that they do not give much thought to this in the 
"heights" on Smolensk Square. The foreign political course of 
its masters rests on two supports, one of which is the strategic 
cooperation with the USA, and the other--the geopolitical 
position of Russia with the "nuances" (Europe? Asia? Eurasia? 
Of, perhaps, Asiope?) We are being pulled into the "common 
European house." We long to become the eighth in the "big 
seven." We are bewitched by the Asia-Pacific region. And we 
cannot avoid the problems of the "near abroad." 
  However, Realpolitik dictates to Russia its place in the 
current world. It is not so much that we are going to the 
"common European house" as Eastern Europe is drifting toward 
NATO. The Soviet legacy in Asia and Africa is confidently being 
picked up by the PCR [People's Republic of China], assuming the 
role of patron of the belittled and the insulted. Especially in 
the Arab East. In general, the collapse of the Soviet Union as a 
super power has created an unfavorable moral climate for Russia 
everywhere in the Old World. The reasons for this are varied. In 
some places they are happy about the removal of a potentially 
powerful competitor. There is also an abundance of small 
predators, ready to grab from us anything that is not nailed 
down. There are also those who accuse the "Russians" of 
traitorship. 
  Today only in Latin America the word "Russian," which was 
always synonymous with "Soviet," does not evoke the reaction of 
detachment either in the mass consciousness or among the local 
ruling circles. The fact is that, first of all, in the political 
culture of the countries in this region, the role of the "bad 
boy" has historically belonged to Washington. Secondly, the 
Soviet period of our country's history gave Moscow the image of 
an antagonist of the United States, which we are shedding with 
such difficulty. We might add that many countries do not want us 
to depart from it. No myths, nor, we might add, the realities of 
the times of the Comintern [Communist International], the Cold 
War, the arms race, etc., can hide the fact that the Latin 
American establishment has always been ready to cooperate with 
the Kremlin over the ideological barriers, even the infamous 
Pinochet's Chile. With the beginning of perestroyka, the 
de-ideologization of Soviet foreign policy has only strengthened 
this tendency. An unpleasant surprise, and not only for the 
local communists, was Gorbachev's implementation of the 
little-understood course in regard to Latin America. This was 
particularly manifested in the course of his official visit to 
Cuba in 1988 (Mikhail Sergeyevich personally reaped the fruits 
of such a policy during his scandalously failed lecture visit to 
Argentina and Chile and 1993). 
  The Latin Americans certainly did not write off our hasty 
"divorce" from Havana as a trait of the famous unfathomable 
nature of the Russian soul. And Shevardnadze's anti-Sandinista 
passes had zero success, since the masters of Managua at that 
time knew perfectly well about the content of the 
Soviet-American talks in London on the Nicaragua problem. They 
bravely undertook the fulfillment of all that we had promised 
the U.S. State Department, since... they intended to do nothing. 
And that is just what they did. It was 1989, and the 
international department of the CPSU Central Committee had grown 
tired of explaining to our "friends" that the "lean times" had 
arrived... 
  However, despite all this, the reserve of good deeds 
accumulated during the Soviet era was so great that even 
Gorbachev and Shevardnadze, these two great dilettantes, could 
not exhaust them. Many thousands of Latin Americans, who had 
received their education in our country in their better youthful 
years, had taken with them forever in their hearts not only 
their love for their first Russian girl, but also similar, 
although more complex, feelings for our homeland. In the last 30 
years, these former students became the backbone of the local 
elite, became leading millionaire-entrepreneurs, well-known 
leaders in science and culture, ministers and ambassadors. And 
they are returning to us, sent by their governments or guided by 
business interests, but never having lost their deep personal 
sympathies for our country. 
  This is but one of the factors favoring Russian 
Latin-American policy which cannot be overlooked. 
  Naturally, there are also other, more material factors. They 
are well known. Latin America remains a solvent market for our 
industrial production. Many light industry goods from the Latin 
American countries are quite suitable for the Russian consumer, 
not to mention the so-called colonial goods (coffee, cocoa, 
citrus fruits, etc.). 
  Russia as a resource donor has not only competitive 
relations 
with the states of Latin America in this sphere, but also common 
interests. In general, we must admit that in the "North-South" 
dialogue the place of Russian hyperboreans is next to the Latin 
Americans. On one hand, they identify themselves with the values 
of Christian civilization. On the other, they clearly feel like 
outsiders in the world arena and strive to overcome this. But 
they do not have that colonial experience of Asia and Africa 
which presupposes the non-acceptance of the "white man" as such. 
Even the Cuban soldiers and specialists in Angola, Ethiopia and 
other African countries (not to mention Asia, and specifically 
South Yemen), despite the racial closeness, were considered by 
the local population to be kind people, but nevertheless 
outsiders, "colonialists." It is rather characteristic that the 
former clientele of the CPSU in Latin America is more 
successfully being "picked up" not by the Chinese, but by the 
Arabs from the Near East (for example, Iraq and Libya--through 
the Palestinian movement--in Central America, Columbia and 
Peru). The Levantine ethno-cultural amalgam, like any other, is 
functional. 
  The foreign policy of any state depends not only on its 
material capacities and needs, but also on the presence of 
domestic decisiveness, as well as a favorable moral climate in 
that country or region where it intends to implement its 
political line. So far, I have tried to prove that it is 
specifically Latin America which is of particular interest to 
Russia, since there is clearly a mutual material interest and a 
favorable moral climate for our country's diplomacy. As for 
domestic decisiveness, here things are somewhat more complex. We 
must say, it is quite significant that we possess a great 
intellectual potential as specialists in Latin American studies. 
First of all, there is the Latin America Institute of the 
Russian Academy of Sciences, which after a short period of 
vegetation and fruitless efforts to "enter the market" changed 
over to the study of the region from the point of view of 
Russian interests. The journal, LATINSKAYA AMERIKA, has also 
been retained--almost the only one of the academic analogs, and 
has become standard reference reading in many foreign embassies 
in Moscow. The RAS Institute of General History has an operating 
Latin American Center, whose works are better known abroad than 
they are in our country. Latin America specialists from the 
academic Institute of Archeology are world renowned. And now I 
would like to explain what relation our Latin American studies 
have to Russian foreign policy. 
  At one time long ago, toward the end of the middle ages, 
first the merchant and missionary went to open new horizons for 
their homeland, and then the warrior. In our time, the state, 
which must once again open up the world for itself, needs a 
different triad. First must come the highly skilled scientist, 
whose in-depth knowledge of the country where he is sent is one 
form of respect shown toward it, as well as an invitation to 
dialogue. Then it is the diplomat's turn, who gives the dialogue 
a constant character and facilitates the creation of a favorable 
climate, without which business people would have to break 
through thousands of obstacles. 
  Obviously, there is no need to explain all this to the 
Russian Latin America specialists. But if suddenly this article 
falls into the hands of those who make the decisions, it would 
be useful for them to learn how this is already today being done 
in France. For Paris, Latin America today, when there is a 
struggle going on for supremacy in the European union, is a new 
horizon, representing a desire to strengthen its positions in 
the Old World by means of extending the Latin American 
"shoulder" of French diplomacy. 
  The first step toward this was made in France by increasing 
the financing of the appropriate research centers and by 
attracting young people to them. 
  In our country, as we know, it is almost impossible to 
retain 
already trained cadres. Therefore, we must especially value the 
heroic efforts of MGIMO [Moscow State Institute of International 
Relations], which developed its Latin America Center for the 
training of new generations of professionals. A good initiative 
has been the allocation by the International Fund "New 
World--500" (whose president is Moscow Mayor Yu. M. Luzhkov) of 
a prize in the form of an increased 6-month stipend for the best 
MGIMO student engaged in the study of Latin American 
problematics. 
  We would like to believe that certain changes are also 
taking 
place in our MFA in its approach to Latin America. In any case, 
the recently held meeting of Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs 
G. S. Mamedov with Russian entrepreneurs and representatives of 
public organizations operating in the Latin American direction 
instills some hope. The high-ranking Russian official asked his 
fellow citizens, simply and openly, how his department can help 
their endeavors in the more distant abroad. You must agree, we 
do not often hear this from the authorities. 
  The only thing that jarred us a bit was the reference to 
U.S. 
President Bill Clinton as some kind of standard: He too, 
protects "his own," they said. And once again we recalled the 
two pillars of our foreign policy... And also about those Latin 
American entrepreneurs who begin business negotiations with 
statements to the effect that they want to force out of their 
markets the North American goods which enslave them, and 
therefore are ready to buy Russian products of the same quality, 
but... for next to nothing. Moreover, they are sure that we, as 
before, will take the ideological bait. 
  But while we can understand these Latin American merchants 
who have not yet recognized the changes in the direction of 
common sense which have taken place in our country, some of 
their fellow countrymen I simply refuse to understand. First one 
of them writes that Washington has turned its back on Latin 
America. And this at a moment when, thanks to the signing of the 
Free Trade Agreement, the words "United States of America" first 
begin to take on real content. Then another places his signature 
under the development of the "Gorbachev Fund" on the prospects 
of Russian policy in the Asia-Pacific region, where Latin 
America has been long forgotten. True, this forgetfulness is 
explained in the footnotes. But why is it that neither Japan, 
nor South Korea, nor Taiwan, nor the PRC suffer from it. 
Instead, they become ever more stubbornly involved in that very 
same Mexico, even as it is pulled ever more strongly into and 
ground up by the integration within the framework of the North 
American free trade zone. Not to mention Chile and the other 
Latin American countries bordering on the Pacific Ocean. Or even 
those not bordering it. Those who have been to Argentina, 
Brazil, Uruguay and Venezuela can tell us much about this. 
  It is even more difficult to understand such opinions 
expressed by our country's specialists when we familiarize 
ourselves with the speeches of the U.S. President, filled with 
the pathos of unification, during his meeting with the heads of 
state and governments of Central America and the Caribbean, or 
those of Vice President Gore in Mexico. 
  We would like to conclude these somewhat confused notes with 
some general arguments. The author is not so naive that he does 
not notice the real state of affairs in our homeland. "No 
money," the British said at one time, and tried to forget that 
they do not have the power for a policy not only "to the east of 
Suez," but much more west of that. There does not exist in 
nature that main link which, if we pull it, we can pull out from 
the quagmire the entire load of Russian problems, either in the 
economy, or in domestic policy, or in foreign. And if someone 
has decided that an active Latin American course pursued by 
Moscow can be such a link, then he has wasted precious time in 
reading this article. However, complete elimination of the Latin 
American component from Russian foreign policy would mean the 
creation of an initially detrimental foreign political facade of 
the Russian Federation.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Bovin, Russian Federation </F>
ambassador to Israel, by Valeriy Dzhalagoniya and Aleksandr 
Zhudro in Tel-Aviv; date not specified: "Will We Live To See 
Democracy?" ] 
  [Text] The ambassador of the Russian Federation in 
Israel, Aleksandr Bovin, is sitting deeply submerged in a 
leather arm chair under a large portrait of Boris Yeltsin. On 
the pier of the office there is a smaller photograph: A laughing 
boy, who is fated to play a certain key role in our discussion. 
  Bovin, whom not so long ago we regularly saw on television 
as 
international commentator and read in the pages of IZVESTIYA, 
after having become a diplomat, has retained a striking 
resemblance to Balzac. A dashingly twirled moustache, hair to 
his shoulders, red suspenders. And, as before, he makes do 
without a tie. The wide-open collar does not violate protocol, 
since Israeli politicians also dress rather informally. 
  Having made the arrangements for the interview, we submitted 
our questions in written form, but we agreed that, when meeting 
in person, we can add to them. So that the interview took place, 
as it were, on two levels. 
  [EKHO PLANETY] You, Aleksandr Yevgenyevich, have always been 
known as a journalist with an opinion of his own, which 
frequently does not coincide with "the directions from 
above"--in a certain sense, a forerunner of glasnost. And here, 
when the Russian press received unprecedented freedom, 
diplomatic work tore you away from journalism. Do you regret 
this? Are you planning in time to return to the pen? And how do 
you assess from the sidelines, now already as a reader, the 
contemporary level of our press, and its place in the present 
unusual situation? 
  [Bovin] I have no regrets. It is difficult to be engaged in 
one and the same thing for 20 years. The freshness of perception 
is lost and the routine becomes oppressive. A change of 
occupation is like the departure for a new and unknown world. 
Moreover, in this case--into a world of interesting and 
attractive work. 
  I don't have to yearn for the pen. I am writing more 
frequently than in IZVESTIYA. Only the audience is a different 
one. Not 10 million, but 10 persons. 
  I do not intend to return to journalism. At my age, "in 
time" 
does not sound very optimistic. 
  I will not undertake to give an assessment of the Russian 
mass media, since I do not read all of them and not regularly. I 
try to follow the most interesting materials from IZVESTIYA, 
LITERATURKA [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA], NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, and 
MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI. It seems to me that in "the present unusual 
situation" these publications have found their unusual place. 
  [EKHO PLANETY] Millions of Russians and Russian-speaking 
people have in recent years found themselves outside the 
boundaries of Russia; moreover, it is by far not always able to 
protect their interests. This problem exists most acutely in the 
"near abroad", but, apparently, in its own way, it is no 
stranger in Israel. Who for you are Russian-speaking Israelis? A 
self-supporting person [as published]? Compatriots in need of 
assistance? A part of our Homeland, transferred to Israeli soil? 
And how do the emigrants regard you, the ambassador of Russia? 
  [Bovin] However strange it may be, but the people who were 
thrown out by Soviet society, driven out from the USSR, more 
correctly, by the circumstances reigning in it, who were 
slighted, insulted, and were called "traitors," and who turned 
up in Israel, in a country which for a quarter of a century has 
served as as "whipping boy," these people yearn for their, as 
they say here, "prehistoric Homeland," avidly follow the news 
from Russia, and support us. A great many retain Russian 
citizenship, and those who were deprived of it are trying to 
restore it. Hence--the relation to the ambassador of Russia, to 
the Russian embassy. 
  The growing into new soil, a new environment, is proceeding 
with difficulty. painfully, and slowly. One has to encounter 
dramas and sometimes also tragedies. Assistance, it goes without 
saying, is necessary. But these are already not so much the 
problems of the Russian ambassador as they are the problems of 
the Israeli government. 
  The embassy sees its task not in pushing aside, in cutting 
off, in chopping off, etc., but in preserving and strengthening 
the threads connecting "Russian" Jews with Russia. This 
corresponds to the principles of democracy and humanitarianism. 
This also corresponds to the interests of Russia, for it helps 
us to occupy stronger and more stable positions in Israel, and 
thus in the Near East as a whole. 
  [EKHO PLANETY] The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has 
been reproached for the lack of a firm policy in regard to the 
rights of the Russian population abroad. While an attempt to 
formulate such a policy has been made, this by no means pleased 
everyone. How do you perceive the attitude of the new Russia to 
the Russian-speaking population? 
  [Bovin] First of all, what we need is not a firm policy, but 
a sensible one. More precisely, a sensible [policy] (always) and 
a firm one (when necessary). Secondly, the development of such a 
policy is difficult and takes a long time. Not everything turns 
out at once, in the beginning vacillations and blunders are 
inevitable. Thirdly, our policy must, above all, please Russia 
and correspond to the interests of Russia. The Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, as far as I can judge, is actively developing 
such a policy. 
  Incidentally. If we can learn anything from the Americans, 
it 
is, above all, their attitude to their compatriots abroad. For 
the United States administration, every American is a "separate 
commodity" [shtuchnyy tovar], and every [American] can count on 
the fact that, at a difficult moment, "Uncle Sam" will come to 
his assistance. 
  Every citizen of Russia, every Russian person who is outside 
the borders of Russia, if he has not intentially harmed his 
country, if he has a clean conscience, must be convinced that he 
has a "strong home front." Some day this is how it will be. . . . 
  [EKHO PLANETY] After the sensational handshake of Yitzhak 
Rabin and Yasser Arafat, the Israeli-Palestinian dialogue all 
the same is moving with difficulty. Support for the agreements 
on the part of both Israelis and Palestinians is weakening. What 
is this--temporary difficulties, or signs of the possible 
failure of the entire peace process in the Near East? What is 
your Near East prognosis? Are you skeptical in regard to the 
possibility of a quick settlement in the region? 
  [Bovin] From a historical viewpoint, there are no permanent 
difficulties; all difficulties are temporary ones. And, 
therefore, sooner or later, the present difficulties will be 
overcome. And in this case, if we are talking about an 
all-encompassing, just, and stable settlement of Near East 
affairs, more likely later than sooner. 
  The movement along this long path will not be even. There 
will be break-throughs, understandings, and agreements. Already 
long ago, there was an agreement between Israel and Egypt. Soon 
a provisional agreement with the Palestinians will be signed. An 
agreement with Jordan is approaching. Even Syria has started to 
talk about peace. So that positive changes and great changes may 
come "sooner." 
  But when I think about Jerusalem, about the fate of the 
Golan 
Heights, and about the future of the 140,000 Jewish settlers 
living in the territories seized by Israel as the result of wars 
with its neighbors, when I think about the wall of hatred 
dividing Jews and Arabs, which is stronger and higher than the 
Berlin Wall, I cannot allow myself to remain within the confines 
of short-term and even medium-term prognoses. The difficulties, 
even if temporary, are enormous. One cannot but admire the 
courage of Yitzhak Rabin and the persistence of Shimon Peres, 
who, in spite of loud cries of protest, demonstrations, and 
appeals for active resistance, decided to break the course of 
history and to lead Israel out of the period of enmity, 
confrontation and war. The cause which they have begun are now 
engaged in will be brought to completion by the next generations 
of political leaders. But it is important to begin. . . . "Only 
that day dawns to which we are awake," said Henry [David] 
Thoreau. 
  [EKHO PLANETY] While in the Near East the hope appeared of 
disentangling the most protracted regional conflict, the 
relatively "young" conflicts in Karabakh, Abkhasia, and some 
other regions of the former Soviet Union stubbornly refuse to 
yield to a settlement. Shevardnadze, who did a lot to extricate 
the USSR from the Afghan quagmire, is unable to find a way out 
of the situation in his native Georgia. Are the methods and 
solutions approved by international practice applicable in 
general to the "hot spots" in the post-Soviet space? 
  [Bovin] There is very little practice in the "disentangling" 
of conflicts in the post-confrontation space. The first steps 
are being taken. And the steps are not always successful. I will 
recall only Somalia and Yugoslavia. And all the same, in 
studying the "hot spots" in the post-Soviet space, we have to 
look closely at the experience which the international community 
has gained. Remembering in so doing, it goes without saying, 
that our chief riches are not the bruises and bumps which the 
Americans inflicted on themselves in Somalia, for example, but 
those which we inflicted on ourselves in Karabakh or Abkhazia. 
No one will teach us if we ourselves do not want to learn. 
  [EKHO PLANETY] You have already studied Israel sufficiently 
well--a country where, to a certain extent, it proved possible 
realize the seemingly hopelessly utopian Zionist idea. What in 
the Israeli experience, positive as well as negative, could 
prove to be useful for Russia? 
  [Bovin] I am not very convinced that the founders of Zionism 
would perceive modern Israel and its way of life as the 
embodiment of the "Zionist idea." 
  As far as the "Israeli experience" is concerned, its 
positive 
aspects are connected with democracy and the socially oriented 
market economy. Towards which we are going, I hope. And the 
negative aspects are rooted in the domination of the 
bureaucrats, in the aspiration of the bureaucratic machine to 
influence all aspects of social life. Which, I hope, we are 
leaving behind us... 
  [EKHO PLANETY] With this, the "written" part of the 
interview 
came to an end; our subsequent discussion went on "live." 
Wanting to verify the correctness of our observations in Israel, 
one of the authors of this material, who had come in the rank of 
"guest from Moscow," put a number of "solo" questions to the 
Russian ambassador. 
  [EKHO PLANETY] In its time, the Soviet Union played a 
considerable part in the creation of the Israeli state, but then 
followed decades of unconditional support of the Arabs and an 
uncompromising struggle against Zionism. . . . Have both of 
these periods been retained in the historical memory of Israel, 
or only the second one? 
  [Bovin] Undoubtedly, both. But in current politics, the 
present nevertheless beats out the past. 
  [EKHO PLANETY] Including the negative past? Or has the 
syndrome of distrust among Israelis nevertheless remained? 
  [Bovin] The negative [past], too. But as to the syndrome of 
distrust, if it does exist, it is somewhere deep. On the level 
of current politics, I repeat, the events of the past few years 
have a greater effect, and not what was, for example, 25 years 
ago. Although on the whole, if we, let us say, write a book 
about this, both aspects need to be kept in mind. 
  [EKHO PLANETY] When you began work in Israel, the USSR, an 
enormous, great country, existed--at least this is what it was 
called. But now Russia, although in contrast to its historical 
forerunner it has become a democratic country, but.... 
  [Bovin] I hope that it will become a democratic country. 
  [EKHO PLANETY] An essential amplification.... But, on the 
other hand, it has suffered an appreciable loss of its former 
influence. Do you feel these changes on yourself as the 
plenipotentiary of Russia? 
  [Bovin] My partners here are very delicate people, and they 
do not give me this feeling. 
  [EKHO PLANETY] During the week that I have been in Israel, I 
have had occasion to have a lot of contact with immigrants from 
our country. It is striking that in the majority of cases they 
occupy an extremely tough position on the question of 
territorial concessions to the Arabs in exchange for peace. 
There was even a conference in Jerusalem on this this question, 
at which the sentiment held sway: "We will not give an inch...." 
How do you explain such intransigence? 
  [Bovin] You are incorrect in your initial statement. 
According to my observations, in no circumstances can one think 
that the majority of aliyah [people who want to become citizens 
of Israel] from Russia takes that position. But here there is 
one circumstance. When the government of the Likud Party was in 
power and there were large problems with the absorption (the 
implantation of repatriates in Israeli society--Author's note), 
the majority of the ethnic Russian [russkuyu] aliyah came out 
against it. In essence, this government was thrown out through 
"Russian" votes. But since the current government of Rabin is 
not carrying out its program demands in regard to absorption 
(although enough is being done), now the critical shots are 
aimed at it. Above all, in regard to the problem of absorption, 
but, of course, encompassing also a broader range of questions, 
including military policy. You recalled the conference "Aliya 
for Eretz-Israel [Aliyah for the Land of Israel]." However, it 
seems to me, that the people who were present there represent by 
far not the entire Russian [rossiyskuyu] aliyah. Perhaps the 
more active part of it, but the smaller one. 
  [EKHO PLANETY] And all the same, I sensed a deep-seated 
distrust of the Arabs in the hearts of our former fellow 
citizens. It is possible that for many immigrants the memories 
of the night bombardments of Tel-Aviv by Iraq during the Persian 
Gulf crisis created a negative emotional background. This 
coincided with the most massive influx from our country. 
  [Bovin] Yes, there really are such sentiments. Although I 
was 
frequently told: On the screens and in the newspapers all this 
looked much more acute than in reality. 
  [EKHO PLANETY] And still one more, very fresh observation. 
In 
all homes where I had the occasion to be, people literally 
cannot tear themselves away from the TV screen when there are 
programs from Moscow. But yesterday I was in a home where they 
consciously do not turn on TV on Russian wavelengths since this, 
as the hosts believe, can interfere with integration in Israeli 
society. The opinion was even expressed that for this reason 
Israel has no need for either Russian-language radio or 
Russian-language newspapers. It is necessary to forget once and 
for all everything that was in the former life and start a new 
one. 
  [Bovin] In the long term, the connections of the immigrants 
with Russia will gradually die down, this is historically 
inevitable since the pot is boiling and a new nation of 
Israelites or Hebrews, as you like, is being formed. But for the 
time being, such sentiments are individual. Moreover, here is 
what is interesting--people consciously convince themselves: "It 
is not necessary to watch television from Moscow, it is not 
necessary to listen to the local Russian radio "Reka" [River]. 
We chop off all these roots, we live here, we breathe this air, 
and we speak in this language." On the level of reason they 
understand this, but on the level of emotions, they will 
nevertheless read, listen, and watch everything Russian. The 
departure from the past is an inevitable but long period. This 
is so everywhere. 
  [EKH0 PLANETY] Do you think, everywhere? Is there not a 
typically Russian syndrome here: We have come from a country 
that has become impoverished and has collapsed, we will forget 
it, like a bad dream. . . I cannot imagine that, let us say, an 
American Jew, having come here, would try to forget as soon as 
possible what is happening across the ocean. . . . Or any 
European. . . . 
  [Bovin] Only between Israel and Russia the difference is 
much 
greater than between Israel and America. This, first of all. 
Secondly, the abandonment of America and the abandonment of 
Russia--these are completely different processes. In the second 
case, there are incomparably more feelings. For this reason, it 
is difficult to make comparisons here, these are different 
things. 
  [EKHO PLANETY] And nevertheless I hope that, when Russia 
becomes a normal, moderately prosperous and democratic country, 
of which one does not have to be ashamed, people will not put it 
out of their memory. . . . 
  [Bovin] I assure you, no one here is ashamed of Russia. 
People love it precisely as it is now--poverty-stricken, 
disorderly, in the midst of chaos. I do not recognize such 
logic: When Russia becomes prosperous and democratic we will 
begin to love it more. Nothing of the sort! Precisely by that 
time, these people, possibly, will love it less. Up to 90 
percent of them will become Israelites, there already will not 
be the former acuteness of emotions. 
  [EKHO PLANETY] And the last thing. Your prognosis: When will 
Russia become democratic? When working in journalism, you made 
rather accurate prognoses. 
  [Bovin] I never made accurate prognoses. 
  [EKHO PLANETY] But why, the readers of the 1970's and 1980's 
well remember your analytical surveys with a calculation of the 
possible variants of the development of events. And now? 
  [Bovin] Do you see the photograph? It is my grandson. When 
he 
reaches the age of our junior colleague (a gesture toward 
Aleksandr Zhudro), Russia, I hope, will become democratic. But 
such a "danger" does not threaten you and me. This is not a 
question of pessimism or optimism. Simply Russia is such a mass 
that to change its course and direction is impossible in a year, 
in 5 years, or in 10 years. The situation of chaos can be 
eliminated, the standard of living can be made tolerable, and 
one can patch the hole, as the sailors say. All this can be 
done, probably, even in the time that depends on us. But to 
transform Russia into a democratic, prosperous country a much 
greater period of time is required. This is what I think. . . . 
  For information: The correspondent of ITAR-TASS (and our 
journal) in Tel-Aviv, A. Zhudro, will be 40 years old this year. 
The grandson of the ambassador of the Russian Federation, Makar, 
will be 6 years old. So count.

<F P=106> [Article by Professor M. Savluk, doctor of economic </F>
sciences: "Inflation in Ukraine: Its Sources and Its Current 
Status"] 
  [Text] The most important negative phenomenon in Ukraine's 
economy in its market-reform stage is inflation. From a barely 
perceptible devaluation of money during the eighties, inflation 
has very rapidly (in close to three years) reached the level of 
hyperinflation. The odd thing is that this upsurge of inflation 
has occurred in one of the most economically developed and 
prosperous republics of the former USSR. This phenomenon has not 
been properly analyzed and objectively assessed and remains 
poorly understood by the general public. This makes it possible 
to exploit the threat of inflation as justification for opposing 
Ukraine's leaving the single ruble zone and for opposing the 
building up of an independent Ukrainian state per se. 
Consequently, an analysis of inflation in present-day Ukraine 
assumes exceptional importance. 
<H5>  Was There Inflation in Ukraine Before Ukraine Proclaimed Her </H5>
Independence? 
  In order to objectively assess the inflationary processes 
currently under way, one must first determine whether there was 
inflation in Ukraine during the Soviet period. It is, however, 
very difficult to find a simple nswer to this question today. 
During the Soviet period, Ukraine was a component part of 
another state and did not have an independent monetary system. 
We are thus left with data on inflation in the USSR as a whole 
on which to base our investigation. This approach is 
methodologically justified inasmuch as the state of monetary 
circulation in Ukraine was then determined by the Union center 
and differed very little from the state of the monetary sphere 
of the Union as a whole. 
  With rigid state controls and containment of prices as their 
policy, the official Soviet authorities [as published] denied 
the very possibility of inflation in a planned economy, and 
government statistics simply kept silent about the problem of 
inflation until 1989. 
  If one were to judge inflation by the dynamics of the 
state-set retail prices at which the majority of goods and 
services were sold in the Soviet Union, one could conclude that 
until the beginning of the restructuring of the Soviet economy, 
there really was no inflation or that it was insignificant (see 
Table 1).

  The data in Table 1 indicates that a perceptible rise in 
prices began concurrently throughout the whole Soviet Union and 
in Ukraine particularly in the eighties. The greatest increases 
occurred in the prices of food products. Inflation began to 
assume an open form. This forced the USSR Ministry of Finance in 
1989 to acknowledge officially that inflation had begun in the 
country and that it was running at an annual rate of 
2-4%.[.sup]1[/] 
  Approximately the same data on inflation in the former USSR 
were cited by official IMF sources and some Western economists. 
In particular, R. Dorybush (Massachussetts Institute of 
Technology), citing IMF sources in a work entitled The 
Lessons of High Inflation, provided the following figures 
for inflation in the USSR: 1986 -- 2%, 1987 -- 
1.3%, 1988 -- 
0.6%, 1989 -- 2%, 1990 --4.8%.[.sup]2[/] But these 
data do 
not take into account hidden constituent inflation. In reality, 
the monetary sphere of the former USSR (including Ukraine's) was 
in much greater disequilibrium than indicated by the index of 
state retail prices. Through the mechanism of preferential bank 
credits, a surplus money supply was constantly being injected 
into circulation. Goods shortages and unmet effective demand 
were growing steadily, creating a significant hidden 
inflationary potential (see Table 2).

  The first two indicators reveal changes in the material 
sphere of the economy, and the other three indicate changes in 
the monetary sphere. From the very beginning of the period under 
investigation, the indicators of change in the monetary sphere 
were rising faster than the indicators of change in the material 
sphere, and this gap grew steadily wider, indicating the growth 
of a chronic disequilibrium between the supplies of goods and 
money in the economy and a hidden inflationary potential. 
Although indebtedness on short-term bank loans fell markedly 
after 1985, this did not alter the overall situation. At the 
same time, there was a sharp rise in such indicators as 
financial means (5.5-fold), the state budget deficit 
(approximately 3-fold),[.sup]3[/] and the national 
debt.[.sup]4[/] 
  The conclusion concerning a chronic buildup of inflationary 
potential (particularly in the consumer sector of the USSR 
economy) is also confirmed by a growing discrepancy between 
prices in the state trade network and at collective farm 
markets. In the USSR as a whole, the average prices of goods 
sold at collective farm markets at unregulated prices exceeded 
state prices: in 1960 -- 1.35-fold, in 1970 --1.55-fold, in 1980 
-- 2.09-fold.[.sup]5[/] In Ukraine, these unregulated prices 
were 2.27-fold higher in 1980, 2.38-fold higher in 1985, and 
2.87-fold higher in 1990.[.sup]6[/] 
  The data cited to reflect the disequilibrium in the economy 
between the supply of goods and money reveal that the surplus 
money supply in circulation in the consumer sector constituted 
70-75% of the total volume of money held by the 
population on 
the eve of the collapse of the former USSR. At the end of 1990, 
this amounted to approximately 350-400 billion rubles. According 
to our estimates, Ukraine accounted for 75-90 billion rubles of 
this sum. This money reflected unmet demand and put constant 
pressure on prices, causing them to rise. We estimate that a 
sudden liberalization of prices alone would have caused the 
general level of prices to at least triple. Calculations of the 
real rate of inflation made in 1991 at the state level revealed 
that in 1989 inflation measured 7.5% and in 1990, 
19%.[.sup]7[/] 
  Thus, Ukraine approached her declaration of independence 
with 
a moderate level of open inflation and with a large hidden 
inflationary potential, which was capable of causing significant 
inflation with the first attempt to liberalize prices. 
<H5>  The Condition of Ukraine's Monetary Sphere During the Period </H5>
Between Ukraine's Proclamation of Independence and Her Leaving 
the Union 
  The Declaration of Independence of Ukraine proclaimed in 
July 
1990 could not suddenly change the course of economic processes, 
including those taking place in the monetary sphere. These 
continued under their own momentum, which had been created by 
the totality of the development that had come before: the 
"cost-is-no-object" nature of the economy, the falling volumes 
and effectiveness of production, decreased labor productivity, 
the irrational, militarized structure of production, etc. 
Moreover, for nearly another one and a half years, Ukraine 
remained part of the Union and part of the common economic and 
monetary space. Therefore, the Union center continued to decide 
all key issues relating to Ukraine's economic development: it 
set policies on wages, prices, emission, credit, etc. Not only 
did Ukraine's proclamation of independence in July 1990 not 
change the internal negative economic processes, but it provoked 
a response from the Union center and some of the other Union 
republics that spurred inflation. There began increased external 
pressure on the economy of the Ukrainian state, manifested in 
the issuance of harsher directives in response to Ukraine's 
desire for independence. 
  The 1990 forecast for the Union as a whole anticipated a 
significant increase in emission, while "freezing" emission for 
Ukraine at the 1989 level, i.e., at 1.2 billion rubles. In 
reality, emission in 1990 for the Union as a whole significantly 
exceeded the predicted level and reached an unprecedented amount 
-- 24 billion rubles. At the same time, Ukraine removed 446 
million rubles out of circulation -- an action that Ukraine's 
government hailed as a notable accomplishment in carrying out 
the center's directive regarding emission.[.sup]8[/] 
  The result of this "accomplishment" for the economy and 
people of Ukraine was slower growth of personal income than in 
other republics, accelerated growth of unmet demand while large 
quantities of goods flowed out of Ukraine, and a redistribution 
of credit resources to the benefit of other republics. 
  Since 1991, the Union center's negative influence on 
Ukraine's monetary sphere was gradually compounded by the 
destructive effects of the centrifugal actions in the monetary 
and credit policy of the government of the Russian Federation. 
  Against the background of the active struggle for 
independence that unfolded in many republics of the Union, the 
government of Russia also proclaimed war on the Union center and 
began to pursue an openly independent economic policy. To bring 
over large segments of the population to its side in this 
struggle, the Russian government decided to promote a rapid 
increase in personal incomes, grant credit and tax preferences 
to enterprises that recognized the jurisdiction of Russia, 
immediately meet all the demands of striking collectives for 
expanded economic independence, etc. 
  The result of this policy was an unprecedented increase in 
emission by the Central Bank of Russia (CBR). During 1991, it 
put 32% more cash into circulation than during all the 
preceding 30 years (1961-1990). At the same time, Ukraine put 
40% less money into circulation than during the entire 
preceding 30 years. As a result, the total supply of money in 
circulation in Russia in 1991 increased 2.26-fold, while in 
Ukraine this amount increased only 1.44-fold.[.sup]9[/] The 
huge money supplies issued by the CBR circulated freely in the 
single ruble zone, "flooding" the markets of all the Union 
republics, and especially Ukraine's. 
  The CBR pursued an identical policy through its mechanism of 
credit emissions, which provided Russia's enterprises with 
maximally favorable terms on which to gain access to credit 
resources. Although Russia, like all the other republics, was 
still part of the Union and therefore bound by the terms of a 
single credit policy set by the State Bank of the USSR, in 1991 
the CBR began openly ignoring these terms. 
  In particular, the USSR State Bank recommended a minimum 
reserve requirement averaging 14% for the central banks 
of the 
Union republics and an interest rate on credits for refinancing 
commercial banks averaging 12%. By the beginning of 1991, 
the 
CBR had set these same standards for Russia's banks at a much 
lower level -- 2% and 8%, respectively. It also 
exceeded the 
centralized quota for credit emission by almost 200 percent. 
Throughout 1991, the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) and the 
central banks of other republics continued to maintain the 
centrally established standards and quotas. The result was a 
2.3-fold increase in credit extensions by Russia's banks, and 
only a 1.7-fold increase by Ukraine's banks.[.sup]10[/] Thus, 
the importing of inflation into Ukraine began even before she 
left the Union, and its effect was so perceptible that the 
government of Ukraine was forced to apply organizational 
measures to protect the Ukrainian consumer market from the 
inflow of money from outside. It introduced single-use coupons 
in retail trade, as well as export controls. 
  At the same time, the effects of internal inflationary 
factors were becoming more perceptible -- in particular, the 
growth of crisis phenomena in Ukraine's own economy. Production 
volumes were falling at an accelerated rate: in 1991 the gross 
social product decreased (as against 1990) by 11.3% and 
national income by 11.2%. Meanwhile, the state budget 
deficit 
amounted to 21.1 billion rubles, or 27.4% of total 
revenues, as 
compared to 1990, when budget revenues had exceeded budget 
expenditures by 1.4 billion rubles. 
  The situation in the monetary sphere grew radically worse 
after controls over spending on wages were abolished in July 
1991. In August 1991 alone, the amount of money issued by banks 
for this purpose increased 2.1-fold and reached 7.5 billion 
rubles. Personal income in 1991 increased (as against 1990) by 
87% and once again significantly exceeded personal 
spending and 
savings -- by 11.3 billion rubles.[.sup]11[/] Unmet demand 
and goods shortages mounted and constituted hidden components of 
inflation. 
  At the same time, the rate of open inflation rose 
unremittingly throughout 1991. In January-February, wholesale 
and purchase prices were raised by a significant amount. In 
April, fundamental changes were made in price formation -- 
agreed-to (free) prices were permitted for a large assortment of 
consumer goods, and state retail prices were also raised. This 
was the first obvious step in the direction of price 
liberalization, which helped to transform hidden inflation into 
open inflation. 
  The index of state retail prices for the whole of 1991 (as 
compared with 1990) measured 187%. Prices in the 
collective and 
"black" markets were wholly unregulated and were two and three 
times higher than in state and cooperative trade. Wholesale 
prices in industry more than doubled.[.sup]12[/] There are 
therefore grounds to believe that open inflation in 1991 across 
the whole spectrum of prices and tariffs in Ukraine exceeded 
200% and began to pose a serious threat to the country's 
economy. 
  The government was forced to take steps to provide a social 
safety net for the population. In particular, it carried out the 
indexation of Savings Bank deposits, indexation of incomes, etc. 
However, in a very short time income indexation was replaced by 
the complete lifting of state wage controls in the production 
sphere and by periodic increases in the incomes of employees of 
budget-financed institutions. As a result of these measures, 
personal income growth began to catch up with price increases. 
Over 1991 as a whole, the rate of growth of personal income even 
exceeded the rate of growth of prices, which, in turn, helped to 
fuel inflation. 
<H5>  The Rise in Inflation Following Ukraine's Exit from the USSR </H5>
  The USSR finally collapsed in December 1991, and Ukraine won 
independence at last. This gave rise to a new inflationary 
phase, in which all the inflationary factors were rendered 
significantly more active and the manifestations and processes 
of inflation changed. 
  First and foremost, the nature of inflation imported from 
other CIS countries changed significantly and its spectrum 
expanded. Having won independence from the Union center and 
having taken over its emission system, the Russian Federation 
fundamentally changed its policies on prices, emission, and 
credit. In January 1992, set on liberalizing prices, the 
government of Russia unilaterally raised retail prices on an 
average to triple and quadruple their previous levels. The 
government of Ukraine was forced to raise the prices of most 
goods by the same factors.[.sup]13[/] 
  After Russia left the Union, the CBR began to implement a 
harsh policy of "expensive money" -- it significantly increased 
the reserve requirements for commercial banks (from 2% in 
1991 
to 10% in January, 15% in February, and 20% 
in March of 1992) 
and raised the discount rate (from 8% in 1991 to 
20% at the 
beginning of 1992).[.sup]14[/] Insofar as the NBU maintained 
the earlier standards that had been recommended by the former 
USSR State Bank, these actions by the CBR upset the balance in 
settling accounts between Ukraine's and Russia's enterprises. 
Russian enterprises were finding it increasingly difficult to 
pay for deliveries of goods from Ukraine, and in the middle of 
1992, their total indebtedness was twice as high as that of 
Ukraine's enterprises. This situation further disrupted economic 
ties, produced a drop in production, and resulted in there being 
fewer goods in Ukraine's markets. Secondly, to prevent the 
bankrupting of Ukrainian enterprises, which were not receiving 
payment from Russia, the NBU was forced to increase the volume 
of preferential credits it extended to them and increase the 
emission of credit. 
  However, Ukraine's total dependence on Russia for energy 
supplies proved to be the principal channel through which 
inflation was imported in 1992. Exploiting this dependence, 
Russia's government began to raise the prices of the oil, oil 
products, and gas that Russia sold to Ukraine. This caused the 
price of oil products in Ukraine to rise nearly 300-fold in 1992 
as a whole.[.sup]15[/] Such a jump in prices would have 
destabilized the economy and monetary sphere of even a highly 
developed country, let alone Ukraine. 
  Ukraine's exit from the Union significantly activated the 
internal inflationary factors as well. Responding to social 
pressure, Ukraine's government in January 1992 sharply increased 
the wholesale prices of goods manufactured by the basic branches 
of industry. The average level of wholesale prices in the coal 
industry in February 1992 was 51 times higher than the 
corresponding indicators in 1991. In January 1992, the general 
level of wholesale prices in industry as a whole increased (as 
gainst December 1991) 8.4-fold, and in February by an additional 
factor of 2.3.[.sup]16[/] Serving to push retail prices up 
even further, this government measure produced an even stronger 
impact than Russia's unilateral price increases. It made state 
regulation of retail prices extremely difficult, and the prices 
of most goods and services were completely "freed." There began 
a spontaneous process of a chronic rise of "free" prices and a 
saltatory rise of regulated prices (see Table 3).

** Not including rates for services. 


  The large jump in prices after their "liberalization" at the 
beginning of 1992 produced the necessary equilibrium and, in 
effect, destroyed the entire surplus supply of money in 
circulation that had accumulated over preceding years. But 
because at the beginning of 1992 current income growth lagged 
behind price growth, the scarcity of demand for goods was felt 
very quickly, trade slowed, and the first quarter already showed 
signs of a crisis in sales. It even became necessary to lower 
the prices of some goods. 
  However, this process soon came to a halt. The monopolistic 
position and state status of most enterprises made it possible 
for them to avoid lowering prices, succeed in obtaining 
preferential credits and direct financial assistance (in 
particular, in the form of indexation of working capital), and 
quickly raise their employees' wages. Thus, by the first half 
year of 1992, the average monthly wage in industry increased 
11.4-fold, despite the fact that the volume of production 
decreased (as against the relevant period in 1991) by 
12.3%, 
and retail prices in state and cooperative trade rose on an 
average by a factor of 6.4.[.sup]17[/] 
  In light of the forced growth of incomes in the production 
sphere, the government had to substantially increase the incomes 
of employees in the budget-financed sphere, of pensioners, 
military personnel, etc. The rate of income growth began to 
surpass the rate of spending (in September -- 1.22-fold), and 
unmet demand and goods shortages increased. 
  The government's policy of liberalizing prices and incomes 
was fully supported by the National Bank of Ukraine, whose 
excessive emission created favorable conditions for the 
realization and intensification of all the inflationary factors 
operating in the Ukrainian economy. 
  The NBU was implementing a policy of "cheap money" and 
maintaining the discount rate at a level well below the rate of 
inflation in Ukraine and the discount rates in other CIS 
countries. Thus, in the fourth quarter of 1992, when inflation 
measured 30% per month, the NBU's discount rate averaged 
22-25% per year. At the time, Russia's discount rate was 
already more than 80%. This had extremely negative 
consequences 
for Ukraine's economy. 
  Personal savings on deposit at the Savings Bank began to 
shrink, the demand for convertible currency on the "black" 
market rose, the exchange rate of the karbovanets began to fall 
at an accelerated rate, and the outflow of capital from the 
country intensified (including to Russia). The NBU's low 
discount rate and the commercial banks' unregulated interest 
rates on loans caused the "flight" of capital from the state 
sector to the private sector of the economy, which meant, in 
effect, a so-called "shadow privatization" and intensified the 
payments crisis in the state sector. 
  Thus over the first 11 months of 1992, overdue payments in 
the national economy of Ukraine increased 125-fold and on 1 
December amounted to 406 billion karbovantsi.[.sup]18[/] All 
these processes increased demand for credit and compelled the 
NBU to release new credit flows. The total amount extended in 
credit by Ukrainian banks in 1992 was 27 times greater than in 
1991.[.sup]19[/] As a consequence of this policy on the part 
of the NBU, economic reforms were curbed, a free-ride mentality 
was reinforced, and nonpayments mounted causing a new demand 
for credits. 
  The negative effects of the NBU's policy of "cheap money" 
became especially apparent in the second half of 1992 when 
Russia halted the flow of excess rubles from Ukraine. By setting 
up clearing operations with Ukraine through centralized 
correspondent accounts in central banks, Russia in effect pushed 
Ukraine out of the ruble zone as punishment for an inadequately 
thought-out monetary policy. This confined the entire supply of 
issued payment means to the territory of Ukraine, and the 
Ukrainian ruble (karbovanets since November) began to lose value 
even more rapidly. At the end of 1992, the rate of inflation 
exceeded 30% per month, reaching an annual rate of 
2,100%.[.sup]20[/] Moreover, the price rises could not keep 
up with the growth of the money supply, because the prices of 
some essential goods were still being set by the state. Demand 
for these goods could not be met despite rising prices. 
  The critical situation that developed in the monetary sphere 
at the end of 1992 exacerbated the political situation in the 
republic and was probably the main reason for the change in the 
leadership of the Cabinet of Ministers and the National Bank of 
Ukraine. The new government, headed by L. Kuchma, was granted 
special powers to conduct a stabilization policy. However, the 
inflationary potential that had accumulated under the preceding 
government was so huge that the first thing the new government 
was forced to do when it took office was to raise fixed prices 
1.8-fold at the beginning of 1993. 
  Having promised to halt inflation, the government of L. 
Kuchma confined its anti-inflation policy to restricting 
consumption funds at enterprises and "freezing" monetary incomes 
in the budget-financed sphere. Even these measures -- albeit not 
sufficiently resolute and consistent --produced some positive 
results: between the end of January and the end of March 1993, 
prices on the consumer market and the exchange rate of the 
karbovanets were relatively stable. 
  But the stabilization proved short-lived, because it was not 
backed by cardinal reforms of Ukraine's economic system per se 
and a suitable monetary policy on the part of the NBU. The old 
economic system, with its "cost-is-no-object" nature, was itself 
transformed into a powerful inflationary factor when economic 
ties were broken and state controls weakened, and the NBU's 
policies helped to keep this system alive. Ukraine's 
agroindustrial complex is an especially telling illustration of 
this. 
  In the first quarter of 1993 alone, the agroindustrial 
complex received nearly one trillion karbovantsi in preferential 
credits (at an annual rate of 30%) and close to three 
trillion 
karbovantsi of state financial assistance for its 
needs.[.sup]21[/] Other sectors of the national economy also 
needed huge credits -- in March they were granted 606 billion 
karbovantsi in credits to settle accounts amongst 
themselves.[.sup]22[/] The total sum of cash issued in the 
period between January and April 1993 amounted to 598.3 billion 
karbovantsi, which exceeded emission during the corresponding 
period of 1992 tenfold.[.sup]23[/] 
  With production volumes continuing to fall and the costs of 
imported energy supplies continuing to rise, it was inevitable 
that such huge injections of money would disturb the delicate 
market balance that had formed after the January price increase. 
Indeed, starting in March, it became apparent that goods were 
again becoming scarce, demand was not being met, production 
outlays that were not covered by the enterprises' own revenues 
were growing, the amount of nonpayments among enterprises was 
mounting to its previous level, etc. Although the NBU seemed to 
come to its senses and in April-May applied a series of monetary 
measures designed to fight inflation (raised the annual discount 
rate to 240%, established stronger controls over the 
operations 
of commerical banks, began to finance the government within the 
limits of the budget deficit approved by the Supreme Council, 
etc.), these steps were not able to alter the situation in the 
monetary sphere as a whole. 
  By the end of the first half year of 1993, the hidden 
inflationary potential had been restored and now exceeded the 
level that had existed at the end of 1992. Nonpayments and 
losses reappeared in the national economy and amounted to 
trillions. The government was forced to raise once again 
(1.5-fold) fixed retail and wholesale prices, as well as all 
forms of personal income. The Supreme Council passed a decision 
to grant enterprises financial and credit assistance in the 
amount of nearly seven trillion karbovantsi to be used to cover 
losses, pay off debts, and for other expenditures. Thus a new 
steep spiral of hyperinflation began, which made the economic 
and the social situation in Ukraine even worse. 
  The data contained in Table 4 confirm the steep climb of all 
the components of inflation in 1993. The most rapid rises are 
occurring in wholesale prices and the exchange rate of the 
karbovanets. During the first nine-month period, industrial 
wholesale prices increased 57.3-fold (as against 11.1-fold for 
the whole of 1992), and the exchange rate of the karbovanets 
against the U.S. dollar increased 22.8-fold. At the same time, 
the retail prices of goods and services increased more than 
16-fold, that is, almost by the same factor as for all of 1992.

  An extremely steep price rise began in June, when there was 
sharp increase of bank credits and in the money supply. 
Throughout the entire third quarter, the money supply increased 
each month by more than 50%. The duration of each wave of 
inflation became markedly shorter. The first inflationary peak 
in 1993 occurred in January and the second in June, that is, 
four months later. The next upsurge took place only two months 
later -- in September. Inasmuch as the money supply grew at a 
faster rate than prices during the last cycle, there is every 
reason to expect another sharp rise in prices. 
  A very clear link between the market exchange rate of the 
karbovanets and the money supply appeared during the first seven 
months. The exchange rate changed every month (except February) 
in the same direction and at approximately the same rate as the 
money supply. Not until August, when on the initiative of the 
Cabinet of Ministers the National Bank of Ukraine made it 
mandatory to sell 50% of all foreign exchange earnings to 
the 
state at a fixed rate, did the exchange rate of karbovanets 
increase 2.2-fold without a clear link to the change in the 
money supply. 
  The rise in inflation in 1993 was also caused by faster 
monetary circulation. Thus, the rate at which money circulated 
in the first nine months of 1993 (as compared with 1992) more 
than doubled. This can be explained by a continually growing 
negative discount rate and an increased level of anticipated 
inflation. 
  Given the conditions that developed in the second half of 
1993, the Cabinet of Ministers and the National Bank of Ukraine 
took a number of purely administrative steps to influence the 
monetary and credit sphere (such as, fixing the foreign exchange 
rate, instituting the mandatory sale to the state of 50% 
of 
foreign exchange earnings, setting a five-percent credit limit 
and high quotas for mandatory reserves for liabilities for 
banks, etc.) Inasmuch as they are purely monetary, these 
measures can result in the build-up of a new inflationary 
potential in Ukraine, because they leave in place the 
deep-rooted structural problems in the economy, which are the 
principal causes of inflation.

<H5>  [No 12, Dec 93, pp 55-63] </H5>
  [Text] In April 1993, an analytical report entitled 
"Priorities of the United States in the New Abroad" was prepared 
at the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of the United 
States and Canada under the general direction of Doctor of 
Historical Sciences Professor V. A. Kremenyuk. Below we offer to 
readers' attention the first of two articles prepared on the 
basis of that report. Used in the report were materials 
presented by Candidate of Historical Sciences N. V. Osipova and 
Candidate of Historical Sciences M. A. Guseynova. 
  The coming to power of the Clinton administration introduced 
an element of additional tension in expectations regarding 
American policy in the new Russian abroad. The traditional 
interest of the Democratic Party in human rights contrasted with 
a certain number of infringements of them in virtually all 
states of the former USSR, Washington's hesitation to provide 
direct economic support to post-Soviet reforms, and the 
contradictions inherent from the start between the need for a 
priority partnership with Russia as the main strategic successor 
of the USSR and attempts to acquire levers of influence on 
Ukraine, which competes with Moscow, and Kazakhstan and 
Belorussia, which take a more restrained attitude toward 
implementing their independent role[.sup]1[/], all create a 
complicated set of problems colored by preoccupation with 
military dangers for the new American leadership. The 
combination of the sense of danger transformed and "compacted" 
as compared with the Soviet period, which comes from the former 
USSR, and the democrats' official and informal precepts on 
ensuring individual rights, one of which is the right to 
democratic development, today determines the United States' 
approaches to most of the processes on former Soviet territory. 
This position of course includes elements of succession in 
relation to the position the Bush administration worked out 
toward the Russian abroad. While the Republican leadership was 
more openly and insistently interested in aspects of strategic 
stability and control over nuclear weapons, the new 
administration's initial period of activity shows its attempts 
to overcome a certain one-sidedness in previous American policy 
and, while maintaining heightened attention to military 
questions, to provide a more extensive vision of its interests 
related to the extremely painful and contradictory establishment 
of democracy and market reforms in the post-Soviet states. It is 
still difficult to speak of any complete definition of the 
American position in relation to events in the former republics 
of the USSR. On the one hand, Washington is seriously concerned 
over conflicts on the former Soviet periphery and intends to 
expand its influence on the situation taking shape there. On the 
other, it is very clearly trying to limit its participation in 
the developing conflicts, emphasizing the importance of mutual 
understanding and cooperation with Moscow. "We want to develop a 
partnership with Russia in order to eliminate the obstacles 
arising as a result of these conflicts," stressed the Clinton 
administration's official explanation of 13 August 1993 on the 
U.S. position toward the armed clashes in the Transcaucasus and 
Central Asia. 
  Washington's more vigorous posture is of course determined 
by 
the ideological precepts of the Democrats, which are more than 
just slightly different from those of the Republicans. 
  It is more significant that it was precisely in the last 
months of Republican rule and the first months of Democratic 
rule (December 1992-May 1993) that tendencies which were not so 
much military-strategic in character as political and 
political-humanitarian began to develop in Russia and its 
immediate neighbors. 
<H8>  I </H8>
  From the moment of the 1991 agreement in Belovezhskaya 
Pushcha, which reinforced the three Slavic republics' "united" 
desire to move along the path of reforms in a coordinated way, 
each of the parties that signed this document had its own 
interpretation of the document's essential point. Russia and 
Belorussia initially interpreted what had been achieved as a 
variant of a Union treaty without such burdensome components as 
a Union government and the less economically developed Central 
Asian republics. 
  However, the agreement's strongest unifying element was the 
common fear of a union Center and a desire to eliminate its 
might. The constructive element was poorly expressed in the 
Belovezhskaya agreements. Belorussia's leadership treated this 
union as one among equals. The Russian leadership planned to 
hold dominant positions in it. Ukraine saw its participation in 
the agreement as a step on the path of the gradual 
disintegration of the former USSR. 
  The Alma-Ata agreement of 21 December 1991, by which the 
republics of Central Asia joined the triple alliance, made it 
appear that a particular structure uniting the new independent 
states had been formed, one which would allow them on a 
coordinated basis to endure the difficulties of the transitional 
period from the administrative-planned system of economy to the 
market and political independence without the forcible 
disruption of existing ties. 
  Differences in the national interests of the CIS countries 
began to show clearly in the time that has elapsed. Even the 
signed agreements have been revised on a bilateral and 
unilateral basis. The changes in the positions of the CIS 
members toward the unified strategic forces of the Commonwealth 
may serve as a clear example. 
  In accordance with Point 6 of the agreement on the formation 
of the Commonwealth, the member states are committed to 
"preserve and support a common military-strategic space under 
unified command, including unified control over nuclear 
weapons." Regarding the question of nuclear weapons, the 
Alma-Ata declaration noted that "combined command of 
military-strategic forces and unified control over nuclear 
weapons will be preserved." The actual agreement with the 
corresponding measures regarding nuclear weapons says that until 
nuclear weapons are completely eliminated on the territories of 
Ukraine and Belorussia, the president of Russia makes the 
decision to employ them with the agreement of the leadership of 
the three nuclear states. 
  But Ukraine's leadership let it be known that it had its own 
interpretation of the agreements reached. To them unified 
control over nuclear weapons meant employing the "double key" 
principle when using them. 
  Attempts were made by Ukraine to revise the provisions on 
defense issues regarding the unity of CIS strategic forces. 
  Ukraine's position found understanding and support in 
Azerbaijan and Moldavia and then in Uzbekistan and Turkmenia, 
which supported preserving the CIS's common military-strategic 
space only after creating their own armed forces. As a result, 
joining the Bishkek Agreement on the concept of military 
security were 6 of the 11 Commonwealth states: the Republic of 
Armenia, the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Republic of Kyrgyzstan, 
the Russian Federation, the Republic of Tajikistan, and the 
Republic of Uzbekistan. The Republic of Ukraine, the Republic of 
Turkmenistan, and the Republic of Belarus did not sign the 
treaty, building military-political relations within the 
framework of the CIS on a bilateral basis. 
  Belorussia's refusal to sign this agreement destroyed 
Russian 
politicians' hopes to balance Ukraine's aspirations to move away 
from the center with the formation of a Minsk--Moscow--Alma-Ata 
military-political bloc. The "restrictive" approach of the 
Belorussian leadership to participating in military-political 
cooperation within the CIS brought additional, although 
apparently, surmountable, complications to this cooperation. 
  We should mention that the "allergic" rejection of the idea 
of participating in military actions outside the country's own 
undeveloped borders is typical of not just Belorussia. It is 
confirmed by the serious difficulties which Kirghizia and 
Kazakhstan had in fulfilling the decision adopted by the 
Commonwealth to send their military contingents to Tajikistan to 
participate along with Russian armed forces in disengaging the 
warring sides. The parliaments of both republics opposed the 
governmental agreements. As a result, the Kazakhstan and Kirghiz 
contingents joined the peace-keeping mission of the Russians 
only at the start of 1991 during a temporary decrease in the 
level of conflict in Tajikistan. 
  Russia's switch in late May 1993 to selling energy media at 
world prices (introducing customs duties on oil exports and the 
like) was an example of the use of methods of economic pressure 
on the countries of the near abroad. The Russian action promoted 
the adoption of the decision to prepare a treaty on the creation 
of an economic union at the first meeting of the CIS 
Consultative-Coordinating Committee on 1 June 1993. The treaty, 
which above all deals with removing customs barriers, regulating 
the mechanisms of interstate payments, and standardizing certain 
economic legislation, was supposed to be signed on 16 July 1993 
at the meeting of the heads of state in Yerevan. 
  But the planned course of events was disrupted by the more 
drastic aggravation of the economic situation in certain CIS 
republics than was expected. Above all, for the first time since 
the dissolution of the USSR, Ukraine felt that it was in fact in 
a critical situation. The economic and following that financial 
crisis, the drop in the exchange rate of the kupon, and as a 
result the explosion of sociopolitical activism, for the most 
part in regions of the northeast which depend on Russian energy 
supplies to a greater degree, resulted in Kiev's convulsive 
efforts to regulate trade with Russia in order to stabilize the 
situation in Ukraine. 
  The Asian republics of the CIS brought additional anxiety to 
the situation. In their own way also dissatisfied with the pace 
and conditions of economic cooperation with Slavic partners, 
they participated even more enthusiastically in the conference 
of heads of governments of the countries of Central Asia, 
Kazakhstan, Turkey, and Pakistan held in Ankara within the 
framework of the transatlantic Organization of Economic 
Cooperation in the first 10 days of July 1993. During the 
conference, an agreement to improve the freight transport system 
among the participating states was signed and certain issues 
related to relaxing customs regulations and liberalizing trade 
conditions were agreed upon. 
  Against the background of this conference, on 13 July 1993 
the heads of governments of Russia, Ukraine, and Belorussia 
signed their own joint statement on urgent measures to deepen 
economic integration, which in fact forestalled the signing of a 
comprehensive economic treaty within the CIS. This was the 
second, after the Belovezhskaya Pushcha shock of 1991, assertion 
of special relations within the CIS based on the "Slavic angle." 
  The rapid evolution of Ukraine's position on issues of a 
union with Russia deserves specific attention. As was noted, 
there have been deep disagreements between the two countries 
from the moment the CIS was created. They are for the most part 
derived from the most important issue, the dispute between 
Russia and Ukraine--in its present borders and with its varied 
combination of social-domestic, economic, and intellectual 
currents--regarding the future of their ethnocultural community. 
  Against this background, the announcement of President L. 
Kravchuk in the summer of 1993 regarding the possibility of 
reviewing the question of a political union of Slavic states 
which did not exclude their military cooperation, with the 
condition that a close economic bloc was created among them, 
must be evaluated soberly, taking into account the deteriorating 
economic and internal political situation in Ukraine. Kiev was 
forced to evaluate its dependence on preferential economic ties 
with Russia, above all related to the supply of energy media, 
more realistically. 
  The detachment of the Slavic subgroup of the CIS evoked an 
excessive response by the states of Central Asia, above all 
Kazakhstan. These states, experiencing the pull toward a union 
with Russia for security considerations, at the same time are 
developing the idea of consolidation on the regional level. A 
manifestation of this was the creation on 4 January 1993 of the 
Central-Asian Regional Commonwealth, which Russia was not a part 
of. 
  Moreover, the coalition states tried to consolidate the 
firmness of their positions toward Moscow and in a broader sense 
toward the non-Asian components of the CIS with as yet rather 
cautious probing of possibilities for establishing new relations 
with the states of the "far abroad" East--Turkey, Iran, the Arab 
countries, and China. 
  The situation which has taken shape highlights the 
difficulties remaining on the path toward integration in 
post-Soviet space. Clearcut conclusions concerning its prospects 
would hardly be appropriate. But given the delicacy of the 
balance of Russia's interests in relations with Ukraine, on the 
one hand, and with Kazakhstan, on the other, relying on a union 
of the three Slavic countries to the detriment of the rest seems 
questionable, although emotionally attractive. For a multitude 
of circumstances, Kazakhstan has many more objectively 
coinciding interests with Russia than it has with Ukraine. 
Consequently, at the very least it has the right to be 
considered a privileged partner of Russia, and the real status 
of relations with it should at least not be inferior to 
Russian-Ukrainian relations. 
<H8>  II </H8>
  The situation in the area of economic relations remains 
complicated. The agreement on the formation of the CIS was 
founded on the idea of the need to coordinate the actions of 
members of the Commonwealth in the economic and 
currency-financial spheres. But when the agreement was ratified 
in the Ukrainian parliament, amendments were made to 12 of the 
document's points, which in fact replaced "coordination of 
actions" with a vague appeal for "cooperation" among independent 
states. 
  Despite the obligations to guarantee "open borders, freedom 
of movement of citizens, and freedom of transfer of information 
within the Commonwealth" (Article 5 of the Minsk Agreement), the 
Ukrainian government began to restrict migration processes. The 
edicts of the Ukrainian President L. Kravchuk on creating a 
state customs committee and his unwillingness to postpone 
introduction of Ukraine's own currency and coupons demonstrated 
his resolve to move faster in reducing Ukraine's dependence on 
the former Union republics. The situation is peculiar because 
even the Russian leadership, following the recommendations of 
the IMF and the IBRD [International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development] and the policy of accelerating economic reforms, is 
not matching them against the potential of the other countries 
of the Commonwealth, and thereby plays against its stability. 
  Understanding of the discrepancy between the rate of Russian 
reforms and transformations in the other republics obviously 
largely determined Moscow's negative attitude toward the 
initiative of the president of Kazakhstan, N. Nazarbayev, to 
transform the CIS into the semblance of a confederation with 
unified coordinating-administrative structures, which had been 
promoted on the threshold of the meeting in Bishkek in October 
1992. Ukraine, Belorussia, Turkmenia, Uzbekistan, and Kirghizia 
also opposed Nazarbayev's plan. 
  The economic ties among the former republics were a 
pseudo-integration which did not reflect the real extent of 
their interdependence. Clear evidence of that is the failure of 
all attempts on the state level to preserve the economic ties 
among the republics. Most provisions of treaties on interstate 
deliveries of the most important types of output concluded by 
the governments were no more than 40-50 percent fulfilled in 
1992, and for some goods the situation was simply disgraceful: 
in the first 10 months Russia's enterprises shipped only 13 
percent of the amount of zinc covered by yearly agreements to 
the members of the CIS, Georgia, and the Baltic countries; 4 
percent of the refined copper; and 2 percent of the lead; while 
the shipment of tin and cobalt through interstate deliveries was 
not even begun. In turn the republics did not fulfill their 
obligations to Russia: during that same period only 6 percent of 
the stipulated level of gasoline was received from Belorussia, 
while less than 10 percent of the petroleum products was 
received from Turkmenia. During the entire year, Ukraine 
delivered only 2 percent of the stipulated volume of dairy 
products to Russia. 
  In other words, the integration pyramid which in the USSR 
did 
not rest on a strong foundation of mutually advantageous 
horizontal ties and transnational capital fell apart as soon as 
the fulcrum in the form of the center vanished. Relations among 
the post-Soviet states returned to a natural state, reflecting 
the real level of their economic and political development and 
varied individual interests. The United States and other foreign 
partners of the former Soviet republics must take this level 
into consideration. 
  Among the factors weakening integration at present are those 
related to the nonuniform socioeconomic development of the CIS 
members and the critical state of even the most developed of 
them. The need to concentrate increasingly more resources in 
order to resolve domestic problems (which in some states are 
rapidly becoming an ever-greater threat to their state 
integrity) forces the economic leaders of the Commonwealth, 
Russia and Ukraine, to reduce the volume of aid to the less 
developed states. This in turn induces the latter (above all the 
Central Asian states) to seek nontraditional partners, most of 
whom are outside the geographic borders of the former Union. 
  The varied speed and orientation of the reforms being 
conducted by the Commonwealth members and their comrades in the 
former USSR are accelerating the dissolution of unified economic 
space. Three models stand out: the radical model (the Baltic 
countries, Armenia, and Kirghizia), the cautious model (Ukraine 
and Kazakhstan), and the conservative model (Uzbekistan and 
Tajikistan). 
  Nor were inter-republic ties strengthened by the fact that 
even the freely set contract prices for output that Russia 
exports to the countries of the near abroad (above all energy 
resources) proved to be lower than the world level, while 
Russia's partners set prices for many goods Russia imports from 
the republics (cotton and sugar) at a level higher than world 
prices. Even Kazakhstan, which traditionally maintained stable 
relations with Russia, in early 1993 raised prices for grain 
supplied to the Russian Federation to a level exceeding world 
market prices. 
  As a result, it seems that it would have been more 
profitable 
for Russia to export raw materials not to the republics but 
outside the borders of the former USSR, and buy the goods needed 
to import there too. Considering that the overall losses which 
Russia incurred in 1992 in connection with price disproportions 
are estimated at 2 trillion rubles, the gain from such a 
reorientation of foreign trade would have been very significant. 
  The turning point to some extent was mid-February 1993, 
which 
was marked by the decision of the presidium of the Russian 
Federation government to switch to trade with all countries of 
the near abroad in prices accepted in world practice. At the 
same time it was proposed that Russia offer the CIS countries 
credits to pay off debts for deliveries of Russian energy media. 
  It is another matter that these steps put the governments of 
the republics which up to then had been trying to observe all 
the rules dictated by Moscow in order to avoid making prices for 
critical imports higher (for example, Belorussia) in a very 
difficult position. For them, in present conditions the economic 
wisdom of preserving the CIS is in many respects disappearing. 
  As the first year of the CIS's existence showed, a universal 
organizational mechanism of interaction in the present stage of 
development of the post-Soviet states could not be created 
successfully. Within the Commonwealth full accord is not found 
even on the basic issues: the draft of the CIS Charter was 
initialed in January 1993 by only seven members, and six of the 
republics signed the agreement on preserving the ruble zone in 
the fall of 1992. In light of that, not one of them (other than 
Belorussia), it became clear, intended to fulfill the 
obligations assumed to coordinate credit-monetary policy, which 
made keeping the ruble as the common currency extremely 
disadvantageous for Russia. 
  All this confirms that for objective reasons the CIS in the 
present stage has been unable to become an economic union of the 
states that emerged from the depths of the USSR. 
  Despite all the contradictory interests of the Commonwealth 
countries, the CIS nonetheless continues to exist. It is 
altogether likely that apart from the temporary and relative 
economic reasons for preserving the Commonwealth, there are 
political conditions forcing these states to keep together. 
<H8>  III </H8>
  At this time one may ponder three variants of the 
development 
of events. 
  First variant: The CIS acquires a more precise 
structure and other republics are drawn toward Russia. This 
scenario in all probability would be accompanied by Russia's 
taking a tougher approach to the Commonwealth and the need to 
ensure support for it on the part of the Russian periphery. 
  Second variant: Several subregional alliances with 
varying degrees of integration (economic, military-political, 
and so on) form within the CIS while observing the principle of 
inviolability of borders. The bilateral ties of the states 
constitute the basis of the subregional alliances. Essentially 
this variant describes the present condition of interrelations 
within the Commonwealth, and it may find increasing support on 
the part of the republics. But this form of the Commonwealth is 
unstable, since the situation in the republics is unstable. 
  Third variant: It is at least theoretically 
possible that a new political-economic formation could arise on 
the basis of the CIS, and regional associations which include 
adjacent areas of several former Union republics would claim the 
role of subjects in it on a par with the republics. 
  Chances that such an association may arise must not be 
exaggerated. But it is extremely important to follow the trends 
toward establishing a special form of direct ties among regions 
of the independent states of the CIS carefully, when the 
subjects of relations are, on the one hand, the central 
authorities of an independent state (the government of Ukraine, 
for example), and on the other, the administrations of the 
national-territorial formations which are part of the Russian 
Federation, for example Yakutia (the Republic of Sakha). Another 
example of this type is the Republic of Kazakhstan's treaties 
with Tataria and Bashkiria. Up to this point the government of 
Russia has not taken similar steps in relation to its partners 
in the CIS. However, there is every reason to consider them 
imminent and useful, at least in relation to regions of East 
Ukraine, the Crimea, oblasts of the North Black Sea Region, and 
the Dnester Region, which are drawn toward development of 
comprehensive ties with the Russian Federation. 
  But under all the scenarios for the development of the 
situation, it is obvious that the CIS does not have a chance in 
the foreseeable future of becoming a suprastate formation able 
to act collectively as a U.S. partner on the strategic, 
economic, and political issues of international relations. 
  Allowing perceptions of the USSR to be transferred by 
inertia 
to the Commonwealth of Independent States has continued to be 
significant for Washington for a fairly long time. Now and again 
it might have seemed that all American politicians related to 
the CIS more as a suprastate than an interstate formation, while 
for the Commonwealth countries themselves, undoubtedly including 
Russia, right from the start priority was very definitely given 
to precisely national sovereignty. 
  However, without questioning in principle the need to 
maintain the policy of cooperation with Moscow, the American 
side at the same time has not found sufficiently weighty 
arguments in favor of maintaining it on the level which the 
Soviet-American dialogue reached under M. S. Gorbachev. 
  But in the first months after the dissolution of the Soviet 
Union, at least two new elements in the approach to relations 
with the Russian abroad were denoted. The first was that at that 
point, apparently having overcome its doubts, the American 
leadership made the choice to take a bilateral approach to the 
states of the former USSR. In terms of terminology, this was 
reflected in abandoning the expanding use of the combination 
"CIS" and replacing it in official statements with the 
expression "new independent states," which earlier had been 
applied only to the former members of the Yugoslav federation 
(Croatia and Slovenia). 
  At the same time, however, the rejection of the 
"supra-country" approach to the states which were successors of 
the USSR illuminates political and other specifics of the 
present stage of development of each of them--either in terms of 
the path of liberal-pluralistic transformations or along the 
lines of protective efforts of one degree of stringency or 
another. Under this approach, the moral advantages of the 
"Russian path" for overcoming totalitarianism becomes clear and 
the "image of Russia" wins out and is enriched by positive 
features. 
  It is not accidental, and this is the second peculiarity of 
American policy, that the Clinton administration has taken an 
active stance toward the domestic processes on the territory of 
the former USSR, above all in Russia, openly and insistently 
announcing its support of the radical-reformist course of 
President B. Yeltsin and organizing international public opinion 
accordingly. The Russian-American summit meeting held in 
Vancouver in April 1993 was only a generalizing symbol of W. 
Clinton's new moral-political activism, and a return to the 
American policy of traditional ethical values and ideals which 
he promised was behind it. 
  Needless to say, demonstrations of solidarity with the 
democratic reforms in Russia must not be equated with actual 
U.S. readiness to devote primary attention in American foreign 
policy to Russian-American relations, such as was devoted to 
Soviet-American relations. Russia has not replaced the Soviet 
Union in American preferences, and in 1992 Russia's role in the 
hierarchy of American foreign policy priorities was perhaps even 
reduced. 
  Compared with the almost self-sufficient significance of 
Soviet-American political relations, Russian-American relations 
in the final stage of the Republican reign proved to be more 
like merely a derivative of U.S. interests on issues of the 
nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and military high 
technologies as well as weapons control. Washington's interest 
acquired a kind of "negative tone": The United States strictly 
defined what Russia should not be for it (the source of a new 
threat), but at the same time gave a very dim picture of its 
vision of Russia's possibly positive function in international 
relations. 
  The United States' decreased interest in cooperation with 
Moscow in this regard can hardly be attributed with any serious 
foundation to the "scattering" of cooperation among the states 
which were successors to the USSR. American aspirations in these 
states have been more and more openly colored by pragmatism and 
a classification as "secondary" in relation not only to the U.S. 
military-strategic and at times economic interests, but even to 
Russian-American relations, which still maintain the gloss of 
"special relations" which was acquired in the years of 
perestroyka. 
  Needless to say, in the future, depending on the evolution 
of 
the strategic and economic landscape of Central Eurasia, the 
independent interest which the post-Soviet states represent to 
the United States may increase substantially. 
  But today it is above all determined by the alarm over the 
prospects of the division of the USSR nuclear legacy among 
Russia and the three "seminuclear" republics. The U.S. position 
on this issue is quite definite: The appearance in Eurasia, as 
in any other part of the world, of new nuclear powers is not in 
American security interests, and Washington firmly intends to 
oppose it. Inasmuch as absolutely the same thing can be said 
about Russia too, there are very solid reasons for 
Russian-American partnership on the issue of nuclear 
nonproliferation. 
  U.S. concern primarily over the nuclear aspects of the 
strategic situation in Central Eurasia predetermines its 
interest in Russia's stabilizing relations with its most 
powerful neighbors in the CIS. Consequently, increased 
Russian-Ukrainian disagreements, especially if they turned into 
a serious conflict, would not suit American objectives. Taking 
into account the prospect of Ukraine becoming a fairly strong 
power, in Central European terms, and giving proper 
consideration to its potential, the American administration at 
the same time is a very long way from being ready to help Kiev 
implement its exaggerated claims to a new world-political 
status, especially since for more than a year now the primary 
means of realizing these claims continues to be opposing Russian 
policies for demonstrative purposes. 
  Under no circumstances would alienation and tension in 
Russia's relations with its Slavic neighbors and Kazakhstan 
satisfy American interests until that indefinite time when the 
question of their acquiring nonnuclear status is fully and 
affirmatively answered. Based on that, the American 
administration is not inclined to encourage centrifugal and 
disintegrational tendencies in the geostrategic space of the 
former USSR. At the same time, however, the United States' 
active interest in the situation in the CIS is largely exhausted 
by nuclear-strategic problems. 
  The already armed conflicts developing between the new 
independent states of Asia which are free of nuclear weapons 
(Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, and Tajikistan), for example, not 
only fail to arouse Washington's active interest, but are even 
definite evidence of its desire to distance itself from the 
prospects of involvement at even the very lowest level. In these 
cases, the United States demonstrates a fairly favorable 
attitude toward the actions of Russia, which has been impelled 
to take the role of conflict-stopping device using force by 
virtue of the actual involvement of its armed forces in combat 
actions. The positions of these parts of the CIS, above all 
Armenia, Tajikistan, and other Central Asian republics which 
consider Russia's military guarantees a pledge of their own 
territorial integrity, give additional reasons for the American 
administration to be loyal on this issue. 
  But the U.S. attitude toward the situation in the European 
parts of the former USSR--in this case we mean the nonnuclear 
countries of the Baltics and Moldavia--is fundamentally 
different. Because of historically traditional factors (the 
circumstances of these states becoming part of the Russian 
Empire, their second absorption by the Soviet Union, and 
American public opinion's assessment of both), Washington reacts 
heatedly to the "residual projection" of Russian military might 
in these territories. Here we can hardly speak of the American 
administration's good will toward the Russian presence. 
  On the contrary, the question of the American perception of 
Russian armed forces in the territory of the Baltic Region and 
Moldavia, the withdrawal of which the governments of these 
countries are trying to ensure (in the latter case, with varying 
insistency), continues to sting. But there is reason to assume 
that the United States' principled support of their demands will 
not become a serious problem in Russian-American relations if 
Russia's diplomacy is consistent and insistent in explaining the 
temporary nature of the Russian troops' stay there, as well as 
the economic and organizational reasons delaying their 
withdrawal. 
  There are sufficient reasons to explain the delay in 
withdrawing troops from Moldavia and the Dnester Region: the 
clear desire of the Left Bank population; the role of the 
Russian Army in preventing a major internal Moldavian conflict; 
and, finally, the high probability of the repetition of such a 
conflict. 
  The question of Russia's military presence in the Baltic 
region is more complicated. Diplomats' arguments will remain in 
limbo if they are not reinforced with concrete steps--steady 
progress in the withdrawal of Russian troops to their own 
national territory in a realistic but not too distant period of 
time reconciled diplomatically with the governments of the 
Baltic states. Appropriate in this sense would be parallel 
contacts with and information support of American diplomats on 
progress in the Russian side's negotiations with the Baltic 
countries, so to speak organized working contact between Russia 
and the United States on issues of cutting back the Russian 
military presence in the Baltic Region. 
  There is hardly any use in clearly and rigidly linking the 
question of postponing the withdrawal of troops with the ethnic 
discrimination laws of Latvia and Estonia, especially in a 
dialogue with the United States, as was already done in a fit of 
temper. Russia has a fairly broad set of other means to 
influence Riga and Tallinn without the use of force--from making 
the customs and visa system tougher to measured and selective 
economic pressure on the governments of both countries. 
Moreover, these methods are likely to arouse incomparably less 
of an "allergic" reaction in Western public opinion than the 
question of Russian troops, which have not ceased to be a 
frightening symbol for Europe and the United States. 
  However, the question of U.S. involvement in cooperation 
with 
Russia on legal rights problems, which for Moscow is directly 
connected to the question of violation of the rights of Russians 
and the ethnic communities of Latvia and Estonia oriented in the 
cultural sense to Russia (the Ukrainian and Jewish communities), 
requires much more attention than it has now. It is precisely 
under a Democratic administration that the chances for such 
cooperation seem favorable. 
  Russia may in fact compete with Latvia and Estonia on the 
question of whether their national standards for insuring human 
rights meet international standards and has every chance of 
finding itself in a more advantageous position. Russia's loyalty 
to democratic transformations combined with a democratic 
leadership and public organizations, including Jewish ones, may 
at least theoretically create favorable prospects in the United 
States for coordinated influence on both Baltic countries in 
order to convince them to abandon discriminatory practice toward 
persons of nonnative nationality.

  [Text] In April 1993, an analytical report entitled 
"Priorities of the United States in the New Abroad" was prepared 
at the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of the United 
States and Canada under the general direction of Doctor of 
Historical Sciences Professor V. A. Kremenyuk. We present the 
second article prepared on the basis of this report to readers' 
attention (the first article was printed in SSHA-EPI, No 12, 
1993). 
<H5>  Second Article </H5>
<H8>  IV </H8>
  Since the start of 1992, the U.S. administration has begun 
to 
grant aid and strengthen economic ties with the CIS countries on 
a large scale. In the 1992 fiscal year, the governmental Agency 
for International Development spent 235 million dollars for 
these purposes. In 1993 the U.S. government allocated 417 
million in accordance with a law supporting freedom adopted in 
the summer of 1992 and another 412 million in the form of 
outright food aid to Russia, Armenia, Georgia, Moldova, Belarus, 
Kyrgyzstan, and Turkmenistan. Apart from that, in order to 
expand crediting of the former Soviet republics by the 
International Monetary Fund, the United States increased its 
contribution to the IMF in 1992 by 12 billion dollars and agreed 
to contribute half of the 6 billion dollars earmarked to form a 
currencies stabilization fund in the new states on the territory 
of the former Soviet Union. 
  A distinctive feature of the new stage in U.S. 
trade-economic 
ties with the sovereign republics is the organization of direct 
contacts with their authorities. In our opinion it was not the 
particular interests of the United States which played the 
decisive role in selecting such an approach, but the actions of 
the republics themselves, which (for objective reasons too) 
demonstrated an inability to create a strong economic union in 
the current stage of their development. 
  With the rare exception, not one of the republics is given 
preference on the official level either as a recipient of 
American humanitarian and technical aid or as a potential trade 
partner or object of investment (the negative example of 
Azerbaijan, which by an amendment to the law on support of 
freedom was deprived of the right to receive humanitarian aid in 
1993, may perhaps serve as the only exception). Although the 
link between the support granted to the republics and their 
resolve to carry out economic reforms was made very clear, the 
administration's representatives are successfully avoiding 
categorical assessments and preferences. 
  One can speak of the lack of privileges for certain states, 
however, only in relation to emergency humanitarian aid. But as 
to the rest, the priority of relations with certain of the 
post-Soviet republics shows quite clearly through the formal 
equivalence of U.S. economic ties with all the post-Soviet 
republics. Russia is undoubtedly given first place, and 
military-strategic considerations played no less a role in this 
than purely economic factors. Moreover, taking into account that 
"the democrats in the Kremlin cost less than nuclear missiles," 
the United States has been inclined to concessions to Russia 
which the other states of the former USSR have been unable to 
expect. 
  For example, the IMF, in which the United States plays the 
leading role, has never applied to Russia the rigorous rules 
used when granting credits to Latvia and Estonia (the annual 
total of loans to both countries was divided into four equal 
parts, and every 3 months the Fund would check to see whether 
the governments were complying with the conditions placed on 
them and only then would the next 25 percent of the 
appropriations be allocated). For these same reasons, the United 
States pays greater attention to the other "nuclear" republics, 
especially Ukraine and Kazakhstan. 
  Apart from the United States' interest in preserving 
stability in Russia and Ukraine, the special nature of relations 
with these republics is also the result of their significance to 
the economy of the United States itself (Russia accounts for 
more than half of the American exports to the former Soviet 
Union). After Russia and Ukraine delayed payments on American 
food credits in the winter of 1993, the U.S. deputy secretary of 
agriculture, J. Omar, was compelled to acknowledge: "Washington 
needs a program to guarantee continued sales of American grain 
to Russia and Ukraine, since the United States cannot afford to 
lose those markets." 
  The interests of business also determine the distribution of 
direct foreign investment in the former Soviet economy. From 
September 1991 through September 1992, the volume of influx of 
foreign capital investments included the following: 9.1 billion 
dollars to Kazakhstan, 7 billion to Russia, 237 million to 
Lithuania, 197 million to Ukraine, 159 million to Latvia, 88 
million to Estonia, and 40 million dollars to Azerbaijan. 
  The list of former Soviet republics (excepting the Baltic 
countries) which used short-term credits from the U.S. 
Export-Import Bank in 1992 to finance American exports is very 
similar to the previous list. They included Belarus, Kazakhstan, 
Uzbekistan, Russia, and Ukraine. The group of countries which in 
1992 signed agreements with the U.S. Department of Commerce also 
differed only slightly in make-up: Armenia, Russia, Belarus, 
Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Moldova. But even so there 
were undisputed favorites among these republics. In order to 
determine them, it is sufficient to pay attention to the 
selection of sites for offices of organizations overseeing 
American technical aid to the former Soviet Union. 
  During the last year, the Agency for International 
Development opened offices in Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, 
Armenia, and Ukraine and has been preparing a project focused on 
the conversion of the military industry of the CIS countries. 
Special groups of advisors whose job includes creating a 
favorable climate for attracting American investments in the 
conversion of the defense industry will be sent once again to 
Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. It was precisely to those three 
countries where American farmers were also sent in 1992, which 
marked the beginning of a new project (at a cost of 30 million 
dollars) for development of farming in the Commonwealth states. 
  But the public democracy corps, which is largely engaged in 
offering services to experienced American businessmen in the 
area of production, marketing, finances, privatization, and 
creation of new firms, had only one office, in Moscow, and 
planned to open them in Kiev and Alma-Ata. It is symptomatic 
that in late 1992 when the American Bar Association held a 
conference on foreign investments in the former USSR, the topic 
was limited to only three republics: Russia, Ukraine, and 
Kazakhstan. Incidentally, the United States signed agreements 
allowing companies and their employees to avoid dual taxation on 
their income only with these three countries. This created one 
of the main conditions necessary for successful movement of 
American capital into those markets. 
  All this illustrates that in the near future it is precisely 
Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan which will remain the focus of 
the United States' economic policy in the former USSR. U.S. 
military-strategic interests and the priorities of American 
business which is interested in these states' markets and 
natural resources also prompt this choice. Armenia and 
Kyrgyzstan will most likely be next in terms of significance, 
without counting the Baltic states. Armenia, to a significant 
extent because of the efforts of the Armenian lobby, which is 
fairly influential in the United States, as well as the result 
of the consistent implementation of radical economic reform. 
Kyrgyzstan, exclusively because of the resolve shown by the 
government to build a democratic market economy in the shortest 
possible time. And in both cases the state interests of the 
United States, which is trying to acquire as an ally a country 
founded on similar economic principles, proved to be more 
significant than the interests of private capital in both the 
Transcaucasus and Central Asia. 
<H8>  V </H8>
  The American administration's general principles in relation 
to the CIS will of course be adjusted with consideration of the 
specifics of U.S. relations with the particular countries and 
the particular features of the situation within and surrounding 
them. At this time, though, one can speak of clearcut American 
priorities only with some qualification. 
<H8>  The United States' Approach to the European Part of the New </H8>
Abroad 
  U.S. policy toward the particular states of post-Soviet 
space 
is built with consideration of several key circumstances. The 
first and most obvious is the state of deep political and 
socioeconomic crisis of these states. The second is the critical 
question of the violation of human rights in them, including the 
rights of the Russian minority and minorities oriented to 
Russia. And finally, the third is the intertwining domestic 
policy and foreign policy aspects of relations within the CIS, 
which always causes suspicion and disorients U.S. policy in 
relation to Russia and its former "little brothers" in the 
Union, who are extremely scrupulous about what affects their new 
powers in the international political sphere, whose meaning they 
do not grasp very clearly yet. Meanwhile, the United States 
itself in one way or another keeps track of the shaping of the 
new states' foreign policy priorities, although in practically 
everything which is outside nuclear concerns it takes the 
position of an observer who is not specially interested. 
  The U. S. noninvolvement is promoted by the situation in the 
new foreign countries themselves. Like the former socialist 
countries of Eastern Europe which right after the "velvet 
revolutions" plunged away from the USSR to the West, the new 
post-Soviet states, on the one hand, are at a loss and shocked 
by the independence hurled down upon them, and on the other, are 
unable to find the right tone in negotiations with foreign 
partners, and not only Moscow. They typically have exaggerated 
expectations of aid from the advanced countries, which are not 
ready to use their own assistance to compensate for the 
republics' ill-considered disruption of ties with Russia. 
  The idea of a "sanitary cordon" on western Russian borders 
is 
also questioned in the United States, since it is customary in 
Washington to consider the guarantee against rebirth of the 
"Russian question" to be involving Russia in ties with the 
outside world rather than isolating it (this idea, when meeting 
for the most part ignorance in the West, is used to attempt to 
clumsily manipulate the diplomats of, for example, Estonia). 
  People in the United States take a more cautious attitude 
toward the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic 
Region. At the same time, however, it is precisely in these 
countries that American representatives have encountered the 
problem of infringement on the rights of the Russian minority on 
the level of state policy in a more open form. The laws on 
citizenship adopted by Estonia and Latvia are discriminatory by 
international criteria. As experience already accumulated shows, 
the most balanced instrument for resolving the problems of the 
Russian minorities in these countries is to involve 
international organizations (the CSCE [Conference on Security 
and Cooperation in Europe] and the United Nations), that is to 
say, to internationalize the problems. In this sense even the 
United States can play an important role by supporting Russia's 
position or, on the contrary, refusing to do so. On the whole, 
the Baltic Region is an "awkward" region for American diplomacy. 
  Settling the question of relations of the international 
community with Ukraine is almost more complicated. 
Despite the fact that Ukraine's failure to sign the Union Treaty 
was one of the main reasons (or rather pretexts) for the breakup 
of the USSR, the prospects for Ukraine's future participation in 
the Commonwealth are not predetermined. While in the political 
and military area, Ukraine's line suggests its intentions to 
become completely sovereign, the extremely bad situation in the 
economy spurs it to restore interdependence under conditions 
which are within the framework of relations of sovereign states. 
  Despite the absence of a real military threat to Europe on 
Ukraine's part, the scale of unsettled military-strategic 
questions, above all problems of nuclear weapons control on 
Ukrainian territory, makes this sphere of Russian-Ukrainian 
relations a high potential risk zone going beyond the geographic 
borders of the former Union space. The United States takes a 
very guarded attitude toward the chances of Ukraine's possible 
refusal to join the Treaty on Nonproliferation of Nuclear 
Weapons as a nonnuclear state. 
  The scope and significance of disagreements between Russia 
and Ukraine in the military field seem to dictate the need for 
and feasibility of internationalization of the solution of these 
questions through the joint efforts of Russia and the leading 
countries of the West, above all the United States, within the 
framework of treaties concluded. The Eastern European factor may 
be used in regulating Russian-Ukrainian disagreements, including 
in the military field; this means joint efforts by Russia and 
Poland, Hungary, Czechia, and Slovakia, which have an interest 
in preserving unified control over nuclear weapons on the 
territory of the former Union. 
  The measured and orderly internationalization of the most 
highly controversial questions of bilateral (or multilateral) 
relations among the former republics is allowable. At the same 
time, however, in realizing this principle it should be 
considered that a constitutional crisis reflected either in the 
opposition of the federal and local level authorities or in 
discrepancies between national laws and the acts of local 
parliaments is to a certain extent present in each of the 
European countries of the new Russian abroad. 
  A face-off between the executive and legislative branches of 
power is typical of Ukraine just as it is of Russia. A similar 
problem exists in the Republic of Belarus. Because there is no 
strict delimitation of powers for resolving international 
questions, the governments and parliaments of these countries at 
times fail to coordinate certain aspects of bilateral relations. 
  Contacts among the states have taken the form of 
"multichannel direct interaction." The governments, parliaments, 
local authorities, and subjects of the federation (for the 
Russian Federation) and even certain ministries and private 
business groups of one republic deal directly with partners of 
the corresponding level in another. And they consider themselves 
tenuously bound by the official postures of their countries, 
especially since sometimes there simply is no single posture. 
  Thus, despite the worsening of intergovernmental 
Russian-Ukrainian relations in connection with questions of the 
status of Sevastopol and the division of the Black Sea Fleet, 
the primary area of confrontation has all the same been in the 
parliaments of the two countries, whereas the municipal 
authorities of Kiev and Moscow, claiming a right to participate 
in settling the interstate dispute, have attempted to take 
conciliatory postures. 
  A similar situation is observed in relations with the Baltic 
countries. Despite a tougher Russian line applied to the Baltic 
countries, certain Russian ministries and import-export 
companies continue to step up economic ties with Estonia and 
Latvia, lessening the results of Russia's diplomatic attempts to 
influence the Baltic governments. 
<H8>  The Asian Perimeter </H8>
  In devoting special attention to Kazakhstan, the 
United States proceeds from the idea that this country's 
potential combined with its political stability allows it to 
expect the status of one of the main components in the regional 
balance of forces. Like Ukraine, Kazakhstan is formally a 
nuclear power and will possibly be so for a relatively long time 
yet. 
  President N. Nazarbayev links his position on the question 
of 
the future of nuclear missiles on his country's territory with 
receiving guarantees from the nuclear powers, Russia, China, and 
the United States. But, as far as one can judge, the president 
considers the course of a potential strategic threat not to be a 
direct conflict with one of these three powers, but rather a 
hypothetical conflict among them where the nuclear objects on 
Kazakhstan's territory could be under attack. 
  The challenges to Kazakhstan's security are now obvious. 
Above all they include the extremely unstable military-political 
situation in the neighboring republics of Central Asia, which is 
only a narrow wedge separating Kazakhstan from the regions of 
direct political and military confrontation and rivalry in the 
India-Pakistan-Afghanistan-Tajikistan-Iran polygon. President 
Nazarbayev, who is actively developing a "southern policy," 
favors preserving the Soviet, multinational, and cooperation 
variant of modernization. Neither communist nor Islamic 
fundamentalism is congenial to him. Although Kazakhstan does not 
emphasize its differences from its southern neighbors in this 
regard, it does not hide them either. Naturally, for such an 
independent course confidence in one's own defense preparedness 
is by no means a luxury. 
  It is doubtful that people in Alma-Ata fear the nuclear 
potential of their powerful eastern neighbor, China. First, 
overall China has shown restraint and caution on questions of 
nuclear policy. Secondly, this country, let us not forget, has 
repeatedly demonstrated the ability to use military pressure 
without resorting to nuclear power in past decades. In 
establishing diplomatic relations with China, Alma-Ata promised 
not to harp on nationality questions (above all that means 
influencing peoples related to Kazakhs in the Chinese province 
of Xinjiang). But what if a wave rolls out from Chinese 
territory? People in Beijing and in Alma-Ata are thinking about 
that, and not without reason. 
  Kazakhstan's significance as a stabilizing factor of the 
regional situation is clearly increasing. It is becoming 
Moscow's main Asian ally. And to one extent or another, its 
significance to the United States and all powers in one way or 
another interested in regional stability is increasing. 
  The republics of the Transcaucasus until recently 
did not draw the specific attention of the United States, 
apparently because of its limited economic interest in this 
region as well as the extremely unstable political situation. 
The concentration in a relatively small space of two fullfledged 
wars (the Abkhaz and Karabakh wars) and at least two smoldering 
conflicts (the Georgian-South Ossetian and Lezghian-Azeri 
conflicts) and tense Armenian-Georgian relations makes the 
Transcaucasus an altogether unattractive site for investing 
capital and, on the contrary, makes the country want to distance 
itself from the events occurring there when possible. 
  But the United States maintains diplomatic relations with 
the 
Transcaucasian republics and follows the development of regional 
conflicts, above all the Armenian-Azeri conflict. And 
Washington's position is taking shape under the influence of 
both pro-Armenian sympathies prompted by the Armenian diaspora 
in the United States and a firm intention to adapt its line from 
the standpoint of such an important U.S. ally in the region as 
Turkey, which supports Azerbaijan on the Karabakh question. 
  After starting in the late 1980s from a general expression 
of 
support of nations' right to self-determination, which could 
also be interpreted as an expression of loyalty to the 
irredentist aspirations of the Karabakh Armenians, recently the 
United States has definitely been inclined to understanding the 
impossibility of a civilized solution of the conflict on the 
basis of territorial changes. 
  Information indicating the presence of uncompromising 
sentiments in Yerevan and Stepanakert which the United States 
received through its own (after an American office was opened in 
Baku) and independent international sources as well as the 
active offensive operations of both Armenian sides (Armenia 
itself and the forces of Karabakh) in the area of the Lachin 
Corridor, control over which opens the way to the actual 
annexation of Karabakh by Armenia, played a role in the 
evolution of American policy. Against the background of 
Azerbaijan's obvious military failures, the model of Armenia as 
a victim of aggression, which from the start had a strong 
influence on American policy, has markedly paled. 
  Finally, the real contours of the threat to Armenia from 
Azerbaijan and Turkey have also been revealed. It seems that 
Ankara is able to show sufficient restraint in relation to the 
conflict and even help alleviate the standoff, including by 
means of humanitarian aid and deliveries of energy media to 
Armenia. And Azerbaijan still obviously does not have the real 
potential to decisively defeat the Armenian forces in Karabakh. 
In this situation, American diplomacy has shifted the focus to 
the need for a political solution of the dispute while complying 
with the principle of territorial integrity. 
  The American evaluation of the conflicts in Georgia has been 
constructed in a similar key. After Gamsakhurdiya was overthrown 
and E. Shevardnadze came to power, the situation in 
Georgian-American relations improved somewhat. Georgia's 
prestige also rose in American public opinion after a largely 
satisfactory settlement of the conflict in South Ossetia with 
Russia's mediation which was reached while preserving the 
principle of Georgia's territorial integrity, something the 
Georgian side had stubbornly sought to have respected. 
  Apparently not without taking into account the experience of 
the South Ossetia settlement, the United States was developing 
its approach to the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict as a conflict 
within Georgia, while the North Caucasus national radicals, who 
did not feel the proper limiting influence of Russia, try to 
turn it into a clash between the peoples of the Adighe group and 
Georgia. The development of the situation was significantly 
influenced by the leaders of Chechnya, who encouraged 
anti-Georgian activism, and the overthrown president 
Gamsakhurdiya, who influenced the situation through his numerous 
supporters in Mengrelia, whose territory the Georgian-Abkhaz 
conflict touches. In addition, under pressure of the 
national-republic lobby in the former Supreme Soviet, Russia in 
fact took Abkhazia's side, although it also officially 
restricted the role of its regular armed forces to a 
peace-keeping function. However, that was not an obstacle to the 
armed intervention in the conflict by volunteer North Caucasian 
formations financed, according to Western information, by 
Chechnya and the nationalist forces of the North Caucasus 
republics. 
  In such a situation the probability of a Russian-Georgian 
conflict rose sharply, and that would have been completely 
unjustified either by Russia's long-term geopolitical interests 
or by the distribution of political forces in the North 
Caucasus. It was especially important to Russia to provide 
coordinated pressure both on the Georgian leadership and on the 
Abkhaz radicals in order to force both sides to negotiate 
conditions for settling the situation and substantially 
expanding Abkhazia's rights while unconditionally affirming 
Georgia's territorial integrity. 
  The Central Asian republics, Kyrgyzstan, 
Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan, are of interest to the 
United States for the most part in three spheres: exploiting 
resource wealth--from uranium to oil and gas, promoting the 
formation of a political base of development along a moderately 
pluralistic and secular path, and preventing the escalation of 
local conflict to the scale of a regional war. And the balance 
of American interests in relation to these states can hardly be 
considered fixed. 
  As for the U.S. attitude toward local political forces, 
there 
is more caution in it than optimism. In any case the initially 
clear focus in American statements on the need to promote 
democratic, including national-and Islamic-democratic, trends in 
the region in late 1992 has become markedly dampened and 
American policy itself more restrained and less definite. 
  The resolution of the critical situation in Kabul affects 
the 
prospects of the regional situation very seriously. The contours 
of the triple Tajik-Afghan-Russian conflict in fact began to 
take shape after the attack in July 1993 by the forces of Tajik 
opposition from bases on Afghan territory and with the support 
of Afghanistan's armed forces. A specific feature here was that 
it was unclear to what degree the support of the military 
actions against the Russian armed forces on Tajikistan's 
territory could be considered a stable element of Kabul's 
foreign policy. 
  For Afghanistan, the question of maintaining Tajikistan's 
independence is most closely linked to the question of the ratio 
of the Pushtu and Tajik components in the country. A drastic 
change in the balance in favor of the Tajiks in the event, say, 
of the creation of an Afghan-Tajik federation would undoubtedly 
raise the question of the territorial unity of Afghanistan 
itself, since the Pushtus are unlikely to reconcile themselves 
to the prospect of becoming a minority in the country in which 
they have traditionally tried to dominate. But the prospect of a 
new territorial division in this region inevitably affects the 
interests of many neighboring powers, and indirectly those of 
the United States. Nonetheless, during the latest aggravation of 
the situation, Washington has chosen waiting tactics and shown 
no desire to take an active stance toward what is happening. 
<H8>  VI </H8>
  Throughout the entire postwar period, the American 
orientation was actually primary in the Soviet Union's foreign 
policy, although relations with the socialist countries were 
formally declared basic. It was another matter that the 
importance of relations with the United States was interpreted 
negatively, through the prism of the American military threat, 
Soviet-American rivalry, and the expansion of American 
imperialism. In this sense the period of perestroyka (1985-1991) 
differed from the preceding decades only by the degree of its 
negativism, which was initially perceived weakly and almost 
brought to the level of a neutral-interest attitude in the final 
stage of the USSR's existence. 
  The affirmation of new, encouraging prospects in 
Russian-American relations after August 1991 was not simple even 
for the ruling elite to interpret. It turned out that not only 
did the radical-nationalist and communist factions of society 
fiercely protest against the complete elimination of the factor 
of rivalry with the United States from the new Russian policy, 
but even a significant part of the centrist and even openly 
liberal forces experienced some psychological trauma from the 
altogether unusual role of the "complaisant" partner in which 
Russian diplomacy found itself. 
  At the same time, the radical-democratic wing was not able 
to 
persuasively substantiate the need for all-out consolidation of 
the partnership with Washington. Reacting to accusations of the 
"excessive globalization" of Russia's foreign policy, which in 
mass consciousness was equated with its "pro-American 
orientation," the government took the path of moving the United 
States out of first place in Russian foreign policy preferences, 
at times giving it to Europe associated with German aid (most of 
1992) and at times to the CIS states (roughly since the fall of 
1992). These fluctuations reflected the intuitive response of 
practical diplomats to the impossibility of effectively 
distributing efforts without having clear priorities, and at the 
same time their inability to substantiate priorities from the 
standpoint of the new demands and inclinations in a society 
which originated from the period of rejection of the Soviet 
legacy and felt altogether unable to create a new legacy. 
  The U.S. role in the Soviet Union's foreign policy took 
shape 
from at least three main components: first, the factor of a 
global nuclear conflict and the threat to the security of the 
USSR and its allies, a group viewed broadly, including, 
sometimes without proper reason, many developing states which 
were not of direct interest to the USSR (Nicaragua, Cuba, and 
the countries of Black Africa); secondly, the potential of 
American influence on international economic organizations and 
world economic ties on the whole, the condition of which "in the 
nonsocialist sectors" had a fundamental effect on the Soviet 
Union's potential, despite its economic autarky and the 
existence of the "iron curtain"; thirdly, strictly bilateral 
Soviet-American relations whose significance should never have 
been overestimated because of the low level of development of 
economic ties. Only humanitarian and cultural contacts had a 
certain significance in bilateral relations. 
  Given the existence of this structure of Soviet-American 
relations, it is not surprising that Russian public opinion, 
based on the elimination of the nuclear threat in its American 
embodiment, was spontaneously inclined to conclude that Russian 
policy generally had less "need" for the United States, which is 
altogether compatible with how American society began to give 
much less attention to the "Russian question" when it was 
convinced that the "Soviet danger" had disappeared. This view, 
however, which is encountered even among experts, seems at the 
least inadequate. 
  The United States retains its significance as a most 
important partner of Russia on questions of its national 
security. That positive change in Russia's security which in 
fact occurred affected only one thing, the global level of the 
threat of war. Nonetheless, there is no reason to believe that 
the nuclear problem has been completely eliminated in the 
military sense as such. It continues to exist on regional levels 
in the form of many unsolved questions related to the possession 
of nuclear weapons (China, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus) and 
to stubborn and obviously unsuccessful attempts to acquire them 
(India and Pakistan) and active preparatory work in this same 
direction (Iran, Iraq, North Korea, and Israel). 
  The potential of these challenges fits better on a regional 
scale. But for precisely that reason, it can directly threaten 
the security of Russia rather than of the United States. 
However, without cooperation with Washington, that is, to speak 
plainly, without the United States' support of Russia, neither 
questions of reinforcing the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons 
system nor of eliminating the consequences of the dispersal of 
the nuclear potential among four former USSR republics will be 
resolved. 
  This is especially clearly seen using the example of the 
situation with nuclear weapons in the CIS. Ukraine, Belarus, and 
Kazakhstan have announced their desire for nonnuclear status. 
But fundamental difficulties of both a political and an 
economic-financial and technical nature constantly arise in 
questions of its realization. It is quite difficult to establish 
a precise balance among them. Most likely the balance is not the 
same in certain republics, just as their positions regarding 
nuclear disarmament are not the same. But the fact that with 
obviously similar problems related to eliminating nuclear 
weapons, all three republics are in fact following three 
different courses (Ukraine--offensive, Kazakhstan--moderately 
restrained, and Belarus--definitely constructive) makes one 
ponder the dominance of political motives in the formulation of 
the approaches of Kiev, Alma-Ata, and Minsk toward the nuclear 
problem. 
  It may be assumed that for Ukraine this represents its 
desire 
to master the new and attractive role of an altogether 
independent subject of international relations in an all-out and 
demonstrative way, a task which according to the Ukrainian 
leadership's logic is more effectively feasible through a 
dialogue with Washington, but in no way with Moscow. It is no 
accident that all the declarations on nuclear policy have been 
made at the same time as the Ukrainian-American negotiations. 
  The same motive surely exists in Kazakhstan's actions, 
although in a much more proper form. President N. Nazarbayev 
also preferred to lay the foundations of his nuclear policy 
during a visit to Washington rather than in his own capital. But 
in this case the most important thing is still not the 
"demonstrative aspect." For Kazakhstan, there are considerable 
real fears that the country may be pulled into a regional war in 
the event the conflict in Tajikistan escalates with involvement 
of Afghanistan and Uzbekistan, not to mention the mightier 
neighboring powers. 
  As for Belarus, its constructive and definite response to 
questions on reinforcing nonnuclear status is most likely above 
all a means of raising its international prestige as a strictly 
peace-loving state and at the same time a means of stabilizing 
ties with Russia, which obviously remains a preferential partner 
in Belorussian priorities. 
  In this way, the three new nuclear powers, although to 
different degrees, clearly show the desire to coordinate their 
policies on defense questions not only with Russia and not even 
so much with Russia as with the United States. A paradoxical 
situation takes shape where Moscow is forced to influence the 
Ukrainian position not directly but through interaction in the 
United States, and this path proves to be the only effective 
one. However, a nonnuclear Ukraine means security and stability 
above all for Russia, and then for Europe, the world, and so on. 
  The significance of the American factor in nonnuclear 
questions of Russia's security is less pronounced but completely 
obvious. That means regional conflicts within the geostrategic 
space of the former USSR, the two Caucasian (Karabakh and 
Abkhazia) and one Central Asian (Tajikistan) conflicts. Despite 
Russia's desire to distance itself from them, Russian army units 
have in fact participated in combat actions. However, it is 
altogether obvious that Russia will be unable to effectively 
fulfill its slightly ambiguous "buffer" role if it encounters 
tough opposition by the international community, above all the 
United States and Europe. Consequently, the factor of mutual 
understanding with Western partners on questions of regional 
conflict is a most important condition of the effectiveness of 
its efforts in consolidating the borders which still are not 
fully demarcated and equipped and are pervious to destabilizing 
waves coming from the near abroad. 
  A critical question is mutual understanding with the United 
States in the humanitarian area, which is becoming increasingly 
important in Russian foreign policy as awareness grows of the 
problem of the rights of Russian communities which were isolated 
outside Russia's borders after the dissolution of the USSR. This 
question has many facets. But most likely the aspect of it 
related to the violation of the rights of Russians in the Baltic 
is more sensitive and at the same time more difficult to 
interpret. The complex history of Russia's relations with Latvia 
and Estonia[.sup]2[/] makes explaining the attempts of 
representatives of the indigenous nationalities to create 
guarantees for preserving their identity emotionally 
understandable. But these attempts have taken on 
antihumanitarian, unfair forms of actual discrimination on the 
ethnic principle. The link between the question of Russians' 
rights and the presence of Russian troops in the Baltic Region 
may seem controversial. But a clear Russian-American mutual 
understanding of the need for effective peaceful influence on 
Latvia and Estonia in order to convince them to stop 
constructing a Baltic variant of apartheid must appear. 
  But in speaking of the link of Russian policy in the 
countries of the former USSR with Russian-American relations 
overall, one must certainly mention that the CIS states' being 
made paramount in Russian foreign policy priorities in fact 
works to preserve a consistently high, preferential role of 
relations with the United States. Russia is no longer able to 
achieve stabilization and the establishment of peace in its 
closest international neighbors without American support. 
  Relations with the United States have obviously lost the 
role 
of a unique kind of end in themselves for Moscow 
policy, as they were in the Soviet era. For democratic Russia, 
they have acquired the significance of a most powerful 
means to achieve national goals in the sphere of 
international relations, and without that means, as experience 
shows, it is difficult and in some cases unrealistic to expect 
the success of Russian undertakings in direct proximity to 
Russia's state borders in post-Soviet space, where chances are 
now concentrated to overcome the economic crisis and consolidate 
the political stability of the Russian Federation.

"Possibilities for Foreign Investment in Russia, Ukraine, 
Belarus, and Kazakhstan"] 
  [Text] Economic affairs in Russia have been accompanied by 
unique changes in recent years. These changes have seemed 
chaotic at times, but now they are clearly taking the form of a 
system contributing to economic stability. Although this 
stabilization still requires a great deal of time, we can 
already ascertain the emergence of the most important market 
elements of the future system, primarily in the spheres of 
property relations, privatization, credit and monetary policy, 
and foreign trade relations. 
  What kind of opportunities can these changes offer foreign 
businessmen in Russia and other CIS countries? The following is 
an analysis of these possibilities, based on studies by the 
International Construction Institute and the International 
Economic and Political Research Institute of the Russian Academy 
of Sciences. 
<H5>  Foreign Investment in Russian Economy </H5>
  Russian laws have allowed the creation of joint ventures 
within Russia since 1987, and the Law of the RSFSR of 4 July 
1991 "On Foreign Investment in the RSFSR" also allowed 
enterprises with 100-percent foreign participation. 
  On 1 July 1993 there were 9,125 joint ventures registered in 
Russia, and around 4,000 of them had been formed in the 
preceding three months. The combined capital stock of the 
enterprises amounted to 62.7 billion rubles, including 7.56 
billion dollars in foreign capital (data for 1 April 1993). This 
amount, however, does not exceed 4 percent of the value of the 
fixed capital of all Russian enterprises. Additions of new 
foreign capital to capital stock increased 3.9-fold in the first 
quarter of 1993. 
  The joint ventures still produce only around 0.7 percent of 
the gross output and employ only 0.3 percent of the able-bodied 
population. It is interesting that in spite of the general slump 
in production (by 30 percent during the period from 1992 to the 
end of the first quarter of 1993) and in the total output of 
registered joint ventures, more than 70 percent are producing 
goods, while the rest have not begun production operations yet. 
  The distribution of joint ventures among different branches 
of the economy is the following (in percentages): 
  industry--6.7; 
  trade and food service--9.3; 
  construction--5.8; 
  transportation and communications--4.6. 
  For the sake of comparison, in 1989 the proportional number 
of industrial enterprises was under 30 percent, and most of the 
joint ventures were concentrated in the trade and service 
sectors. 
  Italy has 511 joint ventures in Russia (5.5 percent of the 
total), surpassed only by the United States, FRG, and England 
(Figure 1) [not reproduced; converted to table].

  Foreign investors recently expressed an interest in 
participating in privatization processes after the cancellation 
of many of the restrictions on the acquisition of enterprises 
slated for privatization and on land use rights. 
  According to Russian Central Bank Regulation No 16 of 16 
July 
1993, foreign businessmen who are not residents may open special 
ruble accounts in Russian banks for settlements in privatization 
projects. According to estimates, by the beginning of 1993 
foreigners had acquired around 12 percent of the stock in 
enterprises undergoing privatization in Russia. Several 
well-known large enterprises, including Lukoil (Tyumen Oblast), 
plan to sell their stock in Western stock markets. 
  All of this suggests that the investment climate in Russia 
is 
gradually becoming increasingly acceptable to foreign 
businessmen, but how does it compare to the situation in other 
CIS countries?

  When we use the term "investment climate," we are referring 
to the fairly complex entity made up of the legislative 
confines, economic-administrative mechanism, and political, 
social, environmental, and other conditions of the host country. 
The investment climate may be judged by the method of expert 
evaluation, the method most commonly used in international 
practice. 
  A multi-factor analysis was conducted with the aid of 31 
indicators, arranged in five groups: 
  administrative and legal conditions (4 factors); 
  social, political, and environmental conditions (5 
factors); 
  foreign economic conditions (6 factors); 
  economic potential of country (9 factors); 
  level of market relations (7 factors). 
  Each indicator was evaluated by a group of specialists on a 
scale from 1 to 10, with the highest number of points 
corresponding to the most favorable conditions. After that the 
rating for each group of factors and the overall rating were 
calculated for each country. There were four separate 
indicators, for example, in the group of "administrative and 
legal conditions": 
  stability of economic legislation; 
  taxes on foreign investments; 
  administrative conditions; 
  guarantees and protection for foreign investments. 
  For the first indicator, Russia and Ukraine received four 
points each, Belarus received eight, and Kazakhstan received 
ten. The grades for the second indicator were nine, nine, and 
ten points respectively, and so forth. The results of the study 
are illustrated in Figure 3 [not reproduced; converted to 
table]. The results did not reveal any significant differences 
in expert evaluations of the investment climate in these 
countries. These were evaluations of conditions at the end of 
the first quarter of 1993.

  The evaluation of Russia, the country with the 
most favorable investment climate, was influenced by such 
well-known factors as Russia's natural resources, tremendous 
production potential, and large domestic market--with 150 
million consumers. In terms of these parameters, Russia 
surpassed all of the other countries combined, and this was the 
reason it finished in first place. Russia was also the leader in 
terms of radical and consistent market reform. Measures are 
being taken for financial stabilization, a strict monetary 
policy, and a stronger ruble. The rate of inflation has been 
lowered, the recession has been curbed, and the exchange rate of 
the ruble has been stabilized. 
  The Law on Foreign Investments, which extended the national 
regulations adopted in 1991 to foreign investors of capital, 
already needs to be adjusted with a view to accumulated 
experience. A law on free economic zones and concessions is 
being considered. Continuity in the development of laws and the 
maintenance of invariable rules of play for investors are 
important for a better investment climate. 
  Nevertheless, opportunities for foreign investment in Russia 
are still growing: 100-percent foreign enterprises and 
subsidiaries are being established in addition to the 
traditional joint ventures; opportunities are being created for 
operations by joint and foreign banks, for the purchase of stock 
in enterprises undergoing privatization, and for the long-term 
leasing of parcels of land. 
  A system of services for foreign investors is being 
established. Presidential Edict No 282 of 26 February 1993 
created the National Agency for the Insurance of Foreign 
Investments in the Russian Federation Against Non-Commercial 
Risks, and Presidential Edict No 184 of 2 February 1993 created 
the State Investment Company, with over a billion dollars in 
capital stock. 
  The present situation is quite paradoxical in 
Ukraine--second to Russia in terms of production 
potential, but last in terms of the overall investment climate. 
Ukraine's strong points are its geographic location, its 
proximity to Western partners, its ports, and its developed 
infrastructure. Ukraine's industrial potential is also highly 
developed, and there are favorable conditions for the 
development of agriculture in basic and processing industries. 
The new laws on foreign investments are quite liberal. 
  All of this is nullified, however, by Ukraine's 
exceptionally 
severe economic crisis and imprudent economic policy. Ukraine is 
lagging behind perceptibly in the sphere of market reform after 
wasting approximately a year to see the results of the reforms 
in Russia. This was followed by the choice of the most drastic 
form of shock therapy, but the genuine threat of social turmoil 
forced the government to retreat. The result was the escalation 
of hyperinflation and the complete devaluation of the recently 
instituted national currency--the karbovanets. This affected 
foreign investors because the government had to cancel some of 
the tax privileges they had been granted earlier. 
  Surpassed by its neighbors in terms of natural resources and 
production potential, Belarus is not regarded as a 
leader in economic reform. In spite of this, the state is ahead 
of its neighbors in terms of the rate of increase in the number 
of joint ventures, attesting to its appeal to foreign investors. 
Belarus' strong points, in addition to its convenient geographic 
location on the shortest route to Western Europe, are its 
sociopolitical stability, its liberal laws on foreign 
investments, the strong guarantees it has established for them, 
and--what is most important--its unchanging rules of play. 
Belarus also benefits from its skilled and highly productive 
labor force. Because Belarus is the smallest of these four 
countries, however, it has fewer spheres for the investment of 
capital. 
  The economic policy of the Belarusian Government is not as 
reform-oriented as the policy in Russia or Kazakhstan. This has 
guaranteed its comparative economic stability. The recession, 
for example, is much less severe here; the level of consumer 
prices is lower, although inflation does exist--largely because 
of Belarus' close economic interaction with Russia and Ukraine. 
Belarus was effectively crowded out of the ruble zone, and its 
national quasi-currency--the settlement coupon--is extremely 
weak, complicating settlements with its partners. 
  Kazakhstan's strong point is its natural wealth. 
The country is close to Russia in this respect, in terms of the 
variety of its resources if not in terms of total reserves. 
Furthermore, it is distinguished by its gas and oil fields and 
its largely undeveloped deposits of ores of nonferrous and rare 
metals. Kazakhstan has the most highly developed legislative 
base for foreign investments. It has already passed laws on 
foreign investment, free economic zones, concessions, and so 
forth. It has stable legal and economic-administrative 
regulations for foreign investors, and the government 
effectively encourages investments. Major investment projects in 
the oil and gas industry are being carried out with the 
participation of leading corporations in the United States, 
England, France, and Japan. The market reform policies of the 
president and government of Kazakhstan are being pursued 
consistently, without any delays or interruptions, although 
there has been a recent tendency toward stronger government 
regulation of some economic processes, particularly the rise in 
prices and income. In addition, the political situation is 
essentially stable. 
  The economy of Kazakhstan, however, is closely related to 
the 
Russian economy and is experiencing a critical decline of 
production and investment activity and a rate of inflation 
slightly higher than the Russian rate. Kazakhstan is still in 
the ruble zone and is striving for closer economic integration 
within the CIS framework and for stronger regional cooperation 
in Central Asia. From the standpoint of the foreign investor, 
however, Kazakhstan appears to have a relatively underdeveloped 
infrastructure and serious environmental problems. 
  This study revealed the most promising sectors and spheres 
of 
foreign investment in the economy of the four countries in 
question. In Russia they are the petroleum and petrochemical 
industries and woodworking, as well as shipbuilding, aircraft 
and automotive engineering, agricultural machinery production 
(particularly for family farms), medicine and medical equipment 
production, the processing of agricultural raw materials, the 
food distribution network, the conversion of defense production 
units, and others. In Ukraine these sectors and spheres also 
include sectors undergoing conversion, particularly satellite 
telecommunications, radar, gas turbine production, corn, 
sunflower, and sugar beet farming, the production of 
agricultural machinery and equipment for the food industry, and 
others. In Belarus these spheres are potash salt extraction and 
processing, mineral fertilizer production, mineral water 
production, the pulp and paper industry, and medicine 
production. In Kazakhstan they are the oil and gas industry, the 
extraction of nonferrous and rare metal ores, nonferrous 
metallurgy, the meat industry, light industry, mining equipment 
production, automotive engineering, and others. 
  In these states there is a need for investments in the 
storage and processing of agricultural products, the production, 
shipment, and sale of food products, the development of the 
production, social, and market infrastructure, and the training 
of personnel for the market economy. 
<H5>  In Lieu of a Conclusion </H5>
  This study presents an overview of foreign investment 
opportunities in the Russian economy, but the businessman 
considering investments of this kind will have many specific 
questions. The International Construction Institute has compiled 
summaries of Russian legislation and practical aids on the 
following topics to answer some of these questions: 
  --How can an enterprise be established with foreign capital 
in Russia? 
  --How can an enterprise dealing in foreign currency be 
opened 
in Russia? 
  --How is land acquired in Russia? 
  --What kind of information is essential for the use of 
Russian mineral resources? 
  --What kind of taxes have to be paid in Russia? 
  --The rules of play in the Russian market: 
  currency regulation; 
  export-import regulation; 
  customs regulation. 
  --What do construction projects in Russia entail? 
  --The Russian construction complex (statistics). 
  --Housing policy in Russia. 
  --Banking in Russia. 
  --The capital market (current reports). 
  --The bankruptcy of enterprises in Russia--a condition 
preventable by legal means. 
  --A survey of the experience in privatization in Russia. 
  --A comparative analysis of the investment climate in 
Russia. 
  Counseling and assistance can be offered in all of these 
fields, and it might be useful to do this in the magazine, with 
a view to the actual experience of the International 
Construction Institute in working with Banca Agricola Mantovana 
and Intesa Finanziaria (Brescia). 
  Note: The International Construction Institute is a 
research and consulting organization which was founded to 
promote foreign investment in Russia and other CIS countries. 
The institute's foreign founder is Banca Agricola Mantovana and 
its Russian founders are the Academy of the National Economy of 
the RF Government, the Russian Academy of Sciences, the 
International Builders Union, and the Tekhnopromeksport foreign 
trade organization.

<H5>  1. The Development of Integrated Economic Processes </H5>
  The contemporary period in the development of the world 
economic expanse is characterized by two trends--a deepening and 
expansion of the international division of labor, on the one 
hand, and the development of integration processes on a 
worldwide scale, on the other. These trends, by interacting, 
make it necessary to develop measures for the management of 
economic ties, the conclusion of international agreements for 
the creation, to a certain extent, of open and closed market 
spheres. This is leading in practice to the creation of various 
types of regional unions that regulate the trade and economic 
relations of countries that are in those unions, as well as 
affecting the formation of trade relations with other countries. 
The following stages, without going deeply into the history of 
world economic integration, must be singled out in its 
development. 
  The first is through the end of World War I. It is 
characterized by the fact that there was, by and large, little 
world economic integration, and what there was was essentially 
of a colonial nature. The economic ties were predominantly 
structured between the developed countries and colonies, where 
the former sold finished products and the latter raw materials. 
Russia belonged to a certain extent to the latter, and was 
considered a "raw-materials appendage" of Europe. 
  The second stage was the period between World War I and 
World 
War II. Three trends can be delineated therein in the 
development of economic ties: a scenario as in the first stage, 
since the world colonial system was preserved; a new scenario, 
with mutual relations between economically equal partners of the 
industrially developed countries of Europe and America. The 
first signs of integrative economic processes between the United 
States and Europe, the United States and Canada etc., appeared 
during this time; and, the scenario of the USSR, which for a 
number of decades remained in virtual economic isolation from 
most of the developed countries of the world. 
  The third stage begins after the end of World War II. Its 
principal features consist of the fact that the colonial system 
had collapsed, the socialist camp was created and former 
colonies attained the status of independent nations, many of 
them so-called underdeveloped countries. The most pronounced 
world integrative economic trends were manifested in the second 
half of the 20th century. They achieved their greatest 
development in a number of regions--continental Western European 
integration (European Economic Community), the North American 
integration that encompassed the economic relations of the 
United States and Canada, and Atlantic integration between the 
United States and Europe. One typical feature of these processes 
is the tendency for them to deepen and expand. 
  The integrative economic process between the United States 
and Canada led to mutual dependence and the intertwining of the 
national economies of those countries. The mutual economic ties 
took the form of free trade, with the abolition of all customs 
restrictions. 
  The process of development of Western European integration 
passed through a series of stages, each of which consistently 
deepened the economic, legal and political mechanisms of 
interaction of the participating countries with the aim of 
providing a basis for intelligent compromise solutions that make 
it possible to harmonize national interests, coordinate the 
actions of governments and the like. The unified trade policy of 
the Commonwealth was formulated in the 1950s and 1960s, in the 
so-called Common Market with the "four freedoms" of movement--of 
goods, capital, manpower and services. The 1970s passed under 
the banner of the formation of the unified European Currency 
System and the mechanism for utilizing it in monetary 
circulation among the member countries, as well as the European 
Currency Cooperation Fund. The task was posed in 1987 of 
creating an entirely integrated Western European market that 
would complete the process of evolution of the unified economic 
expanse from lower forms of customs union to currency-economic 
and political integration. The Masstricht accords, which 
envisage the creation of currency-economic and 
military-political alliances of the 12 European nations by the 
year 2000, entered into force in November of 1993. The 
transition to a unified unit of currency--the ECU--will be 
implemented before the end of the 20th century. The name of the 
European Community will also be changed to the European 
Union.[.sup]1[/] 
  The immediate reason for the creation of economic 
communities 
in the Western European countries and America is the obvious 
advantages of expanding the economic expanse that is based on 
principles of the freedom of movement of goods, capital and 
manpower, a unified banking and monetary system and uniform 
"rules of the game." Customs-free trade within the framework of 
a single market allows enterprises to increase the amounts of 
profits by reducing expenditures for turnover. The increased 
scale of the market has a positive impact on the development of 
competition, and sets limits for regional monopolistic 
structures. The deepening of competition moreover provides a 
powerful impetus for modernizing production and increasing its 
efficiency. Another effect of integration is the fact that 
communities devise a unified mechanism for the regulation and 
coordination of economic policy, which makes it possible to tie 
national plans with the strategic aims of the community. A 
uniform market strategy envisages the development of a set of 
agreements (on price levels, optimal production quotas, the 
division of sales markets and the sources of raw materials etc.) 
that take into account the economic interests of the partners to 
the maximum extent. This permits the enterprises to halt 
spending that is connected with declines in prices as a result 
of overproduction, as well as with the impossibility of 
providing for the normal course of the production process with 
regard to deliveries of raw materials and product sales owing to 
tough competition. 
  The socialist-oriented countries created their own 
organization--the Council for Economic Mutual Assistance 
(CEMA)--that fostered the formation and development of 
established ties in important sectors of economics, science and 
technology, the expansion and strengthening of the international 
market of the CEMA member countries, and improvements in trade 
and monetary relations. The republics that made up the USSR 
developed for many decades primarily under conditions of the 
economic integration of the CEMA member countries, as a result 
of which a deep division of labor was created among those 
countries. A commonality of economic life was created that was 
founded on many similar national-economic proportions, which 
were the result of the use in practice of a uniform approach to 
the placement of productive forces and the creation of joint 
enterprises and scientific organizations. 
  This lasted for decades under the conditions of the Cold 
War, 
and the confrontation of the western and eastern integrative 
economic unions restricted international processes of exchange. 
  Processes that slowed the development of economic ties, and 
later led to their destabilization, arose for a number of 
reasons within the market expanse of the CEMA member nations. 
This pertains first and foremost to shortcomings in the practice 
of planned management. Negative trends conditioned by violations 
of the proportionality of intersector ties were manifested for 
many years, despite the objective necessity and conceptual 
possibility of the proportional and harmonious development of 
production potential and the availability of scientific and 
technical support, and the management of this process (the 
balances method, its software support, powerful computers). This 
led to the appearance and development of a negative 
phenomenon--scarcity in various forms and manifestations. The 
excessive rigidity and detail of approved sector plan targets 
led to a reduction in flexibility in the management of 
production resources, and limitations in opportunities for 
maneuvering them and stabilizing destroyed production ties in 
timely fashion. 
  The practice of centralized administrative management of 
business ties that has existed for decades has engendered 
inertia and an inability of economic managers to resolve 
independently the question of seeking out production partners. 
This has led to an unreadiness of enterprise and association 
executives for conditions where the necessity has arisen of 
establishing direct contractual relations with suppliers of raw 
materials and consumers of the products. 
  Many enterprises and organizations that obtained freedom in 
the choice of suppliers of raw materials and consumers of their 
products began to destroy business ties with their production 
counterparts that had been established for years, and began to 
seek out more profitable partners, including abroad, in order to 
obtain greater profits. This strengthened the instability of the 
mutual relations among levels of the national economy. The 
powerlessness of executive authority with regard to halting the 
collapse of economic ties was reflected here. The attempts at 
administrative state regulation of production on the basis of 
state orders, in the face of shortages of raw materials and 
financial resources, did not lead to the stabilization of the 
economic situation, insofar as those orders did not guarantee 
producers the uninterrupted and complete supply of materials and 
constituent items, the receipt of which was expected to be 
accomplished on the basis of direct contracts. 
  The fourth stage in world economic integration has ensued 
with the curtailment of the activity of CEMA and the collapse of 
the USSR. The destabilization of economic ties brought general 
expansion from the beginning of depression to the development of 
market relations among the Eastern European countries and the 
USSR, of an especially rapid nature after the halt to the 
activity of CEMA and the collapse of the USSR into sovereign 
states. The liberalization of prices made the break-up of 
economic ties even stronger. An increasing decline in production 
is occurring, as a consequence of this, in all of the CIS 
countries. Disproportions are increasing to considerable 
dimensions. The structural transformations have become 
unmanaged. The reproduction of the production apparatus has 
effectively halted. The construction industry is suffering a 
depression. The socio-economic standard of living of the 
population is dropping. 
<H5>  2. Seeking Directions for Economic Integration </H5>
  The political proclamations of sovereignty and national 
independence have signified an attempt by many republics to 
achieve complete economic independence at any price. The actual 
incarnation of that political orientation has been the very 
rapid growth in centrifugal tendencies and disintegrative 
processes. Economic integration has been displaced by an 
economic sovereignty that borders on autarky. The rigid 
separation of the economy from politics has led to the break-up 
of economic ties, the establishment of barriers and increasing 
in-kind exchange. 
  Models for the development of sovereign nations began 
appearing that are oriented toward their own raw-material 
resources or toward the expansion of economic ties with Western 
countries, replacing such ties with the CIS nations. A model for 
the development of production potential was proposed that was 
aimed at a radical structural restructuring of the economies of 
the republics, with a dedicated orientation toward the maximum 
reduction of the requirements for resources to the level of 
balance with their intrinsic raw-materials base. If that path is 
taken, however, losses of fixed capital inevitably result. The 
CIS countries will each hardly be able to accomplish a 
structural restructuring of the economy separately in the face 
of a lack of advanced technologies and raw-material and 
financial resources. The complete collapse of economic ties that 
has occurred does not meet the criterion of economic expediency. 
  This in no way signifies, at the same time, a need to 
maintain inefficient ties or not to cut back types of production 
whose products do not enjoy widespread demand. The discussion 
concerns the establishment of efficient and mutually 
advantageous market ties. 
  In raising the question of the advantage of an accelerated 
search for new economic partners outside the boundaries of the 
CIS, it must be pointed out that hopes for the rapid replacement 
of ties among the republics with international ones have no real 
economic foundation. The experience of a number of countries of 
Eastern Europe speaks to this. A re-orientation toward the 
procurement from Western countries of resources and goods that 
are in short supply requires a corresponding amount of currency. 
None of the CIS countries has any real opportunities for 
obtaining a sufficient quantity of hard currency funds today, 
insofar as they are selling just one percent of the products 
they produce on the world market, and even that at dumping 
prices. No less than 10-15 years will be required, in the 
estimation of specialists, before the republics will be able to 
find their "niche" in the structure of the international 
division of labor. 
  It must also be kept in mind that the interests of Western 
firms, as a rule, are limited to attempts to make use of the 
ties with us for the purpose of obtaining valuable and cheap raw 
materials, leaving us a raw-materials appendage of the developed 
countries of Europe. The collaboration of Western firms is not 
structured for benevolent purposes. The Western countries regard 
the re-organization of our economy first and foremost as the 
winning of an economic market share where harsh competition 
between our and foreign partners is in effect. 
  The experience of Hungary, a country that is one of the 
initiators of the collapse of the market expanse of the CEMA 
countries, testifies vividly to this. A disadvantageous economic 
situation has taken shape for that country today. Hungary, owing 
to the collapse of partnership ties with the CIS countries (with 
an orientation toward a market with the countries of Western 
Europe), finds itself in a difficult position with the sale of 
agricultural products--the principal line item in its export 
income. Western countries, instead of opening their markets to 
cheap Hungarian products, are giving preference to the use of 
those ties for the penetration of their products into the 
Hungarian market. Hungarian stores, as a result, are stuffed 
with products from Germany, Austria and France, while Germany 
procured from Hungary only one sixth of some of the goods 
promised in 1993. 
  Enterprises, under conditions of a very rapid 
destabilization 
of economic ties, have been forced to seek out new forms of 
mutual relations among their production counterparts, and to 
resort to intermediaries--the commodities exchanges. Experience 
shows, however, that the latter are not yet facilitating a 
strengthening of economic ties, but are rather only "fanning" 
prices for the goods that are being sold with their assistance. 
Under the conditions of a sharp decline in production and acute 
shortages of goods, the exchange boom, caused by the attempt of 
so-called entrepreneurs to obtain easy profits with 
insufficiently qualified personnel at the enterprises who 
support the commodities exchanges, has led to the creation of so 
many of them in the CIS countries that there are four times as 
many of them as in the whole rest of the world. It is thus no 
accident that regular auctions are conducted by no more than 1/5 
of the number of registered commodities exchanges, and the 
volume of sales in them has been declining appreciably of late. 
The volume of trades at operating exchanges will be reduced in 
the future, in the estimation of specialists, since those 
exchanges are exchange-bazaars, where agreements are made for 
the sale of actual goods, in the substance of their activity 
today. That type of exchange was supplanted in Europe in the 
17th century, and in the United States and Japan in the 19th 
century, by exchanges that make forward and futures 
contracts--that is, contracts under which the delivery of goods 
will be made in the future. 
  The forward contract on a trading exchange, as is well 
known, 
envisages the delivery of a good in advance of a stipulated time 
(3--6 months), and its quantity and price are defined by 
agreement of the buyer and seller at the moment the contract is 
made. This provides an opportunity for the seller to sell a good 
that has not yet been manufactured at a price that covers the 
spending to produce it, and the buyer to provide his own 
production with raw materials and constituent items in advance 
at a price that suits him. The mass conclusion of forward 
contracts opens up an opportunity to predict prices for these or 
those goods, which under market conditions makes it possible for 
buyers and sellers to be oriented in the long run toward the 
profitability of their enterprises. This is perhaps the sole 
opportunity under market conditions to plan production for the 
future. 
  If an exchange, along with an intermediary in contracts, 
also 
guarantees the fulfillment the contracts reached for the 
purchase and sale of homogeneous raw materials that are united 
into large lots without the loss of consumer traits that are 
called "standard" (grain, meat, sugar, butter, cotton, metals, 
oil, gas, coal, wood etc.), then the forward contract becomes a 
futures contract. Futures contracts that are reached on a broad 
scale level out the effects of the actions of random factors in 
the level of prices, which creates confidence in tomorrow among 
the counterparts of production. These agreements facilitate 
stimulation of the development of production under conditions of 
an unstable economic situation. The amount of futures contracts 
on exchanges in the United States reaches trillions of dollars a 
year, which fosters the stabilization of market relations to a 
certain extent. 
  The development of exchange support for market relations in 
the CIS countries has thus taken the path of primitive forms and 
rudimentary intermediary relations, and has had virtually no 
effect on the stabilization of economic ties both within the 
economic expanse of the CIS countries and its separate states, 
including Ukraine. The creation of a small quantity of so-called 
civilized exchanges able to conclude forward, as well as 
futures, contracts on a broad scale across the economic expanse 
of all of the CIS countries, at the same time, could be an 
important condition for improving the economic situation in the 
republics during the period of transition to market relations. 
The development of futures operations in the long term under our 
conditions, with indices of business activity that are defined 
by the exchanges, the accumulation of a base of information on 
price changes, and analysis of factors that affect the 
competitive market for commodities, could become the foundation 
for various types of calculations and predictions at both the 
macro- and micro-economic levels. Calculations performed by 
state administrative bodies to evaluate the competitive market 
conditions of goods in particular could become, on the one hand, 
a sound basis for the making of decisions on imports and exports 
of goods, tax concessions to the producers of goods etc. and, on 
the other hand, a point of reference for the managers of 
enterprises and associations in planning the development of 
production and conducting routine economic activity. 
  Integration methods are developing in the world economy that 
are promoting a strengthening of the mutual relations among 
sovereign states and the development of economic and cultural 
ties, while sovereignty is not opposed to integration. The use 
of cumulative world experience in economic integration is thus 
expedient, in our opinion, to resolve the problem of stabilizing 
economic ties in the CIS countries. 
  The necessity of forming a well-developed system of mutually 
advantageous international ties is dictated by the entire logic 
of the development of market relations. The winning of true 
independence around the world is sought not on the path to 
autarky, but rather on the basis of active participation in the 
international division of labor and economic, scientific and 
technical exchange. In the estimation of Western economists, 
roughly 5--10 percent growth in the national product as a whole 
in the countries that are part of the EC can be assured only 
through the organization of a unified European market. 
  The experience in creating the EC undoubtedly has its own 
specific nature, but many of its traits could be utilized as 
reliable and well-tested measures for the formation of new 
relations among the independent CIS states. The true foundation 
for this is the high degree of international cooperative ties 
among all of the participants in economic activity. The 
republics of the former USSR have better conditions with regard 
to international ties than the EC: inter-republic exchange was 
20.5 percent of the gross national product, and in the EC 16 
percent. 
  The CIS countries must put a model of economic collaboration 
consisting of further mutual economic integration, with the 
preservation of political independence of the countries and 
without the interference of politics into economics, at the 
foundation of the development of mutual economic relations. The 
realization of this basic model would serve the improvement of 
mutual economic relations of the CIS countries. A system of 
collective and coordinated measures within the framework of the 
entire CIS, founded on the principles of mutual relations among 
sovereign states--equal rights, mutual advantage and mutual 
vested interest in joint emergence from economic crisis--is 
required for this. There must be mutually coordinated standards 
that define trade and economic relations, most-favored status, a 
procedure for the functioning of monetary, currency and credit 
systems etc. within this system of measures. 
  The process of legal support for the new mutual economic 
relations among sovereign economic nations, it must be thought, 
will be prolonged. It would be expedient, in our opinion, to 
make use of the experience of integrated economic unions that 
defines the legal norms for the mutual economic relations of 
sovereign nations. 
  New trends appeared in the middle of 1993 that were directed 
at strengthening economic ties among partners of the 
independence states. They are founded on the joint development 
of production and the necessary quantity of sovereign nations. 
It is thus expected that Russian investors will be enlisted in 
the reconstruction of metallurgical plants in Ukraine that 
supply products to Russia and other nations, while Ukrainian 
investors will invest in the development of the oil-and-gas 
complex in West Siberia, including the creation of joint 
ventures that ensure the delivery of oil and gas resources to 
Ukraine. 
<H5>  The Mechanism for Settlements in the Process of Trade and </H5>
Economic Relations 
  The creation of a mechanism for settlements in the process 
of 
mutual economic exchange is a difficult problem in the mutual 
relations among the CIS states. The experience of CEMA should be 
kept in mind here, where under conditions of an effectively 
balanced economic expanse of the countries participating in that 
organization, and with the availability of a settlement unit 
accessible to all--the conversion ruble--they were not able for 
many years to devise an effective mechanism for mutual 
settlements. The conditions are much more complex today, while 
the theoretical preconditions for the solution of the problem 
are insufficiently grounded or realistic. Two trends are 
actually in effect under the conditions of the dynamic process 
of the emergence of the economic and political independence of 
the CIS countries: first, the attempt by the independent states 
to have national currencies and monetary systems, and second, 
the search for ways of creating a currency that has free 
circulation in those states as a means of settlement in the 
process of economic exchange. These trends are contradictory 
today. The as yet unsuccessful attempts to create a ruble zone 
of a so-called new type are testimony to that. 
  Real economic difficulties have arisen on the path of 
creating a mechanism for mutual settlements among the CIS 
countries. They consist of the great variability of the 
resource-export and economic potentials of the countries that 
make up the commonwealth; the necessity of the strict and 
dynamic balancing of export and import exchange among the 
countries that would provide for non-credit transactions; the 
need for the maintenance of a structure for the goods being 
exchanged that would correspond to the capabilities for payment 
in hard currency; the rigid independence of value indicators of 
exchange from the dynamic of world prices; the chronic shortages 
of goods to make up the balance-of-payments deficit under the 
effects of destabilizing factors, which unbalance the volumes of 
trade deliveries; the price whims and economic pressure of the 
monopoly suppliers of raw and other materials etc. 
  The solution of the problem being considered is complicated 
by the fact that a process of the introduction of national 
monetary systems is taking place in those countries. It must be 
thought that the process of nationalization of monetary systems 
will continue; it could be asserted that the ruble expanse has 
effectively disintegrated. 
  In the socio-economic and political climate that has 
resulted, it must be thought that settlements in the process of 
mutual exchange among the CIS countries will be improved in the 
future, oriented in the long run toward the norms that are in 
effect in the practice of international economic relations. 
However, the process of transition to economic relations among 
the CIS countries, as has been done in the EC, for example, will 
take much time and will be of an evolutionary nature in 
development, passing sequentially through such forms of mutual 
relations and their combination as bilateral payment agreements, 
various forms of clearings, settlements in VKV [freely 
convertible currency], and settlements on the basis of 
convertibility of the currencies of the CIS nations. 
  Bilateral payments agreements, without which the CIS 
countries cannot get by in contemporary trade and economic 
relations, could have a marked effect on the development of 
trade, and serve as good practice for the transition to the 
convertibility of national currencies. An important role in the 
development of those relations is relegated directly to the 
trading partners that take part, on an equal footing, in 
coordinating mutual demands and obligations and in settlements 
for current operations. The national state banks provide for the 
sale of foreign currency to importers in order to pay for 
imports and the exchange of export receipts for their national 
currency. The difficult problem of the exchange rate among 
national currencies arises in these relations, and without the 
resolution of which bilateral agreements will not be able to 
develop actively. The solution of this problem envisages the 
achievement of coordination in the currency policies of the 
countries that have bilateral trade and economic relations. The 
granting of freedom of action to trading partners and the 
removal of restrictions on export/import operations in effect in 
the CIS countries would facilitate the successful development of 
bilateral payment agreements. 
  Currency clearings could also be used in mutual trade and 
economic relations between two or several CIS countries. The 
settlements among the partner countries are made via the 
cashless offset of reciprocal demands and obligations, while 
payments in cash or gold are made only for the amount of the 
difference in deliveries of goods or services rendered. Under 
this system direct mutual currency relations among the trading 
counterparts do not exist, with an absence of interaction among 
national currencies as well. All settlements must be made in 
centralized fashion at the international level. This envisages 
the active role of an International Bank, and the existence of 
mutually coordinated trade and economic relations among the CIS 
countries. A mutually coordinated balance of import and export 
quotas, exchanged raw materials and finished products is am 
important condition for the effectiveness of clearing 
settlements for the partner countries, signifying the static 
nature of the trade structure. The trading partners will 
otherwise prove not to have a vested interest in expanding 
exports, since payments for products above and beyond the quotas 
that come to the clearing accumulator could go to pay off the 
indebtedness of other partners, while the former are left 
without currency from the receipts for the additional product. 
  The use of VKV within the economic expanse of the CIS member 
countries is problematical. The introduction of the conversion 
ruble into mutual settlements among the CEMA countries, on the 
one hand, is considered to be one of the reasons for the 
reduction in the volume of trade turnover among the countries; 
on the other hand, the EC countries have been working on the 
problem of creating a system of mutual settlements based on the 
use of a unified monetary unit (ECU) that, in accordance with 
the Masstricht agreement, will be introduced into circulation 
before the end of the 20th century. The creation of an economic 
union, within the framework of which equal trade and economic 
collaboration would take place on a multilateral basis with the 
use of an internal VKV, is possible and expedient in the long 
term, provided good will on the part of all (or some) of the CIS 
countries exists. Another variation--joining the European Union 
on a voluntary basis, within the framework of which the problem 
could be resolved automatically--is also possible. 
  In order to attain the highest level of mutual 
settlements--on the basis of the convertibility of national 
currencies--it is essential to provide, in each of the partner 
countries, a well-developed internal market that satisfies the 
demand of consumers for various goods and services at 
competitive prices, highly diversified and efficient national 
production, market-competitive exports that provide stability in 
the balance of payments, a sufficient level of currency 
reserves, relative stability of prices and the rate of currency 
exchange, and a highly developed currency market. 
<H5>  4. Opportunities for Making Foreign Economic Activity More </H5>
Vigorous 
  It must be kept in mind, when developing the strategy and 
methods for the expansion of foreign economic ties with the 
countries of the far abroad, that the economies of the CIS 
countries are still not ready for vigorous activity with regard 
to winning new markets. The unstable social and political 
climate in those countries does not promote the activation of 
foreign economic activity. The low technical level of production 
potential is not able to provide for the output of products that 
are competitive on world markets. Only products of types of 
production highly developed in a technical and technological 
regard (certain types of space hardware, weapons, high 
technologies) and natural raw materials are attractive to 
Western partners. 
  The activation of foreign economic activity cannot be 
considered apart from the solution of the overall problems of 
raising the technical level of production. The attempts of 
Ukraine and the other CIS countries in the area of the 
accelerated re-orientation of foreign trade from the near to the 
far abroad have had virtually no positive results, since no 
qualitative changes were made in the products exported. The 
access of the CIS countries to trade relations in the world 
economic expanse from the export of a broad range of finished 
items and products requires the development of a whole set of 
measures to study the market competitiveness of the products 
manufactured by the CIS countries, the determination of the 
priorities in exported goods with regard for their demand, the 
time frames for raising quality to world standards and economic 
capabilities for the technical refitting of production. 
  It is advisable, in the first stage of the development of 
the 
economies of the sovereign nations, to study the export 
capabilities of those sectors of the national economy whose 
potential for the output of finished products surpasses the 
demand on the internal market. This situation, for example, has 
taken shape in Ukraine in the metallurgical industry, where 
production capacity for the extraction of iron and manganese 
ore, the production of cast iron and the rolling of ferrous 
metals exceed the requirements of the national economy of the 
republic. That is one sector that could be transformed into a 
reliable channel for the receipt of foreign currency in the 
future. Government bodies have begun to study the conditions and 
develop the appropriate organizational measures with regard to 
expanding the export of products of ferrous metallurgy to the 
countries of Eastern Europe and the southwest (Turkey, Iran 
etc.). 
  The military-industrial complex, based on the volume and 
production-technical data of the products produced, under 
certain conditions could also be a great exporter of hardware 
and weapons to many countries of the world in return for hard 
currency, which would serve as a source of funds for the 
conversion of production. The capacity of the world market is 
virtually unlimited, especially in the countries of Africa and 
the Near and Middle East, even for firearms, in our opinion. The 
difficulties in resolving this issue consist of the fact that 
exports of military products are restricted and regulated by 
international agreements. Notwithstanding those restrictions, 
however, certain countries--for example, the United States and 
Germany, among others--are growing rich from the sale of 
military hardware and weaponry, even though international 
agreements exist that must be fulfilled equally by all of the 
nations of the world. There is perhaps some inertia in the CIS 
countries in the delivery of arms for free or on credit (which 
is then, as a rule, not paid back) to the underdeveloped 
countries and to developing countries that are in the sphere of 
influence of the socialist camp. The world political problems 
pertaining to the winning of spheres of influence today, 
however, cannot be resolved in this way by any of the CIS 
countries. There is no need of it anyway. The export of military 
products should this be developed more actively within the 
framework of the upholding of international agreements. 
  The possibility and expediency of returning Ukraine among 
the 
nations that export grain and agricultural products in the near 
future can be discerned. A further increase in the stable 
harvest of grain crops, in an amount that would meet entirely 
the needs of the country for foodstuffs and rule out imports, is 
essential as a first step in this regard. The annual production 
of grain crops must be brought to a level that exceeds one tonne 
per capita for this to happen. Attention must be paid in the 
agro-industrial complex, first and foremost, to the safekeeping 
and processing of cultivated crops, and reductions in the 
spending for the products produced, especially fruits and 
vegetables, the spending for which reaches 50 percent. The 
creation of an industry for the gathering, processing and 
safekeeping of products and improvements in their quality and 
outward appearance is a paramount task in raising the market 
competitiveness of products from the agro-industrial complex. 
  The vacuum that has been created in the trade of the Eastern 
European countries with the Russian Federation must be taken 
advantage of. Markets must be won and strongly held not only in 
the Western countries, but in the CIS countries as well. If the 
Russian Federation has the intention of moving to hard 
(international) currency in the sale of power resources, then 
Ukraine must do the same thing. Rolled ferrous metals, iron and 
manganese ore, foodstuffs and other goods must be considered 
export goods to the CIS countries under those conditions. 
  We must not be limited to today and tomorrow in considering 
the prospects for foreign economic ties. We must seek out, even 
today, promising directions in international collaboration, so 
as to achieve a stable situation in world markets and the 
position of priority partner in the competitive battle. 
Proceeding from the level of development of scientific, 
technical and production potential, it may be asserted that 
Ukraine can compete successfully in foreign economic activity if 
it supplies to the world market hardware, items, materials and 
consumer goods and foodstuffs whose production is based on the 
results of basic scientific research and non-traditional 
technologies. One may cite as an example the scientific and 
technical areas that could become the basis for the manufacture 
of market-competitive products: the production of new synthetic 
materials that have their properties designated in advance; new 
alloys that are resistant to corrosion, high and low 
temperatures and wear and tear; composite and powdered 
materials; the creation of biotechnologies, a broad spectrum of 
information systems etc. 
  It must be pointed out that the possibility and expediency 
of 
utilizing foreign technologies, in combination with domestic or 
separately, should not be ruled out in the resolution of the 
question of the prospects for foreign economic activity. This 
approach would facilitate the development of new domestic 
technologies and sectors of industry, as well as the 
modernization of existing types of production. Its tasks are 
both the expansion of export goods, and the replacement of 
imported items in the country with high-quality domestic ones 
that are produced on the basis of assimilated foreign 
technologies. There is great experience in Japan in adopting the 
latest scientific and technical achievements in this regard by 
means of the mass procurement of patents and licenses, which are 
utilized by many foreign countries, including the nations of 
Eastern Europe. 
  The participation of foreign firms in the realization of 
large and small projects in the development of the sovereign 
republic, as well as the joint implementation of scientific and 
technical programs of the EC and other international unions, is 
an aspect of no small importance in the further long-term 
development of foreign economic production and trade relations. 
The sovereign state, by enlisting foreign investors for the 
creation of its own scientific, technical and production 
facilities, resolves not only the issue of the development of 
production potential, but also draws foreign partners into trade 
and economic relations, thereby making an entry into the world 
economic expanse. One concrete example of the realization of 
large projects by foreign firms is the erection of the 
high-capacity terminal on the Black Sea coast for the receipt of 
petroleum products that are coming to Ukraine from the far 
abroad. 
  The creation of free economic zones in border areas is a new 
direction in the development of foreign economic ties that has 
still not become widespread in Ukraine. Groups of scientific and 
practical workers from Donetsk and Odessa oblasts and other 
regions of the republic have been working on plans for the 
creation of such zones for a long time. The Supreme Soviet of 
Ukraine, however, is delaying the realization of these programs 
through its prolonged consideration of the issue. 
  Advertising and information activity, which could be 
launched 
in all countries with a market economy, is an important 
condition for the activation of foreign economic ties. It has 
been introduced in the CIS countries in the form of printed 
materials and advertisements on radio and television. Foreign 
information on commercial activity in the CIS countries, 
however, is effectively lacking. 
  The creation of a national commercial-technical information 
service must play a large role in the development and successful 
functioning of the foreign economic activity of Ukraine. 
Analogous systems should be created in all of the CIS countries. 
They must all be combined into a unified commercial-information 
system of the CIS countries, and linked with the corresponding 
world information centers. Such a far-flung network of foreign 
economic information would facilitate the activation of foreign 
economic activity, the search for mutually advantageous partners 
and an increase in the quantity of contacts among them. 
Experience shows that the absence of full-fledged information 
support reduces the effectiveness of foreign economic activity 
and international collaboration. 
  The participation of Ukraine and the other sovereign nations 
in international exhibitions, fairs and other analogous 
functions also has considerable significance in an advertising 
and informational regard. The numerous examples of the showing 
of models of aviation, military and other types of hardware 
abroad testify to this. Collaboration in the creation of new 
hardware is expanded as a result of such demonstrations, and 
contracts are reached for their supply. The necessity of 
organizing similar functions within the framework of the CIS as 
well is arising.

<F P=106> [Chapter from book "Derzhava" by Gennadiy Zyuganov, </F>
Informpechat, Moscow, 1994, edited by Professor N.A. Vasetskiy, 
doctor of historical sciences: "Russia Above the Abyss"] 
  [Excerpt] The book by G.A. Zyuganov, deputy of the State 
Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation and 
chairman of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation 
Central Executive Committee, analyzes topical problems of the 
constitutional and sovereign-state building of the new Russia 
and its domestic and foreign policy and spirituality and 
patriotism. 
  The author has proposed a constructive program for the 
extrication of the country from the most profound crisis, a 
strengthening of the shaken authority of the managerial 
structures, and a surmounting of the growing lack of trust in 
the institution of power as a whole. 
  The book is intended for a wide range of readers, primarily 
those to whom the fate of their fatherland and its present and 
future is not a matter of indifference. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Russia Above the Abyss </H5>
  IF WE THINK ABOUT IT, IT IS CLEAR THAT NOTHING WAS CONCLUDED 
BY THE EVENTS IN MOSCOW THAT FOLLOWED THE PRESIDENT'S EDICT ON 
THE DISSOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT. ON THE CONTRARY, EVERYTHING IS 
ONLY JUST BEGINNING.... 
  IT IS NOT FORTUITOUS THAT THIS REGIME: 
  CAME TO REAL POWER IN AUGUST 1991 UNDER THE COVER OF 
DEAFENING POPULIST DEMAGOGY ON THE WAVE OF A POWERFUL POLITICAL 
CATACLYSM: 
  REMAINED AFLOAT FOR TWO YEARS AFTER THIS BY INFLAMING AN 
ATMOSPHERE OF CONFRONTATION AND POLITICAL HYSTERIA AND 
REPEATEDLY PROVOKING THE OPPOSITION INTO COLLISIONS; 
  MANAGED IN THE FALL OF 1993 TO AVOID A CRUSHING POLITICAL 
DEFEAT MERELY AT THE PRICE OF THE ORGANIZATION IN MOSCOW OF 
BLOODY CLASHES, IN WHICH HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE DIED. 
  "The revolution devours its children...." This dire aphorism 
has today once again been confirmed before our eyes. The slick 
and smooth-tongued democratic revolution, which two years ago 
managed by treachery and lies to destroy a country that had 
grown weary and had lost its faith in the perestroyka 
experiments, has logically brought society to the brink of civil 
war. But its first volleys were aimed against the most furious 
"democrats" of the recent past. Another circle of Russian 
history inevitably closed, having for the umpteenth time 
exploded at its end point in abundant splashes of innocent blood. 
  This is why it is essential that all of us--patriots and 
democrats, monarchists and nationalists--regardless of political 
"rightness" or "leftness," urgently think through the results of 
the Moscow tragedy in its organic connection with the events of 
recent years and draw for ourselves serious, high-minded, and 
profound conclusions. The situation is, alas, developing 
according to the worst possible scenario, in which there can be 
no winners, for those benefiting will be only the destructive, 
extremist forces that are aiming at the conclusive extermination 
of the remnants of sovereign Russian statehood and the 
suffocation of the very rich Russian spirituality and culture. 
  The inexorable logic of political history has already begun 
to uncoil the latest spiral of opposition, at the end of which, 
unless we come to our senses, an explosion of violence far more 
terrible and ferocious than that which shook Moscow 3-5 October 
of 1993 awaits the country.... "God preserve me from seeing a 
Russian rebellion--senseless and pitiless"--we would all do well 
to keep this firmly in mind. Pushkin knew what he was writing 
about--the bloody experience of the 20th century confirms all 
too clearly and convincingly how right he was. 
<H5>  Fateful Questions </H5>
  What has been happening to the country in the last eight 
years (since the start of perestroyka)? What are the real, 
genuine reasons for the latest Russian troubles and their 
principal driving forces, ends and means, and executants and 
leaders? What are our real prospects? What needs to be done for 
the situation, finally, to be brought under control? Where is 
the way out of the political, economic, and ideological impasse 
in which we have found ourselves as a result of the universal 
"triumph of democracy"? This is just a small part of the 
questions that arise at a first attempt to comprehend in calm 
and considered fashion the recent Moscow carnage. It 
concentrates and fully reflects, as in a drop of water, all the 
present troubles, pains, and adversities of our life. It is for 
this reason that it is so important to understand how what 
happened with us since the fateful Presidential Edict No. 1400 
of 21 September could have happened!... 
  The explanation so importunately and high-handedly imposed 
on 
public opinion today by the reptilian news media--"a red-brown 
putsch"--is patently false and baseless. All these hysterical 
cries about the "communo-fascists" altogether come, rather, from 
the complete ideological impotence of the authorities, which are 
simply incapable of offering society if only some in the least 
bit intelligible explanation of what happened. Nonetheless, 
there is one--merely a little clear thinking is required. 
  From the very start of the present troubles--from the moment 
when a political grouping of extreme, radical "Westerners" 
managed with the support of the world oligarchy at the price of 
the collapse of the USSR to seize political power in Russia--it 
was perfectly obvious that a substantial number of Russians 
would not for the world accept the path of "development" onto 
which the zealous devotees of "values common to all mankind" 
were endeavoring to drive them at any price. It was just as 
obvious that the number of malcontents would grow in line with 
the impoverishment of the masses and the intensification of the 
general chaos--the inevitable consequences of the political and 
economic course of the new Russian leadership. At some moment 
the discontent would reach a critical point, and then the fruit 
of the long painstaking activity of powerful international 
forces endeavoring, on their way to world domination, to remove 
Russia from the geopolitical arena by any means would be 
imperiled. 
  Keeping a vast country under control under such conditions 
without the use of force is practically impossible. For this 
reason the backstage scriptwriters of our modern drama were from 
the outset given the assignment of devising and realizing in 
practice in Russia a set of methods of the country's controlled 
transfer to a new political regime with elements of 
dictatorship. The program-maximum here provides for the 
achievement of secret, but complete and strict, international 
control over the domestic political situation. The 
program-minimum, nonadmission to the levers of state power of 
national-patriotic forces. 
  Many puzzles of our contemporary history are easily 
explained 
upon an analysis of the political collisions in Russia within 
the framework of this set of methods. The tragi-comic Emergency 
Committee "putsch" appears in a new light. The striking 
coincidence of the offices of the "putschists" in August 1991 
and of the "rebels" in October 1993 is clear also. In addition, 
even quite a confident forecast of the political situation in 
the immediate future is possible from this viewpoint. But 
everything in its turn. 
<H5>  August of '91... </H5>
  Before embarking on an examination of the August events, 
which dramatically determined Russian and, to a considerable 
extent, world history of recent years and served as the point of 
departure for processes that culminated in the recent tragedy in 
Moscow, it is essential to provide certain explanations. 
  First, our thoughts may be of at least some analytical value 
only in the event of us abandoning emotional value judgments and 
trying to impartially trace the techniques and backstage 
political mechanics of the phenomena. Whether the state and 
political system of the USSR was good or bad--we will leave this 
question outside of the framework of the article lest we 
complicate matters by personal predilections. 
  Second, while possessing the undoubted benefit of simplicity 
and graphic depiction, the sketchiness inevitable with such an 
analysis has simultaneously a number of shortcomings also. One 
such is a certain consolidation of events preventing us 
conveying all of the practical diversity and actual complexity. 
It is essential that this be borne in mind to avoid being, as a 
result, an uncritical captive of particular theories to the 
detriment of the actual political practice. 
  Third, a retrospective (backdated) reconstruction of the 
operating methods of this political force or the other cannot, 
by virtue of a natural lack of information, lay claim to 
exhaustive fullness. While reconstituting its main, principal 
features with a high degree of probability, it is in no way 
possible to guarantee 100 percent accuracy and the full 
correspondence of detail. Nor is this necessary, for such 
shortcomings do not prevent the achievement of the main goal--a 
qualified evaluation of the leading trends of our political life. 
  Bearing in mind all these amendments, the situation 
preceding 
the Emergency Committee "putsch" may be described as follows. 
  Quite a curious and distinctive picture of political forces 
had taken shape in the country by mid-1991. Formally, the old 
party nomenklatura continued to keep a firm hold of the most 
important levers of state administration. Under its strict 
control were the power structures: the national armed 
forces--combat-ready and easily controllable and barely touched 
in practice by the trends of "perestroyka"; the ramified and 
universal machinery of the Committee for State 
Security--efficient, suitable for the accomplishment of the most 
complex and delicate assignments, and possessing immense 
information and analytical potential; the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs with its most extensive opportunities for controlling 
the situation in the country. 
  For these structures the "flash points" and centers of 
conflict that existed at that time on the territory of the USSR 
represented no in any way serious threat and could, from the 
purely technical viewpoint, have been "extinguished" at any 
moment. 
  The party and state vertical line, thoroughly battered and 
shaken in the six perestroyka years, nonetheless continued still 
to be a relatively dependable executive framework which was 
experienced and professional in matters of administrative and 
economic management. Relying on it, any measures of state 
stabilization could have been implemented perfectly 
well--especially as an understanding that the reform race, which 
had began so clamorously, was becoming by degrees a campaign for 
the dismantling of all the most important state institutions had 
matured among party functionaries. 
  The legislative authority--the USSR Supreme Soviet--could 
easily, if necessary, have mustered the majority needed to pass 
stabilization decisions. The CPSU Central Committee bureaucracy, 
with its numerous and highly qualified specialists, was, as 
before, a sufficiently efficient center of control. Central 
Television and the majority of oblast studios and a substantial 
part of the central and local press remained in the party's 
hands. The financial possibilities of the CPSU were enormous 
also. It had almost undivided operational leadership of the 
economy. 
  More simply put--the party had everything. Except for one 
thing, the most important. ITS CENTRAL ORGANISM WAS UTTERLY 
DEVOID OF A VIGOROUS AND SINGLE-MINDED POLITICAL WILL. Being led 
to the slaughter by its own leaders, the fatigued and decrepit 
CPSU could not find within itself the powers--obeying its own 
political self-preservation instinct--even to adopt elementary 
measures of precaution and self-defense. 
  Nonetheless, continuing "by force of inertia" to control all 
the commanding political heights, the party was, seemingly, an 
insuperable obstacle in the way of the new, energetic, and 
grasping political predators aspiring to take its place on the 
Olympus of state power. In addition, there continued to be the 
"danger" (slight, but real, nonetheless!) that healthy 
intra-party reform could breathe into its enormous body the 
beneficial spark of new life.... 
  The "democratic" elite was, therefore, confronted with all 
seriousness and urgency with the question of the need to ensure 
the drastic, instantaneous "dumping" of its party opponents and 
the destruction of the mechanisms of the political domination of 
the CPSU. 
  This quasi-democratic elite, which had taken shape rapidly 
in 
the years of perestroyka from party renegades, opportunist 
government officials sensitive to the least change in the 
political climate, "agents of influence," "civil 
libertarian"-dissidents, part of the denationalized "artistic" 
intelligentsia, and other fragments, outwardly represented a 
shapeless and patchwork phenomenon. It would have had no chance 
of victory had it not been for three factors which played a 
decisive part in this confrontation. 
  First, the vigorous, outright maniacal will to power which 
united the friable, diverse multitude of "democrats" into a 
single herd (I am referring, of course, merely to those who 
acted consciously, and I by no means wish to offend the vast 
majority of well-intentioned people who succumbed to the 
fascination of eye-catching slogans and populist appeals). 
  Second, the "liberal democratic" ideology, which was 
attractive following decades of exalted praise for the status 
quo and ideological stagnation and behind whose generously 
daubed facade it was impossible for the unsophisticated gaze of 
the naive Russian public almost to discern the hypocrisy and 
cynicism of its vociferous proponents. It was this ideology that 
secured for the "democrats" the unconditional support of the 
West with all the ensuing material and organizational 
consequences. It was its interior that contained the grain of 
destruction for whose sake, in fact, it was foisted so 
vigorously and clamorously on public opinion and whose shoots 
coincided with the collapse of the USSR, and whose first fruits 
coincided with the October tragedy in Moscow. 
  Third--and this is the main factor, perhaps--the "democrats" 
had influential allies in the other camp. The "monolithic unity" 
of the CPSU was a bluff, and a substantial part of the 
unscrupulous nomenklatura, attracted by promises that they would 
"live as in Europe," constituted an impressive fifth column in 
the party's rear ready at any moment to surrender it to whoever 
would pay more. IT IS PARADOXICAL, BUT A FACT: THE HEAD OF THIS 
ARMY OF TRAITORS AND DESERTERS WAS THE GENERAL SECRETARY HIMSELF 
WITH HIS IMMEDIATE ENTOURAGE.... 
  There was on the political stage at that time one further 
force--regional. It was represented by the political elites of 
the Union republics. As ill luck would have it, with the 
majority of them the rudiments of state wisdom were 
confined--alas!--to an aspiration to rake in for themselves as 
much in the way of power and various benefits as possible and to 
snatch as many rights and privileges as they could. In the race 
for these cherished aims they were always prepared to support 
whoever would promise them more. 
  It is clear that with this alignment of forces the party 
elite was doomed. It was merely a question of the path by which 
the change of power would occur--evolution or revolution. The 
first left open the possibility of the existence of a unified 
state and the continued healthy reform of society, the second 
presupposed the collapse of the country and a sharp weakening of 
Russia and, consequently, a powerful geopolitical shift in favor 
of the West. 
<H5>  The Algebra of Politics </H5>
  The art of the imperceptible manipulation of large-scale 
political processes by no means consists, as some people 
believe, of a backstage conductor (conductors) controlling their 
progress from start to finish, predetermining the set goal. This 
understanding of "conspiracies"--from the simplest petty 
intrigue through the "world Yid-Masonic" conspiracy--is 
incomplete and primitive. In reality, the political environment 
is too complex, diverse, and unpredictable for it to be so 
strictly controlled. 
  No, the real "art of power" consists of the ability to make 
virtuoso use of the results of the natural flow of events, only 
occasionally, at most important moments, imparting to them the 
essential direction by almost intangible, but precise and 
calibrated influences. 
  It is thus, I believe, that the political history of Russia 
of recent years has been programmed. 
  The set of methods of this programming may conditionally be 
called the methods of "controlled explosions" or "managed 
catastrophe." Their main purpose is the consistent removal from 
the Russian political arena of all forces capable of impeding 
the country's integration in the single supra-state system of 
the "new world order." The principle of their action is based on 
the use of the political and social antagonisms that naturally 
exist in any state, especially a state in the grip, like Russia, 
of a profound systemic crisis. The starting point of the process 
is the political reality that has taken shape as of a certain 
moment of time, and its end result, the transfer of the entire 
social and political system to a fundamentally new condition 
with certain predetermined characteristics. 
  For simplicity and convenience of schematic description let 
us establish that there participate in the process "players" 
pursuing independent political goals, and a "conductor," whose 
mission it is with the aid of the set of methods described to 
ensure certain rules of the game guaranteeing the predetermined 
result. Essentially, the "conductor" is a player just like the 
others, only of a higher order and the highest qualifications. 
He also pursues an independent goal, the difference being merely 
that he is hidden from the majority of "players," and this is an 
essential condition of its realization. 
  For convenience of analysis the entire process may be 
divided 
into five consecutive phases. 
  The FIRST phase is the focusing or initial phase. It 
provides 
for the "conductor's" determination of his attitude toward the 
"players." The "players" are divided into one's own and others', 
friends and foes, allies and opponents. The main criterion 
making it possible to conduct such an operation with sufficient 
precision is the attitude of the "players" toward some 
fundamental, model concepts and requirements reflecting the true 
purposes of the "conductor" in this game. The ascertainment of 
such "models" in all walks of life is extraordinarily important 
for the observer-analyst, for it is they that make it possible 
to compile the most realistic idea of the real, not sham, goals 
and driving forces of the game. 
  Assuming that some outside force interested in the 
elimination of a strong rival attempts to assume the role of 
"conductor" in the current Russian troubles, as has repeatedly 
been the case throughout our tumultuous 1,000-year history, we 
obtain (with reference to the pre-putsch situation of 1991): 
  1. Serving for the "conductor" as the "model" for choice of 
friends should be the "players'" readiness for the sake of the 
achievement of their individual political and material goals 
(power, wealth, and so forth) to sacrifice the interests of the 
USSR (Russia) as a geopolitical subject: the country's 
territorial integrity, its military and economic power, 
political sovereignty, spiritual and cultural distinctiveness, 
and so forth.... 
  2. In the confrontation of "democrats" and "communists" the 
"conductor's" natural allies are the denationalized "democrats" 
with their aspiration to "integration in the world economic 
system," "entry into the market," "primacy of values common to 
all mankind," and such-like ideological fetishes concealing an 
absence of any national purpose whatever and the rudiments of a 
state instinct. 
  The "communists" (who were earlier, at the dawn of their 
existence, the loyal allies of the "conductor") automatically 
find themselves in the role of "enemies," for the elementary 
self-preservation instinct dictates to them concern for the 
utmost strengthening of the social and political and 
state-administrative system which ensures their dominating 
position. 
  The propaganda formalization of this 
opposition--"freedom-loving democrats against the totalitarian 
monster of barracks socialism"--bears no relation here to the 
heart of the matter and is intended merely to ensure that public 
opinion accept the coming changes as unquestioningly as 
possible.... 
  The SECOND PHASE is the cumulative or polarization phase. 
The 
friends and enemies have been determined, so now it is necessary 
to polarize these two forces as much as possible and to exclude 
any possibility of compromise between them. Concentrated around 
one pole are all those who are intended by the "conductor" to 
walk out onto the stage and seize power at the end of the game, 
around the other, those who have to be removed from the 
political arena. 
  The personal question is of particular importance here. 
Russia, as we all know, does not tolerate impersonal truths, and 
every idea in it laying claim to realization must necessarily be 
personified. It is hard to exaggerate the role of individuality, 
the personality, and a striking and vigorous leader under our 
conditions. This is why at this stage the experienced 
"conductor" endeavors in every way possible to ensure that all 
the "players" of the other side and all political leaders of the 
opposition have a chance to show clearly enough what they can do 
and end up here in one general political bunch. The opposite 
pole, which is to be removed, should have time to attract to 
itself all the forces destined to be "cut" and all leaders whose 
removal guarantees the "players" who are the "conductor's" 
allies maximum freedom of action. 
  Projecting this format onto the era of perestroyka, we find 
that the period 1985 through 1989 corresponds, roughly, to the 
first phase of the game, the years 1989-1990, to the second. It 
was at this time that the attack on communism in the news media 
came to be tied in distinctly with the assaults on statehood as 
such. Full voice was given to the provocative slogans "The USSR 
is the evil empire," "Patriotism is the attribute of 
scoundrels," "Russian history is the history of slavery," and 
such like. The propaganda of outright Russophobia and the 
furious hounding of Russian writers assumed unprecedented 
proportions, and the "chained curs of perestroyka" were at the 
same time choking from fury apropos "Russian anti-Semitism" and 
vituperated demagogically in an expectation of mythical Jewish 
pogroms. 
  This entire barrage of hatred and cynicism pursued as a 
principal purpose the ascertainment of the patriotic forces and 
an evaluation of the possibilities of their influence on the 
mass consciousness, a "battle reconnaissance," so to speak. In 
addition, it was anticipated, not without reason, that the dirty 
and insulting tone of the polemic would force the patriots, in 
turn, to lapse into shrill vituperation and extremism, in this 
way discrediting the very idea of patriotism and nationally 
conceptualized statehood. The alliance of populists and patriots 
and communists and statists, which was highly likely under these 
conditions, also blended splendidly into the script of the game. 
  The THIRD PHASE is the crisis phase. It is, perhaps, the key 
phase, the most important of all. Its realization requires of 
the "conductor" particularly careful, comprehensive preparation 
and the meticulous, refined craftsmanship of political intrigue. 
The main content of this phase of the game is the clever 
incitement of opponents against one another and the spurring of 
subjective contradictions excluding the possibility of accords 
geared to an escape from the crisis. The situation is converted 
here into a stalemated, deadlocked condition, when turning for 
help to normal, legal, and evolutionary political means becomes 
impossible. 
  A clash of the "players" under conditions that are patently 
disadvantageous to the opponents of the "conductor" and 
favorable for its allies is simultaneously provoked in every 
possible way here. 
  It was thus that events developed at the end of 1990 through 
the first half of 1991. The collapse of the world socialist 
system, the progressive disintegration of the USSR, the 
aggressive nationalism of the outlying areas, the January events 
in Lithuania, the inexplicable inaction of a general 
secretary-president invested with boundless authority, the 
unrest in the party masses, the hysteria of the "democratic" 
news media, the defamation of the army and the loss of all 
strategic allies, the disregard for the results of the March 
referendum, which confirmed the country's unity--the result of 
all this was that the party, more precisely, its 
conservative-state wing, was left with practically no choice. It 
was necessary either to unconditionally surrender in the face of 
the new realities or take decisive action to stabilize the 
internal and external position of the USSR. 
  Thus was the August "putsch" incited. 
  The FOURTH PHASE of the process is the power or 
revolutionary 
phase. It is in terms of time the shortest, but in terms of 
significance, the most decisive. Its course is almost wholly 
dependent on how carefully the preparation at the preceding 
stage of the game has been. Of course, there is always the 
element of risk, but with the competent actions of the 
"conductor" it is quite small. 
  This phase presupposes the "players'" move beyond the 
framework of the legal field and the settled political 
stereotypes. This explosion creates the ideal preliminary 
conditions for a decisive change in the political landscape. 
Public opinion, which is in a state of shock, subsequently 
allows the victorious "player" to carry out any revolutionary 
manipulations in no fear of responsibility or organized 
counteraction. 
  In the case of the Emergency Committee the deplorable result 
for its sponsors and participants had been predetermined from 
the outset, and the possibility of the uncontrollable 
development of the "putsch" had been reduced to a minimum. The 
following factors contributed to this: 
  1. The predictability of the event itself. The putsch had 
been "in the air," so to speak, long prior to the attempt at its 
practical realization. That something of the sort had to be 
about to occur was obvious to the main "players" in advance so 
the "initiated" had every opportunity to prepare for the 
denouement. 
  2. The nature of the "putsch," which was phony, timid, and 
indecisive from the outset. It had never been planned in earnest 
even by the organizers themselves. The tacit assumption was that 
a show of decisiveness and strength would in itself sort 
everything out, having then become a decoration and effective 
background against which stabilization measures would be 
implemented easily and without hindrance. 
  3. The strange (to put it mildly) behavior of the head of 
the 
party and the state. The double game of the president-general 
secretary at this stage is obvious. Having by his inaction given 
the Emergency Committee the "green light," he instantly "turned 
in" all his party associates as soon as the situation became 
irreversible. And his personal political aims were 
straightforward and comprehensible, what is more: ridding 
himself of the inconvenient tutelage of the "conservatives," 
untying his hands for further political and personnel maneuvers, 
and so on and so forth. 
  The aims of the "conductor," however, were different. And it 
was they that predetermined the content of the final, fifth, 
stage of this game. 
  The FIFTH PHASE may be defined as that of collapse. As a 
result of the incited political explosion the hostile power pole 
finds itself "outlawed" and is ruthlessly liquidated. The 
rupture of the legal space and the paralysis of the enemy, 
shaken by the unexpected turn of affairs, enable the victorious 
"players" to promptly smash their opponents, rapidly occupy all 
the commanding heights, and emphatically transfer the situation 
to a new quality beneficial to themselves--which was anticipated 
by the set of methods within whose framework the "conductor" 
operated. 
  In the case of the August "putsch" this collapse phase 
lasted 
right up until December 1991, when, as a result of the Belovezha 
conspiracy, which logically crowned the "perestroyka process," 
the USSR--the historical and geopolitical successor of the 
Russian Empire--was legally liquidated. The sought-for "new 
quality" of both the intra-Russian and global, world balance of 
forces was achieved.... 
  We have tried in the example of the Emergency Committee to 
describe in the most general outlines the set of methods of 
"managed catastrophe" applied for the manipulation of political 
processes in Russia. Let us sum up. 
  IN BRIEF, THIS SET OF METHODS COULD BE FORMULATED AS 
FOLLOWS: 
"DIVISION--CONFLICT--DEADLOCK--EXPLOSION--COLLAPSE." The seed of 
division is introduced into the ruling political grouping (or 
one that already exists is stimulated). The rival factions are 
artificially polarized in respect to a predetermined ideological 
pair (communism--democracy; cosmopolitanism--nationalism; 
capitalism--socialism; market--plan; and so forth). 
Contradictions are single-mindedly inflamed, the opposition 
being turned into an open conflict. This is followed by 
political deadlock and then a severe crisis, in the course of 
the power solution of which the "enemy" political grouping is 
liquidated. 
  If necessary, everything is repeated all over again as the 
team of victors loses its monolithic character and "undesirable" 
trends begin to grow within it once again. The successive series 
of such explosions time after time "filters" the political 
spectrum of the ruling elite, gradually dislodging the 
objectionable forces from all the structures of power and state 
administration, fragmenting and destroying their social base, 
and disorganizing and impeding ideological and practical 
consolidation. 
<H5>  And Once More October... </H5>
  By the fall of 1993 the alignment of political forces in the 
country was in some of its features painfully reminiscent of the 
pre-putsch situation of August '91. There were also, however, 
fundamentally new features that lent the situation an undoubted 
distinctiveness. 
  The game that had been successfully staged by the 
"conductor," having culminated in the collapse of the USSR and 
the breakup of the party and state nomenklatura, represented 
strategically merely act one of a wide-ranging scenario entitled 
"The Taming of the Russian Bear." The essence of the scenario 
consists, as we have already said, of the destruction of the 
historically evolved geopolitical Russian "power center" and the 
subsequent integration of its fragments in transnational 
structures of the "single world community." 
  The old party elite was far from the sole obstacle on this 
path. There were in the vast country many forces, different in 
terms of their primary political persuasion, but equally opposed 
to the "democratic" prospect of Russia's conversion into a raw 
material appendage and a beachhead of the "new world order." The 
"conductor" had to lure these forces--deprived to a considerable 
extent of clear ideological and political self-awareness, 
eroded, and unorganized--to the surface of political life and 
smash them one by one, preventing their unification and 
formation. 
  This need predetermined a repetition--at a new level--of 
that 
same "game cycle" we considered in the previous chapter. 
  The power picture of the Russian political field that had 
taken shape following the liquidation of the USSR and the start 
of the shock market reforms afforded every opportunity for this. 
Real authority--the power structures, the news media, 
operational control of the country's economic mechanism, foreign 
policy, and other key spheres--was almost entirely under the 
control of the president's team. On the other hand, considerable 
opportunities for influencing the situation were retained by the 
Supreme Soviet, which had, according to the logic of events, to 
have occupied a critical position in relation to the president 
and the government. Emerging from the same "democratic egg," 
these rival twins inevitably moved further apart from one 
another. Things were too cramped for them together on the upper 
platform of the political Olympus, and the opportunist need to 
constantly declare an "independent political position" 
predetermined the parallel search for their own ideology and 
social base. 
  The first, focusing, phase of the "game" in this situation 
presented the "conductor" with no great difficulty. The majority 
of the old, tried-and-tested personnel was concentrated in the 
radical-democratic camp of the president, which, however, did 
not rule out the possibility of their reinforcement with gifted 
recruits from outside and the use of supplementary strong 
points. These "players" had to be enshrined in the public 
consciousness as "reformers." 
  In accordance with the set of methods already known to us, a 
negative pole, intended for liquidation, must necessarily be 
counterposed to this "positive" pole. Appointed for this role 
was the Supreme Soviet, which had originally not even conceived 
of any conflicts but had contemplated "honorably" and "legally" 
sharing power with the executive structures on the basis of the 
customary backstage agreements and compromises. But its 
"players" had already been assigned the role of "conservatives" 
and "revanchists" in advance. Need it be said that the 
hysterics, on account of the "conservative attacks" on the 
"reform forces" or the "red-brown danger" allegedly threatening 
the young Russian democracy, which were incited in society by 
degrees, had nothing in common with reality and reflected merely 
the propaganda myth within whose framework it was contemplated 
preparing society for the coming events. 
  The situation was complicated somewhat by the presence of 
increasingly independent regions, whose position it was 
difficult to anticipate in advance, but it was perfectly 
suitable for the game as a whole. The intensifying economic 
crisis even created a particularly favorable background for it, 
polarizing public opinion in natural fashion in respect to all 
that was happening. In short, the first phase of the process did 
not take much time, and by the start of 1992 the game had even 
entered the second--cumulative--phase. 
  No difficulties were encountered here either. The 
uncompromising and strict policy of the "reformers" and the 
categorical refusal to admit to the levers of real power the 
leadership of the "conservative" Supreme Soviet rapidly did its 
job. The mutual insults and personal character traits of the 
leaders of the opposed forces contributed to this to a 
considerable extent, which showed once again that an ability to 
play on human frailties and passions is an indispensable 
condition of political success in a "democratic" society. 
  The situation developed in line of ascent throughout 1992 
until it finally, in December, entered the next, conflict, 
phase. Open conflict was initiated at the congress of people's 
deputies by the sharply worded, provocative speech of the 
president, who declared to the whole country that "it is 
impossible to work with this congress." 
  All attempts at a compromise between the executive and the 
legislature were then deliberately, it has to be assumed, 
stymied. The statements of their leaders became increasingly 
harsh, ultimately becoming avowedly confrontational. The 
president's March attempt to impose the "special order of rule 
of the country" "won" by the April Referendum, the Supreme 
Soviet's transition en bloc almost to "opposition"--these are 
just some of the landmarks on this path. 
  As the legislators became increasingly "conservative," ALL 
FORCES THAT REJECTED THE PATH OF THE "DEMOCRATIC" DISMANTLING OF 
RUSSIAN STATEHOOD CONCENTRATED BY DEGREES AT THIS POLE. 
Ultimately it became an odd conglomerate which incorporated the 
most diverse factions--from communists to monarchists. Lacking a 
well-considered common program, ALL WHO WERE "AGAINST" 
DEMOCRATIC EXTREMISM, GATHERED HERE, WHICH, IN FACT, IDEALLY 
CORRESPONDED TO THE PREDETERMINED SCRIPT OF THE GAME. 
  Reality is always broader than the stereotyped pattern, so 
events in this period developed at times in highly dramatic 
fashion, but ultimately the required result was, nonetheless, 
achieved in full. 
  By the fall of 1993 the political situation had obviously 
become deadlocked. When, therefore, the conflict switched to the 
revolutionary, power phase--as of the time the president signed 
the edict on the dissolution of the Supreme Soviet and the 
congress--no one was particularly surprised. Its temporal 
framework may be defined perfectly precisely: from 21 September 
through 5 October. Carefully planned, by all accounts, it was 
crowned with a "success" as complete and decisive as, it would 
seem, the victors themselves even had not expected. The Supreme 
Soviet was destroyed in both the literal and metaphorical 
meaning of this word, and the clashes of the army and the 
militia with its defenders were presented to society as a 
"communo-fascist rebellion." The imposition of a state of 
emergency in Moscow and the disintegration of the entire 
vertical line of the soviets, down to the local soviets also, 
conclusively concentrated state power in the hands of the 
"reformers," who had smashed simultaneously the vast majority of 
opposition political organizations and the "conservative" news 
media. 
  The country had once again accomplished a revolutionary leap 
into a new quality of its political being: FROM BENEATH THE 
DISLODGED DEMOCRATIC MASK FLASHED THE BARED WOLF'S TEETH OF A 
CYNICAL RUTHLESS DICTATORSHIP. 
  The collapse phase of this process continues, and God only 
knows how far its end result will coincide with the 
"conductor's" original desires. But it is possible even now to 
draw some conclusions and even venture certain forecasts. 
<H5>  Not Peace But the Sword... </H5>
  So how are we to view the fact that the "Supreme Soviet 
party" lost to the "president's party"? This question is for the 
patriotic consciousness far from being as simple as might appear 
at first sight. 
  First, "cut off" as a result of the "communo-fascist 
rebellion" is to a large extent part of that same "democratic" 
elite which had come to power after the "putsch" in 1991. 
"Conservative" and "patriotic" slogans were for many of them 
merely a tool for establishing their own political individuality 
in the struggle for power, not by any means an expression of 
conceptualized beliefs arrived at after considerable torment. 
Compared with the democratic radicals, they would undoubtedly be 
the lesser evil, but in principle.... "Same broth, only a bit 
thinner," as the Russian folk saying aptly characterizes such 
situations. 
  In addition, together with the "Supreme Soviet party" 
certain 
extremist organizations which had affiliated to it in the course 
of the power confrontation and which had performed a patently 
provocative role in the unleashing of the "rebellion" have found 
themselves swept from the political stage also. This fact may be 
ranked with the few positive results of the events, especially 
if it is considered how much blood the patriotic movement has 
been caused by the "extreme left" and the "extreme right," 
preventing the unification of the healthy forces, discrediting 
the movement as a whole, inciting hysteria, and affording the 
"democrats" a pretext for the dirtiest and most unbridled 
accusations against the patriots. 
  And, finally, the main point (if we think about it, it is 
clear that nothing was concluded by the events in Moscow that 
followed the president's edict on the dissolution of parliament. 
On the contrary, everything is only just beginning). Having won 
round one of the "battle for Russia" from the party nomenklatura 
in 1991, the makers of the "new world order" staged round two 
also--against some of their recent allies, "incorrect" democrats 
who had "degenerated" in a spirit of "imperial thinking" and 
"great-power chauvinism." 
  But the innocent blood, clamor, and din of this struggle 
attracted general attention, which had been exacerbated by the 
crisis processes in many spheres of social, economic, and state 
life. People involuntarily had to reflect on where the true 
causes of what is happening are rooted. The result is evident: 
It may confidently be said today that there has come to be 
considerably more people than there were a year ago even who are 
aware of the real nature of the present authorities, who 
understand in what a most difficult situation Russia has found 
itself today, and who are convinced that it can only be saved by 
a process of the unification of all healthy forces based on our 
centuries-old national-state, spiritual, and moral and religious 
values. 
  Nor should the difficulties awaiting us on this path be 
understated. Nonetheless, there is hope. No repressive edicts or 
police measures of a fledgling dictatorship can halt the shift 
in the public consciousness, make up for the rapid reduction in 
the social base of the regime, or prevent the coming changes. It 
is important, however, that the patriotic forces learn a serious 
lesson from what has happened and not repeat their past mistakes 
in the future. This is the guarantee of success! 
  There is no future for the present antipopular regime, 
however. IF IT IS COMPELLED TO EXIST FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME 
UNDER THE CONDITIONS OF PEACEFUL, NONVIOLENT DEVELOPMENT AND 
LEGAL STABILITY, IT WILL INEVITABLY BE SWEPT AWAY BY THE 
OPPOSITION. The present "elite" can hold on to power only by 
intensifying the dictatorship. Increasingly new conflicts and 
social unrest are needed as a pretext for this. It would be no 
bad thing for today's exultant "democrats" to give some thought, 
incidentally, as to which of them will the next time be the 
victim of another political intrigue at a new turn of the brutal 
game. And it is, it would seem, inevitable, for only the tops 
have been cut off, the rootlets, on the other hand--the crisis 
phenomena in all spheres of contemporary Russian life--have 
remained entirely untouched. 
  The main danger is that at each new such turn the power 
phase 
of the conflict will become increasingly prolonged and furious, 
pulling into its maelstrom increasingly large masses of people. 
How this might end requires, I believe, no explanation. This 
would be, for that matter, that very result, perhaps, to which 
the true conductors of our troubles, ensuring the unsinkability 
of the bankrupt regime, aspire. 
  It is not fortuitous that this regime: 
  Came to real power in August 1991 under the cover of 
deafening populist demagogy on the wave of a powerful political 
cataclysm; 
  remained afloat for two years after this by inflaming an 
atmosphere of confrontation and political hysteria and 
repeatedly provoking the opposition into collisions; 
  managed in the fall of 1993 to avoid a crushing political 
defeat merely at the price of the organization in Moscow of 
bloody clashes in which hundreds of people died. 
  Such a regime is a regime of civil war. And all who desire 
to 
avoid national catastrophe need, regardless of their political 
positions, to join efforts to ensure for our people a peaceful 
future and the possibility of themselves, freely and 
consciously, deciding their historical destiny. [passage omitted]
