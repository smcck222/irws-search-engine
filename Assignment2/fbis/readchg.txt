Changes to the Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS) files.

1. Since the significance of the document numbers in the original files were
   not clear to us (see document number between <HT> tags), we created
   our own <DOCNO> tags and document numbers.  The new document numbers
   are easier to understand and are consistent with other TREC/NIST
   collections.  An example DOCNO is FBIS3-1 where FBIS abbreviates
   Foreign Broadcast Information Service, 3 is the original FBIS CD number,
   and 1 a sequential number assigned to documents from the beginning
   of the current file.
   
2. To maintain consistency throughout NIST/TREC collections, all tags were
   converted to upper case.  
 
3. SGML-tagging of special characters was corrected and made more consistent.
