The format uses a labeled bracketing, expressed in the style of SGML (Standard 
Generalized Markup Language).  The SGML DTD used for verification at NIST is 
included on the CD.  The philosophy in the formatting at NIST has been to
preserve as much of the original structure as possible, but to provide
enough consistency to allow simple decoding of the data.

  [Text] The Civil Guard have seized 60 kilos of high purity
heroin in "Operation Bread" in Madrid. Three suspected members
of an international drug-trafficking network were arrested. The
drugs seized would have fetched over 1 billion pesetas on the
market.
  In the town of Mojacar in Almeria province, the Civil Guard
have seized 1,171 kilos of hashish resin, and arrested an
Algerian national who is linked with the consignment.

The datasets have all been compressed using the UNIX "compress" utility.

Both as part of the philosophy of leaving the data as close to the original as 
possible, and because it is impossible to check all the data manually, there 
are many "errors" in the data.  These range from errors in the original data, 
such as typographical errors, improper tagging errors, to errors in the 
reformatting done at NIST.  The error-checking has concentrated on allowing 
readability of the data rather than on correcting content.  This means that 
there have been automated checks for control characters, special symbols,
foreign language characters, for correct matching of the begin and end tags, 
and for complete DOC and DOCNO fields.  The types of "errors" remaining include 
fragment sentences, strange formatting around tables or other "non-textual" 
items, misspellings, missing fields (that are generally missing from the data), 
etc.
