SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule would revise the United States Standards for Grades of Apricots. The proposal would specify definitions
that do not appear in the standard but are described in the inspection handbooks and bring up to date any obsolete terms
and definitions. In addition, the proposed rule will provide metric equivalents for dimensions given in terms of
U.S. Customary units and contains conforming and editorial changes.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has determined that this action will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This proposed rule for the revision of U.S. Standards for
Grades of Apricots will not impose substantial direct economic cost, recordkeeping, or personnel workload changes
on small entities, and will not alter the market share or competitive position of these entities relative to large
businesses. In addition, under the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, the use of these standards is voluntary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended
to have retroactive effect. This proposed rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies,
unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must
be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agencies periodically review existing regulations. An objective of the review is to ensure that the grade standards
are serving their intended purpose, the language is clear, and the standards are consistent with AMS policy and authority.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The United States Standards for Grades of Apricots became effective on May 25, 1928 and has not been revised since then.
In June 1992, the Washington Apricot Marketing Committee (WAMC) requested the USDA to revise the standard. Consisting
of producers from various districts throughout the State, the WAMC recommends minimum size, pack, and grade requirements
each year for the Federal Marketing Order on Washington State grown apricots. Specifically, the WAMC requested that
skin breaks (cuts and stem punctures), and stem pulls be changed from ``free from'' defects to ``free from damage''
or ``serious damage'' defects in the U.S. No. 1 and U.S. No. 2 grades, respectively. Such changes would have the effect
of allowing these defects on fruit in various degrees without being scored against the grade (versus ``free from''
which means they are scored on sight). WAMC also suggested that the Department should make any other revisions deemed
necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AMS reviewed these issues to ascertain the need for the change proposed by WAMC as well as other technical changes or
updates that the Agency believes may be helpful. Many suggestions and comments were received pertaining to a recent
informal market survey by AMS. The California Apricot Advisory Board advised AMS that the changes proposed pertaining
to skinbreaks and stem pulls are not warranted and would allow the export of otherwise unsaleable product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, it would appear that there is not a widespread consensus among interested parties that skin breaks, stem
punctures or similar defects should be allowed in these grades. However, in order for the Department to receive comments
in a more widespread and formal manner this requested change as well as the following changes by the Department which
would bring the standard up to date with current industry practices, are being proposed.

Sections 51.2925 and 51.2926 are proposed to be revised to remove cuts and skin breaks as free from defects (and change
them to free from damage and serious damage defects, respectively). According to the Washington Apricot Marketing
Committee, the ``Washington Apricot industry has had difficulty in meeting the U.S. Grade Standards for Apricots
with regard to `skin breaks.' This has caused a great deal of hardship as the industry attempts to make sales into Canada.
Over the past year members of the Washington Apricot Marketing Committee have been expressing a desire to gain some
sort of relief from the strict interpretation of the `free from' portion of the grade standards. The real problem,
as our industry sees it, is that there is no definition of what constitutes `damage' and `serious damage' relative
to `skin breaks' and/or `punctures.' Consequently, all of these types of defects are scored no matter how small or
insignificant they might be.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is proposed that &sect;&sect;51.2925 and 51.2926 be revised to include bruises as a specified defect. Bruising
is a prevalent defect on apricots that should have specific areas designated which constitute damage and serious
damage. Presently, this defect is scored based on the general definitions for damage and serious damage. It is proposed
that any bruise causing discoloration exceeding the area of a circle three-eighths inch (9.5 mm) in diameter or one-eighth
inch (3.1 mm) in depth (damage) or five-eighths inch (15.9 mm) in diameter or three-sixteenths inch (4.8 mm) in depth
(serious damage), or an aggregate of lesser bruises detracting from the appearance, edible or shipping quality of
the apricot as much as the depth or area requirements previously mentioned be scored against the grade. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 51.2926a Unclassified is being removed. Unclassified is not a grade in itself but was simply a designation
for apricots that do not meet any grade requirement. However, it is often mistaken as an actual grade. Since the designation
is rarely used and may create some confusion in the market place it should be discontinued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is proposed that paragraph (c) Description of Pack of &sect;51.2927 be removed. This paragraph provides for pack
designations in 4-basket crates. Apricots are seldom, if ever, packed in these types of containers for today's markets.
Therefore, this paragraph is no longer needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d) Tolerance would also be removed. This paragraph allows a tolerance for offsize specimens. The proposed
rule would make referencing of these tolerances easier and bring the format into conformity with more recent standards
by establishing a separate ``Tolerances'' section. This new section, 51.2928 would respecify not only the size tolerances
which are being removed from paragraph (d), but would also apply tolerances to packages marked according to count,
and defect tolerances as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 51.2928 Mature is revised so that the definition of mature does not contain the word as part of the definition.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As previously mentioned a new section which would now be designated &sect;51.2928 Tolerances, would list all applicable
tolerances for the grades. Other than the provision for packages marked according to count, there are no new tolerances
proposed in this section. Rather than scatter the tolerances under different sections throughout the standard,
they have been grouped together under one section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new section, 51.2929 Application of Tolerances, is being proposed. This section will designate a limit on excessively
high defect percentages for an individual sample which, if exceeded, would cause the lot to fail to grade even though
the average of these defects may be within the lot tolerances provided. It is proposed that for lot tolerances of ten
percent or more, individual samples may not contain more than one and one-half times the tolerance specified, and
for tolerances of less than 10 percent, individual samples may contain not more than double the tolerance specified.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The general definition for damage would be revised to reflect that which is currently used in most other standards.
It also specifies that the dimensions provided for defect limits are based on an apricot one and seven-eighths inches
(4.8 cm) in diameter, and correspondingly lesser or greater dimensions are allowed for smaller or larger sized apricots.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the new section (51.2932) proposed for damage, each defect is listed as a separate paragraph. New definitions
under this section include dirt, scab, scale hail, skin breaks, stem pulls, and bruises. All specifications except
for bruises, skin breaks, and stem pulls are taken from the inspection handbook on scoring these defects under the
general definitions of damage and serious damage. The scoring for skin breaks and stem pulls was recommended by WAMC.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is proposed that scale occurring as scale insects, scale marks, or similar marks which are heavily concentrated
or are scattered and aggregating more than one-fourth inch (6.3 mm) in diameter (damage) or one-half inch (12.7 mm)
in diameter (serious damage); scab spot when cracked or aggregating more than three-eighths inch (9.5 mm) in diameter
in the aggregate (damage) or when the skin has been broken or when more than three-sixteenths of an inch (4.8 mm) deep
or more than one-half inch (12.7 mm) in diameter in the aggregate (serious damage); and bruises when any bruise causes
discoloration exceeding the area of a circle three-eighths inch (9.5 mm) in diameter or one-eighth inch (3.1 mm) in
depth (damage) or when any bruise causes discoloration exceeding the area of a circle five-eighths inch (15.9 mm)
in diameter or three-sixteenths (4.8 mm) in depth; skin breaks in the form of cuts and punctures which exceed individually
or in the aggregate, an area equivalent to a circle three-sixteenths inch (4.8 mm) in diameter (damage) or three-eighths
inch (9.6 mm) in diameter (serious damage); stem pulls which exceed an area equivalent to a circle three-eighths inch
(9.6 mm) in diameter (damage) or one-half inch (12.7 mm) in diameter (serious damage); be specified as definitions
under the appropriate sections.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (the 1993 Act) was enacted on August 10, 1993. Section 1106 of the 1993
Act amended the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 (the 1938 Act) by adding new section 320C that imposes a domestic
tobacco content requirement for cigarettes made in the United States by any ``domestic manufacturer of cigarettes''
as defined in the 1938 Act. Under the provisions of the Act, as amended, each such manufacturer of cigarettes must certify
the percentage of tobacco produced in the United States which was used by the manufacturer to produce cigarettes during
the preceding calendar year. If the percentage of United States produced tobacco used by a domestic manufacturer
of cigarettes in the manufacture of cigarettes is less than 75 percent, the manufacturer will be subject to a domestic
marketing assessment and must purchase a quantity of tobacco from inventories of the producer owned burley and flue-cured
cooperative marketing associations in an amount equal to the quantity of imported tobacco used by the manufacturer
to produce cigarettes during the preceding calendar year that exceeds 25 percent of the total quantity of tobacco
used in such cigarette production. When a manufacturer is subject to a domestic content marketing assessment, the
assessment rate will be based on the amount by which 1/2 the sum of the average prices per pound received during the most
recent marketing year, by producers of domestically produced burley tobacco and flue-cured tobacco, respectively,
exceeds the average price per pound paid for unmanufactured imported tobacco during the preceding calendar year.
This proposed rule would amend the regulations to implement the provisions of section 320C.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12886 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This proposed rule is issued in conformance with Executive Order 12866. Based on a preliminary regulatory impact
analysis, this proposed rule has been determined to be economically significant. To obtain a copy of the Preliminary
Regulatory Impact Statement, contact Dr. Robert Miller, Director, Tobacco and Peanut Analysis Division, Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service, United States Department of Agriculture, P. O. Box 2415, Washington, DC
20013&hyph;2415, telephone (202) 720&hyph;8839. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 75 percent domestic tobacco content requirement is expected to increase the usage of domestic tobacco by 188 million
pounds for 1994 which will cost domestic manufacturers about $200 million. Since the cost of domestic tobacco is about
double that of imported tobacco, domestic cigarette manufacturers are expected to shift cigarette production to
foreign based operations. As this shift in production occurs, domestic cigarette production is expected to decline
about 9 percent a year for the next four years. This will result in the loss of about 11,000 jobs in domestic cigarette
manufacturing plants. The use of domestically produced tobacco will eventually decline to a level less than if there
were no domestic content requirement. Domestic cigarette output is expected to decline about 40 percent by 1998.
The impact statement indicates little effect on the consumer prices for cigarettes because the tobacco accounts
for only about 3 percent of the cost of cigarettes. The regulatory impact analysis does not consider any effects that
an increase in cigarette excise tax may have on domestic cigarette production. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The initial increase in the use of domestic tobacco is expected to draw down current loan stocks of burley and flue-cured
tobacco. This will benefit tobacco producers in the short term since the Commodity Credit Corporation's net loan
outlays for the 1994 marketing year are estimated to be about $380 million less as a result of the domestic tobacco content
requirement. This will reduce the amount of the no-net-cost assessments paid by producers and purchasers of tobacco.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Except for the cigarette manufacturing sector, this proposed regulatory action is not expected to have an adverse
effect on the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities. This regulatory
action is not expected to be inconsistent nor interfere with an action taken or planned by another federal agency.
Other than as indicated in the summary of the regulatory impact statement, this action would not alter the budgetary
impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, loan programs, or the rights and obligations of the recipients thereof.
This proposed rule would be consistent with the President's priorities and principles set forth in Executive Order
12866.

Summary of Statutory Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 320B of the 1938 Act imposes certain requirements on ``domestic manufacturers of cigarettes'' and those
manufacturers are defined in section 301 of the 1938 Act to be those that produce and sell at least one percent of the
cigarettes produced and sold in the United States. Section 320B requires that those manufacturers specify each year,
in advance, their expected purchases of burley and flue-cured tobacco. The sanction for failing to do so accurately,
within certain limits, is that the manufacturer must pay an additional assessment to offset the cost of the Federal
tobacco program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 320C provides for additional requirements that must be met by ``domestic manufacturers of cigarettes''
to avoid additional assessments. The provisions of section 320C are set out in greater detail below in the description
of the content and organization of the proposed rule. Generally, under section 320C manufacturers who are ``domestic
manufacturers of cigarettes'' must certify each year the percentage of U.S. tobacco used in their cigarettes. If
more than 25 percent is imported tobacco, the manufacturer must pay an assessment. Also, if this limit is exceeded,
the manufacturer must make compensatory purchases of tobacco from the burley and flue-cured producer loan associations
and may be required to pay a penalty for failing to make such compensatory purchases in a timely manner. Under section
320C(f), the 75/25 ratio may be reduced if the Secretary determines that U.S. tobacco supply conditions warrant a
reduction due to conditions beyond the control of producers. Also, section 320C requires that manufacturers file
reports and maintain records as specified by the Secretary to enforce that section. Failure to file required reports
or maintain records, or the submission of false information can lead to criminal penalties as well as other sanctions.
Other new provisions concerning assessments on imported tobacco enacted in the 1993 Act will be implemented in a separate
rule.

Coverage of the Proposed Rule; Definition of Tobacco 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The 75/25 ratio is referred to in the rule as the ``domestic content requirement.'' Since this requirement is a calendar
year requirement under section 320C, the proposed rule would apply the requirement first in 1994. The authorizing
statute was enacted well into 1993. There is nothing in the Act to provide for making the provisions retroactive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirement applies only to ``domestic manufacturers of cigarettes.'' The statute does not limit, as such, the
content requirement to cigarettes produced by those manufacturers in the United States. The fact that section 320C
applies the requirement only to certain ``domestic'' manufacturers, and given other provisions of section 320C,
the proposed rule limits the coverage to cigarettes produced by subject manufacturers in the United States. For that
purpose, the rule defines ``United States,'' consistent with section 301 of the 1938 Act, to be the fifty States, the
territories of the United States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. With respect to limiting coverage to domestic
production, section 320C(b) provides that the sanctions in 320C(c), (d), and (e) will apply when the use of ``imported
tobacco'' exceeds 25 percent. Tobacco becomes ``imported'' only by reference to a domestic market. Hence, it appears
clear that the statute was intended to cover only domestic production of cigarettes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The domestic content requirement requires counting all the ``tobacco'' in the cigarettes and computing the amount
of ``imported tobacco'' in those cigarettes. The 1938 Act covers many commodities, including tobacco. Until recently
the tobacco provisions of the 1938 Act dealt mainly with regulating the production of tobacco by domestic producers
and the definition of ``tobacco'' in section 301 of the 1938 Act, which is made generally applicable to the entire 1938
Act, appears to have been drafted accordingly when it was enacted in 1938. The term ``tobacco'' is used in section 320C
without a modifier and in combination with the word ``imported.'' Tobacco is classified by kind and by type number.
For example, domestic burley tobacco is commonly referred to as type 31. Section 301 refers to the ``Service and Regulatory
Announcement 118 of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Bureau of Agricultural Economics'' published in 1929
and defines tobacco to mean certain specified tobacco types by type number as identified in Announcement 118. All
of the identified types, however, are identified in Announcement 118 as domestic tobaccos. Foreign tobaccos are
assigned other type numbers and, thus, under the section 301 definition, they technically would not appear to be,
``tobacco'' at all under that definition. However, section 320C clearly was intended to measure the amount of use
of ``imported tobacco,'' as those words would be defined in their common meaning as compared with domestic tobacco
use. Use of the section 301 definition of ``tobacco'' would make that comparison impossible and make the statute essentially
meaningless. Thus, the proposed rule presumes that the Congress did not intend for the section 301 definition of ``tobacco''
to be used for the section 320C purpose. The proposed rule has been drafted accordingly. ``Tobacco'' is defined in
the proposed rule to mean that which is commonly considered to be ``tobacco'' in the trade. As there is no provision
in the statute to do otherwise, that would include all foreign tobacco, including those like Turkish and Oriental
tobaccos, which may not have as close a domestic counterpart as other tobaccos. This inclusion is consistent with
the Conference report issued with the 1993 Act (H. Conf. Report No. 103&hyph;213) where the Conference managers stated
their belief that the 75/25 ratio, by allowing the maintenance of current blends, would be sufficient to ``permit
the continued importation of Turkish and Oriental tobaccos.'' If Turkish and Oriental tobaccos were not subject
to section 320C, the ratio would be irrelevant. These conclusions, as with all aspects of the proposed rule, are subject
to further consideration on receipt of comments.

1. Domestic Tobacco Content Requirement (&sect;723.502) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
A ``domestic manufacturer of cigarettes'' is defined in section 301(b)(17) of the 1938 Act as ``a person that produces
and sells more than 1 percent of the cigarettes produced and sold in the United States.'' To avoid the domestic marketing
assessment and other sanctions imposed by section 320C of the amended 1938 Act, beginning in 1994 and each succeeding
calendar year, each domestic manufacturer of cigarettes must use at least 75 percent domestically grown tobacco
in the cigarettes manufactured by such manufacturer. In determining compliance with the domestic content requirement,
the proposed rule specifies that imported tobacco will include all tobacco imported into the United States including
Oriental and Turkish tobaccos. The domestic tobacco content requirement will apply to all cigarettes manufactured
in the United States by a domestic manufacturer of cigarettes without regard to whether the manufactured cigarettes
are sold domestically or exported. The domestic content requirement would not apply to cigarettes manufactured
outside the United States by a domestic manufacturer of cigarettes. Likewise, the domestic tobacco content requirement
would not apply to tobacco processed in the United States for use in making cigarettes outside the United States. Domestic
manufacturers of cigarettes with operations located outside the United States would not be required to file reports
for cigarettes manufactured in such foreign based operations for foreign-made cigarettes and the domestic content
rules would not apply to such cigarettes.

2. Reports and Certifications by Domestic Manufacturers of Cigarettes (&sect;723.502) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under the proposed rule, beginning with the 1994 and each succeeding calendar year, each domestic manufacturer of
cigarettes would be required to maintain records, file reports and certify to the quantities of domestic and imported
tobacco used by such manufacturer to manufacture cigarettes in the United States. Determinations as to content percentages
would be based on the weight of the tobacco when it is ready for the cigarette manufacturing process. Adjustments,
to avoid double-counting, will be made for any tobacco which loses its identity during the manufacturing process
and is recaptured and reused to manufacture cigarettes by the same manufacturer and for tobacco in any cigarettes
returned to the manufacturer and reused by such manufacturer to manufacture other cigarettes. Such adjustments
will be made only to the extent that records are maintained which prove the reuse of such tobacco. For the purpose of
determining the domestic content percentage, any tobacco reconstituted, or otherwise processed, so as to lose its
respective identity as either imported tobacco or domestic tobacco, before being acquired by a domestic manufacturer
of cigarettes shall be considered to be imported tobacco when it is used to produce cigarettes by a domestic manufacturer
of cigarettes. The proposed rule provides that reports and certifications must be mailed or otherwise delivered
to Director, Tobacco and Peanuts Division, Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, U. S. Department
of Agriculture, P. O. Box 2415, Washington, DC 20013&hyph;2415 by February 15 of the year after the calendar year for
which reports and certifications apply. Failure to file timely reports or make required certifications will result
in all tobacco used by the manufacturer in the manufacturing of cigarettes in the United States being considered as
imported tobacco and sanctions would be applied accordingly. Such a presumption is provided for in section 320C(b)
of the 1938 Act.

3. Domestic Marketing Assessment and Required Purchases of Tobacco (&sect;&sect;723.503 and 723.504) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 320C(c) of the Act provides that if the quantity of imported tobacco used by a domestic manufacturer for making
cigarettes for the year exceeds 25 percent, such manufacturer must pay a domestic marketing assessment on each pound
of imported tobacco used in excess of 25 percent. In addition, as provided in section 320C(d) and (e), such manufacturer
must purchase tobacco from the existing burley and flue-cured tobacco inventories of producer owned cooperative
marketing associations in an amount equal to the weight of imported tobacco used in excess of 25 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The per pound domestic marketing assessment rate set by section 320C(c) is the difference between one-half the sum
of the average market prices received by domestic producers of burley tobacco and flue-cured tobacco, respectively,
and the average price of unmanufactured imported tobacco. Domestically produced burley and flue-cured tobaccos
are marketed on a marketing year basis. The average price per pound paid to domestic producers for a kind of tobacco
is determined for the marketing year. The marketing years are: for burley tobacco, October 1 through September 30;
and for flue-cured tobacco, July 1 through June 30. Under the proposed rule, the average prices for domestically produced
burley tobacco and flue-cured tobacco would be calculated using data published by the Department of Agriculture's
National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). For the other side of the comparison, a weighted average price
of all unmanufactured tobacco imported for consumption in the United States, with no allowance for tobacco reexported,
would be calculated from Bureau of Census data. For example, if the calculated average market prices were $1.83 per
pound for burley tobacco and $1.73 per pound for flue-cured tobacco, the average price would be $1.78 per pound. If
the weighted average price of unmanufactured imported tobacco for the relevant period was $1.28 per pound, a domestic
marketing assessment rate of $0.50 per pound would apply. That rate would be multiplied by the pounds of imported tobacco
used in excess of the 25 percent limit (unless a higher limit had been set under the Secretary's discretionary authority
to adjust the limit as provided for in section 320C(f)). If noncompliance is indicated, the cigarette manufacturer
will have an opportunity for an administrative hearing before any domestic marketing assessments or other sanctions
are imposed. Under the proposed rule payment of the assessment would be required to be made within 30 days after the
manufacturer is notified of the amount due. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where a domestic content violation has occurred, the compensatory purchases of tobacco by a manufacturer, as required
by section 320C(d) and (e), must be in equal quantities of burley and flue-cured tobacco and must be from the inventories
of producer owned cooperative marketing associations that handle price support loans for tobacco. However, the
statute provides that if the total required compensatory purchases by all noncomplying manufacturers would reduce
the associations inventories of loan stocks of burley or flue-cured tobacco below the reserve stock level for the
respective kind of tobacco, the required purchase of such kind of tobacco, for each manufacturer, may be reduced proportionately.
These provisions of section 320C would be implemented by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;723.504 of the proposed rule. The required purchases of burley tobacco could be made from either of the two producer
owned marketing associations for burley tobacco: the Burley Tobacco Growers Cooperative Association and the Burley
Stabilization Corporation. There is only one applicable producer association for flue-cured tobacco, the Flue-Cured
Tobacco Cooperative Stabilization Corporation. Under the proposed rule, required purchases of tobacco must be
at the applicable list price published by the association without discounts of any kind. The manufacturer would be
allowed to make such purchases from any grade or grades of uncommitted tobacco in the association's inventories.
Compensatory purchases of tobacco would be required to be made within 30 days after the manufacturer is notified of
the quantities of burley and flue-cured tobacco that must be purchased. However, the time could be extended if the
manufacturer requests reconsideration of the compensatory purchase determination. As provided in sections 320C
(d) and (e) of the statute, if a manufacturer fails to make the required compensatory purchases in a timely manner,
the manufacturer, under the proposed rule, would be subject to a penalty of 75 percent of the average market price for
the applicable kind of tobacco for the most recent marketing year multiplied by the quantity of tobacco involved.
Further, as provided in sections 320C(d)(5) and (e)(5), these compensatory purchases could not be counted by the
manufacturer for purchases in the application of section 320B of the 1938 Act.

4. Reduction of Domestic Content Required Percentage (&sect;723.505) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 320C(f) provides that the Secretary may reduce the 75 percent domestic content requirement for a calendar
year following a crop loss if the Secretary, in consultation with the producer owned tobacco associations, determines
that: (1) Because of drought, insect or disease infestation, or other natural disaster or other conditions beyond
the control of producers, the total quantity of a crop of domestic burley or flue-cured tobacco which is harvested
and suitable for marketing is substantially less than the expected production for the crop and (2) loan stock inventories
for the kind of tobacco have been depleted. Under the proposed rule, the expected production would be calculated based
on the planted acreage of the kind of tobacco, as reported by the NASS, multiplied by the average of the 5 most recent
years' average yields per acre as published by the NASS for that kind of tobacco. The loan stock inventory of a kind of
tobacco would be considered to be depleted if the Secretary, in consultation with the associations, concluded that
the loan stock inventories at the beginning of the next marketing year for such kind of tobacco would not likely exceed
25 percent of the reserve stock level. Under the proposed rule, the Secretary would make the determination to announce
any reduced percentage for the domestic content requirement by November 30 of the year preceding the year of the reduction.
Under the proposed rule, the Secretary's authority for making the determinations on reducing the domestic content
percentage would be delegated to the Director, Tobacco and Peanuts Division.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 320C(b) of the 1938 Act requires that manufacturers maintain records and make such reports as are necessary
to show compliance with the domestic tobacco content requirement. That section also provides that the Secretary
and the USDA Office of Inspector General may examine such records and other matters as the Secretary has reason to believe
may be relevant and that the Secretary may charge a fee to the manufacturer for the reasonable cost of any such examination.
Section 320C(b) provides, as well, that any person who fails to provide requested information or provides false information
shall be subject to 18 U.S.C. 1001 which, generally, provides that persons who knowingly and willfully supply false
or misleading information, or cover up information, on matters within the jurisdiction of federal agencies, may
be fined up to $10,000 or imprisoned up to five years. Section 320C(b) also provides that information submitted regarding
cigarette content and levels of production will be exempt from disclosure to other members of the public under the
Freedom of Information Act provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552. These provisions of section 320C are implemented in &sect;723.506
through &sect;723.508 of the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed rule, with respect to records and reports, manufacturers would be required, at a minimum, to file
reports and maintain records concerning the kind, quantity, form (stemmed, unstemmed, reconstituted, etc.), and
country of origin of all tobacco which is: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In inventory at the beginning of the calendar year, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Acquired during the calendar year, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Used to manufacture cigarettes in the United States during the calendar year, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Disposed of other than through the manufacture of cigarettes in the United States during the calendar year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Separate records would be required for each lot, batch, or blend that is used to manufacture cigarettes. These records
would be required to indicate the quantity of tobacco by category, domestic or import, and the total quantity of tobacco
for each specific lot, batch, or run of tobacco. Regarding confidentiality, while the provisions of the statute controls
disclosure of information regarding individual manufacturers, summary statistical data and general statements
that are not related to a specific cigarette manufacturer could be released.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A domestic marketing assessment rate, for purposes of this section, shall be determined for each calendar year. The
assessment rate shall be equal to the difference between one-half the sum of the average prices per pound received
by domestic producers of burley tobacco and flue-cured tobacco, respectively, for the previous marketing year as
determined by the Director. The Director may use for that purpose data published by the National Agricultural Statistic
Service of USDA and the weighted average price of unmanufactured tobacco which was imported during the previous calendar
year, as calculated from Bureau of Census data for such calendar year. Other data may be used in lieu of that data.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Director shall assess a domestic marketing assessment against each domestic manufacturer of cigarettes who
fails to comply with the domestic content requirement of this subpart. The domestic marketing assessment shall be
determined by: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Multiplying the required percentage of domestic content by the total pounds of tobacco used to produce cigarettes
during the applicable calendar year; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Subtracting the pounds of domestic tobacco used in such cigarettes from the result determined in paragraph (c)(1)
of this section, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Multiplying the result determined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if a positive number, by the assessment
rate determined under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Time for paying assessment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The manufacturer shall pay the domestic marketing assessment provided for in this section within 30 calendar days
after demand for payment. However, if the manufacturer timely requests reconsideration or timely appeals the determination,
the time for payment of the amount in dispute may be extended by the Director to a date no later than 30 calendar days after
the final determination is rendered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 If a domestic manufacturer of cigarettes fails in a timely manner to pay any assessment under this section, such manufacturer
shall be subject to a penalty in an amount equal to twice the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of the initial assessment. The penalty shall be payable in addition to the initial assessment and any other
charges that apply.

General.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition to paying a domestic marketing assessment, each domestic manufacturer of cigarettes who fails to comply
with &sect;723.502, as determined by the Director, shall purchase a quantity of burley and flue-cured tobacco from
the loan stocks of the producer owned cooperative marketing associations as provided in this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purchase quantity.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The amount of tobacco that must be purchased shall be an amount equal to the amount of imported tobacco on which the assessment
in &sect;723.503 can be levied. The total amount of required purchases shall be divided equally between burley and
flue-cured tobacco. If it is determined that the required amount of purchases by all manufacturers would reduce the
inventories of burley or flue-cured tobacco below the reserve stock level, the Director may reduce the required purchase
quantity on a pro rata basis. Required purchases under this section shall not be considered as purchases for purposes
of meeting the manufacturer's purchase intentions under section 320B of the 1938 Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purchase price.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In order to receive credit for a purchase to satisfy a purchase required by this section, the purchase price must not
be less than published offer list price of the applicable producer cooperative marketing association. Credit for
required purchases shall not be allowed if discounts, rebates, or other special incentives have been offered and
received in connection with purchases of tobacco loan stocks from association inventories.

Failure to purchase required amount.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Each manufacturer shall have 30 calendar days from date of notification of the required purchase amount to complete
the purchases required under this section. The producer cooperative marketing association shall report to the Director
the quantities of required purchases that have been made. A manufacturer who fails to purchase within the allotted
time the required quantity of burley or flue-cured tobacco shall be liable for penalty on each pound of tobacco for
which there has been a failure to make a timely purchase. The penalty rate shall be the amount determined to be equal
to 75 percent of the average market price for the kind of tobacco required to be purchased for the year preceding the
year of the violation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Director, in consultation with the producer owned cooperative marketing associations, may reduce the domestic
content level to a percentage below 75 percent for any calendar year, when the Director determines that the production
of burley or flue-cured tobacco for the preceding year was substantially reduced because of natural disaster or other
conditions beyond the control of producers for the immediately preceding crop year and that the loan stock inventory
for the kind of tobacco involved will be depleted to 25 percent of the reserve stock level for that kind of tobacco.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For purposes of this section, the Director may determine, but shall not be required to determine, the expected production
of tobacco based on the planted acreage as reported by the National Agricultural Statistics Service for the respective
kind of tobacco multiplied by the simple average of the five most recent years' average yields per acre for the respective
kind of tobacco.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Secretary Espy announced in late May 1993 that he was requesting the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) to present
him with a plan for making the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) system of process control mandatory
in all the Nation's federally inspected meat and poultry establishments. At the Secretary's direction to ensure
greater input from all constituent and other interests, it was determined by FSIS that it would be beneficial to provide
all constituent groups with a forum to comment on development of a mandatory HACCP system. Therefore, FSIS announces
that a HACCP Round Table discussion will be held.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS views this Round Table as an opportunity to allow free and frank discussion of the legitimate concerns of all constituents
prior to the issuance of a proposed regulation on HACCP. This meeting is envisioned as a substantive opportunity to
assist FSIS through a thorough discussion of the issues regarding HACCP. This will aid FSIS when it begins drafting
the rule for implementing a HACCP system of production in all meat and poultry establishments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Round Table will be facilitated by a neutral third party. The facilitator will seek the full participation of all
Round Table participants, will ensure that all identified issues are addressed by the Round Table participants,
and will invite comments at the end of the Round Table. After the Round Table meeting, the facilitator will provide
a transcript of the meeting, and will prepare a final report, which will include any comments submitted at the Round
Table meeting and will summarize the positions of all Round Table participants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Round Table meeting will be open to the public. Issue papers will be prepared in advance of the meeting by the participants,
and will be publicly available through the FSIS hearing clerk. All issues relative to a HACCP system shall be open for
consideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS has preliminarily identified the following categories of constituents:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Meat and Poultry Industry and Their Representatives (Including Grocers and Retailers)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. After the 2-week notification period, FSIS will: (1) Compile a list, for each category, of those who expressed an
interest in participating in the Round Table meeting; and (2) share that list, by category, with the members of each
category. FSIS will then request, within 2 weeks after sending the list to members of each category, that the members
of each category select representatives to serve as both Round Table and Steering Committee participants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure the effectiveness of this process, the estimated number of Round Table participants will be between 25 and
30, and the total number of attendees will be determined by the capacity of the meeting room. FSIS will request each
constituent category to appoint one representative to serve on the Steering Committee. FSIS will request that five
representatives be appointed for the Round Table by each of the following constituent categories: Meat and Poultry
Industry and Their Representatives; Consumers and Their Representatives; and Scientists and Professional Scientific
Organizations. FSIS will request that four representatives be appointed for the Round Table from the Producers and
Farmers category. FSIS will request that three representatives be appointed for the Round Table from the FSIS Employees
and Their Representatives; and Federal, State, and Local Governments categories. FSIS will request that two representatives
be appointed for the Round Table from the Public Health Officials and Medical Doctors category.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If any constituent category is unable to designate its representatives, USDA will assist in the selection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, any person who believes that an affected interest is not represented by the identified categories of
constituent groups may request, within 2 weeks of the date of publication of this notice in the

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Rolls-Royce, plc
Spey series turbofan engines. This proposal would require a one-time inspection of stage 1 and stage 2 high pressure
turbine (HPT) and low pressure turbine (LPT) steel disks for cracks and corrosion pitting. This proposal is prompted
by a report of a stage 7 high pressure compressor steel disk found cracked due to corrosion. The actions specified by
the proposed AD are intended to prevent an HPT or LPT steel turbine disk burst due to cracking attributed to corrosion,
which may result in an uncontained engine failure.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified
the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that an unsafe condition may exist on Rolls-Royce, plc (R&hyph;R) Spey
series turbofan engines. The CAA advises that they have received a report of a three-inch crack extending radially
outward from the bore of a steel stage 7 high pressure compressor disk installed in an R&hyph;R Spey 506&hyph;14D engine.
The crack had originated from a corrosion pit that apparently had been present at the disk's entry into service. Subsequent
investigation revealed that engine failure due to disk burst was imminent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CAA has determined that steel stage 1 and stage 2 high pressure turbine (HPT) and low pressure turbine (LPT) disks
could also contain corrosion pitting that could have been present since original manufacture. Rolls-Royce, plc
has informed the FAA that all turbine disks installed in Spey engine models type certificated in the United States
are made of steel. This condition, if not corrected, could result in an HPT or LPT steel turbine disk burst due to cracking
attributed to corrosion, which may result in an uncontained engine failure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Testing and further analysis indicate that to ensure that steel stage 1 and stage 2 HPT and LPT disks do not operate under
prolonged exposure to levels of corrosion greater than the overhaul manual limits, at least one inspection is required
after 40% of the disk cyclic life is expended in order for the disk to continue in service and to reliably attain full
disk cyclic life. Rolls-Royce, plc has issued Service Bulletin No. Sp72&hyph;1044, dated September 1992, that specifies
a one-time inspection of steel stage 1 and stage 2 HPT and LPT disks for cracks and corrosion pitting. The CAA classified
this service bulletin as mandatory in order to assure the airworthiness of these R&hyph;R Spey series turbofan engines
in the United Kingdom. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This engine model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other R&hyph;R Spey series turbofan
engines of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require a one-time inspection
of steel stage 1 and stage 2 HPT and LPT disks for cracks and corrosion pitting once the disks have completed at least
40% of their published Group ``A'' cyclic life limits as specified in the applicable overhaul manual. These disks
must be inspected in accordance with the applicable overhaul manual during the engine's next shop visit for either
HPT or LPT overhaul after the effective date of this AD. Accomplishment of this inspection will allow stage 1 and stage
2 HPT and LPT disks to complete the remainder of their current published cyclic life limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 173 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD and
that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. The FAA estimates that it would take no additional work hours per engine
to accomplish the proposed actions to the HPT's as the inspection is performed during scheduled overhauls. Approximately
80% of the engines will require an additional 25 work hours of extra access, inspection, and rebuild time to perform
the required LPT inspection. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated
to be $189,750. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ``

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Rolls-Royce, plc
(R&hyph;R) Spey series turbofan engines. This document proposes to supersede Telegraphic AD T89&hyph;02&hyph;52,
which superseded Telegraphic AD T88&hyph;22&hyph;51. Telegraphic AD T88&hyph;22&hyph;51 reduced cyclic life
limits for seventh stage high pressure compressor (HPC) disk from 40,000 total part cycles in service (TPC) to 35,000
TPC for the R&hyph;R Spey Model 506&hyph;14 and &hyph;14D engines. Telegraphic AD T89&hyph;02&hyph;52 currently
requires repetitive inspections or further reduced cyclic life limits for seventh stage HPC disks. This proposal
would increase the AD's effectivity to include additional R&hyph;R Spey engine models, eliminate the option for
repetitive inspections, and further reduce the cyclic life limits. This proposal is prompted by further investigation
into disk bore cracking that was caused by corrosion. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent
a seventh stage HPC disk burst due to cracking attributed to corrosion, which may result in an uncontained engine failure.

Discussion: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority of the United Kingdom, notified the Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) that an unsafe condition may exist on Rolls-Royce, plc (R&hyph;R) Spey series turbofan
engines. The CAA advises that they have received a report of a three-inch crack extending radially outward from the
bore on a seventh stage high pressure compressor (HPC) disk installed in a R&hyph;R Spey Model 506&hyph;14D engine.
The crack originated from a corrosion pit that apparently had been present at the disk's entry into service. Investigation
indicated that failure of the engine due to disk burst was imminent. That condition, if not corrected, could result
in a seventh stage HPC disk burst due to cracking attributed to corrosion, which may result in an uncontained engine
failure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This engine model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined
that airworthiness directive (AD) action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for
operation in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 20, 1988, the FAA issued Telegraphic AD T88&hyph;22&hyph;51, which reduced cyclic life limits for seventh
stage HPC disks from 40,000 total part cycles in service (TPC) to 35,000 TPC for the R&hyph;R Spey Model 506&hyph;14
and &hyph;14D engines. On January 26, 1989, the FAA issued Telegraphic AD T89&hyph;02&hyph;52, which supersedes
Telegraphic AD T88&hyph;22&hyph;51, and currently requires repetitive inspections or further reduced cyclic
life limits for seventh stage HPC disks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of these two previous AD's, further investigation of the cracked disk revealed that the crack originated
from a corrosion pit that could have been present at the disk's entry into service. A testing program investigated
the effects of corrosion on seventh stage HPC disks, and as a result of this investigation, disk cyclic life has been
reevaluated, assuming the possible presence of corrosion at entry into service. To account for the possible presence
of corrosion, this proposed AD would further reduce the cyclic life limit, and would require removing from service
seventh stage HPC disks that exceed the revised cyclic life limits following the schedule established in this AD.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This revised limit reduces the cyclic life limit below the point that intermediate, repetitive inspections are practical;
therefore, this AD does not provide for repetitive inspections. In addition, this AD would increase the effectivity
to include additional R&hyph;R Spey engine models not affected by the previous Telegraphic AD's. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rolls-Royce issued Mandatory Service Bulletin No. Sp72&hyph;1034, Revision 1, dated May 4, 1990, that describes
the revised cyclic life limits for seventh stage HPC disks, and the additional R&hyph;R Spey engine models affected.
The CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory in order to assure the airworthiness of these R&hyph;R Spey
series turbofan engines in the United Kingdom. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other R&hyph;R Spey series turbofan
engines of this same type design installed on aircraft registered in the United States, the proposed AD would supersede
Telegraphic AD T89&hyph;02&hyph;52 to increase the AD's effectivity to include additional R&hyph;R Spey engine
models, eliminate the option for repetitive inspections of seventh stage HPC disks, further reduce the cyclic life
limits, and require removing from service disks that exceed the revised cyclic life limits following the schedule
established in this AD. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described
previously.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA estimates that 173 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, and
that it would not take any additional work hours per engine to accomplish the proposed actions. Replacement parts,
prorated for the reduced life, would cost approximately $1,718 per engine. Based on these figures, the total cost
impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $297,214. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

Discussion

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has received a report of an uncontained stage one fan blade failure, attributed
to excessive fan blade tip clearance. Engines without a fan stator case stiffening ring assembly, and a new stage one
fan shroud, operate with relatively open stage one fan blade tip clearances. Increased fan rotor vibration occurs
when the average tip clearance exceeds the maximum allowable clearance tolerances. This increased vibration increases
stresses in the fan blade shank, which leads to cracking and subsequent blade failure. This condition, if not corrected,
could result in an uncontained stage one fan blade failure, which can result in an inflight engine shutdown, and damage
to the aircraft. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of GE CF6&hyph;50 Service Bulletin (SB) No. 72&hyph;573,
Revision 5, dated September 15, 1981, that describes procedures for the installation of the stiffening ring assembly
and new stage one fan shroud. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist, or develop, on other engines of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require installation of a fan stator case stiffening ring assembly and a new stage one
fan shroud, which will result in reduced running clearances, and lower fan blade stresses. The compliance end date
of August 31, 1995, ensures timely compliance without forced engine removals based on hardware availability. The
actions would be required to be accomplished, in accordance with the service bulletin described previously.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are approximately 67 GE CF6&hyph;45/&hyph;50 series turbofan engines of the affected design in the worldwide
fleet. The FAA has been advised by the manufacturer that there are no engines on U.S. registered aircraft that would
be affected by this AD. However, should an affected engine be imported on an aircraft and placed on the U.S. registry
in the future, it would take approximately 48 work hours to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor
rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $9,360 per engine. Based on these figures, the total
cost impact of the proposed AD is estimated to be $12,000 per engine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12886; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to General Electric
Company (GE) CF6&hyph;45/&hyph;50 series turbofan engines. This proposal would require repetitive inspections
of the left compressor discharge pressure (CDP) manifold and lower CDP tube for cracks, and if found cracked, rework
or replacement with serviceable parts. This proposal would also require rework or replacement of the left CDP manifold,
lower CDP tube, stage 14 turnbuckle, and other related CDP bleed air hardware, and inspection of the compressor rear
frame (CRF) as a terminating action to the inspection program. This proposal is prompted by reports of cracks in the
left CDP manifold, lower CDP tube, and CRF bleed port struts, that have resulted in inflight engine shutdowns and rejected
takeoffs. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent cracks in the left CDP manifold, lower CDP
tube, and CRF bleed port struts, which could result in an inflight engine shutdown, rejected takeoff, or damage to
the engine nacelle.

Discussion

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed airworthiness directive (AD) is applicable to General Electric Company (GE) CF6&hyph;45/&hyph;50
series turbofan engines. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has received 228 reports of cracks in the left
compressor discharge pressure (CDP) manifold, lower CDP tube, and compressor rear frame (CRF) bleed port struts.
Of these 228 reports, 24 have resulted in inflight engine shutdowns, and 24 in rejected takeoffs. The current type
design hardware has been found to crack, allowing hot air to leak into the core cowl area, resulting in false fire warnings.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cracks in the current type design hardware are the result of high cycle fatigue (HCF). The excessive stress is the
result of both thermal and airframe installation loading factors. New hardware exists which decreases operating
stresses, therefore reducing the chance of cracks due to HCF. This condition, if not corrected, may result in cracks
in the left CDP manifold, lower CDP tube, and CRF bleed port struts, which could result in an inflight engine shutdown,
rejected takeoff, or damage to the engine nacelle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of GE CF6&hyph;50 Service Bulletin (SB) No. 75&hyph;065,
Revision 1, dated March 26, 1993, that describes procedures for rework or replacement of the left CDP manifold, lower
CDP tube, and other related CDP bleed air hardware, and inspection of the CRF bleed port struts; GE CF6&hyph;50 SB No.
75&hyph;067, dated March 15, 1993, that describes procedures for rework or replacement of the stage 14 turnbuckle;
and GE CF6&hyph;50 SB No. 75&hyph;064, Revision 2, dated July 23, 1992, that describes procedures for repetitive
inspections of the left CDP manifold and lower CDP tube for cracks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require repetitive inspections of the left CDP manifold and lower CDP tube for cracks,
and if found cracked, rework or replacement with serviceable parts. This proposal would also require rework or replacement
of the left CDP manifold, lower CDP tube, stage 14 turnbuckle, and other related CDP bleed air hardware, and inspection
of the CRF as a terminating action to the inspection program. The compliance end-date of October 31, 1996, is proposed
to ensure timely compliance. Based upon engine shop visit rates, a compliance end-date of October 31, 1996, will ensure
timely compliance while minimizing the number of forced engine removals. The actions would be required to be accomplished
in accordance with the service bulletins described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 2202 GE CF6&hyph;45/&hyph;50 series engines of the affected design in the worldwide fleet.
The FAA estimates that 223 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that
it would take approximately 2 work hours per engine to accomplish the proposed inspections, 32 work hours per engine
to accomplish the proposed terminating action, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts
would cost approximately $27,500 per engine. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S.
operators is estimated to be $6,549,510. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Commission or CFTC) is requesting public comment on the text of a draft
two page generic risk disclosure statement currently being discussed among various international futures regulators
that potentially could be used to meet the risk disclosure requirements for both domestic and foreign commodity futures
and commodity option products subject to regulation by the CFTC. As contemplated by Commission rule 1.55(c), the
text of the generic risk disclosure statement is being published, in part, to further these discussions relative
to the development of one document to satisfy the risk disclosure requirements of the CFTC and such foreign jurisdictions
as may choose to adopt its language for use in their jurisdictions. Based on the comments received, the CFTC may be better
able to provide input to these discussions and to consider rule amendments to permit the substitution of this statement
under rule 1.55(c) and certain other rules for firms doing cross-border business.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 30, 1993, the Commission, among other things, adopted final rule amendments to Commission rule 1.55(b) which
simplified the risk disclosure process by consolidating the risk disclosure statements applicable to domestic
futures transactions and foreign futures and foreign commodity options transactions in rules 1.55 and 30.6, respectively.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The use of such a statement was intended to greatly simplify the risk disclosure process for U.S. firms conducting
cross-border business.

58 FR 17496 (April 5, 1993). These amendments also: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_eliminated the requirement that the rule 190.10 disclosure regarding treatment of non-cash margin be acknowledged
by the customer; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_clarified that the rule 1.55 risk disclosure statement may be included in a booklet of account opening documents,
provided it appears on the cover page or following the cover page of such booklet; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_provided that the Commission may approve a risk disclosure statement that has been approved by a foreign jurisdiction
or foreign SRO for use in lieu of the Commission-required statement; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_permitted the use of a single acknowledgement for rule 1.55 and 33.7 statements and other elections, subject to specified
conditions; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_simplified the disclosure requirements regarding the bulk transfer of accounts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to Commission suggestions in the notice of proposed rulemaking concerning rule 1.55 that it also was considering
the development of a ``plain language'' options disclosure statement,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 some commenters supported that course of action and further suggested that the Commission not only shorten the rule
33.7 disclosure statement applicable to exchange-traded commodity option transactions but also consolidate it
with the new combined domestic futures and foreign futures and foreign commodity options statement. In response,
the Commission noted that certain international regulators were endeavoring to develop a single risk disclosure
statement that could be used in multiple jurisdictions to satisfy the risk disclosure requirements applicable to
domestic and cross-border transactions in futures and options. The Commission stated that if a universal statement
were to be developed, it would consider permitting the use of such a statement in lieu of the new consolidated rule 1.55
risk disclosure statement as well as the options risk disclosure statement required by current rule 33.7.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 Under amended rule 1.55(c), the Commission may permit the substituted use of a risk disclosure statement approved
by a foreign regulatory or self-regulatory organization if the Commission determines that such statement reasonably
is calculated to provide the disclosure required by Commission rule 1.55(b).

For some time, a working group
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 of international regulators worked towards developing a single risk disclosure statement which could satisfy the
risk disclosure requirements applicable, in the multiple participating jurisdictions, to domestic and cross-border
transactions in futures and options (``generic disclosure statement'').
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Following extensive discussions, the draft generic disclosure statement set forth herein was developed and the
draft text was passed to those regulatory authorities (including the CFTC) who were interested in taking the work
forward. The text remains subject to final discussion and approval by the regulatory authorities of the participating
jurisdictions.

The working group was composed of representatives from Canada (Ontario Securities Commission), France (the French
Conseil du Marche a Terme), Switzerland (the Swiss Ministry of Finance), the United Kingdom (the U.K. Securities
and Investments Board, which chaired the working group), and the United States (the CFTC).

It is intended that the generic disclosure statement would specify, in an addendum on a third page, the participating
jurisdictions and the specific products for which it could be used. The addendum would be updated periodically as
new jurisdictions adopted the text. In the United States, it is contemplated that such risk disclosure statement,
if ultimately proposed and adopted after further public comment, would satisfy only those risk disclosure obligations
set forth in Commission rules 1.55 (which incorporates the risk-disclosure contained in Commission rule 30.6),
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 the special disclosures related to futures-style margining of options permitted on certain foreign exchanges,
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 and the special bankruptcy disclosures of Commission rule 190.10(c) related to the acceptance of non-cash margin.

The Commission notes in this regard that pending resolution of the Commission's determination on this draft generic
risk disclosure statement, firms operating pursuant to Commission rule 30.10 relief should continue to comply with
the risk disclosure requirements set forth in the relevant Commission orders and that for these purposes may continue
to use the text of rule 30.6 as published prior to the 1993 revisions to Commission rules 1.55 and 30.6 (which incorporated
the rule 30.6 disclosures for foreign futures into the rule 1.55 disclosures for domestic futures) (see 58 FR 17496
(April 5, 1993)).

Approach Taken By Working Group 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The approach taken by the international working group with respect to risk disclosure has been to develop a draft generic
statement which focuses on the major risks of trading and contains the basic generic disclosures required by most
jurisdictions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the approach of the working group was to eliminate much of the definitional and educational material which currently
is required to be disclosed by Commission rule 33.7 and to treat options disclosure in a manner equivalent to disclosure
for futures. As such, the statement is intended to focus customer attention on the risks of trading, as currently is
the practice with futures risk disclosure. Further, the statement would highlight the importance of obtaining sufficient
information as to the specifics of trading without attempting to address the differences from market to market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The elimination of a Commission mandated description of options trading and other educational material from the
mandated risk disclosure statement does not mean, however, that firms do not have the obligation to provide all material
disclosures in compliance with Commission and National Futures Association (NFA) rules.

Additional Topics 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As the working group's objective was not only to create a risk disclosure statement that categorized existing disclosure
requirements in most jurisdictions but also to incorporate new matters deemed relevant in an evolving marketplace,
the generic statement also contains the following additional topics. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Supporting Systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current draft generic disclosure statement would briefly disclose the fact that most open-outcry and electronic
trading facilities are supported by computer-based component systems, which are vulnerable to temporary disruption
or failure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Electronic Trading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Differences in electronic trading systems are such that a common disclosure appropriate to the specifics of each
such system may not be feasible and, in the case of domestic contract market electronic systems, the draft generic
disclosure statement would not substitute for disclosure requirements that currently are required by individual
contract markets for such systems. However, as the purpose of the draft generic disclosure statement is to articulate
general risks common to futures and options trading, it is possible in the case of electronic systems to identify the
risks common to any such system, such as the possibility of system failure and that the liability of the system provider
may be limited. No attempt has been made to describe in detail the specifics of any one system. On the contrary, the proposed
disclosure text encourages the customer to ask the firm with which it is dealing for details in this respect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Off-Exchange Trading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The draft generic disclosure statement also contains a reference to the risks of off-exchange trading. The international
working group drafting the consolidated disclosure statement concluded that such a provision, if worded appropriately,
would not mislead or confuse customers in those jurisdictions which, for example, do not permit retail customers
to participate in off-exchange markets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Request For Comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is inviting public comment and suggestions generally on the draft text of the generic risk disclosure
statement so that any material public concerns can be considered by the Commission. The Commission also requests
public comment on whether the use of a generic disclosure statement to substitute for current disclosures contained
in rules 1.55, 33.7, 190.10 and Commission orders and Advisories regarding disclosures related to futures-style
margining of option premiums allowed by certain foreign exchanges would be most useful if made mandatory for certain
categories of registrants, and if so, which categories should be included, and whether use should be limited to firms
doing cross-border business or more broadly available.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Risk Disclosure Statement for Futures and Options 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This brief statement does not disclose all of the risks and other significant aspects of trading in futures and options.
In light of the risks, you should undertake such transactions only if you understand the nature of the contracts (and
contractual relationships) into which you are entering and the extent of your exposure to risk. Trading in futures
and options is not suitable for many members of the public. You should carefully consider whether trading is appropriate
for you in light of your experience, objectives, financial resources and other relevant circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Futures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Effect of ``Leverage'' or ``Gearing'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Transactions in futures carry a high degree of risk. The amount of initial margin is small relative to the value of the
futures contract so that transactions are ``leveraged'' or ``geared.'' A relatively small market movement will
have a proportionately larger impact on the funds you have deposited or will have to deposit: this may work against
you as well as for you. You may sustain a total loss of initial margin funds and any additional funds deposited with the
firm to maintain your position. If the market moves against your position or margin levels are increased, you may be
called upon to pay substantial additional funds on short notice to maintain your position. If you fail to comply with
a request for additional funds within the time prescribed, your position may be liquidated at a loss and you will be
liable for any resulting deficit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Risk-reducing Orders or Strategies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The placing of certain orders (e.g. ``stop-loss'' orders, where permitted under local law, or ``stop-limit'' orders)
which are intended to limit losses to certain amounts may not be effective because market conditions may make it impossible
to execute such orders. Strategies using combinations of positions, such as ``spread'' and ``straddle'' positions
may be as risky as taking simple ``long'' or ``short'' positions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Options 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Variable Degree of Risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Transactions in options carry a high degree of risk. Purchasers and sellers of options should familiarize themselves
with the type of option (i.e. put or call) which they contemplate trading and the associated risks. You should calculate
the extent to which the value of the options must increase for your position to become profitable, taking into account
the premium and all transaction costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purchaser of options may offset or exercise the options or allow the options to expire. The exercise of an option
results either in a cash settlement or in the purchaser acquiring or delivering the underlying interest. If the option
is on a future, the purchaser will acquire a futures position with associated liabilities for margin (see the section
on Futures above). If the purchased options expire worthless, you will suffer a total loss of your investment which
will consist of the option premium plus transaction costs. If you are contemplating purchasing deep-out-of-the-money
options, you should be aware that the chance of such options becoming profitable ordinarily is remote. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Selling (``writing'' or ``granting'') an option generally entails considerably greater risk than purchasing options.
Although the premium received by the seller is fixed, the seller may sustain a loss well in excess of that amount. The
seller will be liable for additional margin to maintain the position if the market moves unfavorably. The seller will
also be exposed to the risk of the purchaser exercising the option and the seller will be obligated to either settle
the option in cash or to acquire or deliver the underlying interest. If the option is on a future, the seller will acquire
a position in a future with associated liabilities for margin (see the section on Futures above). If the option is ``covered''
by the seller holding a corresponding position in the underlying interest or a future or another option, the risk may
be reduced. If the option is not covered, the risk of loss can be unlimited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certain exchanges in some jurisdictions permit deferred payment of the option premium, exposing the purchaser to
liability for margin payments not exceeding the amount of the premium. The purchaser is still subject to the risk of
losing the premium and transaction costs. When the option is exercised or expires, the purchaser is responsible for
any unpaid premium outstanding at that time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Additional Risks Common to Futures and Options 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Terms and Conditions of Contracts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
You should ask the firm with which you deal about the terms and conditions of the specific futures or options which you
are trading and associated obligations (e.g. the circumstances under which you may become obligated to make or take
delivery of the underlying interest of a futures contract and, in respect of options, expiration dates and restrictions
on the time for exercise). Under certain circumstances the specifications of outstanding contracts (including
the exercise price of an option) may be modified by the exchange or clearing house to reflect changes in the underlying
interest.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Suspension or Restriction of Trading and Pricing Relationships 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Market conditions (e.g. illiquidity) and/or the operation of the rules of certain markets (e.g. the suspension of
trading in any contract or contract month because of price limits or ``circuit breakers'') may increase the risk of
loss by making it difficult or impossible to effect transactions or liquidate/offset positions. If you have sold
options, this may increase the risk of loss. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, normal pricing relationships between the underlying interest and the future, and the underlying interest
and the option may not exist. This can occur when, for example, the futures contract underlying the option is subject
to price limits while the option is not. The absence of an underlying reference price may make it difficult to judge
``fair'' value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Deposited Cash and Property 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
You should familiarize yourself with the protections accorded money or other property you deposit for domestic and
foreign transactions, particularly in the event of a firm insolvency or bankruptcy. The extent to which you may recover
your money or property may be governed by specific legislation or local rules. In some jurisdictions, property which
had been specifically identifiable as your own will be pro-rated in the same manner as cash for purposes of distribution
in the event of a shortfall. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Commission and Other Charges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before you begin to trade, you should obtain a clear explanation of all commission, fees and other charges for which
you will be liable. These charges will affect your net profit (if any) or increase your loss. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Transactions in Other Jurisdictions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Transactions on markets in other jurisdictions, including markets formally linked to a domestic market, may expose
you to additional risk. Such markets may be subject to regulation which may offer different or diminished investor
protection. Before you trade you should enquire about any rules relevant to your particular transactions. Your local
regulatory authority will be unable to compel the enforcement of the rules of regulatory authorities or markets in
other jurisdictions where your transactions have been effected. You should ask the firm with which you deal for details
about the types of redress available in both your home jurisdiction and other relevant jurisdictions before you start
to trade. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
9. Currency Risks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The profit or loss in transactions in foreign currency-denominated contracts (whether they are traded in your own
or another jurisdiction) will be affected by fluctuations in currency rates where there is a need to convert from the
currency denomination of the contract to another currency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
10. Trading Facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most open-outcry and electronic trading facilities are supported by computer-based component systems for the order-routing,
execution, matching, registration or clearing of trades. As with all facilities and systems, they are vulnerable
to temporary disruption or failure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
11. Electronic Trading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Trading on an electronic trading system may differ not only from trading in an open-outcry market but also from trading
on other electronic trading systems. If you undertake transactions on an electronic trading system, you will be exposed
to risks associated with the system including the failure of hardware and software. The result of any system failure
may be that your order is either not executed according to your instructions or is not executed at all. Your ability
to recover certain losses which are particularly attributable to trading on a market using an electronic trading
system may be limited to less than the amount of your total loss. Limits on liability may be imposed by the system provider,
the market, the clearing house and/or member firms. Such limits may vary: You should ask the firm with which you deal
for details in this respect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
12. Off-exchange Transactions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In some jurisdictions, and only then in restricted circumstances, firms are permitted to effect off-exchange transactions.
The firm with which you deal may be acting as your counterparty to the transaction. It may be difficult or impossible
to liquidate an existing position, to assess the value, to determine a fair price or to assess the exposure to risk.
For these reasons, these transactions may involve increased risks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Off-exchange transactions may be less regulated or subject to a separate regulatory regime. Before you undertake
such transactions, you should familiarize yourself with applicable rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

I. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On November 5, 1993, the Commission authorized publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of a proposal to make major amendments to the Commission's Rules of Practice. Published on November 22, 1993 (58 FR
61732), this proposal stems from the work of the Commission's Task Force on Administrative Proceedings, chaired
by Commissioner Mary Schapiro. In addition to updating the Commission's existing rules and make them more consistent
with actual practices, the proposed revisions would establish procedures to implement the authority granted to
the Commission by the Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act. The Commission requested that
comments the received by January 6, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the publication of the Rules, the Commission has received from interested persons a number of requests for an
extension of the comment period. On December 27, 1993, an Ad Hoc Committee of the American Bar Association that is preparing
comments in response to the Commission's proposal sent a letter requesting that the comment period be extended from
January 6, 1994 to February 1, 1994. The stated reason for this request is the ABA requires more time because of the breadth
of the Commission's proposal and its accompanying commentary. Three other parties have contacted the Commission's
Office of the General Counsel to request an extension of the comment period.

II. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In light of the length and complexity of the release and the benefits to the Commission of receiving carefully considered
comments, the Commission believes a reasonable extension of the comment period is appropriate. Therefore, in order
to assist interested participants in their consideration and preparation of carefully reasoned comments, the Commission
is extending the comment period for all persons to February 4, 1994.

III. Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The comment period for responding to Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34&hyph;33163 is extended to February 4,
1994.

 The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is considering the establishment of a viticultural area

located in Siskiyou County, California, to be known as

``Seiad Valley.'' This proposal is the result of a petition

filed by Brian J. Helsaple of Seiad Valley Vineyards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF believes that the establishment of viticultural areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the subsequent use of viticultural area names as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appellations of origin in wine labeling and advertising 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allows wineries to designate the specific areas where the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grapes used to make the wine were grown and enables 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumers to better identify the wines they purchase.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 23, 1978, ATF published Treasury Decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF&hyph;53 (43 FR 37672, 54624) revising regulations in 27 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 4. These regulations allow the establishment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definite American viticultural areas. The regulations also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allow the name of an approved viticultural area to be used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as an appellation of origin in the labeling and advertising 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of wine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 2, 1979, ATF published Treasury Decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF&hyph;60 (44 FR 56692) which added a new part 9 to 27 CFR, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing for the listing of approved American viticultural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas. Section 4.25a(e)(1), title 27, CFR, defines an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
American viticultural area as a delimited grape-growing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
region distinguishable by geographical features, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boundaries of which have been delineated in Subpart C of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 9. Section 4.25a(e)(2) outlines the procedure for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing an American viticultural area. Any interested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person may petition ATF to establish a grape-growing region 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a viticultural area. The petition should include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Evidence that the name of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
viticultural area is locally and/or nationally known as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referring to the area specified in the petition; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Historical or current evidence that the boundaries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the viticultural area are as specified in the petition; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Evidence relating to the geographical features 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(climate, soil, elevation, physical features, etc.) which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distinguish the viticultural features of the proposed area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from surrounding areas; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) A description of the specific boundaries of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
viticultural area, based on features which can be found on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States Geological Survey (U.S.G.S.) maps of the

ATF has received a petition from Brian J. Helsaple of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seiad Valley Vineyards proposing to establish a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
viticultural area in Siskiyou County, California, to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
known as ``Seiad Valley.'' The proposed viticultural area is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
located in northwestern California, about 15 miles south of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Oregon border. It contains approximately 2160 acres, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of which approximately 2.5 acres are planted to vineyards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seiad Valley Vineyards is the only commercial grower and

the only wine producer currently active within the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
viticultural area.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The U.S.G.S. map used to show the boundaries of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed area (the Seiad Valley Quadrangle 7.5 minute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
series map) uses the name ``Seiad Valley'' to describe the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area immediately surrounding Seiad Creek, corresponding to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the portion of the proposed area which is north of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Klamath River. The map also shows the town of Seiad Valley 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within this area. The map shows no separate designation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the portion of the proposed area south of the Klamath 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
River, which is drained by Grider Creek. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The petitioner provided excerpts from the 1957 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue of Siskiyou Pioneer, an annual publication of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Siskiyou County Historical Society, which discuss the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
history of the name Seiad Valley, and local understanding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the extent of the area known as Seiad, or Seiad Valley. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Sciad,'' by Betty Livingston and Hazel Davis, states the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
name Seiad was originally spelled Sciad, and the creek and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
valley were called that by the trappers ``before the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prospectors came in 1850.'' Sometime after 1871, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spelling of the name changed to Seiad. In ``Gold Mining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from Scott Bar to Happy Camp,'' by J.B. Grider, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following description appears: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Seiad is a small valley two miles long and one mile wide *&blank;*&blank;* There are two large creeks in Seiad, Grider
Creek and Seiad Creek. Grider Creek flows north into the Klamath from the Marble Mountain territory. Seiad creek flows
south into the Klamath from the Siskiyous and Red Mountain.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) The petitioner also provided a copy of a claim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document dated August 26, 1942, which states the Grider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Creek mining claim is ``situate in the Seiad Mining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
District.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Evidence of Boundaries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petitioner has defined the proposed area primarily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by its elevation, using the 1600 and 1800 foot contour 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lines. As evidence that the proposed boundaries for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area are as specified in the petition, the petitioner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
states that the vegetation within and outside the area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides a dramatic contrast. Within the proposed area, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cottonwood, oak and willow trees and wild blackberries and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grapes grow in addition to the cultivated crops. Outside 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed area, on the higher slopes of the surrounding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mountains, conifers such as cedar, Douglas fir and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ponderossa pine predominate in the thin, eroded soils with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scant summer moisture. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Geographical Features 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed viticultural area consists of the valleys 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drained by Seiad Creek and Grider Creek, which both flow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into the Klamath River in northwestern California. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the petitioner, these valleys and an expanse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of land along the Klamath River which connects them share 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristics of topography, soil composition and climate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which distinguish the proposed viticultural area from the

surrounding areas. The petitioner provided the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence to support his claims:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S.G.S. topographic map submitted by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petitioner shows the proposed area is a relatively flat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area varying in elevation from 1,400 to 1,600 feet, with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small portion as high as 1,800 feet, surrounded by steeply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rising terrain. Outside the area, the elevation ranges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from 2,000 to 2,800 feet, with peaks exceeding 3,000 feet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on all sides, and some peaks as high as 3,900 feet. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petitioner explains that snow melt, runoff, and erosion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from these higher areas into the valley create a contrast 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in both the quality of soils and the availability of water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within and outside the proposed area. The lower elevation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the proposed area also contributes to more moderate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperatures there. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Soil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petitioner states that the valley floor ``is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
composed of deep fertile soil mixtures of loam, sand, clay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and rocks eroded from the surrounding mountain slopes.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to a draft environmental impact report prepared 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in 1975 by the California Department of Transportation, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
valley floor is ``mostly alluvium deposits which were widely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dredged and hydraulically mined for gold. Chromite was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also mined within the Seiad Valley area.'' Dredging left 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``tailings,'' or piles of rounded rocks, wherever the dredge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operated. The petitioner states that these granite-dominated rock tailings store heat during the day and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide protection against frost in spring and fall. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Climate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petitioner provided the following material related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the climate in the area: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) An article in the Pioneer Press of September 16, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1992, titled ``Rock-pile grapevines surprising all experts,'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contrasted Siskiyou County growing conditions with those in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seiad Valley vineyard: ``What's stopped the area from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
becoming a wine-producing area are the erratic late spring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
freezes in the zone where elevations are low enough to even 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make it possible. And in some of the county's lowest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elevation areas, the precipitation levels are too high.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The article stated the rock tailings in his vineyard ``may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
give Helsaple just the edge he needs to be the county's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first successful longterm wine grape grower.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Sunset New Western Garden Book, 1979 edition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
climate map of northern California and western Nevada 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
showed Seiad Valley as Zone 7, and characterizes a Zone 7 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
climate as having hot summers and mild but pronounced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
winters, favorable for deciduous fruit that requires a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marked seasonal pattern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Boundary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The boundary of the proposed Seiad Valley viticultural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area may be found on one United States Geological Survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(U.S.G.S.) map with a scale of 1:24000. The boundary is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in &sect;9.148.

Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this proposed regulation is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order 12866. Accordingly, this proposal is not subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the analysis required by this Executive Order.

It is hereby certified that this regulation will not

have a significant economic impact on a substantial number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of small entities. Any benefit derived from the use of a

viticultural area name is the result of the proprietor's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
own efforts and consumer acceptance of wines from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular area. No new requirements are proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ATF requests comments from all interested parties. We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are particularly interested in comments concerning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application of the name ``Seiad Valley'' to the area south of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Klamath River, which is drained by Grider Creek. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments received on or before the closing date will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carefully considered. Comments received after that date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be given the same consideration if it is practical to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
do so, but assurance of consideration cannot be given 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
except as to comments received on or before the closing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF will not recognize any comment as confidential. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments may be disclosed to the public. Any material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which a commenter considers to be confidential or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inappropriate for disclosure to the public should not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be included in the comment. The name of the person 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitting a comment is not exempt from disclosure. During 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the comment period, any person may request an opportunity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to present oral testimony at a public hearing. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Director reserves the right to determine, in light of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all circumstances, whether a public hearing will be held.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.G.S. 7.5 minute series topographical map of the 1:24000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Boundary
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Seiad Valley viticultural area is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
located in Siskiyou County, California. The boundary is as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The beginning point is the intersection of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1600 foot contour line with the power transmission line 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
north of the Klamath River, near Mile 130; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) From the beginning point, the boundary follows the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1600' contour line in a generally northeasterly direction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
until it reaches the intersection of an unnamed light duty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
road and an unimproved road just west of Canyon Creek; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The boundary then follows the unimproved road 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
north to its end, then goes east in a straight line until 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it reaches the 1800' contour line; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The boundary then follows the 1800' contour line 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a northeasterly direction to the point, near Sawmill 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gulch, where the contour line crosses Seiad Creek and turns 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
south and west; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The boundary continues to follow the 1800' contour 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
line as it proceeds southwest for approximately 4.5 miles, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
then turns sharply south-southeast for approximately 0.3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
miles, until the contour line turns sharply east at a point 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
just north of the Klamath River; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The boundary then diverges from the 1800' contour 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
line and proceeds south-southeast in a straight line, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
across the Klamath River and State route 96, until it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intersects with the 1600' contour line; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The boundary then follows the 1600' contour line 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
south and west, then north and west, roughly following the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
course of the Klamath River, until it reaches an unnamed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
peak 1744 feet high; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) The boundary continues along the 1600' contour 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
line as it diverges from the Klamath River and proceeds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
south, just to the east of an unnamed light duty road, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the point where that road crosses Grider Creek; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) The boundary diverges from the contour line and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proceeds west in a straight line across the road and Grider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Creek until it intersects with the 1600' contour line on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the west side of Grider Creek; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) The boundary then follows the 1600' contour line 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
north, west and north again until it reaches a point where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the contour line turns west, just south of the Klamath 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
River; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(11) The boundary diverges from the 1600' contour line 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and proceeds in a straight line in a northeasterly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
direction, back to the point of beginning.

On December 10, 1993, the Postal Service published proposed rule changes to implement recently enacted statutory
restrictions on the use of special bulk third-class mail. 58 FR 64918. See also 58 FR 65959 (December 17, 1993) which
extended the period for comment on this proposal. A number of customers have requested an opportunity to present their
views and concerns in person regarding the proposed rule change. The Postal Service generally does not hold, nor does
it generally find a need for, public meetings concerning proposed rules. Nevertheless, in this limited instance,
the Postal Service has determined to grant the request for a public meeting. Interested parties may, of course, submit
written comments in accordance with the instructions in the

A. Background for This Action Regarding Section 211(m) of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Motor vehicles are significant contributors of carbon monoxide emissions. An important measure toward reducing
these emissions is the use of cleaner-burning oxygenated gasoline. Extra oxygen enhances fuel combustion and helps
to offset fuel-rich operating conditions, particularly during vehicle starts, which are more prevalent in the winter.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 211(m) of the Act requires that various states submit revisions to their SIPs, and implement oxygenated gasoline
programs no later than November 1, 1992. This requirement applies to all states with carbon monoxide nonattainment
areas with design values of 9.5 parts per million or more based generally on 1988 and 1989 data. Each state's oxygenated
gasoline program must require gasoline for the specified control area(s) to contain not less than 2.7 percent oxygen
by weight during that portion of the year in which the areas are prone to high ambient concentrations of carbon monoxide.
Under section 211(m)(2), the oxygenated gasoline requirements are to generally cover all gasoline sold or dispensed
in the larger of the Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA) or the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)
in which the nonattainment area is located. Under section 211(m)(2), the length of the control period, to be established
by the EPA Administrator, shall not be less than four months unless a state can demonstrate that, because of meteorological
conditions, a reduced control period will assure that there will be no carbon monoxide exceedances outside of such
reduced period. EPA announced guidance on the establishment of control periods by area in the

 Under a credit program, marketable oxygen credits may be generated from the sale of gasoline with a higher oxygen content
than is required (i.e., an oxygen content greater than 2.7 percent by weight). These oxygen credits may be used to offset
the sale of gasoline with a lower oxygen content than is required. Where a credit program has been adopted, EPA's guidelines
provide that no gallon of gasoline should contain less than 2.0% oxygen by weight.

1. Type of Program and Oxygen Content Requirement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above, section 211(m)(2) of the Act requires that gasoline sold or dispensed for use in the specified
control areas contain not less than 2.7 percent oxygen by weight. Under section 211(m)(5), the EPA Administrator
issued guidelines for credit programs allowing the use of marketable oxygen credits. The State of Colorado, by the
authority of the Air Quality Control Commission (AQCC), has elected to adopt a regulation requiring 2.7% oxygen content
for each gallon of gasoline sold in a control area, not allowing for the use of marketable oxygen credits. The following
sections of this notice address some specific elements of the State's submittal. Parties desiring more specific
information should consult the TSD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Applicability and Program Scope
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 211(m)(2) requires oxygenated gasoline to be sold during a control period based on air quality monitoring
data and established by the EPA Administrator. Colorado has established control periods consistent with the EPA
guidance. The control period for all of Colorado's affected areas begins on the first day of November each year and
ends following the last day of February. Colorado State oxygenated gasoline regulations require oxygenated gasoline
to be sold in the Fort Collins-Loveland MSA, the Colorado Springs MSA, and the Boulder-Denver MSA, consistent with
the requirements of section 211(m)(2) of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Transfer Documents
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Colorado has no requirements related to transfer documentation in its oxygenated gasoline regulation. EPA feels
that the State's policy of presumptive liability provides the incentive for all parties to ensure gasoline meets
the oxygen content requirements of the program. In lieu of transfer documentation indicating oxygen content, the
State provides for presumptive liability on the part of the party in possession of gasoline found to be in violation
of the required oxygen content, and allows for no defenses. The State has historically inspected refineries, bulk
fuel storage plants, fuel distribution plants, pipelines, and retail station for fuel compliance, holding all parties
responsible to meet oxygen content requirements for gasoline in their possession. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Enforcement and Penalty Schedules
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
State oxygenated gasoline regulations must be enforceable by the state oversight agency. EPA recommends that states
visit at least 20% of regulated parties during a given control period. Inspections should consist of product sampling
and record review. In addition, each state should devise a comprehensive penalty schedule. Penalties should reflect
the severity of a party's violation, the compliance history of the party, as well as the potential environmental harm
associated with the violation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Colorado oxygenated gasoline regulation is legally enforceable by the Colorado Department of Health, Division
of Air Pollution Control (APCD). The APCD is committed to the enforcement of this program requiring a level of sampling
greater than EPA's recommendation for the sampling of 20% of all oxygenated gasoline dispensing sites. Violation
of this regulation results in a civil penalty not to exceed $25,000 per day of violation. The APCD considers three factors
when assessing penalties: the penalty constraint; the economic benefit of noncompliance; and a gravity component
taking into consideration the intentional nature of the violation, whether the violator cooperated with the APCD,
whether a repeat violation has occurred, the actual oxygen content of the sample, and an other relevant factors as
detailed in the Oxygenated Gasoline Program Policy and Procedure Manual (Procedure Manual), published by the Colorado
Department of Health, Air Pollution Control Division, October 1992. Penalty authority is contained in section 25&hyph;7&hyph;122
C.R.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Test Methods and Laboratory Review
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each state regulation must include a test method. EPA's guidelines recommend the use of the OFID test, although parties
may elect to use ASTM-D4815&hyph;89 or another method, approved by EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has tentatively approved a variation of the ASTM-D4815&hyph;89 testing method for use in Colorado, as detailed
in the Procedure Manual. The State may continue to use this testing method unless otherwise instructed by EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has established an interim testing tolerance, which states appropriate ranges for credit and per-gallon programs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
7
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As EPA states in the memorandum, for a per-gallon program, such as adopted by Colorado, the purpose of the testing is
to determine whether the gasoline contains less than 2.7 percent oxygen by weight. Colorado is using testing tolerances
consistent with the tolerances in the EPA memo.

B. Background for This Action Regarding Regulation No. 13 Prior to the Requirements of Section 211(m) of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 6, 1990, the Governor of Colorado submitted additional revisions to Regulation No. 13. The Regulation 13
amendments were necessary because the Colorado Air Pollution Control Division (APCD) found that progress toward
attaining the carbon monoxide (CO) standard was not adequate to meet the December 31, 1987, Clean Air Act deadline.
The August 6, 1990, revisions required between December 1 and March 1 of each winter season, a 2.6 percent level of oxygen
for all gasoline except premium unleaded.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA recognizes that this, August 6, 1990, revision to Regulations No. 13 does not meet EPA's current guidance for oxygenated
gasoline programs. However, Colorado's present SIP revision, November 27, 1993, for the oxygenated gasoline program
amends the State's existing program, which includes elements that were contained in the past SIP revision, August
6, 1990. EPA is also proposing to approve this past revision, in order for the SIP to be considered fully approved.

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table
2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The USEPA
has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the
waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866
which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over population of less than 50,000.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Act forbids EPA to base its
actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission by Notice of Proposed Rulemaking published November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62077) proposed amendments to
its Non-Vessel-Operating Common Carriers (NVOCC) coloading rules to clarify ambiguities and to address current
practices resulting in increased application of untariffed NVOCC charges. Sixty days was allowed for comment. Requests
for additional time to comment ranging from 30 to 90 days have been filed by various interests. Upon consideration
of the requests, the Commission has determined to grant a 30-day extension, thereby providing a total of 90 days for
comment, which is deemed adequate under the circumstances.
