SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes to adopt a new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airworthiness directive (AD) that would apply to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain Piper Aircraft Corporation (Piper) Models PA34&hyph;200, PA34&hyph;200T, PA34&hyph;220T, PA44&hyph;180,
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PA44&hyph;180T airplanes. The proposed action would require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repetitively inspecting the main landing gear trunnions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for cracks, replacing any trunnions found cracked, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eventually replacing the landing gear trunnions with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parts of improved design as terminating action for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repetitive inspection requirement. Several reports of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the main landing gear trunnions cracking on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected airplanes prompted the proposed action. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevent collapse of the main landing gear caused by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cracked trunnions, which could result in airplane 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
damage.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Service history of certain Piper Models PA34&hyph;200, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PA34&hyph;200T, PA34&hyph;220T, PA44&hyph;180, and PA44&hyph;180T airplanes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reveals several occurrences of cracked main landing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gear (MLG) trunnions. Five of these occurrences 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulted when the left MLG trunnion, part number (P/N) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
67926&hyph;12, separated from Piper Model PA34&hyph;200T 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplanes during the landing roll. Further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigation revealed that the left MLG collapsed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of a transverse fracture in the trunnion at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rear web lower end fillet. Metallurgical examination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of four of these MLG trunnions further disclosed that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fractures originated from very shallow fatigue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cracks originating from several areas along the rear surface 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the lower end of the fillet web. The length of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these fatigue cracks ranged from .20 to .40 inches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Piper has issued Service Bulletin (SB) 787B, dated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
August 25, 1993, which specifies procedures for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspecting the MLG trunnions on certain Piper Models 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PA34&hyph;200, PA34&hyph;200T, PA34&hyph;220T, PA44&hyph;180, and PA44&hyph;180T 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplanes, and references replacing MLG trunnions with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parts of improved design. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After examining the circumstances and reviewing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all available information related to the incidents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described above including the referenced service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information, the FAA has determined that AD action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be taken to prevent collapse of the main landing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gear caused by cracked trunnions, which could result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplane damage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is likely to exist or develop in other Piper Models 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PA34&hyph;200, PA34&hyph;200T, PA34&hyph;220T, PA44&hyph;180, and PA44&hyph;180T 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplanes of the same type design, the proposed AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would require repetitively inspecting the main landing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gear trunnions for cracks, replacing any trunnions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found cracked, and eventually replacing the landing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gear trunnions with parts of improved design as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminating action for the repetitive inspection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement. The proposed inspections would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplished in accordance with Piper SB No. 787B, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dated August 25, 1993. The proposed replacement would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be accomplished in accordance with the applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintenance manual.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA estimates that 2,265 airplanes in the U.S. registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it would take
approximately 16 workhours per airplane to accomplish the proposed initial inspection and replacement, and that
the average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Parts cost approximately $1,100 per airplane. Based on these
figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $4,484,700. This cost figure
is based on the assumption that none of the affected airplane owners/operators have accomplished the proposed actions.
The FAA believes that some airplane owners/operators have already incorporated the inspection terminating MLG
trunnion replacements. With this in mind, the FAA anticipates that the cost of the proposed AD would be much lower than
the figure referenced above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial
number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation
prepared for this action has been placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable, in accordance with the applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintenance manual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If parts for any MLG replacement have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ordered from the manufacturer but are not available, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to further flight and thereafter at intervals not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to exceed 100 hour TIS, dye-penetrant inspect the MLG 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trunnion for cracks in accordance with the INSTRUCTIONS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section of Piper Service Bulletin (SB) 787B, dated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
August 25, 1993. If any one of the following occurs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to further flight, terminate the above repetitive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (b) of this AD: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Parts become available; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A trunnion is found cracked; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) 2,500 hours TIS are accumulated on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trunnion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Replacing both the left and right MLG trunnion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with P/N 67926&hyph;30, 67926&hyph;31, 67926&hyph;32, 67926&hyph;33, 39486&hyph;14, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
39486&hyph;15, as applicable, eliminates the inspection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement of this AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Special flight permits may be issued in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with FAR 21.197 and 21.199 to operate the

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice proposes to establish Class D airspace located at Eglin Air Force Base, FL, and Eglin AF Aux No 3 Duke Field,
FL. The notice also proposes to amend Class D airspace located at Eglin Hurlburt Field, FL, and Class E airspace at Crestview,
FL. As part of the Terminal Airspace Reclassification, the Valparaiso, Florida Terminal Area was to be changed from
Part 93 Airspace to Class D Airspace. The change included the revocation of the Eglin AFB, Florida Class D airspace
and Eglin AF Aux No. 3 Duke Field, Florida Class D airspace; the modification of the Hurlburt Field, Florida Class D
airspace and Crestview, Florida Class E airspace. The Valparaiso, Florida Terminal Area will remain as Part 93 Airspace
and this notice proposes to return the affected Class D and Class E airspace areas as they were prior to Docket No. 26968,
Amendment No. 71&hyph;19 published in the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
D airspace at Eglin AFB, Florida; establish Class D airspace at Eglin AF Aux No 3 Duke Field; amend Class D airspace at
Eglin Hurlburt Field, Florida, and amend Class E airspace at Crestview, Florida. The intended effect of this proposal
is to reverse the action of Docket No. 26968, Amendment No. 71&hyph;19 (58 FR 12128, March 2, 1993) to provide adequate
airspace to contain Instrument Flight Rule operations at these four locations. The coordinates for this airspace
docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D and Class E airspace areas are respectively published in Para 5000
and Para 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference
in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class D and E airspace listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice proposes to modify the current Class D airspace at Hood Army Airfield (AAF) and Robert Gray AAF, and to establish
Class E airspace at Killeen Municipal Airport, Killeen, TX. The current Class D airspace encompasses Killeen Municipal
Airport and with airspace reclassification, aircraft operators at Killeen Municipal Airport are now required to
establish two-way radio communication with Hood AAF Air Traffic Airport Traffic Control Tower (ATCT) or when Hood
AAF ATCT is closed, Robert Gray AAF ATCT. This notice proposes to remove the airspace surrounding Killeen Municipal
Airport from Hood AAF's Class D airspace and to establish Class E airspace around Killeen Municipal Airport. The intended
effect of this proposal is to maintain adequate Class D airspace and two-way radio communications at Hood AAF and Robert
Gray AAF, to remove Killeen Municipal Airport, TX, from the current Class D airspace, and to establish Class E airspace
around Killeen Municipal Airport, Killeen, TX.

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify Class D
airspace at Hood AAF and Robert Gray AAF, TX, and to establish Class E airspace at Killeen Municipal Airport, Killeen,
TX. This modification has been requested by both the operators of Hood AAF and the operators of Killeen Municipal Airport.
The proposal would remove that portion of current Class D airspace which surrounds Killeen Municipal Airport and
would establish Class E airspace around Killeen Municipal Airport. The intended effect of this proposal is to maintain
adequate Class D airspace and two-way radio communications to contain instrument flight rule (IFR) operations at
Hood AAF and Robert Gray AAF, TX, to remove Killeen Municipal Airport from the Class D airspace, and to establish Class
E airspace at Killeen Municipal Airport, Killeen, Texas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D airspace designations are published
in Paragraph 5000 and Class E airspace areas designated as surface areas for airports are published in Paragraph 6002
of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14
CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D and Class E airspace designations listed in this document would be published
subsequently in the Order.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
that need frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice proposes to establish Class D airspace at Friedman Memorial Airport, Hailey, Idaho. Midwest ATC Service,
Inc., operates a control tower at Friedman Memorial Airport with an associated airport traffic area. Airspace Reclassification,
which became effective September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the term ``airport traffic area'' and eliminated
those ATA's not already designated to become Class D airspace. As a result, the requirement for two-way radio communication
with the control tower at Friedman Memorial Airport lapsed. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate
Class D airspace to contain instrument flight rules (IFR) operations and continue the two-way radio communication
requirement at Friedman Memorial Airport.

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
D airspace at Friedman Memorial Airport, Hailey, Idaho. Midwest ATC Service, Inc., operates a control tower at Friedman
Memorial Airport with an associated airport traffic area (ATA). Airspace reclassification, which became effective
September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the term ``airport traffic area'' and, for control zones with operating
control towers, replaced it with the designation ``Class D airspace.'' Only ATA's already designated to become Class
D airspace continued to exist; Friedman Memorial Airport was not so designated. As a result, the requirement for two-way
radio communication with the control tower at Friedman Memorial Airport lapsed. The intended effect of this proposal
is to provide adequate Class D airspace to contain IFR operations and continue the two-way communication requirement
at Friedman Memorial Airport. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class
D airspace is published in paragraph 5000 of FAA Order 7400.9A, dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993,
which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 as of September 16, 1993 (58 FR 36398; July 6, 1993). The Class D airspace
listed in the document would be published subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend the class
E airspace at Lakeview, Oregon, to accommodate a new instrument approach procedure at the Lake County, Airport. The
area would be depicted on aeronautical charts for pilot reference. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based
on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations for airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more
above the surface of the earth are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective
September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 as of September 16, 1993 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993).
The class E airspace designations listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

 This proposed rule would amend the Oak Harbor, Washington, Class E&hyph;2 airspace. This action is necessary to correct
an error in the airspace description inadvertently committed during the airspace reclassification process. This
action would reduce the size of the Oak Harbor, Washington, Class E&hyph;2 airspace. The area would be depicted on
aeronautical charts for pilot reference.

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend Class E&hyph;2
airspace at Oak Harbor, WA, to correct an error in the Class E&hyph;2 airspace description. During the airspace reclassification
process the Class E&hyph;2 airspace for Oak Harbor Airpark was miscalculated resulting in the designation of more
controlled airspace than necessary. This action would correct that error. The coordinates for this airspace docket
are based on North American Datum 83. Class E&hyph;2 airspace areas are published in Paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9A
dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298;
July 6, 1993). The Class E&hyph;2 airspace designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in
the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend Class E airspace
at Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, and Spokane, Washington, to accommodate a new instrument approach procedure and missed
approach holding pattern at Coeur d'Alene Air Terminal. The areas would be depicted on aeronautical charts for pilot
reference. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations
for airspace areas are published in Paragraphs 6004 and 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective
September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 as of September 16, 1993, (58 FR 36298; July 6,
1993). The Class E designations listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would notify Federal Airways V&hyph;93 and V&hyph;451 located in Maine. Modifying V&hyph;93
and V&hyph;451 is necessary because a section of both airways is defined by radials from the Navy Brunswick, ME, Very
High Frequency Omnidirectional Range/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) facility. Navy Brunswick VORTAC is scheduled
to be decommissioned on April 28, 1994, and the effective date of the final rule, if issued would coincide with that
date.

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify V&hyph;93
and V&hyph;451. A section of both airways is defined by radials from the Navy Brunswick, ME (NHZ) VORTAC which is scheduled
to be decommissioned on April 28, 1994. This action would ensure that the airways are usable after the navigational
aid has been decommissioned. This proposed action would be come effective concurrent with the decommissioning of
the Navy Brunswick VORTAC. Domestic VOR Federal airways are published in paragraph 6010(a) of FAA Order 7400.9A dated
June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July
6, 1993). The airways listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on October 15, 1993. The NPRM proposed to alter the descriptions of VOR Federal Airways V&hyph;7, V&hyph;51, V&hyph;97,
and V&hyph;399, respectively, by reducing the standard width of these airways. The FAA has determined that withdrawal
of the proposal at this time is warranted because a change in air traffic control (ATC) procedures would alleviate
the need to alter these airways.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 15, 1993, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 to amend 14 CFR part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to alter the descriptions of V&hyph;7, V&hyph;51, V&hyph;97,
and V&hyph;399, respectively, by reducing the standard width of these airways located in the states of Indiana and
Illinois (58 FR 53459). This action was proposed to redefine the lateral boundaries of the airways to provide for more
efficient utilization of the airspace. No comments were received on the proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has decided to withdraw the proposal at this time to provide an opportunity to reexamine the operations effecting
these airways in the Lafayette Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT) and Chicago Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC)
areas. This proposal was initiated to simplify air traffic operations and to provide for more efficient utilization
of that airspace. The FAA has determined that changing the ATC procedures and delegating to Chicago ARTCC the control
responsibility previously handled by Lafayette ATCT would alleviate the need to alter these airways.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in which the Commission proposed to amend 18 CFR Parts 141 and 385 to provide for the electronic filing of FERC Form No.
1, ``Annual Report of Major electric utilities, licensees and others'' (Form 1). Under the proposed rule, in addition
to paper copies, future Form 1 filings would also be made by means of a computer diskette incorporating software programming
developed by the Commission. Electronic reporting of Form 1 was proposed to commence with reporting year 1993, due
on or before April 30, 1994. No change was proposed in Form 1 itself.

Having considered these comments, the Commission is deferring issuance of a final rule at this time pending development
and testing of the necessary software. Once that process is complete the Commission intends to issue a final rule providing
for the electronic filing of Form 1. The Commission presently anticipates that that process will be complete in time
for the electronic filing of Form 1 for reporting year 1994, due on or before April 30, 1995. However, there will be no
electronic reporting of Form 1 for reporting year 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the meantime, the Commission believes it useful to comment on certain suggestions and recommendations made by
interested parties concerning features they believe should be incorporated in the software.

II. Summary of Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is presently developing a personal computer (PC) based software package for Form 1 reporting.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The software will be available on standard computer diskettes with instructions and documentation, and will be sent
to each Form 1 respondent without charge. This package will display the Form 1, schedule by schedule, on a respondent's
PC. The required data may then be manually key-entered on the respondent's PC. The program will also permit the respondent
to ``import'' the required data from its PC or mainframe computer directly into the software package, thus avoiding
the manual data-entry process. When the data entry process is completed, the respondent, using the software, will
produce a data diskette that will be submitted to the Commission, along with the required paper copies.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The data contained on the data diskette will be in a data base format for use by the Commission.

The Commission has already initiated the process of procuring the necessary software package for automating Form
1 reporting. The Commission intends to test all aspects of the system, including data input, data output, and print
capability. The Commission also intends to conduct a field test of the software package with volunteer Form 1 respondents.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the NOPR, the Commission stated that it expected the program to be complete and to have diskettes ready for distribution
to each Form 1 respondent in time to allow reporting for reporting year 1993 by the April 30, 1994 filing deadline; that
time frame is being delayed pending development and testing of the necessary software. Thus, there will be no electronic
reporting of Form 1 for reporting year 1993.

III. Discussion of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenters generally expressed support for the objectives set forth in the NOPR, although virtually all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested a delay in implementation until at least reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters also made numerous suggestions and recommendations concerning development and implementation
of the proposal. It was the Commission's intention in initiating this proposal that the software would be developed
by the Commission's staff and that modifications or revisions would be made as necessary based on the results of staff
and field tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, a number of commenters have offered specific suggestions as to features which they believe should
be incorporated in the software, and the Commission has reviewed these various suggestions and is prepared to state
its views on most of these suggestions. Additionally, the Commission's staff will continue to evaluate suggestions
as the software is developed and the field test is undertaken.

A. Effective Date of Electronic Reporting Requirement and Response to Comments on Software 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A majority of the commenters suggested that implementation be delayed from reporting year 1993; they variously suggest
delays until, for example, reporting year 1994, or voluntary filing in 1994 and mandatory filing in 1995, or until
one year after the software package has been fully tested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the comments received, the Commission agrees that the electronic reporting requirement should not be implemented
for the 1993 reporting year. Rather, we believe that the electronic reporting requirement should be delayed pending
development and testing of the required software.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated both in the NOPR and above, the Commission intends to conduct a field test of the Form 1 software with volunteer
respondents and, to the extent needed, modifications will be made. This field testing will be in addition to testing
by the Commission's staff. In order to allow sufficient time for development and testing, the Commission concludes
that the most prudent course at the present time is to defer implementation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, the NOPR only addressed the adoption of an electronic filing requirement and the effective date for
that requirement (and a delegation of authority). It did not address the specifics of the electronic filing, its development
and implementation. The Commission believes that the details of such development and implementation are best done
at the staff level in the first instance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although not specifically solicited in the NOPR, many of the commenters nevertheless made recommendations on features
they would like to see included in the software, or that they felt needed to be included in the software. We anticipate
that many of the recommendations will, in fact, be included in the initial version of the software. There are others
which appear to be worthwhile features which are not contemplated for the initial version software, although they
may be considered and included in future updates. We believe that other recommendations are without merit in that
they are at odds with the intent of the Form 1 as a whole (i.e., uniform reporting), or the purpose of electronic filing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is presently anticipated that the following features suggested by commenters will be incorporated in the initial
software program: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Edit checking within pages and across pages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Supplemental or continuation page feature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Use of data base structure in ASCII format. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Compatibility with different types of printers, including laser printers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Footnote references on schedules by line items and written columns, including headings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. View screen option. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Menu driven screens, including a help function. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Support function to provide assistance to users when implementing the new software. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. LAN compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certain additional features suggested by commenters are not considered feasible for incorporation in the initial
software, but may merit consideration in future software updates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These features include the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Submission by modem rather than diskette. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Electronic dissemination capability to others. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Incorporation of filings on a ``bulletin board'' accessible to the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Providing a diskette to update Form 1 schedules without reissue of the entire software package each year.

5. Providing a capability to carry over data from year to year in instances where there is no change in the data to be reported.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Providing a capability to extract portions of the program onto diskettes for distribution to various individual
departments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certain additional proposed features have been determined to be inconsistent with the basic Form 1 objective of uniform
reporting by the electric utility industry, and are therefore rejected. These features include the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Providing a capability to insert user defined rows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Allowing for center, left and right justification of data within columns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Elimination of General Instruction II (use of whole numbers, dollars or MWH). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Providing compatibility of the software with Lotus 1&hyph;2&hyph;3 spreadsheet or Windows.

American Electric Power System (AEP) and Utilicorp United, Inc. suggest that the Form 1 software should be made compatible
with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Electric Data Gathering Analysis and Retrieval (EDGAR) system, or
that a system should be adopted based on EDGAR. The Commission declines to adopt this suggestion. In developing requirements
for the electronic filing of Form 1, a number of approaches were considered initially, including the EDGAR system.
The approach chosen was based on the Commission's information needs, as well as the estimated costs of development
and implementation. It was concluded that the software program should be consistent with the current information
and data formats of Form 1. Consequently the EDGAR approach was not, and is not, adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Delmarva Power &amp; Light Company and Edison Electric Institute (EEI) suggest that the software program be based
on (or similar to) EEI's electronic Uniform Statistical Report (USR). The Commission declines to adopt this recommendation.
Form 1 reporting is more extensive than that for the USR. Because of the unique information requirements of Form 1,
compatibility with the USR program would be difficult to develop and maintain and would not be cost effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CG&amp;E suggests that, for combination gas and electric utilities, Form 1 reporting under the Federal Power Act
should be compatible with Form 2 reporting under the Natural Gas Act. At this time, there are no plans to attempt to make
Form 1 and Form 2 reporting electronically compatible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Florida Power &amp; Light Company (FP&amp;L), Florida Power Corporation, and EEI argue that, because of the emergence
of competition in the industry, sensitive competitive data should no longer be required or publicly disclosed, citing
as an example electric generating plant operating statistics. This issue is beyond the scope of this proceeding and
the Commission will therefore not address it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FP&amp;L argues that, before continuing with the electronic filing project, the Commission should review the actual
data required to be reported on Form 1, and should eliminate obsolete or unnecessary information. The subject matter
of this proceeding is the electronic filing of Form 1. It was not intended as, and is not, a forum for evaluation of the
need for the data presently required to be reported. Accordingly, as the issue is beyond the scope of this proceeding,
the Commission will not address it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Utilicorp United, Inc. argues that the existing systems used by the many Form 1 respondents are incompatible and that
no product or program exists to convert them to a usable computer format. The Commission agrees that no comprehensive
program exists to convert the various systems in use to the Commission's electronic software. The Commission anticipates,
however, that the Form 1 software program will allow the respondents to develop and use such a conversion program.

IV. Conclusion

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, in light of the foregoing, the Commission hereby gives notice of its intent to defer issuance of a final
rule prescribing the electronic filing of Form 1 at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission expects that it will issue a final rule in 1994 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide for the electronic filing of Form 1 for reporting year 1994, due on or before April 30, 1995.

order for taxpayers to compute the combined taxable income under profit split when the possession product chosen
for purposes of section 936(h)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code is a component product or an end-product form. These
regulations are necessary to provide guidance to taxpayers electing the profit split method of computing taxable
income under section 936(h)(5).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This document contains proposed amendments to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1) under section 936 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986. These amendments to the regulations are proposed to provide simplified rules for computing
combined taxable income under the profit split method for a taxpayer that has chosen a component product or an end-product
form as its possession product.

Explanation of Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The proposed regulations would amend &sect;1.936&hyph;6(b)(1), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Q &amp; A. 12, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
with conforming changes made to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Q &amp; A. 10, A. 11, and A. 13. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed revision, where the possession product is a component product or an end-product form, the combined
taxable income attributable to the possession product will be determined by multiplying the combined taxable income
of the possession corporation and affiliated groups derived from covered sales of integrated products (which includes
the possession product) by a production cost ratio. In the case of a component product, the combined taxable income
of the integrated product would be multiplied by a ratio, the numerator of which equals the production costs of the
component product and the denominator of which equals the production costs of the integrated product. The combined
taxable income of an end-product form is determined in a similar manner using the production costs of the end-product
form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change is intended to simplify the computation of combined taxable income under 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Q &amp; A. 12 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and to eliminate the need to apply section 482 in cases in which a possession product is a component product or an end-product
form. No inference is intended as to the interpretation or scope of current regulations by the revisions proposed
herein.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in
Executive Order 12866. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C.
chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations and, therefore,
a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, a copy
of this notice of proposed rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration
for comment on its impact on small business.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (leasing units of the possession product or use of such units in the taxpayer's own trade or business), how should it

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A. 10:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the case of an integrated product, combined taxable income shall be computed as if the U.S. affiliate had sold the
units to an unrelated person (or to a foreign affiliate) at the time the units were first leased or otherwise placed
in service by the U.S. affiliate. The sales price shall be equal to the sales price from comparable uncontrolled transactions
determined in accordance with &sect;1.482&hyph;2(e)(2). If a sales price from comparable uncontrolled transactions
cannot be determined in accordance with &sect;1.482&hyph;2(e)(2), then the taxpayer shall not be treated as having
possession sales with respect to such leasing transaction. If the possession product is a component product or an
end-product form, and there is a comparable uncontrolled price for the integrated product which includes the possession
product, the combined taxable income with respect to the possession product shall be determined under

 of this paragraph (b)(1). For purposes of determining the basis of a component product or an end-product form, the
deemed sales price of such product must be determined. The deemed sales price of the component product shall be determined
by multiplying the deemed sales price of the integrated product by a ratio, the numerator of which is the production
costs of the component product and the denominator of which is the production costs of the integrated product. The
deemed sales price of an end-product form shall be determined by multiplying the deemed sales price of the integrated
product by a ratio, the numerator of which is the production costs of the end-product form and the denominator of which
is the production costs of the integrated product. The definition of production costs with respect to the component
product or end-product form shall be determined under the rules of

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Q. 12:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the possession product is a component product or an end-product form, how is the combined taxable income for such
product to be determined? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. 12: (i) Combined taxable income for a component product or an end-product form is computed under the production
cost ratio (PCR) method. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Under the PCR method, the combined taxable income for a component product will be the same proportion of the combined
taxable income for the integrated product which the production costs attributable to the component product bear
to the total production costs for the integrated product. Production costs will be the sum of the direct and indirect
production costs as defined for inventory accounting purposes under &sect;1.471&hyph;11 (b), (c) or (d), except
that the costs will not include the costs of materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Under the PCR method the combined taxable income for an end-product form will be the same proportion of the combined
taxable income for the integrated product which the production costs attributable to the end-product form bear to
the total production costs for the integrated product. Production costs will be the sum of the direct and indirect
production costs as defined for inventory accounting purposes under &sect;1.471&hyph;11 (b), (c) or (d), except
that the costs will not include the costs of materials.

Example. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The following example illustrates a possessions corporation, S, engaged in the manufacture of microprocessors.
S obtains a component from a U.S. affiliate, O. S sells its production to another U.S. affiliate, P, which incorporates
the microprocessors into central processing units (CPUs). P transfers the CPUs to a U.S. affiliate, Q, which incorporates
the CPUs into computers for sale to unrelated persons. S chooses to define the possession product as the CPUs. The combined
taxable income for the sale of the possession product on the basis of the given production, sales, and cost data is computed
below:

 (i) The income shall be allocated to U.S. affiliates as follows_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) First, to U.S. affiliates (other than tax-exempt affiliates) within the group (as determined under section 482)
which derive income with respect to the product produced in whole or in part in the possession; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Second, to U.S. affiliates (other than tax-exempt affiliates) which derive income from the active conduct of
a trade or business in the same product area as the possession product; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Third, to other U.S. affiliates (other than tax-exempt affiliates); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Fourth, to foreign affiliates which derive income from the active conduct of a U.S. trade or business in the same
product area as the possession product (or, if the foreign members are resident in a country with which the U.S. has
an income tax convention, then to those foreign members that have a permanent establishment in the United States which
derives income in the same product area as the possession product); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Fifth, to all other affiliates.

 shall be made on the basis of the relative gross income derived by each such affiliate with respect to the product produced
in whole or in part in the possession. Where the product is a component product, the relative gross income with respect
to the component product shall be determined by multiplying the relative gross income of the integrated product by
a ratio, the numerator of which is the production costs of the component product and the denominator of which is the
production costs of the integrated product. Where the product is an end-product form, the relative gross income of
an end-product form shall be determined by multiplying the gross income of the integrated product by a ratio, the numerator
of which is the production costs of the end-product form and the denominator of which is the production costs of the

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Implementation of the provisions the CAA will require regulation of many small businesses so that areas may attain
and maintain the National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and reduce the emission of air toxics. Small businesses
frequently lack the technical expertise and financial resources necessary to evaluate such regulations and to determine
the appropriate mechanisms for compliance. In anticipation of the impact of these requirements on small businesses,
the CAA requires that states adopt a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance
Program, and submit this Program as a revision to the federally approved SIP. In addition, the CAA directs EPA to oversee
these small business assistance programs and report to Congress on their implementation. The requirements for establishing
a Program are set out in section 507 of title V of the CAA. In February 1992, EPA issued 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Guidelines for the Implementation of Section 507 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, in order to delineate the Federal and state roles in meeting the new statutory provisions and as a tool to provide further
guidance to the states on submitting acceptable SIP revisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 11, 1993, the State of Delaware submitted a formal revision to its SIP. The SIP revision consists of a plan
for establishing an SBTCP. In order to gain full approval, the state submittal must provide for each of the following
program elements: (1) The establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) to provide technical and compliance
assistance to small businesses; (2) the establishment of a State Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests
of small businesses in the regulatory process; and (3) the creation of a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) to determine
and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP. The plan must also determine the eligibility of small business
stationary sources for assistance in the program. The plan includes the duties, funding, and schedule of implementation
for the three program components.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DE DNREC) is authorized to create and administer
the SBTCP. Delaware DNREC can create and administer the SBAP, and create the Office of the Ombudsman. Through an executive
order, the Governor of the State of Delaware will establish the Compliance Advisory Panel.

II. Summary and Analysis of SIP Revision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 507(a) of the CAA sets forth seven requirements that Delaware must meet to have an approvable SBAP. Three requirements
will be discussed in the first section, and the remaining four requirements, including the establishment of an Ombudsman,
in the second section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Small Business Assistance Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The first requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for developing, collecting and coordinating information
concerning compliance methods and technologies for small business stationary sources, and programs to encourage
lawful cooperation among such sources and other persons to further compliance with the CAA. Delaware has met this
requirement by establishing a SBAP, with the responsibility of serving as a clearinghouse for information related
to compliance methods and control technologies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Small businesses will be referred to state technical experts specifically trained to handle questions relevant
to achieving compliance with the CAA. The SBAP will be coordinated through the Air Quality Management Section and
will respond to inquiries from small businesses received through the ombudsman's toll-free hotline. Information
workshops, industry-specific compliance publications, and roundtable groups are examples of planned outreach
activities. A list of potentially affected parties will be developed in conjunction with the State of Delaware Department
of Labor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for assisting small business stationary sources with
pollution prevention and accidental release detection and prevention, including providing information concerning
alternative technologies, process changes, products and methods of operation that help reduce air pollution. Delaware
DNREC established a Pollution Prevention Program in 1990 which provides education, technical assistance, and financial
incentives to improve environmental quality. Small businesses have access to Delaware's Waste Minimization/Pollution
Prevention Information Clearinghouse. In addition to distributing pollution prevention guides, DE DNREC has established
a Pollution Prevention Industry Roundtable to facilitate technology transfer between large and small businesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To address accidental release detection and prevention, the Air Quality Management Section has been administering
Delaware's ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Regulation for the Management of Extremely Hazardous Substances
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' through the Industrial Disaster Prevention Group (IDPG). Facility visits and compliance discussions are a part
of this program, as is the distribution of generic procedures to assist with compliance with the regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third requirement is to develop a compliance and technical assistance program for small business stationary
sources which assists small businesses in determining applicable requirements and in receiving permits under the
CAA in a timely and efficient manner. Delaware has met this requirement through the Engineering and Compliance Branch
(ECB) of the Air Quality Management Section. The ECB will identify applicable rules, determine whether a permit is
needed, identify compliance alternatives, and explain the fees, application process, violations, and appeals,
as needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Ombudsman Office 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The fourth requirement of section 507(a)(3) is the designation of a state office to serve as the Ombudsman for small
business stationary sources. Delaware's Secretary of DE DNREC is authorized to create the ombudsman's office within
DNREC. The ombudsman will be appointed by the Secretary of DE DNREC and will report directly to him or her. The Delaware
Office of the Ombudsman (Delaware Ombudsman) will be independent of the Division of Air and Waste Management and the
Air Quality Management Section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fifth requirement is to develop adequate mechanisms to assure that small business stationary sources receive
notice of their rights under the Act in such manner and form as to assure reasonably adequate time for such sources to
evaluate compliance methods and any relevant or applicable proposed or final regulation or standards issued under
the CAA. The Delaware Ombudsman will ensure that small businesses receive notice of their rights in sufficient time
to evaluate compliance. Information delineating legal rights will be disseminated with the technical and compliance
information by the SBAP. In addition, field inspectors will be trained to properly inform small businesses of their
rights during site visits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The sixth requirement of CAA section 507(a) is to develop adequate mechanisms for informing small business stationary
sources of their obligations under the CAA, including mechanisms for referring such sources to qualified auditors
or, at the option of the state, for providing audits of the operations of such sources to determine compliance with
the CAA. The Delaware Ombudsman will develop procedures for referring sources to qualified auditors. A list of qualified
environmental consulting firms who could conduct audits will be provided by the Delaware Ombudsman to small businesses.
The Delaware Ombudsman, ECB, IDPG and Pollution Prevention Program may elect to provide qualified auditors, if available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The seventh requirement of CAA section 507(a) is to develop procedures for consideration of requests from a small
business stationary source for modification of: (A) Any work practice or technological method of compliance, or
(B) the schedule of milestones for implementing such work practices or compliance methods. Delaware's Office of
the Ombudsman will receive written requests from a small businesses for modification of work practices.

3. Compliance Advisory Panel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 507(e) of the CAA requires Delaware to establish a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) that must include two members
selected by the Governor who are not owners or representatives of owners of small businesses; four members selected
by the state legislature who are owners, or represent owners, of small businesses; and one member selected by the head
of the agency in charge of the Air Pollution Permit Program. Members of the Delaware CAP will be selected in the following
manner for the first term, after which all will serve four year terms: (1) The majority leader of the Senate shall appoint
one member for 4 years; (2) the minority leader of the Senate shall appoint one member for 2 years; (3) the majority leader
of the House of Representatives will appoint one member for three years; (4) the minority leader of the House of Representatives
shall appoint one member for one year; (5) the Governor will select two members for four years; and (6) the Air Quality
Management Program Administrator will select one member for four years. The makeup of Delaware's CAP is prescribed
as is required by section 507(e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Delaware CAP will meet at least once per quarter. Any member absent from three consecutive meetings will be replaced.
Administrative and logistical support for the Delaware CAP will be funded through the Delaware Ombudsman's office.
The Delaware Ombudsman will also serve a Secretariat for the development and dissemination of CAP reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to establishing the minimum membership of the CAP the CAA delineates four responsibilities of the Panel:
(A) to render advisory opinions concerning the effectiveness of the SBAP, difficulties encountered and the degree
and severity of enforcement actions; (B) to review and assure that information for small business stationary sources
is easily understandable; (C) to develop and disseminate the reports and advisory opinions made through the SBAP;
and (D) to periodically report to EPA concerning the SBAP's adherence to the principles of the Paperwork Reduction
Act, the Equal Access to Justice Act, and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. (Section 507(e)(1)(B) requires the CAP
to report on the compliance of the SBAP with these three statutes. However, since state agencies are not required to
comply with them, EPA believes that the state Program must merely require the CAP to report on whether the SBAP is adhering
to the general principles of these Federal statutes.) The duties and responsibilities described in Delaware's submittal
indicate that the Delaware CAP will be responsible for all four of the activities listed above, except that the Delaware
Ombudsman will disseminate reports.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 507(c)(1) of the CAA defines the term ``small business stationary source'' as a stationary source that:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) Is owned or operated by a person who employs 100 or fewer individuals; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Is a small business concern as defined in the Small Business Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Is not a major stationary source; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Does not emit 50 tons per year (tpy) or more of any regulated pollutant; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Emits less than 75 tpy of all regulated pollutants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Delaware's submittal duplicates the language of CAA section 507(c)(1) in defining eligible stationary sources.
It also provides for the state, after consultation with the Administrator and the Administrator of the Small Business
Administration and notice and opportunity for public comment, to include or exclude a category or subcategory of
sources.

III. Summary of SIP Revision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Delaware has submitted a SIP revision requiring implementation of each of the program elements required by CAA section
507. As previously stated, the authority to implement the SBAP has been delegated to the Department of Natural Resources
and Environmental Control, Air Quality Management Section. Program implementation will begin no later than January
1, 1994. The Secretary of DE DNREC will appoint the Ombudsman by July 1, 1993 and hire the staff dedicated to implementing
the program. An Executive Order establishing the Compliance Advisory Panel will be executed by the Governor of the
State of Delaware by March 1, 1993. In this action, EPA is approving the SIP revision submittal by the State of Delaware.
Accordingly, &sect;52.460 is added to 40 CFR part 52, subpart I&hyph;Delaware to reflect EPA's approval action and
the fact that it is considered part of the Delaware's SIP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing to approve the Delaware SIP revision for establishing a Small Business Stationary Source Technical
and Environemental Compliance Assistance Program, which was submitted on January 11, 1993. EPA is soliciting public
comments on the issues discussed in this notice or on other relevant matters. These comments will be considered before
taking final action. Interested parties may participate in the Federal rulemaking procedure by submitting written
comments to the EPA Regional office listed in the Addresses section of this document.

Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is proposing to approve Delaware's plan for the establishment of a Small Business Stationary Source Technical
and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this action, EPA is approving a state program created for the purpose of assisting small businesses in complying
with existing statutory and regulatory requirements. The program being approved does not impose any new regulatory
burden on small businesses; it is a program under which small businesses may elect to take advantage of assistance
provided by the state. Therefore, because the EPA's approval of this program does not impose any new regulatory requirements
on small businesses, I certify that it does not have a
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant economic impact on any small entities affected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action for signature by the Regional Administrator under the procedures
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistance Administrator for Air and Radiation. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived
Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years.
EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the waiver
until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request is still applicable under Executive Order 12866, which superseded
Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.

 The EPA proposes to conditionally approve the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts for the purpose of establishing a small business stationary source technical and environmental
compliance assistance program. The SIP revision was submitted by the State to satisfy the Federal mandate to ensure
that small businesses have access to the technical assistance and regulatory information necessary to comply with
the Clean Air Act (CAA). The rationale for the conditional approval is set forth in this proposal; additional information
is available at the address indicated below.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Implementation of the provisions of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, will require regulation of many small businesses
so that areas may attain and maintain the National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and reduce the emission of
air toxics. Small businesses frequently lack the technical expertise and financial resources necessary to evaluate
such regulations and to determine the appropriate mechanisms for compliance. In anticipation of the impact of these
requirements on small businesses, the CAA requires that States adopt a small business stationary source technical
and environmental compliance assistance program (PROGRAM), and submit this PROGRAM as a revision to the federally
approved SIP. In addition, the CAA directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to oversee these small business
assistance programs and report to Congress on their implementation. The requirements for establishing a PROGRAM
are set out in section 507 of title V of the CAA. In February 1992, EPA issued 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Guidelines for the Implementation of Section 507 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, in order to delineate the Federal and State roles in meeting the new statutory provisions and as a tool to provide further
guidance to the States on submitting acceptable SIP revisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has submitted a SIP revision to EPA in order to satisfy the requirements of section
507. In order to gain full approval, the State submittal must provide for each of the following PROGRAM elements: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The establishment of a small business assistance program (SBAP) to provide technical and compliance assistance
to small businesses; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The establishment of a State small business ombudsman to represent the interests of small businesses in the regulatory
process; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The creation of a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) to determine and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP.

1. Small Business Assistance Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Massachusetts' SIP revision delegates the responsibility for implementation of the SBAP to various functional
units within the Executive Office of Environmental Affairs (EOEA) and the Department of Environmental Protection
(DEP). SBAP staff will be located in the Office of Technical Assistance. Primary responsibility for program oversight,
development, and coordination will lie with the small business ombudsman and the SBAP staff.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 507(a) sets forth six requirements
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that the State must meet to have an approvable SBAP. The first requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for
developing, collecting and coordinating information concerning compliance methods and technologies for small
business stationary sources, and programs to encourage lawful cooperation among such sources and other persons
to further compliance with the Act. The State has met this requirement by offering a proactive and reactive approach
to gathering and disseminating information on compliance issues and control technologies. This approach includes:
an information clearinghouse, workshops, and an audit program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
A seventh requirement of section 507(a), establishment of an Ombudsman office, is discussed in the next section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for assisting small business stationary sources with
pollution prevention and accidental release detection and prevention, including providing information concerning
alternative technologies, process changes, products and methods of operation that help reduce air pollution. The
State has met this requirement by stating that the Massachusetts Office of Technical Assistance (OTA) will provide
help in identifying pollution prevention opportunities. These services are provided at no charge. Additionally,
the SBAP staff will provide small business stationary sources with information and referral to appropriate sources
regarding requirements related to accidental release detection and prevention.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third requirement is to develop a compliance and technical assistance program for small business stationary
sources which assists small businesses in determining applicable requirements and in receiving permits under the
Act in a timely and efficient manner. The State has met this requirement. As stated earlier, responsibility for the
implementation of the small business assistance program will involve various units within the EOEA and the DEP, with
primary responsibility for program oversight, development, and coordination lying with the small business ombudsman
and SBAP staff in EOEA, Office of Technical Assistance. The air quality staff at each DEP Regional Office will provide
assistance to small business stationary sources in the following: identifying applicable rules, determining their
need for permits, explanation of the permitting procedures, providing the necessary forms and applications, and
assisting them in preparing the required documents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fourth requirement is to develop adequate mechanisms to assure that small business stationary sources receive
notice of their rights under the Act in such manner and form as to assure reasonably adequate time for such sources to
evaluate compliance methods and any relevant or applicable proposed or final regulations or standards issued under
the Act. The State has met this requirement by providing that the DEP's Division of Air Quality Control (DAQC) will
be responsible for the development of policies and regulations for implementing the provisions of the CAA. The staff
in that office will provide assistance in identifying applicable rules. Additionally, that office will provide
the necessary information regarding rules and procedures for complying with Federal and state laws and regulations.
Furthermore, it will be the DAQC's responsibility to inform businesses of their rights through brochures and workshops.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fifth requirement is to develop adequate mechanisms for informing small business stationary sources of their
obligations under the Act, including mechanisms for referring such sources to qualified auditors or, at the option
of the State, for providing audits of the operations of such sources to determine compliance with the Act. The SIP revision
provides that the DAQC is responsible for the development of policies and regulations for implementing the provisions
of the CAA. The SBAP staff will also be responsible for providing audits. These include on-site assessments by the
OTA and through audit referrals. On-site assessments will be arranged in conjunction with technical staff from the
OTA. Audit referrals will be arranged by having the staff provide a list of qualified private sector auditors or consultants
to small business stationary sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The sixth requirement is to develop procedures for consideration of requests from a small business stationary source
for modification of: (A) Any work practice or technological method of compliance, or (B) the schedule of milestones
for implementing such work practice or method of compliance preceding any applicable compliance date, based on the
technological and financial capability of any such small business stationary source. The SIP revision provides
that specific regulations for modifications of work practices or technological methods of compliance will be submitted
in November 1993. These regulations will include: (1) Procedures for receiving requests from small businesses to
modify the provisions of State-adopted regulations; (2) format for such requests; (3) procedures for how requests
will be reviewed and acted upon; and (4) requirements to ensure that no such modification may be granted unless it is
in compliance with the applicable requirements of the CAA, the SIP and the applicable Federal regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 507(a)(3) requires the designation of a State office to serve as the ombudsman for small business stationary
sources. The State has met this requirement by designating the small business ombudsman within the EOEA. The EOEA
is a secretariat answering directly to the Governor. The designation of a small business ombudsman within the Commonwealth's
environmental secretariat but outside of the secretariat's regulatory agency will:

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Enhance impartiality in resolving disputes involving compliance and enforcement;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Reduce potential for conflicts of interest; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Improve utilization by the business community; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Allow for a high level of independence, authority, and communication; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Allow the small business ombudsman to build upon established contacts with the business community and other government
offices and agencies; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Strengthen the ombudsman's ability to provide program oversight and evaluation.

3. Compliance Advisory Panel
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 507(e) requires the State to establish a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) that must include two members selected
by the Governor who are not owners or representatives of owners of small businesses; four members selected by the State
legislature who are owners, or represent owners, of small businesses; and one member selected by the head of the agency
in charge of the Air Pollution Permit Program. The State has not fully met this requirement due to the lack of adequate
statutory authority to establish the CAP. However, EPA expects Massachusetts to submit a legislative resolve to
EPA when it is finally approved. The SIP revision provides that legislative approval and selection of CAP members
will be completed by January 30, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to establishing the minimum membership of the CAP the CAA delineates four responsibilities for it: (1)
To render advisory opinions concerning the effectiveness of the SBAP, difficulties encountered and the degree and
severity of enforcement actions; (2) to periodically report to EPA concerning the SBAP's adherence to the principles
of the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Equal Access to Justice Act, and the Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
; (3) to review and assure that information for small business stationary sources is easily understandable; and (4)
to develop and disseminate the reports and advisory opinions made through the SBAP. The State has met these requirements
in the SIP revision by authorizing the panel to: render advisory opinions on the effectiveness of the small business
assistance program; prepare periodic reports to EPA on the status of the SBAP with regard to the Paper Work Reduction
Act, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and the Equal Access to Justice Act; and review information for small business
stationary sources to assure such information is understandable by the layperson. Additionally, the SIP revisions
provide the small business ombudsman with the authority to oversee all aspects of the SBAP and allows for the ombudsman
to act as secretariat to the panel.

Section 507(e)(1)(B) requires the CAP to report on the compliance of the SBAP with these three Federal statutes. However,
since State agencies are not required to comply with them, EPA believes that the State PROGRAM must merely require
the CAP to report on whether the SBAP is adhering to the general principles of these Federal statutes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 507(c)(1) of the CAA defines the term ``small business stationary source'' as a stationary source that:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) Is owned or operated by a person who employs 100 or fewer individuals, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Is a small business concern as defined in the Small Business Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Is not a major stationary source; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Does not emit 50 tons per year (tpy) or more of any regulated pollutant; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Emits less than 75 tpy of all regulated pollutants.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SIP revision states that it is the general policy of the EOEA and the DEP to assist all businesses in identifying
applicable regulations and in meeting their obligations under the requirements of the CAA. However, recognizing
the special needs of the small business stationary sources, EOEA and DEP shall, wherever resources become a limiting
factor in providing such assistance, give priority to businesses which meet the definition of small business stationary
source under title V, section 507(c)(1) of the Clean Air Act. Additionally, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts allows
businesses that do not meet the provisions of sections 507(c)(1)(C)-(E) to petition the SBAP for assistance in accordance
with the procedures established in section 507(c)(2) of the CAA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SBAP staff, with the advice of the ombudsman and the CAP, may consider the development of provisions for excluding
any category or subcategory of sources with sufficient financial and technical resources, from receiving assistance
under the SBAP in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

III. Proposed Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has submitted a SIP revision implementing each of the required PROGRAM elements
required by section 507 of the CAA. The State expects all the elements of the PROGRAM to be fully operational by November
14, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State needs full adequate legal authority to implement the PROGRAM before EPA can fully approve this SIP revision.
Therefore, EPA is proposing to conditionally approve the Massachusetts SIP revision for the small business stationary
source technical and environmental compliance assistance program, which was submitted on November 13, 1993 upon
the condition that Massachusetts submits the additional legal authority necessary to fully implement the PROGRAM.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is soliciting public comments on the issues discussed in this proposal or on other relevant matters. These comments
will be considered before EPA takes final action. Interested parties may participate in the Federal rulemaking procedure
by submitting written comments to the EPA Regional office listed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Addresses
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 section of this action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to conditionally approve the small business stationary source technical and environmental compliance
assistance program submitted on November 13, 1992 and July 22, 1993. The one outstanding issue with this SIP revision
concerns Massachusetts' lack of adequate legal authority to establish and implement a compliance advisory panel.
The State plans to address this issue in a legislative resolve which it will forward to EPA by November 14, 1994. For
this reason EPA is proposing to conditionally approve this SIP revision on the condition that the State meet its commitment
to submit a legislative resolve allowing a compliance panel to be established and implemented, incorporating all
the elements listed in section 507(e) of the Clean Air Act and have the program fully operational by November 14, 1994.
Under section 110(k)(4) of the Act, EPA may conditionally approve a plan based on a commitment from the State to adopt
specific enforceable measures by a date certain, but not later than 1 year from the date of approval. If EPA takes final
conditional approval on the commitment, the State must meet its commitment to have the program fully operational
by November 14, 1994. If the State fails to do so, this approval will become a disapproval on that date. EPA will notify
the State by letter that this action has occurred. At that time, this commitment will no longer be a part of the approved
Massachusetts SIP. EPA subsequently will publish a notice in the notice section of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notifying the public that the conditional approval automatically converted to a disapproval. If the State meets
its commitment, within the applicable time frame, the conditionally approved submission will remain a part of the
SIP until EPA takes final action approving or disapproving the new legislative authority. If EPA disapproves the
new submittal, the conditionally approved small business program will also be disapproved at that time. If EPA approves
the submittal, the small business program will be fully approved in its entirety and replace the conditionally approved
program in the SIP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If EPA determines that it cannot issue a final conditional approval or if the conditional approval is converted to
a disapproval, such action will trigger EPA's authority to impose sanctions under section 110(m) of the CAA at the
time EPA issues the final disapproval or on the date the State fails to meet its commitment. In the latter case, EPA will
notify the State by letter that the conditional approval has been converted to a disapproval and that EPA's sanctions
authority has been triggered. In addition, the final disapproval triggers the Federal implementation plan (FIP)
requirement under section 110(c). Pursuant to section 507(b)(3), EPA will provide for implementation of the program
provisions required under section 507(a)(4) in any State that fails to submit such a program under that subsection.
Therefore, EPA would have to provide for a compliance assistance program which assists small business stationary
sources in determining applicable requirements and in receiving permits under the CAA.

 This action has been classified as a Table 2 Action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the

Assistant Administer for Air and Radiation. On January 6, 1989 the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table
2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years.
EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue
the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866
which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 By today's action, EPA is conditionally approving a State program created for the purpose of assisting small businesses
in complying with existing statutory and regulatory requirements. The program being proposed for conditional approval
today does not impose any new regulatory burden on small businesses; it is a program under which small businesses may
elect to take advantage of assistance provided by the state. Therefore, because the EPA's conditional approval of
this program does not impose any new regulatory requirements on small businesses, I certify that it does not have a
significant economic impact on any small entities affected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regional Administrator's decision to approve or disapprove the SIP revision will be based on whether it meets
the requirements of sections 110(a)(2)(A)-(K) and 110(a)(3) of the Clean Air Act, as amended, and EPA regulations
in 40 CFR part 51.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is proposing to approve revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) adopted by the Sacramento
Metropolitan Air Quality Management District (SMAQMD) on February 23, 1993, and by the Santa Barbara County Air Pollution
Control District (SBCAPCD) on December 10, 1991. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) submitted these revisions
to EPA on April 6, 1993, and June 19, 1992, respectively. The revisions concern SMAQMD's Rule 454, Degreasing Operations,
and SBCAPCD's Rule 331, Fugitive Emissions Inspection and Maintenance. SMAQMD's Rule 454 controls volatile organic
compound (VOC) emissions from metal parts cleaning procedures, while SBCAPCD's Rule 331 controls VOC emissions
from equipment leaks at sources such as petroleum refineries. The intended effect of proposing approval of these
rules is to regulate emissions of VOCs in accordance with the

requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). EPA's final action on this notice of proposed
rulemaking (NPR) will incorporate these rules into the federally approved SIP. EPA has evaluated each of these rules
and is proposing to approve them under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals, SIPs for national
primary and secondary ambient air quality standards and plan requirements for nonattainment areas.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 3, 1978, EPA promulgated a list of ozone nonattainment areas under the provisions of the Clean Air Act, as amended
in 1977 (1977 CAA or pre-amended Act), that included the Sacramento Metro Area and Santa Barbara County. 43 FR 8964,
40 CFR 81.305. Because these areas were unable to meet the statutory attainment date of December 31, 1982, California
requested under section 172(a)(2), and EPA approved, an extension of the attainment date to December 31, 1987. 40
CFR 52.238. On May 26, 1988, EPA notified the Governor of California, pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(H) of the pre-amended
Act, that the above districts' portions of the California SIP were inadequate to attain and maintain the ozone standard
and requested that deficiencies in the existing SIP be corrected (EPA's SIP-Call). On November 15, 1990, the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990 were enacted. Public Law 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q.
In amended section 182(a)(2)(A) of the CAA, Congress statutorily adopted the requirement that nonattainment areas
fix their deficient reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone and established a deadline of
May 15, 1991 for states to submit corrections of those deficiencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 182(a)(2)(A) applies to areas designated as nonattainment prior to enactment of the amendments and classified
as marginal or above as of the date of enactment. It requires such areas to adopt and correct RACT rules pursuant to pre
amended section 172(b) as interpreted in pre-amendment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA's SIP-Call used that guidance to indicate the necessary corrections for specific nonattainment areas. The Sacramento
Metro Area is classified as serious and Santa Barbara County is classified as moderate
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
; therefore, these areas were subject to the RACT fix-up requirement and the May 15, 1991 deadline.

 Among other things, the pre-amendment guidance consists of those portions of the proposed post-1987 ozone and carbon
monoxide policy that concern RACT, 52 FR 45044 (November 24, 1987); ``Issues Relating to VOC Regulation Cutpoints,
Deficiencies, and Deviations, Clarification to Appendix D of November 24, 1987 Federal Register Notice'' (Blue
Book) (notice of availability was published in the Federal Register on May 25, 1988); and the existing control technique

 The Sacramento Metro Area and Santa Barbara County retained their designations of nonattainment and were classified
by operation of law pursuant to sections 107(d) and 181(a) upon the date of enactment of the CAA. See 55 FR 56694 (November

On June 22, 1991, EPA, Region 9, notified the State of California that EPA had not received by the May 15, 1991 deadline
all required VOC rule corrections under section 182(a)(2)(A) of the CAA. The finding letter identified six districts
in California, including SMAQMD and SBCAPCD, that had failed to submit required rule corrections. The official finding
notice was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on October 22, 1991 (56 FR 54554). SMAQMD's Rule 454 and SBCAPCD's Rule 331 were listed in that finding notice. As a result,
both SMAQMD and SBCAPCD had 18 months to submit the rules to EPA before a sanction under section 179(a) of the Act would
be imposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of California submitted many revised RACT rules for incorporation into its SIP on April 6, 1993 and June 19,
1992, including the rules being acted on in this document. This document addresses EPA's proposed action for SMAQMD's
Rule 454, Degreasing Operations, and SBCAPCD's Rule 331, Fugitive Emissions Inspection and Maintenance. SMAQMD's
submitted Rule 454 and SBCAPCD's Rule 331 were found to be complete on April 28, 1993 and August 27, 1992, respectively,
pursuant to EPA's completeness criteria that are set forth in 40 CFR part 51, appendix V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and both rules are being proposed for approval into the SIP. The State's complete submittal of SMAQMD's Rule 454 and
SBCAPCD's Rule 331 satisfies the deficiency for which the finding of nonsubmittal, dated October 22, 1991, was made
and stopped the sanction clock.

 EPA adopted the completeness criteria on February 16, 1990 (55 FR 5830) and, pursuant to section 110(k)(1)(A) of the

SMAQMD's Rule 454 controls VOC emissions from equipment used to clean (degrease) metal parts, while SBCAPCD's Rule
331 controls leaks of VOCs from equipment used in petroleum refining and associated operations. VOCs contribute
to the production of ground level ozone and smog. The rules were adopted as part of each district's efforts to achieve
the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone and in response to EPA's SIP-Call and the section 182(a)(2)(A)
CAA requirement. The following is EPA's evaluation and proposed action for these rules.

EPA Evaluation and Proposed Action

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In determining the approvability of a VOC rule, EPA must evaluate the rule for consistency with the requirements of
the CAA and EPA regulations, as found in section 110 and part D of the CAA and 40 CFR part 51 (Requirements for Preparation,
Adoption, and Submittal of Implementation Plans). The EPA's interpretation of these requirements, which forms
the basis for today's action, appears in the various EPA policy guidance documents listed in footnote 1. Among those
provisions is the requirement that a VOC rule must, at a minimum, provide for the implementation of RACT for stationary
sources of VOC emissions. This requirement was carried forth from the pre-amended Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purpose of assisting state and local agencies in developing RACT rules, EPA prepared a series of Control Technique
Guideline (CTG) documents. The CTGs are based on the underlying requirements of the Act and specify the presumptive
norms for what is RACT for specific source categories. Under the CAA, Congress ratified EPA's use of these documents,
as well as other Agency policy, for requiring States to ``fix-up'' their RACT rules. See section 182(a)(2)(A). The
CTG applicable to SMAQMD's Rule 454 is entitled, ``Control of Volatile Organic Emissions from Solvent Metal Cleaning,''
EPA&hyph;450/2&hyph;77&hyph;022. The CTG applicable to SBCAPCD's Rule 331 is entitled, ``Control of Volatile
Organic Compound Leaks from Petroleum Refinery Equipment,'' EPA&hyph;450/2&hyph;78&hyph;036. Further interpretations
of EPA policy are found in the Blue Book, referred to in footnote 1. In general, these guidance documents have been set
forth to ensure that VOC rules are fully enforceable and strengthen or maintain the SIP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SMAQMD's submitted Rule 454, Degreasing Operations, includes the following significant changes from the current
SIP:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The definition section has been expanded by 13 terms, which helps to clarify the rule and makes it easier to enforce.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The applicability of the rule to solvents is now based on the initial boiling point rather than on solvent vapor pressure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Control Officer discretion for the use of unspecified control equipment has been deleted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The overall (capture and control) efficiency of control equipment has been set at not less than 85%.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Records for solvent usage amounts and for maintenance are now required, making the rule more enforceable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Test methods for determining compliance, not identified in the existing SIP rule, are now specified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SBCAPCD's submitted Rule 331, Fugitive Emissions Inspection and Maintenance, includes the following significant
changes from the current SIP:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The definition section has been expanded by 28 terms, which helps to clarify the rule and makes it easier to enforce.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The rule now requires replacement of components that require five or more repairs in one year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The rule now specifies that major leaks (as defined in the rule) be fixed within 5 calendar days, minor leaks within
15 days, and liquid leaks within 24 hours. Also, the leaking component must be tightened (minimized) within one hour
of discovery of the leak.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Recordkeeping requirements have been expanded to include not only tags on equipment, but diagrams of component
location, inspection logs, and maintenance records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The rule has been significantly strengthened by the identification of test methods to use to determine compliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has evaluated the submitted rules and has determined that they are consistent with the CAA, EPA regulations, and
EPA policy. Therefore, SMAQMD's Rule 454, Degreasing Operations, and SBCAPCD's Rule 331, Fugitive Emissions Inspection
and Maintenance, are being proposed for approval under section 110(k)(3) of the CAA as meeting the requirements of
section 110(a) and part D. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.

5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under sections 110 and 301 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply
approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose
any new requirements, it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature
of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action.
The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

 Allied Colloids, Inc., P.O. Box 820, Suffolk, VA 23434, has submitted pesticide petition (PP) 4E4277 to EPA requesting
that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 346a(e)),
propose to amend 40 CFR 180.1001(d) by establishing an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues

Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but
are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own):
solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers
such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading,
and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term
``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. As part of the EPA policy statement
on inert ingredients published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 22, 1987 (52 FR 13305), the Agency set forth a list of studies which would generally be used to evaluate the risks
posed by the presence of an inert ingredient in a pesticide formulation. Where it can be determined that the inert ingredient
will present minimal or no risk, the Agency does not need some or all of the listed studies to rule on the proposed tolerance
or exemption for an inert ingredient. The Agency has decided that any data, in addition to that described below, normally
required to support the proposed tolerance exemption for alkyl (C

) methacrylate-methacrylic acid copolymer will not need to be submitted. The rationale for this decision is described
below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of certain chemical substances that are defined as ``polymers,'' the Agency has established a set of criteria
which identify categories of polymers that present low risk. These criteria (described in 40 CFR 723.250) identify
polymers that are relatively unreactive and stable compared to other chemical substances as well as polymers that
typically are not readily absorbed. These properties generally limit a polymer's ability to cause adverse effects.
In addition, these criteria exclude polymers about which little is known. The Agency believes that polymers meeting
the criteria noted above will present minimal or no risk. Alkyl (C

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) methacrylate-methacrylic acid copolymer conforms to the definition of polymers given in 40 CFR 723.250(b)(11)
and meets the following criteria that are used to identify low-risk polymers:

) methacrylate-methacrylic acid copolymer is 11,900. Substances with molecular weights greater than 400 generally
are not absorbed through the intact skin, and substances with molecular weights greater than 1,000 generally are
not absorbed through the intact gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Chemicals not absorbed through skin or GI tract generally
are incapable of eliciting a toxic response.

practice, this ingredient is useful and a tolerance is not necessary to protect the public health. Therefore, EPA
proposes that the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance be established as set forth below.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 International Specialty Products, 1361 Alps Rd., Wayne, NJ 07470, has submitted to EPA the following pesticide petitions
(PPs): (1) 3E4243, maleic acid monoethyl ester-vinyl methyl ether copolymer; (2) 3E4248, maleic acid monisopropyl
ester-vinyl methyl ether copolymer; and (3) 3E4247, maleic acid monobutyl ester-vinyl methyl ether copolymer requesting
that the Administrator pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a(e),
propose to amend 40 CFR 180.1001(c) and (e) by establishing an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues
of these copolymers when used as inert ingredients (seed-coating adhesives, gels, and antitranspirants) in pesticide
formulations applied to growing crops or to raw agricultural commodities after harvest, and to animals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but
are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own):
solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers
such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading,
and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term
``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. As part of the EPA policy

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 22, 1987 (52 FR 13305), the Agency set forth a list of studies which would generally be used to evaluate the risks
posed by the presence of an inert ingredient in a pesticide formulation. Where it can be determined that the inert ingredient
will present minimal or no risk, the Agency does not need some or all of the listed studies to rule on the proposed tolerance
or exemption for an inert ingredient. The Agency has decided that any data, in addition to that described below, normally
required to support the proposed tolerance exemption for maleic acid monoethyl ester-vinyl methyl ether copolymer,
maleic acid monisopropyl ester-vinyl methyl ether copolymer, and maleic acid monobutyl ester-vinyl methyl ether
copolymer will not need to be submitted. The rationale for this decision is described below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of certain chemical substances that are defined as ``polymers,'' the Agency has established a set of criteria
which identify categories of polymers that present low risk. These criteria (described in 40 CFR 723.250) identify
polymers that are relatively unreactive and stable compared to other chemical substances as well as polymers that
typically are not readily absorbed. These properties generally limit a polymer's ability to cause adverse effects.
In addition, these criteria exclude polymers about which little is known. The Agency believes that polymers meeting
the criteria noted above will present minimal or no risk. Maleic acid monoethyl ester-vinyl methyl ether copolymer,
maleic acid monoisopropyl ester-vinyl methyl ether copolymer, and maleic acid monobutyl ester-vinyl methyl ether
copolymer conform to the definition of polymers given in 40 CFR 723.250(b)(11) and meet the following criteria that
are used to identify low-risk polymers: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The minimum number average molecular weight of the copolymers mentioned above is 46,000. Substances with molecular
weights greater than 400 generally are not absorbed through the intact skin, and substances with molecular weights
greater than 1,000 generally are not absorbed through the intact gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Chemicals not absorbed
through skin or GI tract generally are incapable of eliciting a toxic response.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Maleic acid monoethyl ester-vinyl methyl ether copolymer, maleic acid monoisopropyl ester-vinyl methyl ether
copolymer, and maleic acid monobutyl ester-vinyl methyl ether copolymer are not cationic polymers, nor are they
reasonably anticipated to become cationic polymers in a natural aquatic environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The above-mentioned copolymers do not contain less than 32.0 percent by weight of the atomic element carbon.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Maleic acid monoethyl ester-vinyl methyl ether copolymer, maleic acid monisopropyl ester-vinyl methyl ether
copolymer, and maleic acid monobutyl ester-vinyl methyl ether copolymer contain as integral parts of their composition
the atomic elements carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The above-mentioned copolymers do not contain as integral parts of their composition, except as impurities, any
elements other than those listed in 40 CFR 723.250(d)(3)(ii).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Maleic acid monoethyl ester-vinyl methyl ether copolymer, maleic acid monisopropyl ester-vinyl methyl ether
copolymer; and maleic acid monobutyl ester-vinyl methyl ether copolymer are not biopolymers, synthetic equivalents
of biopolymers, or derivatives or modifications of biopolymers that are substantially intact.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The above-mentioned copolymers are not manufactured from reactants containing, other than as impurities, halogen
atoms or cyano groups.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Maleic acid monoethyl ester-vinyl methyl ether copolymer, maleic acid monisopropyl ester-vinyl methyl ether
copolymer, and maleic acid monobutyl ester-vinyl methyl ether copolymer do not contain reactive functional groups
that are intended or reasonably anticipated to undergo futher reaction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The above-mentioned copolymers are not designed, nor are they reasonable expected, to substantially degrade,
decompose, or depolymerize.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the information above and review of its use, EPA has found that, when used in accordance with good agricultural
practice, these ingredients are useful and a tolerance is not necessary to protect the public health. Therefore,
EPA proposes that the exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance be established as set forth below.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Zeneca Ag Products, P.O. Box 751, Wilmington, DE 19897, has submitted pesticide petition (PP) 3E4269 to EPA requesting
that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a(e),
propose to amend 40 CFR 180.1001(e) by establishing an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues
of cross-linked polyurea-type encapsulating polymer when used as an inert ingredient (encapsulating agent) in
pesticide formulations for application to animals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but
are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own):
solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers
such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading,
and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term
``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted in support of the current exemption and also the data submitted in this petition have been evaluated.
As part of the EPA policy statement on inert ingredients published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 22, 1987 (52 FR 13305), the Agency set forth a list of studies which would generally be used to evaluate the risks
posed by the presence of an inert ingredient in a pesticide formulation. Where it can be determined that the inert ingredient
will present minimal or no risk, the Agency generally does not need some or all of the listed studies to rule on the proposed
tolerance or exemption for an inert ingredient. The Agency has decided that any data, in addition to that described
below, normally required to support cross-linked polyurea-type encapsulating polymer will not need to be submitted.
The rationale for this decision is described below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of certain chemical substances which are defined as ``polymers,'' the Agency has established a set of criteria
which identify categories of polymers that present low risk. These criteria (described in 40 CFR 723.250) identify
polymers that are relatively unreactive and stable compared to other chemical substances as well as polymers that
typically are not readily absorbed. These properties generally limit a polymer's ability to cause adverse effects.
In addition, these criteria exclude polymers about which little is known. The Agency believes that polymers meeting
the criteria noted above will present minimal or no risk. Cross-linked polyurea-type encapsulating polymer conforms
to the definition of a polymer given in 40 CFR 723.250(b)(11) and meets the following criteria which are used to identify
low risk polymers:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The minimum average molecular weight of the above-mentioned polymer is 5 X 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
13
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Substances with molecular weights greater than 400 generally are not readily absorbed through the intact skin,
and substances with molecular weights greater than 1,000 generally are not absorbed through the intact gastrointestinal
(GI) tract. Chemicals not absorbed through the skin or GI tract generally are incapable of eliciting a toxic response.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The above-mentioned polymer is not a cationic polymer, nor is it reasonably anticipated to become a cationic polymer
in a natural aquatic environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The above-mentioned polymer does not contain less than 32.0 percent by weight of the atomic element carbon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The above-mentioned polymer contains as an integral part of its composition the atomic elements carbon, hydrogen,
nitrogen, and oxygen. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The above-mentioned polymer does not contain as an integral part of its composition, except as impurities, any
elements other than those listed in 40 CFR 723.250(d)(3)(ii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The above-mentioned polymer is not a biopolymer, a synthetic equivalent of a biopolymer, or a derivative or modification
of a biopolymer that is substantially intact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The above-mentioned polymer is not manufactured from reactants containing, other than as impurities, halogen
atoms or cyano groups.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The above-mentioned polymer does not contain reactive functional groups that are intended or reasonably anticipated
to undergo further reaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The above-mentioned polymer is not designed or reasonably anticipated to substantially degrade, decompose,
or depolymerize.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the above information and review of its use, EPA has found that, when used in accordance with good agricultural
practice, this ingredient is useful and a tolerance is not necessary to protect the public health. Therefore, EPA
proposes that the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance be established as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide, under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended, which contains any of the ingredients listed herein, may request
within 30 days after publication of this document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation.
Comments must bear a notation indicating the document control number, [OPP-300137]. All written comments filed
in response to this petition will be available in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, at the address
given above, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

1. We now consider a Motion for Extension of Time for the filing of reply comments in the above-captioned proceeding
filed on December 22, 1993, by WLIG&hyph;TV, Inc. (``WLIG''), licensee of Television Station WLIG&hyph;TV, Riverhead,
New York, and proponent of the amendment of section 76.51 of the rules to include Riverhead in the subject market. The
deadline for filing comments in this proceeding was December 20, 1993, and reply comments are due January 4, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. WLIG states that although comments were all filed on December 20, 1993, copies were not received by counsel until
December 21 and 22. Seven sets of comments were filed. WLIG contends that the comments respond to a number of issues
raised in the

 which must be studied and addressed. Although WLIG has begun the process, it requests, noting the intervention of
two Federal holidays, the press of other year-end responsibilities, and pre-exiting vacation schedules, an additional
nine business days, until January 18, 1994, to file its reply comments. Inasmuch as this proceeding was initiated,
in part, by WLIG, it urges that the additional time will foster the paramount public interest in the development of
a full public record for the Commission's decision.

3. As set forth in section 1.46 of the Commission's rules, 47 CFR 1.46, it is our policy that extensions of time for filing
comments in rule making proceedings shall not be routinely granted. However, we note that the Notice of Proposed Rule
Making raises numerous issues concerning adjustments to particularly large and complex television markets, and
therein we specifically state our desire for additional information to develop a comprehensive record before deciding
these matters. Thus, it appears reasonable to provide the commenting parties additional time to analyze and address
these issues. Therefore, we will extend the deadline for filing reply comments in this proceeding to January 18, 1994.

 The FHWA requests public comment on the use and design of driver sleeper berths in the motorcoach industry. Existing
sleeper berth regulations were written with commercial trucks and truck-tractors in mind. The agency seeks comments
on the suitability of these regulations for motorcoaches and the possibility of amending them to account for design
differences between trucks and motorcoaches. This action is being taken in response to comments received at the motorcoach
industry Zero-Base Review hearing held in Miami, Florida, on January 20, 1993, and written requests from the motorcoach
industry.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On January 20, 1993, the FHWA held a public hearing in Miami, FL, as part of our Zero-Base Review of the Federal Motor
Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs) to obtain information, views, and opinions from representatives of the motorcoach
industry (see 57 FR 60784). Four out of ten industry representatives who testified at the hearing voiced concerns
about the suitability of existing sleeper berth regulations for motorcoaches. A common theme among those who testified
on this subject was that the current sleeper berth regulations were written specifically for trucks and truck-tractors
without considering the unique design characteristics of motorcoaches. A complete transcript of this hearing is
on file and available for review in the FHWA docket room under FHWA Docket No. MC&hyph;92&hyph;33&hyph;182. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both the American Bus Association and the United Bus Owners of America have also indicated to the FHWA that the suitability
of existing sleeper berth regulations for motorcoaches is a concern of their members. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA has also received written requests from the motorcoach industry to revise the current sleeper berth regulations
to account for design differences between motorcoaches and trucks. (Copies of these letters are included in FHWA
Docket No. MC&hyph;93&hyph;34.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to these concerns and as part of the FHWA's efforts to eliminate unnecessarily design-restrictive regulations,
a review of the rulemaking history of the current sleeper berth requirements was completed. The review indicated
that sleeper berths on motorcoaches may not have been considered when the existing sleeper berth regulations were
promulgated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a final rule published on May 15, 1952 (17 FR 4422), the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) revised most of the
existing Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs) and created a number of new regulations. One new regulation
set forth detailed specifications for sleeper berths. The rule required that every sleeper berth installed in or
on a truck or truck-tractor after December 31, 1952, be located within or immediately adjacent to the cab, or within
the cargo space of a truck, and be provided with a direct and ready means of exit into the driver's compartment (17 FR
4443). These requirements are now codified at 49 CFR 393.76(b)(2) and 393.76(c)(1), respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the regulations also required that any sleeper berth which could not meet this standard, in essence those
installed on trucks or truck-tractors before December 31, 1952, be provided with means of communication between
the occupant of the berth and the driver. The berth also had to be designed, constructed, and maintained to provide
the occupant, without the assistance of other persons, at least two means of ready exit from the motor vehicle. These
requirements are now codified at 49 CFR 393.76(d) and 393.76(c)(2)(ii), respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because motorcoach operators rarely used sleeper berths forty years ago, the ICC drafted a rule for trucks and truck-tractors.
Practices in the motorcoach industry have changed, however, and some operators would like to use sleeper berths to
reduce driver fatigue and to help comply with driver's hours of service regulations. The 1952 regulations did not
address sleeper berths on motorcoaches, nor have any subsequent rulemakings done so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 3, 1970, the FHWA published a final rule relating to seat belts and restraint of sleeper berth occupants (35
FR 10859). That rule differentiated between trucks and buses with regard to seats, seat belt assemblies, and seat
belt assembly anchorage requirements, but not with regard to sleeper berth restraint requirements.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another rule on sleeper berth specifications was published on April 26, 1974 (39 FR 14710). It amended &sect;393.76
by increasing the minimum interior dimensions required for sleeper berths. The rule omitted specific references
to trucks and truck-tractors but made no substantive changes to adapt the regulation to the different design configurations
of motorcoaches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Available information indicates that many sleeper berths installed on motorcoaches today are located in the baggage
area. This area is modified to allow the doors to be opened from inside the compartment, and by adding a mattress, air
conditioning, heat, and a means of communication with the driver. In order to meet the current requirement of &sect;393.76(c)(1)
for direct and ready means of exit from the sleeper berth into the driver's seat or compartment, an aperture that meets
the exit dimensional requirements must be cut into the floor of the motorcoach. This reduces the seating capacity
of the motorcoach. The FHWA would like to know about other motorcoach sleeper berth designs which may or may not meet
the current requirements of &sect;393.76. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA is requesting public comment on the question of whether, and if so how, existing sleeper berth regulations
should be amended to address design differences between motorcoaches and commercial trucks.

Questions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA would appreciate comments on the following questions. Commenters are also encouraged to discuss any other
matters related to sleeper berths on motorcoaches which they believe the FHWA should address. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Should existing sleeper berth regulations be amended to account for design differences between motorcoaches
and trucks? If so, what changes should be made and why? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. What is the current extent of sleeper berth usage within the motorcoach industry? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. How many motorcoaches have been manufactured with sleeper berths as part of their original equipment? How and where
are these sleeper berths installed? How many comply with &sect;393.76? How many do not? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. How many motorcoaches have been retrofitted with sleeper berths? How and where are these sleeper berths installed?
How many comply with &sect;393.76? How many do not? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Do after-market changes, such as cutting holes in the floor or modifying the cargo compartment, affect the structural
integrity of the motorcoach? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The FHWA notes that if a driver sleeper berth is located within the baggage area and occupied while the motorcoach
is in operation, the occupant could be vulnerable to a side impact collision. Are special requirements needed to ensure
the occupants' safety? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. If a driver sleeper berth is located in the baggage area of a motorcoach, should its location be restricted (e.g.,
only the forward-most portion of the baggage area)? If the sleeper berth is used while the vehicle is in operation,
would having the sleeper berth near the rear of the motorcoach subject persons occupying the berth to excessive heat,
noise, or exhaust? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The current requirements of &sect;393.76 for a direct and ready means of exit from the sleeper berth into the driver's
seat or compartment may be design-restrictive for motorcoaches. Should the exit requirements allow a ready means
of exit into the passenger compartment of the motorcoach instead of the driver's seat or compartment? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Would separate motorcoach sleeper berth regulations enhance motorcoach safety or benefit the motorcoach industry?
If yes, how?

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is proposing to add 313 chemicals and chemical categories to the list of toxic chemicals required to be reported
on under section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 and section 6607 of the Pollution
Prevention Act of 1990. The proposed addition of these chemicals and chemical categories is based on their acute human
health effects, carcinogenicity or other chronic human health effects, and/or their environmental effects. EPA
believes that these chemicals and chemical categories meet the EPCRA section 313(d)(2) criteria for addition to
the list of toxic chemicals.

A. Statutory Authority
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule is issued under sections 313(d) and (e)(1) of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know
Act of 1986 (EPCRA), 42 U.S.C. 11023. EPCRA is also referred to as Title III of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization
Act of 1986.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 313 of EPCRA requires certain facilities manufacturing, processing, or otherwise using listed toxic chemicals
to report their environmental releases of such chemicals annually. Beginning with the 1991 reporting year, such
facilities also must report pollution prevention and recycling data for such chemicals, pursuant to section 6607
of the Pollution Prevention Act, 42 U.S.C. 13106. When enacted, section 313 established an initial list of toxic chemicals
that was comprised of more than 300 chemicals and 20 chemical categories. Section 313(d) authorizes EPA to add chemicals
to or delete chemicals from the list, and sets forth criteria for these actions. Under section 313(e), any person may
petition EPA to add chemicals to or delete chemicals from the list. EPA has added to and deleted chemicals from the original
statutory list.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA issued a statement of petition policy and guidance in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of February 4, 1987 (52 FR 3479), to provide guidance regarding the recommended content and format for submitting
petitions. EPA must respond to petitions within 180 days either by initiating a rulemaking or by publishing an explanation
of why the petition is denied. On May 23, 1991 (56 FR 23703), EPA issued guidance regarding the recommended content
of petitions to delete individual members of the section 313 metal compound categories.

II. Explanation for Expansion of the EPCRA Section 313 Chemical List 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. General Rationale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Toxics Release Inventory (TRI), through the public access provisions of EPCRA, has proven to be one of the most
powerful forces in empowering the Federal government, State governments, industry, environmental groups, and
the general public, to fully participate in an informed dialogue about the environmental impacts of toxic chemicals
in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A major section of EPCRA, which Congress passed in 1986, resulted in the creation of the Toxics Release Inventory.
TRI is a publicly available data base that provides quantitative information on toxic chemical releases, transfers,
recycling, and disposal. With the collection of this information for the first time in 1987, came the ability for the
public, government, and the regulated community to understand the magnitude of chemical emissions in the United
States; to compare chemical releases and transfers of chemical wastes among States, industries, facilities, and
environmental media; and perhaps most importantly, to assess the need to reduce and where possible, eliminate these
releases and transfers. TRI enables all interested in environmental progress to establish credible baselines,
to set realistic goals, and to measure progress over time, in meeting those goals. The TRI system has become a neutral
yardstick by which progress can be measured by all interested parties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The original list of chemicals for which reporting was required consisted of 320 chemicals and chemical categories.
The list was a combination of the Maryland Chemical Inventory Report List of Toxic or Hazardous Substances and the
New Jersey Environmental Hazardous Substance List. The combination of these two lists provided a sound and logical
starting point for the national TRI program. Recognizing however that the list would need to be a dynamic one, EPCRA
specifically authorizes additions to and deletions from the list. To date, EPA has added 16 chemicals to the list and
has deleted 12 chemicals from the list.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With 5 years experience behind the program, EPA, other federal agencies, Congress, and the public have recognized
the need to expand the TRI list beyond the original chemicals and chemical categories and beyond the relatively limited
reporting universe. (Currently reporting is only required from facilities that fall within the manufacturing Standard
Industrial Classification (SIC) codes 20 through 39 that meet certain thresholds).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the data on the chemicals that are covered have allowed the public and private sectors to be informed and involved
in environmental decisionmaking as they never were before, it has become increasingly evident to those same constituents
that they have access to information on a relatively small number of important chemicals. Congress has echoed this
recognition in the Right-to-Know More bills that were put forward in the 102nd Congress. EPA and State regulatory
agencies have integrated TRI information as a critical component in their environmental decisionmaking and in many
cases are constrained by the lack of similar information on chemicals of concern not covered by the TRI. While the TRI
has been successful in focusing attention on the initial list of chemicals and in many cases fostering emissions reductions
and prevention activities, that same focus has highlighted the need to expand beyond that initial list and to include
additional chemicals that exhibit similar toxicity characteristics. This proposal is one of the first in a series
of actions that EPA plans to use to expand the coverage of the TRI. This first phase will focus on adding chemicals, followed
by a second phase that will identify additional facilities for inclusion. EPA is considering a third phase, which
would look at modification of the data elements currently required by TRI. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In conjunction with these expansion activities EPA has been considering whether other adjustments are needed in
the scope of the TRI program. EPA received petitions from the Small Business Administration and the American Feed
Industry Association seeking an exemption for ``small sources'' (i.e, those facilities that file TRI forms with
zero or small release estimates). EPA previously put those petitions out for public comment and, on review, believes
there is substantial merit to the general concerns raised in the petitions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency's plan for proceeding on the small source issue would include the following steps. EPA is examining four
options for establishing a small release exemption from the TRI reporting obligation: Cutoffs at zero, 500 pounds,
1,000 pounds, and 5,000 pounds. EPA will provide the public with a report on these four options by the end of January.
This analysis will consider what data might not be available at both the national and community level, and the cost
savings to the government and to industry of the four exemption levels. EPA plans to hold a public meeting in February
for discussion of the report. Based on this feedback, EPA will then design a regulatory strategy that will align the
small source issue with final action on today's proposal. The Agency's objective will be to minimize unnecessary
data collection and reporting by facilities, including for the chemicals identified in today's proposal.

B. Development of the Chemical Addition Candidates
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a starting point for screening candidates for addition to the toxic chemical list under EPCRA section 313, EPA chose
to examine the lists of chemicals regulated or identified, as of concern, under various environmental statutes including:
(1) Section 112(b) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) as amended in 1990 (Hazardous Air Pollutants); (2) section 602(b) of the
CAA (Class II ozone depleting substances); (3) section 307(a) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) (Priority Pollutant List);
(4) Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Active Ingredients, including Special Review,
Canceled/Denied or Suspended, and Restricted Use Pesticides; (5) section 302 of EPCRA (Extremely Hazardous Substances);
(6) section 102 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA); (7) section
3001 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and chemicals listed at 40 CFR 261.33(e) and (f) and Appendix
VIII; (8) section 1412 of the Safe Drinking Water Act as amended; (9) certain chemicals subject to the Toxics Substance
Control Act (Existing Chemicals); and (10) the State of California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act
of 1986 (Proposition 65) (List of Chemicals Known to the State to Cause Reproductive Toxicity). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, EPA considered chemicals designated as possible, probable, or known carcinogens in the Monographs
of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the 6th Annual Report on Carcinogens of the National
Toxicology Program (NTP), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). From this initial group of substances,
EPA excluded chemicals that are already listed on section 313 or are already reportable under one of the EPCRA section
313 categories. For example, ``cyanide, total'' is listed under section 307(a) of the CWA. This listing is considered
to be a subset of the EPCRA section 313 cyanide compounds category and the hydrogen cyanide listing. EPA decided not
to propose listing these types of chemicals separately because they are already reportable under one of the existing
section 313 categories. To prioritize chemicals for possible addition to EPCRA section 313, EPA applied a human health
and ecotoxicity screen and a production volume screen, which are described below. The results of the toxicity screen
for a subset of these chemicals were presented at a public meeting on May 29, 1992 (Ref. 4). Other chemicals were also
removed from consideration for this rulemaking because they are the subjects of two recently published EPCRA petition
responses. On March 4, 1992, EPA received a petition from Governor Mario M. Cuomo of New York and the Natural Resources
Defense Council (NRDC) to add 80 chemicals and 2 chemical categories to the list of toxic chemicals under section 313
of EPCRA. All of these chemicals and chemical categories appear on the RCRA list of hazardous wastes under 40 CFR 261.33(f)
and as such are a subset of the chemicals screened by EPA. EPA responded to the petition in a proposed rulemaking on September
8, 1992 (57 FR 41020) and in a final rule adding 22 chemicals on November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63500). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 3, 1991, EPA received a petition from the NRDC, Friends of the Earth, and the Environmental Defense Fund
to add hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) to the list of toxic chemicals under section 313 of EPCRA. The HCFCs are listed
under section 602(b) of the CAA as Class II ozone depleting substances and as such are a subset of the chemicals screened
by EPA. EPA responded to the petition in a proposed rulemaking on June 24, 1992 (57 FR 28159) and in a final rule adding
11 HCFCs on November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63496). An additional 16 HCFCs not added to the TRI list by the November 30, 1993 final
rule are proposed for addition in this rulemaking (See Unit IV.B.135. of this preamble).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Toxicity screen
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A toxicity screen is a limited review of readily available toxicity data (e.g., information in data bases and other
secondary sources) that is used for a preliminary categorization of a chemical during the process of selecting candidates
for possible listing under EPCRA section 313. The toxicity screen is used to identify chemicals for further consideration
and does not reflect a final determination for listing a chemical under EPCRA section 313. Such a determination can
only be made after a hazard assessment is conducted (See Unit II.B.3. of this preamble). The chemicals identified
above were screened for four general effect categories: Acute human health effects, cancer, other chronic human
health effects, and ecological effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The screening criteria associated with each of the effect areas used in the toxicity screen are discussed in detail
in the

, (Ref. 6). The numerical screening values reflected in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 were developed to capture, in the ``sufficient for listing'' screening category, the majority of chemicals already
listed on various CERCLA and EPCRA lists, and thus known or suspected to be toxic and/or hazardous. These 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Draft Hazard Assessment Guidelines
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contain guidance for both the screening and hazard assessments of chemicals and are available for review in the docket
associated with this rulemaking. This draft document was distributed at a public meeting on May 29, 1992. A final version
of these guidelines has not yet been developed. Requests for further information about these draft guidelines should
be addressed to the person identified under ``FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the results of this screen, the chemicals were preliminarily placed in one of three screening categories
defined in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Draft Hazard Assessment Guidelines
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: ``sufficient;'' ``may be sufficient;'' or ``insufficient.'' EPA received comment in response to the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Draft Hazard Assessment Guidelines
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that objected to the Agency's use of the terms ``sufficient,'' ``may be sufficient,'' and ``insufficient'' as titles
for the toxicity screening categories. The commenter claimed that these terms are appropriate only for the results
of a hazard assessment. The commenter stated that these terms should not be used for screening categories because
the toxicity screen only identifies chemicals for further consideration. EPA agrees that the screening categories
only reflect a preliminary determination on each chemical, and therefore, to avoid further confusion, will refer
to the screening categories as ``high priority,'' ``medium priority,'' and ``low priority'' to reflect the difference
between a toxicity screen and a hazard assessment. These terms will be used throughout this document in reference
to the toxicity screening categories. Chemicals that were categorized as ``low priority'' during the screening
process were not considered further as candidates for addition to the EPCRA section 313 list in this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Production volume screen
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. EPCRA section 313(f) establishes reporting thresholds related to the amount of a chemical that is manufactured,
processed, or otherwise used. [The EPCRA section 313 manufacture (includes import) and processing thresholds are
25,000 pounds per facility per year. The otherwise use threshold is 10,000 pounds per facility per year]. EPA anticipates
that the addition of chemicals manufactured, imported, processed, or used in quantities less than the EPCRA section
313 volume thresholds would not result in the submission of TRI reports. Thus, EPA elected to initially focus its attention
on chemicals likely to yield reports. Accordingly, EPA also screened potential candidates for the likelihood of
meeting the EPCRA section 313 volume thresholds. Chemicals for which there were no data to indicate that the chemical
is likely to meet or exceed the EPCRA section 313 volume thresholds were not considered further as possible candidates
for addition to the section 313 list at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Production volume data on each of the chemicals were gathered primarily from two sources: (1) The TSCA Chemical Update
System (1990); and (2) the FIFRA Section 7 Tracking System. On June 12, 1986 (51 FR 21438), EPA promulgated a rule pursuant
to section 8(a) of TSCA which required manufacturers and importers to report every 4 years, subject to certain threshold
production quantities and other exclusions, the quantities of chemicals they produced (40 CFR part 710). Among the
exceptions to the inventory update rule (IUR) reporting were polymers, biological products, inorganic substances,
and chemicals produced at less than 10,000 pounds, all with certain limitations. Data from the IUR is maintained in
EPA's TSCA Chemical Update System (CUS). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 7 of FIFRA provides the Agency with annual production information on registered pesticides. EPA regulations
implementing FIFRA section 7 (40 CFR part 167) require all manufacturers of pesticidal products (which includes
formulated pesticides, active ingredients, and devices) to submit an annual report detailing the amount of each
type of pesticidal product manufactured, sold and distributed during the past year, and estimated to be manufactured,
imported, and processed during the current year (40 CFR 167.85). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For industrial inorganic compounds not subject to FIFRA or available on CUS, information from the public literature
was used, supplemented with information from companies.

Hazard evaluation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. EPA conducted a hazard evaluation for each of the addition candidates that resulted from the above analyses and determined
based on the weight-of-the evidence if there was sufficient evidence to establish that the candidate chemical met
the statutory criteria for addition to EPCRA section 313. To make this determination, EPA senior scientists reviewed
readily available toxicity information on each chemical for each of the following effect areas: acute human health
effects; cancer; other chronic human effects; and environmental effects. In addition, EPA reviewed, where appropriate,
information on the environmental fate of the chemical. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hazard assessment was conducted in accordance with relevant EPA guidelines for each adverse human health or environmental
effect (e.g., the appropriate guidelines for hazard evaluation of chemical carcinogens and for the type of evidence
required to substantiate a determination of carcinogenicity are the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Ref. 2)). The guidelines that were used for each effect are Agency guidelines that are identified in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Draft Hazard Assessment Guidelines
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Ref. 6). During this assessment the severity and significance of the effects induced by the chemical, the dose level
causing the effect, and the quality and quantity of the available data, including the nature of the data (e.g., human
epidemiological, laboratory animal, field or workplace studies) and confidence level in the existing data base,
were all considered. Where a careful review of the scientific data for a particular chemical results in a high level
of confidence that the chemical causes an adverse effect at relatively low dose levels, EPA believes that this evidence
is sufficient for listing the chemical under section 313. On the other hand, where a review of the scientific data indicates
that the chemical will cause various adverse effects at moderate dose levels, EPA believes, based on the total weight-of-the-evidence,
that there is sufficient evidence for listing the chemical under EPCRA section 313. EPA also conducted an analysis
of exposure for each chemical or chemical category proposed for listing under EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A) (i.e.,
based on adverse acute human health effects), and, where appropriate, under section 313(d)(2)(C) (i.e., based on
adverse ecological effects). For chemicals listed under EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A), this analysis included estimated
concentrations of the chemical at or beyond the facility site boundary through the use of estimated releases and modelling
techniques. EPA requests comment on its approach in considering exposure as a part of its evaluation of these chemicals
under sections 313(d)(2)(A) and (C).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on this analysis for each of the chemicals proposed for listing, EPA determined that one or more of the statutory
criteria were met. A discussion of EPA's interpretation of the EPCRA section 313 criteria is given in Unit III. of this
preamble. A discussion of the evidence supporting EPA's proposal to add each of the chemicals to EPCRA section 313
is presented in Unit IV. of this preamble and in the record supporting this proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other considerations
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. EPA excluded certain chemicals and chemical categories from consideration for proposed listing under EPCRA section
313 in this rulemaking for a number of reasons. Some chemicals were identified only as environmental degradation
products rather than chemicals that are manufactured, processed, or otherwise used by a facility. These chemicals
will only be present in the environment as a result of the release into the environment of precursor chemicals. If the
degradation product meets the toxicity criteria of EPCRA section 313, the precursor chemical may be considered for
listing on EPCRA section 313. The degradation product would not be considered for listing on EPCRA section 313 because
a facility subject to EPCRA section 313 is only required to file a TRI report for a chemical that it manufactures, processes,
or otherwise uses, within the facility boundaries. Therefore, EPA does not believe that it is appropriate to consider
listing such chemicals at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some of the lists reviewed by EPA included listings that represented waste streams from particular processes. These
waste streams, such as coke oven emissions, are not discrete chemicals or chemical categories, but contain a wide
range of chemicals, many of which are currently listed individually on EPCRA section 313. The focus of this rulemaking
is on the addition of specific chemicals and chemical categories and, as such, EPA believes that these waste streams
are inappropriate for listing under EPCRA section 313 at this time. EPA also excluded chemicals whose only identified
toxicity concern was a result of their status as a volatile organic compound (VOC). VOCs contribute to the formation
of tropospheric ozone which causes a number of health-related and environmental problems. EPA continues to believe
that VOCs meet the listing criteria of EPCRA section 313. However, EPA intends to address the issue of how VOCs should
be listed on EPCRA section 313 separately. Therefore, chemicals whose only identified toxicity concern is due to
their status as VOCs were excluded from consideration at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also identified chemicals that are routinely manufactured, processed, or otherwise used at levels far below
the reporting thresholds of EPCRA section 313. These chemicals are not expected to ever be manufactured, processed,
or otherwise used in quantities at or above these reporting thresholds. In this proposed rulemaking, EPA is attempting
to add chemicals to EPCRA section 313 that are manufactured, processed, or otherwise used in quantities greater than
the EPCRA section 313 volume thresholds and thus would result in the submission of TRI reports. Consequently, chemicals
that are manufactured, processed, or otherwise used in quantities less than the EPCRA section 313 volume thresholds
were excluded from further consideration at this time, because no reports would be filed under EPCRA section 313 for
such chemicals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some of the chemicals that are manufactured, processed, or otherwise used below the EPCRA section 313 activity thresholds,
particularly those chemicals that are manufactured in trace amounts in waste streams, are highly toxic at very low
dose levels and have physical, chemical, or biological properties that make the chemicals persist for extended periods
in the environment, and bioaccumulate through the food chain. Persistent bioaccumulative toxic chemicals, such
as dioxins, are of particular concern in ecosystems such as the Great Lakes Basin due to the long retention time of the
individual lakes and the cycling of the chemical from one component of the ecosystem to another. EPA may reconsider
in the future the issue of listing such chemicals in a manner which would result in the submission of TRI reports. EPA
requests comment on the following: Is it appropriate to list such chemicals on EPCRA section 313? If EPA were to add
this type of chemical to EPCRA section 313, what modifications to EPCRA section 313, such as lowering the reporting
thresholds and modifying the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in mixture exemptions (40 CFR part 372.38), would be required to insure that release and transfer information would
be collected?

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. EPCRA Section 313 Statutory Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPCRA section 313(d)(2) sets out criteria for adding chemicals to the list of chemicals subject to reporting under
section 313(a). For a chemical (or category of chemicals) to be added to the EPCRA section 313(c) list of toxic chemicals,
the Administrator must determine whether, in her judgement, there is sufficient evidence to establish any one of
the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The chemical is known to cause or can reasonably be anticipated to cause significant adverse acute human health
effects at concentration levels that are reasonably likely to exist beyond facility site boundaries as a result of
continuous, or frequently recurring, releases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The chemical is known to cause or can reasonably be anticipated to cause in humans--
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) cancer or teratogenic effects, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) serious or irreversible--
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(I) reproductive dysfunctions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(II) neurological disorders, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(III) heritable genetic mutations, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(IV) other chronic health effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The chemical is known to cause or can reasonably be anticipated to cause, because of--
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) its toxicity, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) its toxicity and persistence in the environment, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) its toxicity and tendency to bioaccumulate in the environment, a significant adverse effect on the environment
of sufficient seriousness, in the judgement of the Administrator, to warrant reporting under this section. To remove
a chemical from the section 313(c) list, the Administrator must determine that there is not sufficient evidence to
establish any of the criteria described above as required by EPCRA section 313(d)(3). Thus, the criteria for listing
or delisting a chemical are identical. However, whereas EPA can add a chemical if only one of the criteria is met, it
can only delete a chemical if none of the criteria are met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ascertain whether there is sufficient or insufficient evidence to determine that the statutory criteria are met
for listing a chemical, EPA conducts a hazard assessment on the chemical and determines based on the weight-of-the-evidence,
whether the chemical can reasonably be anticipated to cause any of the adverse effects specified in EPCRA section
313(d)(2). The hazard analysis is described above in Unit II.B.3. of this preamble. EPA's interpretation of the specific
statutory criteria follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 313(d)(2)(A) (acute human health effects)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. To determine whether the section 313(d)(2)(A) ``acute human health effects'' criterion is met, EPA must examine
the adverse effects associated with the chemical, the ``concentration levels'' which would cause acute human health
effects, and the likelihood of such levels existing ``beyond facility site boundaries as a result of continuous,
or frequently recurring, releases.'' Such a determination may include, among other factors, consideration of production
processes, workplace procedures, pollution controls, and the volume and pattern of production, use, and release,
as well as other chemical-specific factors. EPA believes that to make the section 313(d)(2)(A) determination it
must demonstrate that a chemical can reasonably be anticipated to be released in quantities that result in concentration
levels, or within a reasonable margin of exposure of the concentration levels, that would be expected to cause acute
human health effects beyond the facility site boundary. The margin of exposure applied is dependent upon the type
of hazard data (e.g., data in animals versus human) and the confidence in this hazard data base for acute effects (e.g.,
sufficiency of the hazard data). However, EPA is not required to make a facility-specific finding, nor is it necessary
for EPA to demonstrate that these concentration levels or effects occur at or near any particular facility (Ref. 1).
Furthermore, ``EPA may, but is not required to, conduct new studies or risk assessments or perform site-specific
analyses to establish actual ambient concentrations or to document adverse effects at any particular location''
(Ref. 1). Nor is EPA limited to considering concentration levels and potential acute human health effects at the ``fenceline.''
Rather, the phrase ``beyond facility site boundaries'' reflects Congress' recognition that the ``highest concentration
to which persons outside the site boundary may be exposed'' could occur at ``any point outside the boundaries of the
site on which the facility is located,'' including, for example, where an air emissions plume cools and settles to
the ground (Ref. 1). Therefore, EPA believes that to make a finding under EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A), the Agency may
estimate concentrations at or beyond the facility site boundary through the use of estimated releases and modelling
techniques. The term ``continuous or frequently recurring releases'' is included only to distinguish routine releases
that are a normal consequence of the operation of a facility from the episodic and accidental releases that are subject
to EPCRA section 304 (Ref. 1). As such, EPA believes that episodic and accidental releases are not pertinent in a determination
that a chemical meets the section 313(d)(2)(A) criterion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 313(d)(2)(B) (chronic human health effects)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In contrast to the section 313(d)(2)(A) criterion, section 313(d)(2)(B) does not require consideration of either
the nature and frequency of releases or concentration levels at facility site boundaries. Rather, section 313(d)(2)(B)
is focused solely on whether the chemical is known or can reasonably be anticipated to cause cancer, teratogenicity,
or other serious or irreversible chronic human health effects. Consequently, EPA believes that it is sufficient
to consider only the toxicity of the subject chemical to make the section 313(d)(2)(B) determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 313(d)(2)(C) (environmental effects)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The section 313(d)(2)(C) criterion requires EPA to consider a chemical's potential to cause significant adverse
effects on the environment. The statute directs EPA to base its determination on a consideration of the toxicity of
the chemical, either alone or in combination with the persistence of the chemical or the potential for the chemical
to bioaccumulate. Congress intended that EPA consider a broad range of environmental effects when making a determination
under section 313(d)(2)(C).

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In determining what constitutes a significant adverse effect on the environment...the Administrator should consider
the extent to which the toxic chemical causes or can reasonably be anticipated to cause any of the following adverse
reactions, even if restricted to the immediate vicinity adjacent to the site: (1) Gradual or sudden changes in the
composition of animal life or plant life, including fungal or microbial organisms in an area. (2) Abnormal number
of deaths of organisms (e.g. fish kills). (3) Reduction of the reproductive success or the vigor of a species. (4) Reduction
in agricultural productivity, whether crops or livestock. (5) Alterations in the behavior or distribution of a species.
(6) Long lasting or irreversible contamination of components of the physical environment, especially in the case
of groundwater, and surface water and soil resources that have limited self-cleansing capability (Ref. 1).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA believes that the environmental effects criterion inherently contains a limited exposure component because
of the statutory requirement for EPA to find a ``significant adverse effect on the environment of sufficient seriousness,
in the judgment of the Administrator, to warrant reporting'' under EPCRA section 313. Unlike section 313(d)(2)(B),
where EPA only has to determine whether certain kinds of effects are ``known or reasonably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anticipated'' to occur, section 313(d)(2)(C) requires EPA to find the effect to be of sufficient seriousness to warrant
reporting, which implies the possibility that under certain circumstances, a chemical that could theoretically
cause a significant adverse effect on the environment is unlikely to cause one of a magnitude to warrant listing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The extent to which exposure is factored into EPA's determination depends upon the inherent toxicity of a chemical,
and a variety of other chemical-specific characteristics. EPA believes that when a chemical is inherently extremely
toxic, that is, it is toxic at very low dose levels, an exposure assessment is not necessary because even minimal releases
of such a chemical may reasonably be anticipated to result in significant adverse environmental effects. In such
cases, EPA could rely on toxicity alone under section 313(d)(2)(C)(i) as a basis for listing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, for chemicals that exhibit adverse effects upon the environment solely based on toxicity at moderately
low doses, EPA believes that consideration of potential exposure is warranted because minimal releases may not result
in significant adverse effects upon the environment. These exposure considerations may include, among other factors,
pollution controls, the volume and pattern of production, use, and release, environmental fate, as well as other
chemical-specific factors, and the use of estimated releases and modelling techniques. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPCRA sections 313(d)(2)(C)(ii) and (iii) allow EPA to consider the impacts of other characteristics of a chemical.
Where a chemical exhibits significant adverse effects in the environment based on toxicity and persistence or toxicity
and bioaccumulation at very low to moderately low dose levels, EPA believes that exposure considerations are not
required in addition to those considerations implicit in evaluation of the chemical's potential for persistence
and bioaccumulation. This is because even minimal releases of the chemical may result in elevated concentrations
in the environment or in an organism that can reasonably be anticipated to result in significant adverse effects.
This reflects the increased likelihood that there will be exposure to a chemical that persists due to its longer residence
time in the environment. Repeated minimal releases of a persistent chemical may result in elevated concentrations
in the environment. For a chemical that bioaccumulates, even low levels of the chemical in the environment may result
in increased concentrations in an organism. Therefore, evaluation of a chemical's persistence or bioaccumulation
potential may be considered the functional equivalent of an exposure analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, for chemicals which induce well-established adverse effects, e.g. chlorofluorocarbons, which cause
stratospheric ozone depletion, EPA believes that an exposure assessment is unnecessary. EPA believes that these
chemicals typically do not affect solely one or two species but rather affect changes across a whole ecosystem. EPA
believes that these effects are of sufficient seriousness that additional exposure considerations are not warranted
because of the scope of their impact and the well-documented evidence supporting the adverse effects. EPA requests
comment on its approach for considering exposure as a part of its evaluation for listing of these chemicals under section
313(d)(2)(C).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Data on the chemicals and chemical categories were reviewed for evidence indicating adverse acute and chronic toxicity,
carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, developmental and reproductive effects, neurotoxicity, and environmental effects.
Information on the environmental fate was also reviewed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For each chemical proposed for addition to EPCRA section 313 in this rulemaking, EPA conducted an extensive hazard
assessment, and, where appropriate, an analysis of exposure, to determine whether the chemical met one or more of
the EPCRA section 313(d)(2) listing criteria. This hazard assessment is discussed in detail in Unit II.B.3 of this
preamble. Only after this careful review was a final determination made as to whether one of the EPCRA section 313(d)(2)
listing criteria was met for each individual chemical or chemical category proposed for listing below. EPA need only
show that one of the listing criteria is met in order to list a chemical or chemical category under EPCRA section 313.
The information summarized below for each chemical or chemical category represents the key data elements that lead
EPA to believe that there is sufficient evidence to establish that one of the section 313(d)(2) listing criteria is
met. A more extensive review of the existing data base for each chemical or chemical category proposed for listing,
which reflects the entire weight-of-the-evidence considered by EPA, is contained in following support documents:

 (CAS No. 020859-73-8) (CERCLA; EPCRA EHS; RCRA APP8; RCRA P) (Ref. 8). The median lethal dose of aluminum phosphide
in humans is 20 mg/kg. The acute inhalation toxicity of aluminum phosphide is attributed to phosphine gas resulting
from decomposition of aluminum phosphide on contact with moisture in the air. Symptoms of phosphine poisoning include
restlessness, headache, dizziness, fatigue, chest tightness, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, stupor, coma, convulsions,
lowered blood pressure, pulmonary edema and respiratory failure; disorders of the kidney, liver, heart and brain
can also occur. In female CFT-Wistar rats exposed to phosphine gas generated from aluminum phosphide pellets in distilled
water, 100 percent mortality was observed after a 6&hyph;hour exposure to 40 ppm (0.1 mg/L), and exposure to 20 to 40
ppm (0.05 to 0.1 mg/L) for 6 hours resulted in 33 percent mortality. Symptoms of toxicity reported in these animals
included dyspnea, loss of muscular coordination, polyuria, and paralysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's exposure analysis indicates that aluminum phosphide concentrations are likely to exist beyond facility site

Boron trichloride
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (CAS No. 010294-34-5) (EPCRA EHS) (Ref. 8). Boron trichloride is corrosive to the skin and mucosal tissue due to its
rapid hydrolysis to hydrochloric acid and boric acid, the former acid being the corrosive species. Single, relatively
large doses of boron administered through any route affects the central nervous system causing depressed circulation,
diarrhea, vomiting, shock, and coma. The kidneys are the most severely affected organ. Symptoms of acute irritation
of the upper airways were observed in humans at exposure levels of greater than or equal to 0.004 mg/L. Inhalation of
0.48 mg/L of boron trichloride proved fatal to certain laboratory animals. Inhalation of 0.096 mg/L of boron trichloride
for 7 hours produced adverse effects on the respiratory tract, and weight loss. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's exposure analysis indicates that boron trichloride concentrations are likely to exist beyond facility site
boundaries, as a result of continuous, or frequently recurring releases, at levels that can reasonably be anticipated

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (CAS No. 007637-07-2) (EPCRA EHS) (Ref. 8). Boron trifluoride is a colorless gas that is corrosive to tissues due to
its rapid hydrolysis to hydrofluoric acid and boric acid. The principal acute effect in animals is irritation of the
mucous membranes of the respiratory tract and eyes; post mortem examination also revealed pneumonia and degenerative
changes in renal tubules. The kidneys are most severely affected because boric acid concentrates in this organ. Exposure
of six animal species to 0.28 mg/L of boron trifluoride for 4 to 7 hours a day, 5 days a week killed all animals within 30
days. Rats, rabbits, and guinea pigs were exposed to boron trifluoride via inhalation. Guinea pigs died of respiratory
failure after being exposed to 0.036 mg/L for 19 days; rats experienced fluorosis of the teeth at this concentration.
All three species were minimally affected at 0.004 mg/L. In a 2-week rat inhalation study, all animals died after 6
daily exposures to 0.18 mg/L. Rats exposed to 0.024 mg/L showed signs of respiratory irritation, increased lung weights,
and depressed liver weights. Rats exposed to 0.17 mg/L of boron trifluoride 6 hours/day, 5 days a week for 13 weeks developed
necrosis of the proximal tubular epithelium of the kidneys. Guinea pigs exposed to 0.035 mg/L, 7 hours/day, 5 days
a week for 3 months developed severe pneumonitis and pulmonary changes indicating chemical irritation.

 (CAS No. 007726-95-6) (EPCRA EHS) (Ref. 8). Rats fed bromine at a dose of 0.01 mg/kg/day for 6 months experienced changes
in their reflexes and blood indexes. Rats, mice, and rabbits inhaling 0.001 mg/kg/day for 4 months developed functional
abnormalities of the respiratory, nervous, and endocrine systems. Data on the acute and chronic effects of bromine
in humans are limited. Bromine is very corrosive to the eyes, skin, and mucous membranes in either the liquid or vapor
form. A concentration of 10 ppm of bromine in air is intolerable in humans, and can cause severe irritation of the upper
respiratory tract. Other clinical symptoms include neurologic, dermatologic, and gastrointestinal effects.
The maximum concentration allowable in humans for a 0.5 to 1-hour exposure to bromine is 4 ppm. Bromine can cause lacrimation
at concentrations less than 1 ppm. Chronic exposure to bromine (estimated concentration at 0.6 ppm) can result in
eye irritation, upper respiratory irritation, coughing, and headache. Neurological symptoms have also been reported
following chronic exposure to bromine.

 (CAS No. 035691-65-7) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a 3&hyph;month dietary study where rats were administered 83.5, 500,
and 3,000 ppm (4, 25, and 150 mg/kg/day) 1-bromo-1-(bromomethyl)-1,3-propanedicarbonitrile, a NOEL of 83.5 ppm
(4 mg/kg/day) and a LOEL of 500 ppm (25 mg/kg/day) were established (based on neonatal splenic hematopoiesis, decreased
parental body weight and food consumption, increased male urinary epithelial cells, amorphous casts, and crystals).
At 3,000 ppm (150 mg/kg/day) there was decreased lactase dehydrogenase, increased total cholesterol, total protein,
and albumin, elevated female organ-to-body weight ratio for thyroid, liver, spleen, ovaries, and pituitary. In
a 13-week dietary study in beagle dogs (administered 167, 1,000, and 4,000 ppm; 4, 25, and 100 mg/kg/day) the LOEL was
greater than 167 ppm (4 mg/kg/day) (increased male thyroid and female ovary organ to body weight ratio). At 1,000 ppm
(25 mg/kg/day), the same signs were seen as at 167 ppm (4 mg/kg/day), plus diarrhea and increased organ to body weight
ratio of thyroid, heart, liver, and adrenals. At 4,000 ppm (100 mg/kg/day), emesis and ataxia in males, decreased
body weight gain/food consumption, decreased hematocrit, hemoglobin, immature red blood cells, and alkaline phosphatase,
extramedullary hematopoiesis in the liver and spleen, thyroid enlargement with follicular cell hyperplasia, increased

exposure of dogs to 100 ppm (0.11 mg/L) carbon monoxide, 5.5 hours/day, 6 days/week, for 11 weeks. Some of the dogs showed
disturbances in gait and in postural and position reflexes. The toxicity of carbon monoxide results from its combination
with hemoglobin in the blood to form carboxyhemoglobin which is a poor oxygen carrier. Thus, oxygen delivery by the
blood is severely compromised, which leads to tissue hypoxia and possibly tissue poisoning, resulting in the toxic
effects (including death) known for this substance. Infants born to women who survive acute exposure to high concentrations
of carbon monoxide during pregnancy often display neurological sequelae and gross brain damage. Exposure of pregnant
rats to 150 ppm (0.17 mg/L) carbon monoxide caused reduced pup growth rate, and altered behavior (poor performance
on negative geotaxis and homing tests) in pups.

Carbon monoxide is regulated under Title I of the CAA (Provisions for Attainment and Maintenance of National Ambient
Air Quality Standards). In addition to this proposal to add carbon monoxide to EPCRA section 313, in Units IV.B.179.
and 235, EPA is proposing to add two other chemicals, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide, that are regulated under
Title I of the CAA. Sulfur dioxide is also regulated under Title IV of the CAA (Acid Deposition Control). Extensive
data, which are highly technical, are collected on these chemicals as required by the CAA. EPA requests comment on
the following: (1) Is the information collected under the CAA sufficient for public right-to-know purposes; and
(2) suggestions on how the data collected on these chemicals pursuant to CAA Titles I and IV could be used to meet the
purposes of EPCRA section 313.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (CAS No. 000075-72-9) (CAA OD) (Ref. 8). Chlorofluorocarbons, including chlorotrifluoromethane (CFC-13) are
known to release chlorine radicals into the stratosphere. Chlorine radicals act as catalysts to reduce the net amount
of stratospheric ozone. Stratospheric ozone shields the earth from ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation (i.e., 290 to
320 nanometers). Decreases in total column ozone will increase the percentage of UV-B radiation, especially at its
most harmful wavelengths, reaching the earth's surface.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exposure to UV-B radiation has been implicated by laboratory and epidemiologic studies as a cause of two types of nonmelanoma
skin cancers: squamous cell cancer and basal cell cancer. Studies predict that for every 1 percent increase in UV-B
radiation, nonmelanoma skin cancer cases would increase by about 1 to 3 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recent epidemiological studies, including large case control studies, suggest that UV-B radiation plays an important
role in causing malignant melanoma skin cancer. Recent studies predict that for each 1 percent change in UV-B intensity,
the incidence of melanoma could increase from 0.5 to 1 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Studies have demonstrated that UV-B radiation can suppress the immune response system in animals, and, possibly,
in humans. Increases in exposure to UV-B radiation are likely to increase the incidence of cataracts and could adversely
affect the retina.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aquatic organisms, particularly phytoplankton, zooplankton, and the larvae of many fishes, appear to be susceptible
to harm from increased exposure to UV-B radiation because they spend at least part of their time at or near the surface
of waters they inhabit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Increased UV-B penetration has been shown to result in adverse impacts on plants. Field studies on soybeans suggest
that yield reductions could occur in some cultivars of soybeans, while evidence from laboratory studies suggest
that two out of three cultivars are sensitive to UV-B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because this increased UV-B radiation can be reasonably anticipated to lead to cancer and other chronic human health

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (CAS No. 004170-30-3) (RCRA APP8) (Ref. 8). Crotonaldehyde has been tested for carcinogenicity in one animal study.
When crotonaldehyde was administered to male F344 rats at 0, 42, or 421 mg/L for 113 weeks, there was a statistically
significant increase in the incidence of hepatocellular neoplasms (benign and malignant combined) in the low dose
group. The lack of tumorigenic effects at the high-dose group is believed to be due to the hepatotoxicity observed
in this group. At high dose, crotonaldehyde is cytotoxic; cells died before neoplasms are manifested. Crotonaldehyde
and other alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyls are chemically reactive compounds which can readily react with cellular
macromolecules such as DNA and proteins. Mutagenicity studies in a slightly modified preincubation Ames test have
clearly shown that crotonaldehyde is mutagenic. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing crotonaldehyde

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (CAS No. 000120-36-5) (FIFRA SR; IARC) (Ref. 8). 2,4-DP (2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)propionic acid) is a 2,4-dichlorophenoxy-type
herbicide. Developmental toxicity has been reported in rats and mice administered oral doses of 2,4-DP as low as 20
mg/kg during gestation days 4 through 18. Behavioral changes and physical effects were observed in newborn rats,
while increased post-implantation loss was observed in the mothers. Exposure of mice to much higher doses (3,000
and 4,000 mg/kg) for shorter durations (i.e., gestation days 6 through 15) caused musculoskeletal abnormalities
and fetotoxicity.

of the colon, rectum, breast, stomach, and pancreas that is not amenable to surgery or irradiation. The major toxic
effects of fluorouracil are on the normal, rapidly proliferating tissues particularly of the bone marrow and lining
of the gastrointestinal tract. Leukopenia, predominantly of the granulocytopenic type, thrombocytopenia, and
anemia occur commonly with intravenous fluorouracil therapy at doses ranging from 6 to 12 mg/kg. Pancytopenia and
agranulocytosis also have occurred.

EPCRA section 313 requires threshold determinations for chemical categories to be based on the total of all chemicals
in the category manufactured, processed, or otherwise used. For example, a facility that manufactures three members
of a chemical category would count the total amount of all three chemicals manufactured towards the manufacturing

These diisocyanates represent a category of chemicals that may effect many organ systems. However, the primary toxicity
target for diisocyanates is the upper and lower respiratory tract resulting in chronic pulmonary irritation. Diisocyanates
are also known respiratory and dermal sensitizing agents. Both acute and chronic effects may result from acute or
chronic exposures. These effects may be immune- or non-immune mediated. EPA believes that diisocyanates should
be listed as a category because it is the isocyanate functionality that is responsible for the observed chronic pulmonary
irritation associated with exposures to members of this category. The other part of the molecule does not mitigate
to any large degree the observed toxic effects. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing diisocyanates
as a category on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available toxicity data for
members of the category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

EPA intends to maintain the individual listings for the three toluene diisocyanate compounds. In addition to the
effects discussed above, these compounds have been classified as probable carcinogens. EPA intends to continue
to individually list diisocyanates that are possible of probable carcinogens. Methylenebis(phenylisocyanate)
has not been shown to be a carcinogen and EPA is proposing to remove it as an individually listed chemical, and add it
to the diisocyanates category if the alternative proposal for creation of the category is finalized.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Hydrochlorofluorocarbons
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (CAA OD) (Ref. 8). Hydrochlorofluorocarbons are known to release chlorine radicals into the stratosphere. Chlorine
radicals act as catalysts to reduce the net amount of stratospheric ozone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stratospheric ozone shields the earth from ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation (i.e., 290 to 320 nanometers). Decreases
in total column ozone will increase the percentage of UV-B radiation, especially at its most harmful wavelengths,
reaching the earth's surface.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exposure to UV-B radiation has been implicated by laboratory and epidemiologic studies as a cause of two types of nonmelanoma
skin cancers: squamous cell cancer and basal cell cancer. Studies predict that for every 1 percent increase in UV-B
radiation, nonmelanoma skin cancer cases would increase by about 1 to 3 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recent epidemiological studies, including large case control studies, suggest that UV-B radiation plays an important
role in causing malignant melanoma skin cancer. Recent studies predict that for each 1 percent change in UV-B intensity,
the incidence of melanoma could increase from 0.5 to 1 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Studies have demonstrated that UV-B radiation can suppress the immune response system in animals, and, possibly,
in humans. Increases in exposure to UV-B radiation are likely to increase the incidence of cataracts and could adversely
affect the retina.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aquatic organisms, particularly phytoplankton, zooplankton, and the larvae of many fishes, appear to be susceptible
to harm from increased exposure to UV-B radiation because they spend at least part of their time at or near the surface
of waters they inhabit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Increased UV-B penetration has been shown to result in adverse impacts on plants. Field studies on soybeans suggest
that yield reductions could occur in some cultivars of soybeans, while evidence from laboratory studies suggest
that two out of three cultivars are sensitive to UV-B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because this increased UV-B radiation can be reasonably anticipated to lead to cancer and other chronic human health
effects and significant adverse environmental effects, EPA believes there is sufficient evidence for listing the
following HCFCs that are commercially viable on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA sections 313(d)(2)(B) and (C).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (CAS No. 000078-59-1) (CAA HAP) (Ref. 7). Isophorone has been shown to cause neurotoxic effects in humans exposed
to atmospheric concentrations of 5 to 8 ppm. After being exposed for 1 month, workers complained of fatigue and malaise.
Neurotoxicity was also observed in humans following acute exposure. At 40 to 85 ppm, effects included nausea, headache,
dizziness, faintness, inebriation, and a feeling of suffocation. Increasing exposure concentrations resulted
in increasing severity of symptoms. Irritation and central nervous system (CNS) depression were observed at concentrations
of 200 to 400 ppm. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing isophorone on EPCRA section 313 pursuant
to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available neurotoxicity data for this chemical.

 (50 percent reduction in respiratory rate) values are 0.0046 mg/L and 0.0019 mg/L, respectively. A 50&hyph;year
old man developed severe asthma after exposure to an unspecified amount of paint containing isophorone diisocyanate.
A 1&hyph;hour exposure to an unspecified amount of the compound caused eczema in three out of four workers. In addition,
isocyanates as a class are generally severe skin, eye and respiratory irritants. EPA's exposure analysis indicates
that isophorone diisocyanate concentrations are likely to exist beyond facility site boundaries, as a result of
continuous, or frequently recurring releases, at levels that can reasonably be anticipated to cause significant
adverse acute human health effects. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing isophorone diisocyanate
on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A) based on the available acute toxicity and exposure data
for this chemical. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As detailed in Unit IV.B.132. of this preamble, as an alternative proposal to the individual listing of HDI, isophorone
diisocyanate, and 1,1-methylene bis(4-isocyanatocyclohexane), EPA is proposing to create a diisocyanates category

Lactofen (5-(2-chloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy)-2-nitro-2-ethoxy-1-methyl-2-oxoethyl ester)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (CAS No. 077501-63-4) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Lactofen meets the criteria of an EPA Group B2 compound, i.e., a probable
human carcinogen. This conclusion was based on an increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas in males and
combined incidence of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in both sexes of CD-1 mice following dietary administration
of lactofen. In CD rats, there was increased incidence of liver neoplastic nodules in both sexes. Four structurally
similar chemicals, acifluorfen, nitrofen, oxyfluorfen, and fomesafen, all produced hepatocellular tumors in
rodents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Results of several subchronic and chronic studies indicated the liver and kidney as target organs for lactofen. Increased
absolute and relative liver weight and hepatocytomegaly (the LOEL was 1.5 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was not determined)
were observed in male mice fed lactofen for 78 weeks. At 37.5 mg/kg/day, there was also an increased incidence of cataracts
and renal pigmentation. Based on the LOEL, an oral RfD of 0.002 mg/kg/day was derived. Renal dysfunction and decreased
hemoglobin and hematocrit levels and red blood cell counts (the LOEL was 25/75 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 5 mg/kg/day)
were observed in a 1&hyph;year feeding study in dogs. Increased renal and hepatic pigmentation (the LOEL was 50 mg/kg/day;
the NOEL was 25 mg/kg/day) were noted in a 2&hyph;year feeding study in rats. In a 90&hyph;day mouse study, increased
alkaline phosphatase, serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT), and serum gleutanic pyruvic transaminase
(SGPT) activities, increased liver weight, hepatic necrosis, biliary hyperplasia, decreased hematocrit and hemoglobin
levels and red blood cell counts, extramedullary hematopoiesis, and kidney nephrosis and fibrosis (the LOEL was
26 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was not determined) were seen. Decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, decreased red
blood cell counts, and brown pigment in the kidney and liver (the LOEL was 50 mg/kg/day) were noted in a 90&hyph;day
feeding study in rats. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Linuron
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (CAS No. 000330-55-2) (FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). The appearance of sulfhemoglobin in the blood of dogs, rats, or mice exposed
to linuron has been reported. In fact, available animal data from feeding studies of various durations (30 days to
2 years) with linuron as well as from studies with structurally similar urea-based herbicides indicate that the presence
of sulfhemoglobin (abnormal blood pigment) and morphological changes in red blood cells provide the most sensitive
indicator of exposure to linuron. In a 2&hyph;year feeding study with beagle dogs, the LOAEL, based on the presence
of the sulfhemoglobin, was 0.625 mg/kg/day. This was the lowest dose tested. Red blood cell counts were decreased
in dogs exposed to higher doses of linuron. EPA has derived an oral RfD of 0.002 mg/kg/day for linuron from this study.
Similar findings were reported in two separate 2&hyph;year rat feeding studies. In one of these studies, the LOAEL
was 31.25 mg/kg/day and the NOAEL was 6.25 mg/kg/day. These values were based on spleen and bone marrow changes indicative
of hemolysis, and an increase in mortality and growth retardation. In the other 2&hyph;year rat study, a LOAEL of 2.5
mg/kg/day (the lowest dose tested) was based on decreased red blood cell counts and reticulocytosis. Elevated sulfhemoglobin
levels were reported in rats exposed for as little as 30 days to 150 mg/kg/day. This exposure level also caused severe
growth retardation and increased mortality. The LOAEL for decreased body weight gain was 15 mg/kg/day and the NOAEL
was 3 mg/kg/day. Chronic administration of linuron at 4 mg/kg/day to rats caused hypochromic anemia, decreased cholinesterase
and peroxidase activities in the blood.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A LOAEL of 31.25 mg/kg/day was established in a 3&hyph;generation reproductive toxicity study in which linuron (in
the diet) caused reduced weanling weights, reduced liver and kidney weights, liver atrophy, and reduced pup survival.
In a separate developmental toxicity study in rats administered linuron orally, a LOAEL of 31.25 mg/kg/day was based
on an increased incidence of fetal resorptions. The LOAEL for maternal toxicity in this study was 6.25 mg/kg/day (NOAEL
2.50 mg/kg/day), and was based on decreased food consumption and decreased body weight gain. An oral teratology study
in rabbits indicated a LOAEL of 5 mg/kg/day (lowest dose tested) based on decreased fetal body weight, decreased litter
size and an increase in skull malformations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing linuron on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section
313(d)(2)(B) based on the hematological and developmental toxicity data for this chemical.

 (CAS No. 000554-13-2) (CAL) (Ref. 8). A major use of lithium carbonate is in the treatment of manic episodes of manic-depressive
illness. Decreases in the number of implantations, number of live fetuses and fetal body weight, and increases in
resorptions and various limb/skeletal anomalies were reported in the offspring of Wistar rats that received 100
mg/kg (the fetotoxic LOEL; the fetotoxic NOEL was 50 mg/kg) during gestation days 6 through 15. Offspring of mice that
received 465 mg/kg/day during gestation days 6 through 15 had increased craniofacial abnormalities. Fetal death
and reductions in litter size were also noted. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing lithium
carbonate on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental toxicity
data for this chemical.

Malathion
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (CAS No. 000121-75-5) (CERCLA) (Ref. 8). Malathion is a phosphorothioate insecticide. Its insecticidal properties
are due to cholinesterase inhibition. A 42&hyph;year old woman ingested a minimum of 120 ml of a 50 percent solution
(approximately 850 mg/kg). She quickly became comatose, cyanotic, flaccid, devoid of tendon reflexes, and miotic.
Her serum cholinesterase activity was 22 percent of normal for 9 days and her red blood cell cholinesterase activity
was 10 to 25 percent of normal for 45 days. Thirty-five cases of poisoning by ingestion were reported in India. The symptoms
observed were cyanosis, excess salivation, pinpoint pupils, pulmonary edema, and electrocardiographic abnormalities;
all of which are indicative of cholinesterase inhibition. Autopsy of the fatalities indicated damage to the myocardium.
In a 56&hyph;day study in which men were orally administered malathion, the NOEL for neurotoxic effects was 0.23 mg/kg/day
and the LOEL was 0.34 mg/kg/day. Plasma and red blood cell cholinesterase inhibition was observed at 0.34 mg/kg/day;
however, no clinical signs of overt toxicity were noted at this dose. Based on the NOEL, EPA has derived an oral RfD of
0.02 mg/kg/day for this chemical. Cholinesterase inhibition symptoms have also been observed in experimental animals
exposed to malathion. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing malathion on EPCRA section 313 pursuant
to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the chronic neurotoxicity data for this chemical.

Man-made mineral fibers category
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (CAA HAP) (Ref. 7). Man-made mineral fibers are synthetic, amorphous (noncrystalline) fibers which consist of three
major groups: Glass fibers; mineral wool fibers (which includes mainly rock wool and slag wool); and refractory ceramic
fibers. Health concerns for these fibers are based on the morphological and toxicologic similarities with asbestos,
a known human carcinogen, causing lung cancer and mesotheliomas in humans and non-malignant respiratory diseases
(e.g. lung fibrosis). Injection studies, in which glass wool and glass microfibers were directly placed into the
respiratory airways, the pleural or abdominal cavities of laboratory animals, have shown consistent evidence of
carcinogenesis. Experimental studies have shown evidence of carcinogenesis by injection of rock wool and slag wool.
IARC has classified glass wool, rock wool, and slag wool fibers as Group 2B compounds, i.e., possible human carcinogens.
EPA has classified refractory ceramic fibers as Group B2 compounds, i.e., probable human carcinogen. EPA believes
that there is sufficient evidence for listing man-made mineral fibers as a category on EPCRA section 313 pursuant
to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available carcinogenicity data for these fibers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPCRA section 313 requires threshold determinations for chemical categories to be based on the total of all chemicals
in the category manufactured, processed, or otherwise used. For example, a facility that manufactures three members
of a chemical category would count the total amount of all three chemicals manufactured towards the manufacturing
threshold for that category. When filing reports for chemical categories, the releases are determined in the same
manner as the thresholds. One report is filed for the category and all releases are reported on this form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA considered a number of options for listing man-made mineral fibers on EPCRA section 313. In 1977, the National
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommended that exposures to fibers be limited to 3 fibers
per cubic centimeters (f/cc) for fibers that are less than 3.5 micrometers in diameter and longer than 10 micrometers
in length. NIOSH has since commented that in order to protect workers from lung cancer it will be necessary to lower
the exposure to 0.2 f/cc for fibrous glass. In 1992, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) proposed
a 1 f/cc 8&hyph;hour time-weighted average (TWA) limit for respirable fibers of fibrous glass, including refractory
ceramic fibers. Respirable fibers are generally defined as fibers with a diameter of less than 3.5 micrometers whose
length is at least 3 times the diameter (i.e., an aspect ratio (fiber length divided by fiber diameter) of 3 or greater).
In order to ease the burden of reporting, EPA considered listing fibers based on an aspect ratio that simply discriminates
between particles and fibers. This, however, seemed to be overly inclusive in that it would cover nonrespirable as
well as respirable fibers. EPA also considered using a diameter criteria without an aspect ratio but this option also
appears to be too inclusive since it may include particles as well as fibers. EPA is proposing to list man-made mineral
fibers as a category that includes glass microfibers, glass wool fibers, rock wool fibers, slag wool fibers, and refractory
ceramic fibers that have a diameter less than 3.5 micrometers and an aspect ratio greater than 3. This definition is
consistent with both the NIOSH and OSHA recommendations and is limited to fibers that are respirable. EPA requests
comment on this definition of man-made mineral fibers and any other options for defining a fibers category.

IARC has assigned mecoprop to Group 2B, i.e., it is possibly carcinogenic to humans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In several animal studies, changes in liver or kidney weights were the most sensitive indicators of mecoprop toxicity.
In a 90&hyph;day rat feeding study, the LOAEL was 9 mg/kg/day and the NOAEL was 3 mg/kg/day. At 26 mg/kg/day, the changes
in organ weights were accompanied by decreased glucose levels in males and increased creatinine levels in females.
EPA has derived an oral RfD of 0.001 mg/kg/day from this study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

range from 240 to 470 ppb. The 60-day MATC for rainbow trout range from 41 to 78 ppb. EPA's exposure analysis indicates
that releases of 2-mercaptobenzothiazole will result in concentration levels that can reasonably be anticipated
to cause significant adverse environmental effects. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing

Merphos
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (CAS No. 000150-50-5) (FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). Merphos is a thiophosphate-type cholinesterase inhibitor. Delayed neurotoxic
effects have been reported in a 28-year old man following accidental exposure to the chemical over a period of 3 days.
Fourteen days later, he developed complete facial diplegia and decreased conduction velocity in his nerve fibers.
He recovered completely. Both immediate and delayed neurotoxic effects following exposure to merphos have been
reported in experimental animals. In a 3&hyph;month hen feeding study the NOEL for neurotoxic effects was 0.1 mg/kg/day
and the LOEL was 0.5 mg/kg/day. At 0.5 mg/kg, hens showed delayed neurotoxicity, ataxia, and equivocal changes in
the spinal cord and peripheral nerves. Based on the NOEL, EPA derived an oral RfD of 0.00003 mg/kg/day for this chemical.
In a 112-day rat feeding study, females showed red blood cell cholinesterase inhibition at the LOEL of 0.25 mg/kg/day.
The NOEL was 0.1 mg/kg/day. In a 90&hyph;day rat feeding study, animals showed reduced brain cholinesterase activity
at the LOEL of 3.8 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 1.8 mg/kg/day. In a 90&hyph;day dog feeding study, plasma cholinesterase
inhibition was observed at the LOEL of 2.5 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 0.75 mg/kg/day. Fourteen cattle and 20 sheep administered
single doses of merphos (25 to 200 mg/kg) or 10 daily doses of merphos (2.5 mg/kg/day) showed emaciation, diarrhea,
and depression of blood cholinesterase. Ingested merphos is rapidly metabolized to n-butyl mercaptan within the
gastrointestinal tract. n-Butyl mercaptan has been shown to be responsible for the acute neurotoxic effects of merphos.
Thus, oral exposure to merphos is expected to cause acute neurotoxic symptoms while dermal exposure to merphos is
expected to cause delayed neurotoxic symptoms. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing merphos
on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the chronic neurotoxicity data for this chemical.

 (CAS No. 000137-42-8) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Postimplanatation loss was observed in rabbits administered metham sodium
at 30 mg/kg/day (LOEL) on days 6 to 18 of gestation. The NOEL was 10 mg/kg/day (4.2 mg/kg/day based on active ingredient).
In rats fed metham sodium, increased variations, retardations, and anomalies were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day

concentrations are likely to exist beyond facility site boundaries, as a result of continuous, or frequently recurring
releases, at levels that can reasonably be anticipated to cause significant adverse acute human health effects.
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing 1,1-methylenebis(4-isocyanatocyclohexane) on EPCRA

As detailed in Unit IV.B.132. of this preamble, as an alternative proposal to the individual listing of HDI, isophorone
diisocyanate, and 1,1-methylene bis(4-isocyanatocyclohexane), EPA is proposing to create a diisocyanates category
that includes HDI, isophorone diisocyanate, 1,1-methylene bis(4-isocyanatocyclohexane), and 16 other diisocyanates.

 (CAL; CERCLA; EPCRA EHS; FIFRA AI; RCRA APP8; RCRA P) (Ref. 8). Nicotine salts will dissociate in aqueous solutions
to yield soluble nicotine. Nicotine is highly toxic in humans. The estimated lethal oral dose in adults is approximately
40 to 60 mg. The onset of toxicity is rapid. Symptoms include nausea, salivation, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea,
headache, weakness, sweating, and confusion. Nicotine markedly stimulates the central nervous system, causing
tremors and convulsions. The stimulation is followed by depression, and death resulting from paralysis of respiratory
muscles. Nicotine can also activate parasympathetic ganglia and cholinergic nerve endings resulting in gastrointestinal
hyperactivity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Skeletal defects and occasional cleft palates were observed in mice injected with 25 mg/kg nicotine on gestation
days 9 to 11. Reduced size in the newborn of rats and limb deformities in the offspring of swine were reported in swine
and rats following oral exposure to 1,058 ppm nicotine (approximately 53 mg/kg/day). Deformities were found in some
rabbit fetuses when dams were administered nicotine at a dose of 20 mg/kg 5 times during pregnancy. Pregnant swine
fed aqueous leaf extracts of tobacco at the rate of 16 and 32 mg/kg nicotine produced arthrogrypotic newborn pigs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing nicotine and its salts as a category on EPCRA section 313
pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the developmental toxicity data for these substances. EPCRA section
313 requires threshold determinations for chemical categories to be based on the total of all chemicals in the category
manufactured, processed, or otherwise used. For example, a facility that manufactures three members of a chemical
category would count the total amount of all three chemicals manufactured towards the manufacturing threshold for
that category. When filing reports for chemical categories, the releases are determined in the same manner as the
thresholds. One report if filed for the category and all releases are reported on this form.

). Infantile methemoglobinemia occurs in human infants exposed to aqueous solutions of nitrate ion and can progress
to cyanosis and death. Based on numerous epidemiological and clinical studies, EPA has determined a LOAEL of 1.8 to
3.2 mg/kg/day and a NOAEL and RfD of 1.6 mg/kg/day, corresponding to 10 mg/L nitrate-nitrogen or 44 mg/L nitrate ion
in drinking water. Infants weighing an average of 4 kg (0 to 3 months of age) are the most sensitive population to nitrate-induced
methemoglobinemia. This is primarily due to their higher stomach pH which favors the growth of nitrate-reducing
bacteria, the immaturity of their metabolic enzyme systems, and reduced capacity of their erythrocytes to reduce
methemoglobin to hemoglobin. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing nitrate ion on EPCRA section
313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hematological toxicity data for this chemical.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In nitrogen-limited waters, nitrates have the potential to cause increased algal growth leading to eutrophication
in the aquatic environment. (Nitrate-nitrogen is the form of nitrogen most available to plants.) Studies of estuarine
water at several locations along the eastern coast of the United States have indicated that low concentrations of
dissolved nitrogen (e.g., nitrate) limit primary production of plants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additions of nitrate to such estuarine systems stimulate primary production of plants and can produce changes in
the dominant species of plants, leading to cultural eutrophication and ultimately to deterioration of water quality,
including algal blooms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been determined that lakes with a spring maximum concentration of more than 300 ug/L of inorganic nitrogen (e.g.,
nitrates) could be expected to have algal nuisances in the summer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toxic effects result from oxygen depletion as the algae die and decay. Toxic effects have also been related to the release
of decay products or direct excretion of toxic substances from sources such as blue-green algae. EPA believes that
there is sufficient evidence for listing nitrate ion on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C)
based on the available environmental toxicity data.

 (CAS No. 010102-43-9) (CERCLA; EPCRA EHS; RCRA APP8; RCRA P) (Ref. 8). The acute toxicity of nitric oxide has been rated
high. Nitric oxide causes death or permanent injury after very short exposure to small quantities. Exposure to nitric
oxide can result in acute and chronic changes of the pulmonary system including pulmonary edema, pneumonitis, bronchitis,
bronchiolitis, emphysema, and methemoglobinemia. Neurologic effects (fatigue, restlessness, anxiety, mental
confusion, lethargy, loss of consciousness) have also been reported. The effects of nitric oxide may be related to
the formation of methemoglobin. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing nitric oxide on EPCRA

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (CAS No. 010102-44-0) (CERCLA; EPCRA EHS; RCRA APP8; RCRA P) (Ref. 8). Acid precipitation occurs in large regions
of the Eastern United States and Canada, Europe, and Japan. This widespread occurrence of acid precipitation and
dry deposition results in large part from man-made emissions of oxides of sulfur and nitrogen (e.g., nitrogen dioxide).
These substances are transformed in the atmosphere into sulfuric acid and nitric acid, transported over great distances
and deposited on vegetation, soils, surface waters, and materials. These substances are transferred from the atmosphere
into ecosystems by the absorption of gases, the impaction and gravitational settling of fine aerosols and coarse
particles, and precipitation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Acids contained in polluted snow are released as contaminated meltwater. The resulting release of pollutants can
cause major or rapid changes in the acidity of streams and lake waters. Interference with normal reproduction in fish
populations is induced by acidity of lake and stream waters. Reproduction of frogs and salamanders is also inhibited
by atmospheric acidification of surface waters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Atmospheric deposition of sulfuric acid and nitric acid can cause serious damage to crops and forests. Biological
effects include induction of necrotic lesions, loss of nutrients due to leaching from foliar organs, accelerated
erosion of waxes and leaf surfaces, and interference with normal reproductive processes. Acidification also decreases
the rate of many soil processes such as nitrogen fixation and the breakdown of organic matter.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Phosphoric acid, as well as other phosphates, have the potential to cause increased algal growth leading to eutrophication
in the aquatic environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eutrophication may result when nutrients, especially phosphates, enter into an aquatic ecosystem in the presence
of sunlight and nitrogen. The phosphate ion is a plant nutrient, which can be a major limiting factor for plant growth
in freshwater environments. In excess, phosphates can cause algal blooms. Toxic effects result from oxygen depletion
as the algae die and decay. Toxic effects have also been related to the release of decay products or direct excretion
of toxic substances from sources such as blue-green algae.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Laboratory studies indicate that eutrophication may occur at phosphate concentrations as low as 50 ppb in lakes.
The resulting oxygen depletion and toxic decay products (e.g., hydrogen sulfide) kill many invertebrates and fish.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although green algae are more sensitive to growth stimulation by phosphates in fresh water, blue-green algal blooms
may cause greater damage. At least three species of blue-green algae are known to excrete toxins. Secretion by cyanobacteria
of dyalyzable metabolites have inhibited the growth of other species of algae and may result in algal monoculture.
When algal blooms of these toxic species occur in a reservoir, lake, slough, or pond, the cells and toxins can become
sufficiently concentrated to cause illness or death in invertebrates and vertebrates. Major losses have been reported
for cattle, sheep, hogs, birds (domestic or wild) and fishes, minor losses for dogs, horses, small wild animals, amphibians,
and invertebrates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eutrophication may occur in slow moving rivers, but is less likely in swift rivers where rapid mixing occurs. Light
is the most important limiting factor because rivers are murkier than lakes thus, the chances of eutrophication in
swift rivers are slight. However, lakes and reservoirs collect phosphates from influent streams and store a fraction
of them within consolidated sediments, thus serving as a phosphate sink.

Pirimiphos methyl (O-(2-(diethylamino)-6-methyl-4-pyrimidinyl)-O,O-dimethyl phosphorothioate)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (CAS No. 029232-93-7) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Pirimiphos methyl is a cholinesterase inhibitor in humans and other mammalian
species. A mild and transient decrease in plasma cholinesterase activity was observed in 2 of 4 female humans given
pirimiphos methyl daily in a capsule at dose levels of 0.25 mg/kg/day for 56 days. This effect was not seen in 3 of 3 males.
The dose level of 0.25 mg/kg/day was considered a NOEL for plasma cholinesterase inhibition. Based on the NOEL, an
oral RfD of 0.01 mg/kg/day was derived. The findings of the 56&hyph;day study were corroborated by the 28&hyph;day
feeding study (capsule) with 5 male human volunteers where 1 individual showed borderline cholinesterase depression.
Inhibition of brain cholinesterase (LOEL was 0.5 mg/kg/day, the NOEL for cholinesterase inhibition was not determined)
was observed in a 2&hyph;year feeding study in dogs. Inhibition of plasma cholinesterase activity (the LOEL was 2.5
mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 0.5 mg/kg/day) was seen in a 2&hyph;year feeding study in rats. No clinical signs were reported
for the above studies. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing pirimiphos methyl on EPCRA section

Polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (CAS No. NA) (CAA HAP) (Ref. 7). Polycyclic aromatic compounds are a class of chemicals that include polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons, azapolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, thio-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, nitroarenes, and
others. PACs can be formed in any combustion process that involves the burning of fuels or, more generally, materials
containing carbon and hydrogen. Some industrial sources include coke ovens, catalytic cracking of crude oil, carbon
black production, and iron and steel processes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Materials containing mixtures of PACs have been shown to be carcinogenic. Several epidemiology studies have shown
increased mortality due to lung cancer in humans exposed to coke-oven emissions, roofing-tar emissions, and cigarette
smoke. Each of these mixtures contains benzo(a)pyrene, benzo(a)anthracene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(a)phenanthrene,
and dibenzo(a,h)anthracene as well as other potentially carcinogenic PACs and other carcinogenic and potentially
carcinogenic chemicals, tumor promotors, initiators, and co-carcinogens such as nitrosoamines, coal tar pitch,
and creosote. Although it is impossible to evaluate the contribution of any individual PAC to the total carcinogenicity
of these mixtures to humans, reports of this nature provide qualitative evidence of the potential for mixtures containing
PACs to cause cancer in humans. In addition, several PACs caused cancer in animals when orally (e.g., benz(a)anthracene,
benzo(a)pyrene, dibenz(a,h)anthracene), dermally (e.g., benz(a)anthracene, benzo(a)phenanthrene, benzo(b)fluoranthene,
benzo(a)pyrene, dibenz(a,h)anthracene, and indeno (1,2,3-cd)pyrene) or inhalationally (e.g., benzo(a)pyrene)
exposed. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing these PACs on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA
section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available carcinogenicity data for these chemicals. EPA is proposing to create

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene (CAS No. 000193-39-5)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These PACs were proposed for listing individually in EPA's response to a petition to add certain chemicals that appear
on the RCRA list of toxic wastes under 40 CFR 261.33(f) to EPCRA section 313 (57 FR 41020, September 8, 1992). These chemicals
were proposed for addition based on the available carcinogenicity data. Due to the similarities of these seven PACs
to the chemicals listed in Unit IV.B.207.a. through IV.B.207.u. of this preamble, EPA believes that these chemicals
should be added to EPCRA section 313 as part of the delineated PAC category rather than listed individually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPCRA section 313 requires threshold determinations for chemical categories to be based on the total of all chemicals
in the category manufactured, processed, or otherwise used. For example, a facility that manufactures three members
of a chemical category would count the total amount of all three chemicals manufactured towards the manufacturing
threshold for that category. When filing reports for chemical categories the releases are determined in the same
manner as the thresholds. One report is filed for the category and all releases are reported on this form. In the case
of the delimited PAC category, only the 28 chemicals listed above would be included for purposes of making the threshold
determinations and in filing reports on releases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Clean Air Act Amendments section 112(b) Hazardous Air Pollutants list includes a listing for polycyclic organic
matter (POM) that includes PACs. The definition given for the POM category is broad and chemically non-specific and
may be delineated by test method. For the purpose of listing under EPCRA section 313, EPA considered the following
more chemically-specific definition for a PAC category: ``includes all chemical species from the polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbon, aza-polycyclic, thio-polycyclic, or nitroarene families where polycyclic means three or more fused
rings. More specifically, it means any combination of three or more fused six or five membered hydrocarbon rings with
at least two or more rings being aromatic. The structure may contain fused non-aromatic five-membered rings, a ring
nitrogen, a ring sulfur, one or more attached nitro groups, or one or more attached alkyl groups.'' As an alternative
to the delimited category, EPA is proposing to add a PAC category based on this broad definition. Although this definition
may include chemicals of low or no concern, it may be less of a burden for facilities to report their total PACs rather
than trying to determine which and how much of the specific PACs covered by the delimited category they are producing
and releasing. EPA requests comment on the addition of the delimited PACs category versus the alternative PAC category
based on the broader definition. 208.

A case study reported a deliberate ingestion of an unspecified dose of sodium fluroacetate by a healthy female. The
woman experienced nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain 30 minutes after ingestion, with subsequent seizures occurring
60 minutes after the initial onset of symptoms. Neurological examination after 2 weeks revealed severe cerebellar
dysfunction. By 18 months, memory disturbances and depressive behavior persisted. Inhalation exposure to unspecified
levels of sodium fluoroacetate caused salivation, loss of speech, violent convulsions, and coma in a male worker.
The patient ultimately recovered. Neurological effects have also been reported in rats in a 13&hyph;week oral study.
Four of 20 female rats treated with 0.50 mg/kg/day (the highest dose tested) exhibited convulsions at day 79, with
no recurrences for the remainder of the study. An estimated lethal dose of sodium fluoroacetate in humans ranges from
5 to 10 mg/kg.

Sodium nitrite
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (CAS No. 007632-00-0) (CERCLA) (Ref. 8). Sodium nitrite causes conversion (oxidation) of hemoglobin to methemoglobin.
Methemoglobin cannot combine reversibly with oxygen and its formation can cause anemic hypoxia which may lead to
intense cyanosis. Infants are particularly susceptible to this effect because of their higher stomach pH, immature
enzyme systems, the reduced capacity of newborn erythrocytes to reduce methemoglobin to hemoglobin, and the increased
rate of nitrite-induced oxidation of fetal hemoglobin to methemoglobin (approximately twice the rate of adult hemoglobin
oxidation). Coma and methemoglobinemia/ carboxyhemoglobinemia were reported in a human that received sodium nitrite
(71 mg/kg) orally. In animal studies, methemoglobinemia was reported in dogs that received an intravenous dose of
30 mg/kg sodium nitrite and in rats administered a 10 mg/kg dose of sodium nitrite subcutaneously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fetotoxicity (fetal death) was reported following oral exposure of pregnant rats to sodium nitrite (30 mg/kg/day)

Strychnine and salts

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (CERCLA; EPCRA EHS; FIFRA SR; RCRA APP8; RCRA P) (Ref. 8). Strychnine salts will dissociate in aqueous solutions to
yield soluble strychnine. Strychnine, an alkaloid, can cause violent convulsions in humans. Other effects include
agitation, hypertonicity of muscles, and painful muscle spasms. Renal failure and respiratory paralysis generally
ensues, from severe or prolonged convulsions. A potentially lethal oral dose in a small child is 5 to 10 mg. The lethal
oral dose for an adult may be as low as 30 mg. Similar effects have also been reported in animals exposed at lethal doses
ranging from 0.25 to 2.35 mg/kg via oral and parenteral routes of exposure. EPA's exposure analysis indicates that
strychnine and strychnine salts concentrations are likely to exist beyond facility site boundaries, as a result
of continuous, or frequently recurring releases, at levels that can reasonably be anticipated to cause significant
adverse acute human health effects. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing strychnine and salts
as a category on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A) based on the available acute toxicity and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPCRA section 313 requires threshold determinations for chemical categories to be based on the total of all chemicals
in the category manufactured, processed, or otherwise used. For example, a facility that manufactures three members
of a chemical category would count the total amount of all three chemicals manufactured towards the manufacturing
threshold for that category. When filing reports for chemical categories, the releases are determined in the same
manner as the thresholds. One report if filed for the category and all releases are reported on this form.

 (CAS No. 007446-09-5) (CERCLA; EPCRA EHS) (Ref. 8). Acid precipitation occurs in large regions of the Eastern United
States and Canada, Europe, and Japan. This widespread occurrence of acid precipitation and dry deposition results
in large part from man-made emissions of oxides of sulfur (e.g., sulfur dioxide) and oxides of nitrogen. These substances
are transformed in the atmosphere into sulfuric acid and nitric acid, transported over great distances and deposited
on vegetation, soils, surface waters, and materials. These substances are transferred from the atmosphere into
ecosystems by the absorption of gases, the impaction and gravitational settling of fine aerosols and coarse particles
and, precipitation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Acids contained in polluted snow are released as contaminated meltwater. The resulting release of pollutants can
cause major or rapid changes in the acidity of streams and lake waters. Interference with normal reproduction in fish

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (CAS No. 003383-96-8) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Temephos is a cholinesterase inhibitor in many mammalian species. The
LOELs at which the cholinesterase inhibition was observed ranged from 0.3 to 10 mg/kg/day. However, human subjects
that ingested 256 mg/day for 5 days or 64 mg/day for 4 weeks showed no clinical signs or effects on plasma or red blood
cell cholinesterase activities. Dietary exposure of rats to 350 mg/kg/day for 90 days resulted in cholinesterase
inhibition only; no clinical signs were reported. Rabbits and guinea pigs tolerated 10 mg/kg/day for extended periods
without clinical effects, and dogs tolerated 3 to 4 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested. EPA believes that there is

Tetracycline hydrochloride
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (CAS No. 000064-75-5) (CAL) (Ref. 8). Tetracycline hydrochloride is widely used as an antibiotic for the treatment
of many common infections. The average oral adult dose for most infections is 1 to 2 grams per day in equally divided
doses. The most frequent adverse reactions to orally administered tetracycline hydrochloride are gastrointestinal
effects including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bulky loose stools, and abdominal discomfort. Photosensitivity,
manifested as an exaggerated sunburn reaction on sun-exposed areas of the body has occurred following oral therapy
with tetracycline hydrochloride. Photosensitivity reactions of this type generally develop within a few minutes
to several hours after sun exposure and usually persist 1 to 2 days after discontinuance of tetracycline hydrochloride.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers of tetracycline hydrochloride state that this substance should not be used in women during the last
half of pregnancy or in children younger than 8 years of age unless other appropriate drugs are ineffective or contraindicated.
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that tetracycline hydrochloride be used only in children who are 9
years of age or older, except under unusual circumstances. Use of tetracycline hydrochloride in pregnant women or
infants has resulted in retardation of skeletal development and bone growth in the fetus or child. Because tetracycline
hydrochloride localizes in the dentin and enamel of developing teeth, use of this substance during tooth development
may cause enamel hypoplasia and permanent yellow-gray to brown discoloration of the teeth. Use of tetracycline hydrochloride
may result in discoloration of the deciduous teeth of children if the substance is used during pregnancy or in children
up to 4 to 6 months of age. These effects are most common following long-term use of tetracycline hydrochloride but
have occured following repeated short-term use. Premature infants treated with tetracycline have demonstrated
a 40 percent depression of bone growth. This effect is readily reversible if exposure to the substance is short. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Intraperitoneal injection of 85 mg/kg/day on days 14 to 18 of gestation has resulted in abortion and extra embryonic
structures in rat offspring. Subcutaneous injection of 48 mg/kg/day on days 16 through 20 of gestation and intramuscular
injection of 40 mg/kg/day to rats on days 10 through 15 of gestation resulted in embryo/fetotoxicity. Exposure to
50 mg/kg/day on days 7 to 15 of pregnancy resulted in postimplantation loss and fetotoxicity in rats. Exposure to 85
mg/kg/day on days 7 to 15 of pregnancy resulted in abortion in rats. Fetotoxicity was observed in mice receiving 86
mg/kg/day of tetracycline hydrochloride on days 8 to 13 of gestation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (CAS No. 002303-17-5) (FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). Triallate, a dithiocarbamate insecticide, is a cholinesterase inhibitor.
When triallate was administered to rats at a dose of 147.1 mg/kg/day orally and to cats at a dose of 0.028 mg/L/day (via
aerosol) for 2 months, the animals developed fatal morphological changes in neurons of the cerebral cortex, subcortical
area, cerebellum, and spinal cord. Doses of 30 mg/kg/day caused head bobbing and circling in pregnant rats. The NOEL
was 7.5 mg/kg/day. The LOEL and NOEL for liver effects in a 2&hyph;year study in dogs fed diets containing triallate
were 4.25 mg/kg/day and 1.28 mg/kg/day, respectively. At 4.25 mg/kg/day an increase in hemosiderin deposition and
serum alkaline phosphatase was observed in both sexes, and an increase in liver weight was observed in females. Based
on the NOEL, an oral RfD of 0.013 mg/kg/day was derived. In a hamster chronic feeding study, decreased triglycerides

Vinclozolin (3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-5-ethenyl-5-methyl-2,4-oxazolidinedione)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (CAS No. 050471-44-8) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). The results of a 3&hyph;month feeding study in Wistar rats administered
4,500 ppm (225 mg/kg/day; the only dose tested) indicate that vinclozolin interacts with numerous steroid hormones
in male and female animals. A broad spectrum of steroid hormones were affected in these animals, including increases
in adrenocorticotropic hormone, lutenizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, testosterone, corticosterone,
aldosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone and slight decreases in estradiol levels in males. Female rats had elevated
adrenocorticotropic hormone and luteinizing levels and depressed corticosterone and aldosterone levels, while
follicle stimulating hormone, testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone and estradiol levels were comparable to
controls. After a 2&hyph;month recovery period postdosing, all male hormone levels were normal except for a slight
elevation in FSH, and all female hormone levels were normal except for a slight elevation in estradiol. The endocrine
changes also were reported in developmental, subchronic, and chronic toxicity studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A broad spectrum of organ changes occurred in dogs exposed to vinclozolin in a 1-year feeding study. Males administered
4.8 mg/kg/day (the LOEL for males) had increases in testes weights, increased bilirubin, and prostate atrophy. The
NOEL in males was 2.4 mg/kg/day. Females in this study had increased adrenal weights, lipid accumulation in the adrenal
glands, and marginally increased hemosiderin in the liver at 5.1 mg/kg/day (the LOEL for females). The NOEL for females
was 2.5 mg/kg/day. At higher doses (47 mg/kg/day in males and 53 mg/kg/day in females), there were increases in weights
of the liver, spleen, testes, adrenal, and thyroid. Other effects included increased diffuse hyperplasia of the
Leydig cells, lipid accumulation in the adrenal cortex, and increased platelets in males, and in females, slight
increases in mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration. The oral RfD for this compound,
0.025 mg/kg/day, was based on the findings of a 6&hyph;month feeding study with beagle dogs, in which adrenal weights
(absolute and relative) were significantly increased at 7.5 mg/kg/day (the LOEL). The NOEL was 2.5 mg/kg/day. Both
males and females exposed to higher doses (600 and 2,000 ppm, or 15 and 50 mg/kg/day) had histological changes in the
adrenal glands, including vacuolation of the zona fasciculata. In addition to effects on the adrenal gland, males
exposed to the LOEL dose and higher had decreased absolute kidney weights, and at 600 ppm, fat droplets in the distal
tubule were observed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pseudohermaphroditism (a decrease in anal-genital distance) occurred in male offspring of rats administered doses
of 50 mg/kg (the LOEL) and higher by gavage. The developmental NOEL was 15 mg/kg. The same effect was noted in the offspring
of rats that received dermal applications of 180 mg/kg/day (LOEL; the developmental NOEL was 60 mg/kg/day) during
gestation, and also in a 2-generation reproduction study in rats (the LOEL was 86 mg/kg/day, the NOEL was 25 mg/kg/day).
Other developmental effects observed in the latter study included developmental delays, reduced male and female
pup weight, increased stillbirths and increased pup mortality throughout lactation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing vinclozolin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section

V. Rationale for Listing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to add the chemical substances identified in Unit IV.B. of this preamble because EPA believes that
these chemicals meet the statutory criteria for listing under section 313(d)(2) of EPCRA. The bases for these determinations
and the specific toxic effects are summarized in Unit IV.B. of this preamble and set forth in more detail in the rulemaking
record. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA intends to evaluate public comment on this proposed rule and issue a final rule by November 30, 1994. Reporting
for the chemicals identified in the final rule would be required for activities during the 1995 calendar year. Such
reports would have to be submitted to EPA and States by July 1, 1996. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Rulemaking Record

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VII. Request for Public Comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA requests comment on any aspect of this proposal. EPA requests specific comment as detailed in the following paragraphs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requests comment on the sufficiency of the evidence for each of the chemicals proposed for addition in Unit IV.B.
of this preamble. In addition, EPA requests comment on any issues that may be specific to any of the individual chemicals
or chemical categories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requests comment on whether it would be appropriate to list persistent bioaccumulative toxic chemicals that
are manufactured, processed, or otherwise used below the current reporting thresholds on EPCRA section 313. If EPA
were to add this type of chemical to EPCRA section 313, what modifications to EPCRA section 313, such as lowering the
reporting thresholds and modifying the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in mixture exemptions, would be required to insure that release and transfer information would be collected? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Units IV.B.132., IV.B.144., and IV.B.158., of this preamble, EPA is proposing to add individually three diisocyanates:
hexamethylene-1,6-diisocyante; isophorone diisocyanate; and 1,1-methylene bis(4-isocyanatocyclohexane).
EPA requests comment on its alternative proposal in Unit IV.B.132. of this preamble to create a diisocyanates category
rather than adding diisocyanates individually to EPCRA section 313. EPA also requests comment on what diisocyanates,
other than those listed in IV.B.132. of this preamble, should be included in such a category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requests comment on its proposed definition of man-made mineral fibers, given in Unit IV.B.149. of this preamble,
and any other options for defining a fibers category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Unit IV.B.166. and 172. of this preamble, EPA is proposing to add two ethylene bisdithiocarbamates (EBDCs): metiram;
and nabam. An additional two EBDCs, zineb and maneb, are currently listed on the EPCRA section 313 list of toxic chemicals.
The category of EBDCs has recently been added to EPCRA section 313 (December 1, 1993; 58 FR 63500). EPA requests comment
on the following: (1) Should the individual EBDCs, metiram and nabam, be added individually to EPCRA section 313 even
though they are members of the EBDC category, which is listed on EPCRA section 313; and (2) should the individual listings
for two EBDCs, zineb and maneb, be deleted and added as members of the newly created EBDC category? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requests comment on whether polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) should be added as a delineated category consisting
of the PACs listed in Unit IV.B.207. of this preamble or as a category with the definition given in Unit IV.B.207. of
this preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requests comment on its approach in considering exposure as a part of its evaluation of certain chemicals under
sections 313(d)(2)(A) and (C).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Units IV.B.36, 179., and 235. of this preamble, EPA is proposing to add three chemicals (sulfur dioxide, nitrogen
dioxide, and carbon monoxide) that are regulated by Title I of the CAA (Provisions for Attainment and Maintenance
of National Ambient Air Quality Standards). In addition, sulfur dioxide is regulated under Title IV of the CAA (Acid
Deposition Control). Extensive data, which are highly technical, are collected on these chemicals as required by
the CAA. EPA requests comment on the following: (1) Is the information collected under the CAA sufficient for public
right-to-know purposes; and (2) suggestions on how the data collected on these chemicals pursuant to CAA Titles I
and IV could be used to meet the purposes of EPCRA section 313.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments should be submitted to the address listed under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ADDRESSES unit. All comments must be received on or before April 12, 1994.

VIII. Public Meeting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA will hold a 1&hyph;day public meeting to discuss the issues presented above. The tentative agenda for this public
meeting will include a discussion of the issues presented in Unit VII. of this preamable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Scheduling of oral statements will be on a first come first served basis by calling the telephone number listed under
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. All statements will be made part of the public record and will be considered in the
development of the final rule.

X. Regulatory Assessment Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements of the
Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action likely to
result in a rule (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting
a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local,
or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious
inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering
the budgetary impacts of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues
arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, it has been determined that this proposed rule is a ``significant regulatory
action.'' As such, this action was submitted to OMB for review, and any comments or changes made in response to OMB suggestions
or recommendations have been documented in the public record.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires each Federal agency to perform a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
for all rules that are likely to have a ``significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' The analysis
supporting this proposed rule estimated the maximum cost that a small business might incur, and calculated the cost
impact percentage (reporting costs divided by average value of shipments) for each employee size, class, and SIC
code. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reporting costs are estimated at less than one percent of the average value of shipments per report in the first year,
and less than one-half of one percent of the value of shipments per report in subsequent years. The precise impacts
depend on how many reports an individual small business submits. However, experience with current reporters indicates
that small businesses generally submit fewer reports per facility than larger ones. Most of the reports are anticipated
to be submitted from industries with the lowest impacts. Because of this, no segment of the manufacturing sector is
likely to suffer significant adverse effects due to this rule, Therefore, EPA certifies that this proposed rule will
not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

C. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The collection of information and other requirements under section 313 of EPCRA and section 6607 of the PPA are covered
under OMB approval number 2070&hyph;0093, which was issued on May 14, 1992. While this approval normally would have
expired on November 30, 1992, it remains in effect pursuant to the 1993 Department of Veteran Affairs and Housing and
Urban Development and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, Pub. L. 102&hyph;389, signed October 6, 1992, which
states that:

Notwithstanding the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 or any requirements thereunder the Environmental Protection
Agency Toxic Chemical Release Inventory Form R and Instructions, revised 1991 version issued May 19, 1992, and related
requirements (OMB No. 2070&hyph;0093), shall be effective for reporting under section 6607 of the Pollution Prevention
Act of 1990 (Public Law 101508) and section 313 of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (Public
Law 99-499) until such time as revisions are promulgated pursuant to law.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule adds chemicals to the list of toxic chemicals subject to reporting under section 313 of EPCRA and
section 6607 of the PPA and does not change the elements of the TRI reporting form, its instructions, or related requirements.
Accordingly, the Form R and Instructions and related requirements remain in effect, as provided by Pub. L. 102-389.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The industry reporting burden for collecting this information is estimated to average 53 hours per respondent annually,
including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data
needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. The actual burden to a specific facility may
deviate from this estimate depending on the complexity of the facility's operations and the profile of the release.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Send comments regarding this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Chief,
Information Policy Branch, 2131, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460; and
to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, 726 Jackson Place NW., Washington,
DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' The final rule will respond to any OMB or public comments on this
collection of information.
