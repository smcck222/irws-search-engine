SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary of the Interior is announcing the approval, with certain exceptions, of proposed amendments to the
Wyoming permanent regulatory program (hereinafter, the ``Wyoming program'') under the Surface Mining Control
and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act), and the corresponding modification of the one remaining condition
of program approval. The amendments primarily address the recovery of costs and expenses, including attorney's
fees, incurred in connection with administrative review proceedings under the Wyoming program, but they also include
provisions pertaining to formal and informal administrative reviews in general, intervention in administrative
review proceedings, and the definition of toxic materials. The amendments are intended to revise the Wyoming program
to be consistent with the corresponding Federal standards and to clarify State operating procedures.

I. Background on the Wyoming Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 26, 1980, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Wyoming program. General background
information on the Wyoming program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and conditions
of approval of the Wyoming program can be found in the November 26, 1980,

 (45 FR 78637). Subsequent actions concerning Wyoming's program and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 950.11,
950.12, 950.15, and 950.16.

II. Submission of Amendments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 9, 1993 (Administrative Record No. WY&hyph;22&hyph;1), Wyoming submitted a proposed amendment comprised
of (1) Enrolled Act No. 60 (1993 General Session), which, as signed into law on March 2, 1993, revised subsection (f)
of section 35&hyph;11&hyph;437 of the Wyoming Statutes (W.S.) and added a new subsection (g) to this section, and
(2) a number of changes to Chapter V of the Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Wyoming Department of Environmental
Quality (DEQ). Both Enrolled Act No. 60 and the regulation changes pertain solely to the award of costs and expenses
in connection with administrative and judicial proceedings under the approved State program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State submitted the amendment primarily to satisfy a condition the Secretary placed on the approval of the Wyoming
program at 30 CFR 950.11(c) (hereinafter, condition ``c''). This condition requires the State to amend its program
to include provisions that are consistent with the Federal regulations at 43 CFR part 4 concerning intervention in
administrative review proceedings and the recovery of costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred
in connection with participation in such proceedings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wyoming originally promulgated Chapter V of the DEQ Rules of Practice and Procedure on August 3, 1982, and submitted
it to OSM as a program amendment by letter dated August 18, 1982. This amendment also included a revised version of section
7 of Chapter II of the DEQ Rules of Practice and Procedure; the revisions of this chapter were intended to satisfy the
intervention portion of condition ``c.'' Wyoming had previously promulgated these rules in identical form as temporary
emergency regulations, which were submitted to OSM on May 26, 1982. After reviewing the emergency regulations, OSM
determined that they did not fully satisfy condition ``c.'' Therefore, instead of acting upon these portions of the
May 26, 1982, proposed amendment, OSM extended the deadline for Wyoming to meet the condition (47 FR 42351&hyph;52,
September 27, 1982). Similarly, OSM never acted upon the corresponding portions of the August 18, 1982, submittal,
which were identical to the May 26, 1982, submittal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The August 18, 1982, submittal also included (1) a revised definition of ``toxic materials'' at Chapter I, section
2(99) of the Rules and Regulations of DEQ's Land Quality Division (LQD), and (2) a new Chapter VI to be added to the DEQ
Rules of Practice and Procedure. The new chapter authorizes the Director of the DEQ to informally review and modify
decisions of division administrators (including the Administrator of the LQD) and establishes procedures and requirements
governing such reviews. OSM also did not act upon these portions of the proposed amendment at the time of submittal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the March 9, 1993, submittal revises part of the August 18, 1982, submittal, OSM is taking this opportunity
to announce a decision on both submittals. Except for recodification of the definition of toxic materials, no changes
other than those contained in the March 9, 1993, submittal have been made in the regulations submitted on August 18,
1982. (See letter from Wyoming dated August 27, 1992 (Administrative Record No. WY&hyph;22&hyph;2).)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM announced receipt of the March 9, 1993, submittal in the March 30, 1993, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (57 FR 16637), and, in the same document, opened the public comment period and provided opportunity for a public hearing
on the substantive adequacy of both the August 18, 1982, and the March 9, 1993, submittals. The public comment period
closed on April 29, 1993. A public hearing was not held because no one requested an opportunity to testify.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Set forth below, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, are the Secretary's findings
concerning the proposed amendments submitted by Wyoming on August 18, 1982, and March 9, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Award of Costs and Expenses: General
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 525(e) of SMCRA provides that: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Whenever an order is issued under this section, or as a result of any administrative proceeding under this Act, at the
request of any person, a sum equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses (including attorney fees) as determined
by the Secretary to have been reasonably incurred by such person for or in connection with his participation in such
proceedings, including any judicial review of agency actions, may be assessed against either party as the court,
resulting from judicial review, or the Secretary, resulting from administrative proceedings, deems proper.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although section 525(e) is not directly applicable to State programs, section 102(i) of SMCRA specifies that one
of the purposes of the Act is to ``assure that appropriate procedures are provided for the public participation in
the development, revision, and enforcement of regulations, standards, reclamation plans, or programs established
by the Secretary or any State under this Act.'' To implement this provision, the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15(b)(10)
require that State programs ``[p]rovide for public participation in the development, revision and enforcement
of State regulations and the State program, consistent with public participation requirements of the Act and this
chapter.'' Furthermore, 30 CFR 732.15(b)(14) requires that State programs ``[p]rovide for administrative review
of State program actions, in accordance with section 525 of the Act and subchapter L of this chapter,'' and 30 CFR 840.15
specifies that ``[e]ach State program shall provide for public participation in enforcement of the State program
consistent with that provided by 30 CFR parts 842, 843 and 845 and 43 CFR part 4.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preambles to both 30 CFR 732.15(b)(10) and 840.15 explain that these rules mean that the State program must authorize
the award of costs and expenses incurred in connection with administrative and judicial proceedings as provided
under sections 520 (d) and (f) and 525(e) of SMCRA and 43 CFR part 4 (44 FR 14965, 15297, March 13, 1979). In 1981 and 1982,
OSM considered revising these two rules to modify this interpretation, but, ultimately, no changes were adopted
(47 FR 26359&hyph;60, June 17, 1982; 47 FR 35625, August 16, 1982). Therefore, the 1979 preamble is still an authoritative
explanation of the Federal regulations currently in effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;902(e) and 35&hyph;11&hyph;901(p), the Wyoming program counterparts to paragraphs (d)
and (f), respectively, of section 520 of SMCRA, are unaffected by the amendments under consideration in this rulemaking.
These provisions, which authorize the award of costs and expenses incurred in connection with citizen suits to compel
compliance with regulatory requirements or to recover damages for personal injury or property damage sustained
as a result of a violation, are substantively identical to and consistent with their Federal counterparts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, Wyoming Enrolled Act No. 60, as submitted on March 9, 1993, extensively revises W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f),
the Wyoming counterpart to section 525(e) of SMCRA, which authorizes the award of costs and expenses incurred in connection
with administrative proceedings and judicial review of agency actions. Enrolled Act No. 60 also adds W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(g),
which further restricts awards of costs and expenses under subsection (f). As discussed below in this finding and
in findings 3, 5, 6, and 7, the Secretary has determined that W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437 (f) and (g) are not fully consistent
with section 525(e) of SMCRA and the Federal regulations implementing that provision of SMCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chapter V of the DEQ Rules of Practice and Procedure is the Wyoming counterpart to the Federal rules at 43 CFR 4.1290
through 4.1296, which implement section 525(e) of SMCRA with respect to awards of costs and expenses incurred in connection
with administrative review proceedings. Except as discussed below in this finding, these State rules, as submitted
on August 18, 1982, and revised by submittal dated March 9, 1993, are substantively identical to the Federal rules.
Finding 2 explains why Wyoming's use of the term ``contested case'' is not a substantive difference.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Wyoming rules do not include a counterpart to either 43 CFR 4.1296, which provides that an administrative law judge's
decision on a petition for an award of costs and expenses may be appealed to the Interior Board of Land Appeals, or that
portion of 43 CFR 4.1291 that specifies where a petition for an award of costs and expenses must be filed. However, unlike
the two-tiered Federal administrative review system, Wyoming has only one administrative review entity, the Environmental
quality Council (EQC or the Council). Therefore, neither of these provisions is needed since (1) there is no question
as to the entity with which the petition must be filed, and (2) no administrative review of an EQC decision is possible
because no higher-level administrative review entity exists. Furthermore, both Sections 2 and 3.a.(2) of Chapter
V clearly identify the Council as the entity responsible for the processing of petitions for the award of costs and
expenses.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, the statute is inconsistent with the regulations in that W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) vets the Director
of the DEQ with the responsibility for processing petitions and determining awards, whereas Chapter V of the DEQ Rules
of Practice and Procedure assigns this responsibility to the Council. Since 43 CFR 4.1291 requires that petitions
be filed with and processed by the administrative review entity that decided the underlying case, the Secretary finds
that W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) is inconsistent with the Federal regulations to the extent that it assigns this
responsibility to the Director of the DEQ, who has no formal administrative review function, rather than the Council.
Therefore, the Secretary is not approving the phrases ``by the director'' and ``as the court or the director deems
proper'' in the first sentence of W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f). Nothing in these actions shall be construed as eliminating
the ``deems proper'' standard of review or as vesting the Council with the authority to review or decide petitions
for the award of costs and expenses incurred in connection with judicial proceedings. The Secretary is disapproving
the entire phrase ``as the court or the director deems proper'' to avoid creating a situation in which only the court
would have the authority to assess awards under the Wyoming statute, as could be the case if only the clause ``or the
director'' within that phrase was disapproved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Wyoming rules also lack a counterpart to 43 CFR 4.1294(a)(2), which allows an award of costs and expenses to any
person from the permitte if the person initiates an application for review of alleged discriminatory acts pursuant
to 30 CFR part 830 (since recodified as 30 CFR part 865) upon a finding of discriminatory discharge or other acts of discrimination.
However, nothing in SMCRA or the Federal regulations requires that State programs include a counterpart to section
703 of the Act or its implementing regulations at 30 CFR part 865. Any person who believes they have been discriminated
against in violation of this section of the Act has the right to file an application for review directly with OSM in accordance
with 30 CFR part 865. Any resulting hearings would be held by the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of
the Interior in accordance with 43 CFR part 4 and the applicant would have the right to file a petition for an award of
costs and expenses under 43 CFR 4.1294(a)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Secretary finds that Chapter V of the DEQ Rules of Practice and Procedure, as submitted on August 18,
1982, and revised on March 9, 1993, is not inconsistent with the Federal requirements concerning the award of costs
and expenses incurred in connection with administrative proceedings, as set forth in section 525(e) of SMCRA and
43 CFR part 4. Accordingly, the Secretary is approving these State rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Award of Costs and Expenses: Contested Case Requirement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Wyoming has revised both W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) and Section 2.a.(3) of Chapter V of DEQ's Rules of Practice
and Procedure to provide that participants in administrative proceedings may recover costs and expenses only if
the proceeding is a ``contested case'' proceeding, although the regulations use this language only in connection
with awards from the State, not awards from other parties. Section 525(e) of SMCRA provides for the award of costs and
expenses incurred in connection with ``any administrative proceeding.'' Prior to the State's adoption of the amendment
under consideration in this rulemaking, W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) contained similar language.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although neither the Wyoming Environmental Quality Act (EQA) nor the DEQ Rules of Practice and Procedure directly
define ``contested case,'' Chapter I, Section 2.a. of the DEQ Rules of Practice and Procedure indicates that all definitions
contained in the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act, which does define this term, are incorporated by reference.
However, Sections 1 and 2.a.(4) of Chapter I of the DEQ Rules define the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act as W.S.
9&hyph;4&hyph;101 through 9&hyph;4&hyph;115. These citations appear to be in error since Title 9 of the Wyoming
Statutes does not pertain to administrative review of agency actions. The correct citation appears to be W.S. 16&hyph;3&hyph;101
through 16&hyph;3&hyph;115, which W.S. 16&hyph;3&hyph;101 (a) and (b)(xi) identify as the Wyoming Administrative
Procedure Act. The Secretary encourages Wyoming to correct this citation error.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
W.S. 16&hyph;3&hyph;101(b)(ii) defines ``contested case'' as ''a proceeding including but not restricted to ratemaking,
price fixing and licensing, in which legal rights, duties or privileges of a party are required by law to be determined
by an agency after an opportunity for hearing but excludes designations under W.S. 9&hyph;2&hyph;1022(h)(i).''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State has not clearly indicated how this definition would translate in practice to actions and proceedings under
the Wyoming Environmental Quality Act and its implementing regulations. However, in an October 29, 1992, document
entitled ``Statement of Principal Reasons for Adoption'' that accompanied the revised rules, the Council stated
that ``the words `contested case' were added before the word `proceeding' *&blank;*&blank;* to clarify that fees
may be awarded only in contested cases, as opposed to rulemaking hearings.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both the Interior Board of Land Appeals (IBLA or the Board) and the U.S. District Court for the Utah District declined
to delineate the full reach of the phrase ``any administrative proceeding'' in section 525(e) of SMCRA when presented
with an opportunity to do so.

 643 F. Supp. 810, 825 n. 26 (D. Utah 1986). However, in deciding these cases, both the IBLA and the U.S. District Court
held that this phrase should not be read literally, but rather must be interpreted in the context of the legislative
history of SMCRA and case law concerning attorney fee and expense awards under other statutes. Both opinions contain
extensive dicta suggesting that the phrase could or should be read to include only administrative proceedings of
an adjudicatory nature, not proceedings that are part of the fact-finding process culminating in an initial agency
decision, e.g., informal conferences on permit applications.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the Federal regulations at 43 CFR 4.1290 and 4.1291, which implement this section of SMCRA in part, provide
for an award of costs and expenses only in connection with administrative proceedings resulting in the issuance of
a final order by an administrative law judge or the IBLA. The preamble to these regulations notes that the Secretary
rejected comments requesting that the scope of the rules be expanded to allow the award of costs and expenses in other
types of administrative proceedings, such as rulemaking (43 FR 34385, August 3, 1978). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Secretary finds that the Wyoming statutory and regulatory provisions allowing the award of costs
and expenses only in connection with a ``contested case'' proceeding are not inconsistent with section 525(e) of
SMCRA and its implementing regulations, as interpreted by case law. However, the Secretary's approval is predicated
upon Wyoming's interpretation of the term ``contested case'' to include all classes of actions in which participants
would be eligible for an award of costs and expenses under 43 CFR 4.1290 through 4.1295, consistent with the discussion
set forth above. At a minimum, the term must include all administrative proceedings of an adjudicatory nature. Additionally,
as more case law develops, it may be necessary to further expand the interpretation to include other types of administrative
proceedings.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Wyoming Enrolled Act No. 60 revises W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) to provide that a participant in a proceeding is
eligible to receive an award of costs and expenses from the State only if the issues resolved in the contested proceeding
were raised in the original complaint and within the statutory timeframes of W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;406(p) or within
an enforcement action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 525(e) of SMCRA does not provide a basis for a limitation of this nature. The purpose of section 525(e) is to
facilitate public participation in the administrative and judicial review process, as required by section 102(i)
of the Act. As stated in the preamble to 43 CFR 4.1290 through 4.1295 as originally proposed:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The legislative history of the Act is clear that section 525(e) of the Act is intended to encourage public participation
in the administrative process. Such a provision is designed to encourage citizens to bring good faith actions to insure
that the Act is being properly enforced. It is the intention of the Office that these proposed rules not be interpreted
to discourage good faith actions on the part of interested citizens.

Administrative and judicial review entities may not be obligated to accept untimely filings or amended complaints,
but if they do there is no basis for excluding participants in the affected proceeding from eligibility for an award
of costs and expenses. Such persons are entitled to all the rights and privileges accorded to other litigants.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Additionally, restricting awards under W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) to issues ``raised within the statutory time
frames of W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;406(p) or within an enforcement action'' would improperly limit the type of proceedings
for which an award may be made. As previously noted, section 525(e) of SMCRA allows awards in connection with ``any
administrative proceeding under this Act.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the meaning of the new State statutory language is unclear since W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;406(p) does
not establish timeframes for appealing agency actions. Instead, it merely specifies the time within which the regulatory
authority must render a decision on a permit application. To be consistent with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
NRDC, supra,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in which the IBLA found the plaintiffs eligible for an award of costs and expenses pursuant to section 525(e) of SMCRA
as a result of their participation in an administrative appeal of a decision on a permit application, Wyoming must
likewise authorize the award of costs and expenses incurred in connection with administrative review of regulatory
authority decisions on permit applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even if the State language were to be interpreted as including permit application decisions, restricting award eligibility
to proceedings involving either enforcement actions or decisions on permit applications is inconsistent with Utah
International, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
supra.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Although the opinion accompanying the Utah International decision contains numerous statements that section 525(e)
does not apply to nonenforcement administrative proceedings, the court ultimately awarded attorney fees to the
plaintiffs in this case as a result of their participation in judicial proceedings concerning a designation of certain
lands as unsuitable for surface coal mining operations. Decisions on petitions to designate lands as unsuitable
for mining are not enforcement actions or proceedings. Therefore, the court clearly did not intend to limit attorney
fee awards to proceedings concerning enforcement actions. In 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
NRDC,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the IBLA specifically rejected the argument that Utah International restricts the scope of section 525(e) in this
fashion. 107 IBLA 359&hyph;60. The Board further stated that ``[t]here is no question that Congress intended to encompass
more than section 525 enforcement proceedings within the bounds of section 525(e)'' (107 IBLA 356, emphasis in original),
and that ``[a]t best, the legislative history supports a limitation of section 525(e) to adjudicatory proceedings''
(107 IBLA 357).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Secretary finds that W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f)(i), which contains the provision in question,
is inconsistent with section 525(e) of SMCRA, and he is not approving it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary notes that the regulations submitted by the State do not contain this defect: Chapter V, Section 2.a.(3)
of the DEQ Rules of Practice and Procedure allows the award of costs and expenses to any person who ``initiates or participants
in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
any contested case proceeding
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 under the act'' (emphasis added).

4. Award of Costs and Expenses: Requirement for Separate and Distinct Contribution [W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f)(ii)]
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Wyoming Enrolled Act No. 60 revises W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) to specify that a participant in an eligible proceeding
who did not initiate the proceeding may receive an award of costs and expenses from the State only if that person's contribution
is separate and distinct from the contribution made by the person initiating the proceeding. Neither section 525(e)
of SMCRA nor the corresponding Federal regulations at 43 CFR 4.1294(b) contain a similar provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the preamble to 43 CFR 4.129(a)(1) clarifies that this requirement is implicit in the provision that, to
be eligible for an award, the party must have made a substantial contribution to a full and fair determination of the
issues (50 FR 47223, November 15, 1985). Since 43 CFR 4.1294(b) contains a ``substantial contribution'' provision
identical to that of paragraph (a)(1), the same rationale would apply. Accordingly, the Secretary finds that W.S.
35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f)(ii), which adds the ``separate and distinct'' stipulation, is not inconsistent with SMCRA
or the Federal regulations, and is approving it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Wyoming Enrolled Act No. 60 revises W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) to allow the award of costs and expenses from the
State only if the person claiming eligibility for such an award establishes the existence of a specific violation
of an applicable statute or rule. Neither section 525(e) of SMCRA nor the Federal regulations contain equivalent
language.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under 43 CFR 4.1294(b), the corresponding Federal regulation, a person is eligible for an award of costs and expenses
from the regulatory authority if that person ``made a substantial contribution to a full and fair determination of
the issues'' and ``prevails in whole or in part, achieving at least some degree of success on the merits.'' While the
preamble to 43 CFR 4.1294(a)(1) states that meeting a requirement for a finding that a violation of the Act, regulations
or permit has occurred is comparable to a showing of some degree of success on the merits (50 FR 47223, November 15, 1985),
the reverse of this statement is not true. For example, a person involved in an administrative hearing on a permit decision
can achieve at least some degree of success on the merits (imposition of a permit condition or issuance of a revision
order) without establishing the existence of a specific violation of statute or rule. The same situation exists with
respect to administrative proceedings that end in settlement agreements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the proposed amendment is in direct conflict with the legislative history of section 525(e) of SMCRA:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 525(e) provides for the award of costs, including attorneys' and expert witness fees, in the discretion of
the Secretary. This section gives the Secretary authority to award attorneys' fees to compensate participants in
the administrative process. The subsection does not require that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proceedings result in the finding of a violation nor does the fact that the Government was a party in an adjudicatory
proceeding, or had caused the proceeding to be initiated, prevent an award under the terms of the subsection. It is
the committee's intention that this subsection not be interpreted or applied in a manner that would discourage good
faith actions on the part of interested citizens.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provision of H.R. 2 to which this passage applies was subsequently adopted by the conference committee as part
of SMCRA with only minor changes. The accompanying committee report (H.R. Rep. No. 493, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 111 (1977))
contains no language repudiating or modifying the portion of H.R. Rep. No. 218 quoted above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Secretary finds that W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f)(iii), which contains the provision in question,
is inconsistent with section 525(e) of SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 43 CFR 4.1294(b), and is not approving
it.

6. Award of Costs and Expenses: Applicability to Judicial Proceedings and Administrative Proceedings Under EQA
Sections Other Than W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Wyoming Enrolled Act No. 60 revises W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f), the State counterpart to section 525(e) of SMCRA,
by providing in part that costs and expenses (including attorney's fees) incurred by parties in connection with a
proceeding under the Act may be assessed against one or more of those parties only if the proceeding is an administrative
proceeding. In relevant part, the revised statute reads as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Whenever an order is issued under this section, at the request of any person, a sum equal to the aggregate amount of all
costs and expenses (including attorney's fees) as determined by the director to have been reasonably incurred by
the person for or in connection with his participation in the proceeding, including any judicial review of agency
actions, may be assessed against either party as the court or the director deems proper. This subsection shall apply
only to administrative contested case proceedings under the provisions of this act relating to the regulation of
surface coal mining and reclamation operations in accordance with P.L. 95&hyph;87, as that law is worded on August
3, 1977.*&blank;*&blank;*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the first sentence of subsection (f), which is essentially unchanged, would appear to allow assessments
in connection with judicial review proceedings, this provision is now negated by the second sentence, which has been
revised to specify that ``[t]his subsection shall apply 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
only
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
administrative
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contested case proceedings *&blank;*&blank;*'' (emphasis added). Therefore, the Secretary finds that W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f)
as revised is inconsistent with section 525(e) of SMCRA, which allows costs and expenses to be assessed in connection
with both administrative and judicial proceedings.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the first sentence of subsection (f) (``Whenever an order is issued under this section, *&blank;*&blank;*''),
authorizes the award of costs and expenses only in connection with proceedings concerning enforcement actions since
W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437 (``this section'') pertains only to such actions. Section 525(e) of SMCRA, which applies
``[w]henever an order is issued under this section, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
or as a result of any administrative proceeding under this Act
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
,'' (emphasis added), is far more expansive in its coverage. Both the plain language of section 525(e) and pertinent
case law (e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
NRDC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and

Utah International

, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
supra
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) extend the reach of paragraph (e) beyond section 525, which pertains only to administrative review of enforcement
actions, to administrative and judicial review proceedings under other sections of SMCRA. Therefore, the Secretary
finds that W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) is inconsistent with section 525(e) of SMCRA to the extent that the State
statutory provision does not apply to proceedings under sections of the Wyoming Environmental Quality Act other
than W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the preceding discussion, the Secretary is not approving the introductory clause of the first sentence of
W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;37(f) (``Whenever an order is issued under this section,''), or the words ``only'' and ``administrative''
in the second sentence of this subsection (``This subsection shall apply only to administrative contested case proceedings
*&blank;*&blank;*'').

7. Award of Costs and Expenses: Cap on Fees and Costs [W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(g)]
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Wyoming Enrolled Act No. 60 revises W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437 by adding a new subsection (g), which provides that
attorney's fees, expert witness fees or other fees or costs shall not exceed $50.00 per hour. To the extent that this
provision would apply to awards of costs and expenses under subsection (f) of W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437, it is inconsistent
with section 525(e) of SMCRA, which authorizes the award of all ``reasonably incurred'' costs and expenses. An inflexible
cap on hourly rates is not in accordance with SMCRA's reasonable cost standard as interpreted by the courts, which
generally use the prevailing community market rate to compute award amounts. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Right to Intervene in Administrative Proceedings: Chapter II, Section 7, DEQ Rules of Practice and Procedure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In findings 22.16 and 22.D (45 FR 20977, March 31, 1980; and 45 FR 78674, November 26, 1980, respectively) concerning
Wyoming's original program submittal and subsequent resubmittal, the Secretary determined that the Wyoming rules
governing intervention in administrative review proceedings did not afford citizens rights of intervention as
broad as those in the Federal regulations at 43 CFR 4.1110. Accordingly, in the approval of the Wyoming program, the
Secretary imposed a condition at 30 CFR 950.11(c) requiring the State to correct this deficiency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 18, 1982, Wyoming submitted a fully promulgated revised version of Chapter II, Section 7 of the DEQ Rules
of Practice and Procedure. The revised version includes a new subsection b. of Section 7 that is substantively identical
to 43 CFR 4.1110. Therefore, the Secretary finds that the revised rules satisfy the intervention component of the
program condition at 30 CFR 950.11(c), and is approving the submittal and modifying the condition accordingly.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
As submitted on August 18, 1982, this new chapter recognizes the authority of the Director of the DEQ to review and modify
decisions of the administrators of the various divisions within the Department, including the Land Quality Division.
This arrangement is in accordance with standard managerial principles and is analogous to the authority of the Secretary
of the Interior to review and modify decisions of the Director of OSM; therefore, it is not inconsistent with any Federal
requirement under SMCRA.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The new rules grant individuals the right to request that the Director of the DEQ hold an informal conference to review
decisions of the Administrator; they also establish procedural, notice and decision requirements to govern such
conferences. There are no Federal counterparts to these provisions, but they are consistent with the purpose of SMCRA
set forth in section 1029(i) of the Act; i.e., the development of procedures for public participation in the program
and its enforcement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, Sections 4 and 5 of this chapter of the State regulations provide that (1) failure to seek informal review
shall not be construed as a failure to exhaust administrative remedies, (2) no evidence as to statements made or evidence
produced by one participant at an informal conference may be introduced by another participant at a subsequent formal
proceeding, and (3) the Director of the DEQ cannot usurp the authority of the EQC. Therefore, the State rules will not
compromise or encumber the formal administrative review process or the right to administrative review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Secretary finds that Chapter VI of the DEQ Rules of Practice and Procedure, as submitted on August
18, 1982, is not inconsistent with SMCRA or the Federal regulations, and is approving these rules.

10. Definition of ``Toxic Materials''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
On August 18, 1982, Wyoming submitted a permanent rule revising the definition of ``toxic materials'' at Chapter
I, Section 2(99) of the LQD Rules and Regulations in a fashion identical to a temporary emergency rule submitted on
May 26, 1982.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM approved the emergency rule on September 27, 1982 (47 FR 42351), and, in the same rulemaking document, removed
the corresponding condition of State program approval at 30 CFR 950.11(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wyoming has since recodified this definition as Chapter I, Section 2(cv) of the LQD Rules and Regulations, but no other
changes have occurred. Similarly, the corresponding Federal definition of ``toxic-forming materials'' at 30 CFR
701.5 has not changed since it was first promulgated on March 13, 1979. Because the permanent State definition at Chapter
I, Section 2(cv) of the LQD Rules is identical to the temporary emergency definition approved by OSM on September 27,
1982, the Secretary finds it to be no less effective than the Federal definition, and is approving it.

and the National Wildlife Federation (NWF) (Administrative Record Nos. WY&hyph;22&hyph;12, WY&hyph;22&hyph;14,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. WOC, PRBRC, and NWF stated that restricting awards of costs and expenses to ``contested case'' proceedings would
be more limiting than and inconsistent with section 525(e) of SMCRA and 43 CFR 4.1294. In particular, several commenters
argued that participants in informal conferences should be eligible for awards of costs and expenses. For the reasons
discussed in finding 2, the Secretary does not agree with the commenters. Case law associated with implementation
of section 525(e) of SMCRA indicates that petitions for awards of costs and expenses incurred in connection with administrative
proceedings must be entertained only if the proceedings are adjudicatory in nature (although nothing in these decisions
would prohibit the regulatory authority from voluntarily considering petitions submitted in connection with other
types of administrative proceedings). Informal conferences are both predecisional and nonadjudicatory.

 supports awards of costs and expenses in connection with predecisional nonadjudicatory administrative proceedings.
Therefore, by restricting awards to contested case proceedings, the Wyoming amendments do not inappropriately
limit the scope of proceedings in which participants may be eligible for an award of costs and expenses. Additionally,
as discussed in finding 2, the Secretary's approval is predicated upon Wyoming's interpretation of the term ``contested
case'' to include all classes of actions in which participants would be eligible for an award of costs and expenses
under 43 CFR 4.1290 through 4.1295.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. WOC, PRBRC, and NWF stated that W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f)(i), which provides that, to receive an award of costs
and expenses from the State, the issues resolved in the proceeding must be those raised in the original complaint within
certain statutory timeframes or within an enforcement action, is inconsistent with section 525(e) of SMCRA and 43
CFR 4.1294(b) in that it would improperly narrow the type of proceedings for which an award could be made. As discussed
in finding 3, the Secretary agrees, and is not approving this provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. WOC, PRBRC, and NWF stated that W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f)(ii), which provides that, to receive an award of costs
and expenses from the State, the contribution of a person who did not initiate a proceeding must be separate and distinct
from the contribution of the person initiating the proceeding, is inconsistent with section 525(e) of SMCRA and 43
CFR 4.1294(b), which do not contain this provision. For the reasons set forth in detail in finding 4, the Secretary
does not agree. NWF also objected to the lack of a definition for ``initiate.'' However, the commenter provided no
explanation of why such a definition is necessary. Since the Secretary is unaware of any confusion as to the meaning
of this term, which appears to be clear on its face, the Secretary is not requiring that Wyoming provide the definition
requested by the commenter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NWF further stated that this Wyoming statutory provision is in conflict with the DEQ Rules of Practice and Procedure,
which do not contain equivalent language. In response, the Secretary notes that, like the Federal rules at 43 CFR 4.1294(b),
Section 2.a.(3) of chapter V of the Wyoming rules requires that a person make a substantial contribution to a full and
fair determination of the issues to be eligible for an award of costs and expenses from the regulatory authority. The
preamble to 43 CFR 4.1294 contains the following discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment suggested that the initiator should be required to make a contribution separate and distinct from OSM
in order to be eligible to recover an award of costs. The final regulation was not revised to accommodate this comment.
However, the requirement that a contribution be ``substantial'' precludes an award if a contribution simply duplicates
that of OSM.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

50 FR 47223, November 15, 1985.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Therefore, as explained in finding 4, the Secretary finds that the ``separate and distinct'' requirement is an implicit
component of the ``substantial contribution'' requirement, and that there is no conflict between the statute and
the regulations on this matter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. WOC, PRBRC, and NWF stated that W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f)(iii), which provides that, to receive an award of
costs and expenses from the State, a person must establish the existence of a specific violation of applicable statute
or rule, is inconsistent with section 525(e) of SMCRA and 43 CFR 4.1294(b). As discussed in detail in finding 5, the
Secretary agrees, and is not approving this provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. PRBRC stated that W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) is inconsistent with 43 CFR 4.1294(d) because it gives the court
or the Director the discretion to assess awards against any person as deemed proper, without reference to whether
the person participated in bad faith for the purpose of harassing or embarrassing the permittee. In response, the
Secretary notes that the provision to which the commenter refers is included in Chapter V of the DEQ Rules of Practice
and Procedure (see paragraphs (2)(a), (4), and (5) of Section 2.a.).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. PRBRC noted that Chapter V, Section 1 of DEQ's Rules of Practice and Procedure does not clearly indicate whether
a petition for an award of costs and expenses is to be filed with the EQC or the Director of the DEQ. While this statement
is correct, Sections 2 and 3 of the DEQ Rules clearly assign responsibility for processing these petitions to the EQC.
As discussed in finding 1, the Secretary agrees that language to the contrary in W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) is confusing
and inconsistent with 43 CFR 4.1291, and is not approving the conflicting language.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. PRBRC noted that DEQ's Rules of Practice and Procedure do not contain a counterpart to 43 CFR 4.1296. As discussed
in finding 1, no State counterpart is needed since, unlike the two-tiered Federal administrative review system,
Wyoming has only one administrative review entity, the EQC. Hence, administrative review of EQC decisions is not
possible. Likewise, the Federal regulations at 43 CFR 4.1296 do not provide for administrative review of a petition
originally decided by the Interior Board of Land Appeals, the higher-level administrative review body under the
Federal system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. WOC objected to the lack of a State counterpart to 43 CFR 4.1294(a)(2). As discussed in detail in finding 1, no State
counterpart is needed since affected parties have the right to file petitions directly with OSM; there is no requirement
to first exhaust any available State remedies.

9. PRBRC opposed OSM's decision to process the Wyoming submittals as program amendments under 30 CFR 732.17. The commenter
stated that because these submittals pertain to a condition of program approval, the provisions of 30 CFR 732.13(j)
apply instead. The Secretary cannot agree with the commenter. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(g) specifically
require that all changes to laws and regulations that make up the State program be submitted to OSM as a program amendment.
Both the August 18, 1982, and the March 9, 1993, submittals fall into this category. Furthermore, the provisions of
30 CFR 732.13(j) apply only if the State has not initiated action to satisfy the condition of program approval, a situation
which does not exist here.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

V. Secretary's Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the above findings, the Secretary is approving Wyoming's proposed program amendments as submitted on August
18, 1992, and March 9, 1993, with the exception of W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(g) (see finding 7) and those provisions
of W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) set forth in findings 1, 3, 5, and 6. The Secretary also is revising the cost recovery
component of the condition of program approval at 30 CFR 950.11(c) to reflect the statutory and regulatory changes
made by the proposed amendments consider in this rulemaking. For the reasons discussed in finding 8, the Secretary
is removing the intervention component of the condition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 950 codifying decisions concerning the Wyoming program are being amended to
implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment
process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal Standards without undue
delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.

The Secretary acknowledges that the plaintiff in

the Secretary to make any amendments satisfying condition ``c'' retroactive to May 20, 1983, the deadline the Secretary
had established for Wyoming to comply with the condition. The Secretary does not find the action requested by the plaintiff
to be appropriate in this instance.

Retroactive application of SMCRA regulations is committed to the discretion of the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See id. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
at 13, n. 4. However, retroactive application is inconsistent with the traditional presumption that regulations
are prospective, not retroactive, and that advance notice of their application must be provided. With respect to
the current rulemaking, Wyoming did not propose to apply these amendments retroactively, and the Secretary is adverse
to imposing such a requirement in the absence of a compelling reason to do so. The Powder River plaintiff appears to
be the only party that would be affected positively by a retroactive application. This plaintiff did not rely to its
detriment on the existence of cost recovery provisions in the Wyoming program, but has instead labored for their addition
to the program. In addition, the underlying permit challenge was maintained despite the absence of the provisions
sought by the plaintiff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary is reluctant to impose upon Wyoming the obligation to pay past costs and expenses on the basis of retroactive
application of provisions that, prior to this rulemaking, have not been part of the State's approved program. However,
the Secretary's decision not to require retroactive application of these amendments does not preclude Wyoming from
paying all or part of the plaintiff's costs and expenses if the State is so inclined.

VI. Effect of Secretary's Decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 503 of SMCRA provides that a State may not exercise primary jurisdiction under SMCRA unless the State program
is approved by the Secretary of the Interior. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(a) require that any alteration
of an approved State program be submitted to OSM for review as a program amendment. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR
732.17(g) prohibit any unilateral changes to approved State programs. Thus, any changes to the State program are
not enforceable by the State as part of the approved State program until they are approved by the Secretary or the Director.
In oversight of the Wyoming program, the Director will recognize only those statutes, regulations, and other materials
approved by the Director, together with any consistent implementing policies, directives and other materials,
and will require the enforcement by Wyoming of only such provisions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsection (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the requirements
of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).

The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Hence, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 OSM is announcing the non-approval with required amendments of a proposed amendment to the Wyoming permanent regulatory
program (hereinafter, the ``Wyoming program'') under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA).
The amendment, submitted January 6, 1993, and April 13, 1993, pertains to shrub density standards. The proposed amendment
was intended to revise the Wyoming program to be consistent with the corresponding Federal standards and to incorporate
the additional flexibility afforded by the revised Federal rules.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background on the Wyoming Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On November 26, 1980, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Wyoming program. General background
information on the Wyoming program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and conditions
of approval of the Wyoming program can be found in the November 26, 1980, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (45 FR 78637). Subsequent actions concerning Wyoming's program and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 950.11,
950.12, 950.15 and 950.16.

II. Submission of Amendment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated January 6, 1993, (Administrative Record No. WY&hyph;21&hyph;1) Wyoming submitted shrub density
rules as a proposed amendment to its permanent program pursuant to SMCRA. The proposed Wyoming amendment revises
the Land Quality Division (LQD) Rules at Chapter IV, Section 2(d)(x)(E), shrub density standard, and Appendix A,
entitled ``Vegetation Sampling Methods and Reclamation Success Standards for Surface Coal Mining Operations.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 15318) announcing receipt of the amendment and inviting public comment on the adequacy of the proposed amendment.
The public comment period ended April 21, 1993. During this public comment period Wyoming submitted additional information
regarding shrub density legislation, Enrolled Act No. 86 [Senate File No. 39] on April 13, 1993 (Administrative Record
No. WY&hyph;21&hyph;21). This proposed legislation amended Wyoming Statute (W.S.) 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e) by
creating new paragraphs (xxxviii) through (xxx), that define agricultural lands, critical habitat, and important
or critical habitat; modified the paragraph at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402(b), that provides shrub density standards;
and created a new subsection (c) at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402, that would provide shrub density standards on grazingland.

A public meeting was requested and held on June 8, 1993. The summary notes for that meeting are available for public
review (administrative record No. WY&hyph;21&hyph;49).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During its review of the amendment, OSM identified various concerns in the proposed regulations and legislation,
including the conflicting nature of the proposed rules and statute. OSM notified Wyoming of these concerns by letter
dated August 17, 1993 (Administrative Record No. WY&hyph;21&hyph;50).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wyoming responded to these concerns by letter dated October 7, 1993, with additional information (Administrative
Record No. WY&hyph;21&hyph;51). Wyoming's submittal included a table identifying the proposed statutes and rules
that conflict with each other, those that complement one another, and discussions on some of the concerns in the issue
letter.

III. Director's Findings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Set forth below, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, are the Director's findings
concerning the amendment submitted by Wyoming on January 6, 1993, and April 13, 1993, and subsequently clarified
on October 7, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxviii): Definition of Agricultural Lands
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Wyoming proposes at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxviii) a definition as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) (xxviii) ``Agricultural lands'' means cropland, pastureland, hayland, or grazingland;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Neither SMCRA nor the implementing Federal regulations include a definition of agricultural lands. Wyoming's proposed
statutory definition appears to make explicit what land uses are considered agricultural in nature. Wyoming is combining
specific land uses into a general category but still maintains the individual land use definitions in its program.
Nothing in the Federal program would preclude such combining of land uses into a single category so long as it does not
result in being inconsistent with the Federal and State program requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the August 17, 1993, letter, OSM cautioned the State regarding the exclusion of ``agricultural lands'' from lands
that can contain habitat of unusually high value as proposed at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxx) (see discussion
at Finding 3). Wyoming did not address this concern in its October 7, 1993, reply. It appears that the sole purpose of
the proposed statutory definition of ``Agricultural lands'' is its use in the proposed statutory definition of ``Important
habitat or crucial habitat''. Thus the proposed definition would cause the State program to be inconsistent with
the Federal program requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the definition of ``Agricultural lands'' as is proposed to be used at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxx)
would not be in accordance with the Federal requirements. The Director is: (1) not approving the definition; and (2)
is requiring Wyoming to either clarify how the definition would not render its program less stringent than SMCRA requirements
and less effective than the Federal regulation requirements or repeal the definition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxix): Definition of Critical Habitat
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Wyoming proposes at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e) a new definition as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xxix) ``Critical habitat'' means only that fish and wildlife habitat designated as critical by the United States
Secretary of the Interior or Secretary of Commerce, for the survival and recovery of listed threatened and endangered
species;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Neither SMCRA nor the implementing Federal regulations define critical habitat. Wyoming's LQD rules at Chapter
I, Section 2(v) already define the term critical habitat. However, based on Wyoming's clarification submitted October
7, 1993, this rule definition is superseded by the proposed statutory definition (Administrative Record No. WY&hyph;21&hyph;51).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All references to critical habitat in the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 780/784.16 and 816/817.97 cite critical habitats
listed by the Secretary under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Under section 3 of ESA, a critical habitat is the specific areas within the geographical area occupied by the species,
at the time it is listed in accordance with provisions of Section 4 of this Act, on which are found those physical or biological
features (I) essential to the conservation of the species and (II) which may require special management consideration
or protection; and (III) specific areas outside the geographical area occupied by the species at the time it is listed
*&blank;*&blank;* that such areas are essential for the conservation of the species.

<TEXT>
 
<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ESA does not use the term ``fish and wildlife habitat'' in the definition of critical habitat. Instead, the ESA
only refers to geographic areas with physical or biological features that are essential for the species. The ESA also
defines the term ``species'' as including ``any subspecies of fish or wildlife or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
plants
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and any distinct population segment of any species or vertebrate fish or wildlife which interbreeds when mature''
(Emphasis added). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Wyoming definition of critical habitat appears to exclude plants. Also, Wyoming has not specified any
State statutes or rules that identify State critical habitat or Threatened and Endangered Species as required by
the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 780/784.16. Additionally, OSM cannot determine whether the term ``fish and wildlife
habitat'' in this definition means fish and wildlife habitat for ESA purposes or fish and wildlife habitat as a land
use. Finally, Wyoming also recognizes critical habitat designated by the ``Secretary of Commerce.'' It is not clear
if this requirement is in addition to the Secretary of the Interior's designation or is an option to use the ``Secretary
of Commerce'' designation instead of the Secretary of Interior's. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, based on the above discussion, the Director finds that the proposed statutory definition at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxix)
is not in accordance with and is less effective than the Federal program requirements and is not approving the proposed
definition. Wyoming is required to either repeal this statutory definition or modify it to be in accordance with and
no less effective than the Federal program requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxx): Definition of Important and Crucial Habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Wyoming proposes at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxx) a definition as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xxx) ``Important habitat'' or ``crucial habitat'' means that fish and wildlife habitat, exclusive of agricultural
lands, which in limited availability, increases the species diversity of a localized area and fulfills one (1) or
more of the essential living requirements of important wildlife species.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Neither SMCRA nor the implementing Federal regulations include a definition of important habitat or crucial habitat.
However, the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 780/784.16(a)(2) requires permit applications to include site-specific
resource information when the permit area or adjacent area is likely to include ``habitats of unusually high value
for fish and wildlife such as streams, wetlands, riparian areas, cliffs supporting raptors, areas offering special
shelter or protection, migration routes, or reproduction and wintering areas.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These habitats of unusually high value would appear to be comparable to the State proposed definition for important
or crucial habitat. Additionally, the State regulations at LQD Rule Chapter II, Section 2(a)(i)(E)(II) require
permit applications to include specific information ``if critical or important habitat or migration route disruption
is likely.'' Wyoming's LQD Rule at Chapter II, Section 3(b)(iv)(B) is similar to the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 780.16(b)(3)(ii)
in requiring protection and enhancement of ``important habitat for fish and wildlife, such as wetlands, riparian
areas, rimrocks, areas offering special shelter or protection, reproduction and nursery areas, and wintering areas.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Federal permitting and performance standard regulations do not exclude any land uses from consideration
in meeting the requirements for protection and enhancement. Wetlands, riparian areas, migration and wintering
areas can potentially occur within any land use including grazingland, pastureland, forestry, etc. Wyoming's proposed
definition would appear to exclude consideration of important habitat or crucial habitat from those land uses included
in the categorical definition of ``agricultural lands.'' These would include the land uses of cropland, pastureland,
hayland and grazingland.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its August 17, 1993, letter to the State, OSM cautioned that such exclusion would render Wyoming's statute less
effective than the Federal regulations requirements and less stringent than the requirements of SMCRA. In its October
7, 1993, reply to OSM's concerns, Wyoming did not address this issue. Additionally, OSM cannot determine whether
the use of the term ``fish and wildlife habitat'' in this definition means fish and wildlife habitat for ESA purposes
or fish and wildlife habitat as a land use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above discussion the Director finds that the proposed statutory definition at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxx)
is not in accordance with and is less effective than the Federal program requirements and is not approving the proposed
definition. Wyoming is required to either repeal this statutory definition or modify it to be in accordance with and
no less effective than the Federal program requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Wyoming proposes to revise existing W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402(b) as follows (proposed language in upper case):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) To the extent federal law or regulations require consultation and approval by state wildlife agencies regarding
surface mining lands to be reclaimed for fish and wildlife habitat, the Wyoming game and fish department shall consider
fish and wildlife habitat to mean as defined in W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvi) and does not include grazingland
as defined in W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvii). IN ESTABLISHING RECLAMATION STANDARDS PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION
AND APPLICABLE FEDERAL LAW OR REGULATION THE COUNCIL SHALL APPLY THE DEFINITIONS OF W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvi)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed new language requires the Environmental Quality Council to use the following specific statutory definitions
when establishing standards regarding required consultation and approval by State wildlife agencies when lands
are to be reclaimed for fish and wildlife habitat: ``Fish and wildlife habitat'' land use (W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvi));
``Grazingland'' land use (W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvii)); ``Agricultural lands'' (W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxviii));
``Critical habitat'' (W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxix)); and, ``Important habitat or crucial habitat'' (W.S.
35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxx)). The statutory definitions for fish and wildlife habitat and grazingland are existing
definitions that were previously approved by OSM. The statutory definitions for agricultural lands, critical habitat,
and important habitat or crucial habitat were proposed by Wyoming in this amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in Findings 1, 2, and 3, the three proposed definitions referenced in this provision, W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxviii),
(xxix) and (xxx), are not being approved by OSM. This provision, if approved, would inappropriately reference the
disapproved definitions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the Environmental Quality Council is already required, by existing W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402(b),
to use the land use definitions of fish and wildlife habitat and grazingland at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvi)
and (xxvii) when developing reclamation standards for those two postmining land uses. The proposed additional language
is redundant and confusing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the foregoing, the Director finds that the proposed revision to W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402(b) is less stringent
than SMCRA and less effective than the Federal regulations and is not approving it. The Director is requiring Wyoming
to repeal this provision.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 21, 1990, OSM required Wyoming, by letter, pursuant to 30 CFR 732 (required amendment), to revise its program
to be no less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816/817.116(b)(3)(i).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the cover letter to this submittal, Wyoming specified that existing W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402(b) and W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvi),
approved by OSM on July 8, 1992 (57 FR 30121), satisfy the required amendment of February 21, 1990. Wyoming did not,
at that time, identify the submission of proposed W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402(b) and W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvi)
as a response to the required amendment of February 21, 1990, but rather as a State-initiated amendment. OSM approved
W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402(b) and W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvi) as a State initiative, leaving the required
amendment outstanding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wyoming now contends that the language approved in the previous program amendment was intended to address the portion
of the February 21, 1990, required amendment pertaining to consultation and approval by the appropriate State agencies
responsible for fish and wildlife habitat land uses. Accordingly, OSM has reviewed the State provision at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402(b),
as well as the existing State provision at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvi), to determine if Wyoming has satisfied
the required program amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816/817.116(b)(3)(i) provide as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Standards for [revegetation] success shall be applied in accordance with the approved postmining land use and,
at a minimum, the following conditions: *&blank;*&blank;*
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For areas to be developed for fish and wildlife habitat, recreation, shelter belts, or forest products, success
of vegetation shall be determined on the basis of tree and shrub stocking and vegetative ground cover. Such parameters
are described as follows:

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) Minimum stocking and planting arrangements shall be specified by the regulatory authority on the basis of local
and regional conditions and after consultation with and approval by the State agencies responsible for the administration
of forestry and wildlife programs. Consultation and approval may occur on either a program-wide or a permit-specific
basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existing State statutory provisions at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402(b) and W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvi),
respectively, provide as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) To the extent federal law or regulations require consultation and approval by state wildlife agencies regarding
surface mining lands to be reclaimed for fish and wildlife habitat, the Wyoming game and fish department shall consider
fish and wildlife habitat to mean as defined in W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvi) and does not include grazingland
as defined in W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvii).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) (xxvi) ``Fish and wildlife habitat'' means land designated wholly or partially to the production, protection,
or management of species of fish or wildlife.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The quoted State provisions require the Wyoming Game and Fish Department to use the noted definition of ``fish and
wildlife habitat'' when consulting on the revegetation of lands to be reclaimed to the fish and wildlife habitat land
use. These provisions do not correspond to 30 CFR 816/817.116(b)(3)(i).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the quoted provisions do not specify if the Wyoming Game and Fish Department would be the appropriate
State agency responsible for the administration of forestry and wildlife programs for any of the land uses, other
than fish and wildlife habitat, mentioned in the Federal regulations (recreation, shelterbelts, and forest products).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, without further clarifying information from Wyoming, the Director finds the statutory provision at
W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402(b) combined with the previously approved definition of fish and wildlife habitat at W.S.
35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxvi), does not satisfy OSM's February 21, 1990, required amendment.

5. W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402(c): Grazingland Shrub Standard
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Wyoming proposes at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402 establishment of standards as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) For the reclamation of grazingland, operators shall be required to reestablish shrubs on ten percent (10%) of
the affected surface at a density of one (1) shrub per nine (9) square meters, or to a pre-mine density, whichever is
less. The shrubs used for reestablishment shall be those native to the general area, and shall include those found
pre-mining, but the premining dominant shrub need not be the dominant shrub in the post-mining reclamation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SMCRA, at section 515(b)(24), requires that the operator, to the extent possible, using the best technology currently
available (BTCA), minimize disturbances and adverse impacts of the operation on fish, wildlife, and related environmental
values, and achieve enhancement of such resources where practicable. Further, the Federal regulations at 30 CFR
780/784.16 (Fish and wildlife information for permit applications) require resource information of which the scope
and level of detail determined by the regulatory authority in consultation with State and Federal agencies with responsibilities
for fish and wildlife shall be sufficient to design the protection and enhancement plan. This plan shall include a
description of how, to the extent possible using BTCA, the operator will minimize disturbances and adverse impacts
on fish and wildlife and related environmental values.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State has failed to demonstrate through the submission of documentation and/or other materials, that the proposed
shrub standard: (1) would minimize disturbances and adverse impacts on fish and wildlife and related environmental
values; (2) represents BTCA; and (3) was developed in consultation with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department (WGFD).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Director finds the proposed statutory provision at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402(c) to be less stringent
than SMCRA and less effective than the Federal regulation requirements. The Director is not approving the proposed
statutory provision and is requiring Wyoming to either repeal this statutory provision, modify it to make it consistent
with SMRA and no less effective than the Federal regulations, or provide the required documentation to show that the
standard meets the Federal program requirements.

6. LQD Rules at Chapter IV, Section 2 and Appendix A_Shrub Density Rule and Revegetation Success Standards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State additionally proposes to revise LQD Rule Chapter IV, Section 2(d)(x)(E) to require a shrub density standard
of 1 shrub per square meter over 20 percent of the affected surface (including fish and wildlife habitat land use) and
excluding areas where the premining land use was pastureland or cropland. Additionally, the proposed standard can
be reduced to the level of the premine shrub densities if premine shrub densities are less than the proposed success
standard. The proposed rule requires establishment of shrubs in a mosaic pattern to optimize habitat interspersion
and edge effect. A minimum shrub patch size of 0.05 acres is required. For areas of crucial or important habitat, the
Wyoming Game and Fish Department (WGFD) must be consulted for recommended reclamation standards for shrub establishment.
Specific criteria and procedures implementing this proposed rule were provided in modifications to Appendix A_Vegetation
Sampling Methods and Reclamation Success Standards for Surface Coal Mining Operations. The modifications provide
examples of acceptable shrub density standards on specific land uses, shrub composition, and acceptable species
type.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several portions of the Federal regulations place requirements with regard to revegetation standards involving
fish and wildlife habitat. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 780/784.16 require an operator to provide a protection
and enhancement plan for fish and wildlife resources. The scope and level of premine resource information must be
determined in consultation with State and Federal agencies responsible for fish and wildlife and be sufficient to
develop the protection and enhancement plan that describes how, to the extent possible using BTCA, the operator will
minimize disturbance and adverse impacts on fish and wildlife values. An element to be considered is the establishment
of vegetation for wildlife food and cover. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816/817.116(a)(1) require that standards
for success and statistically valid sampling techniques for measuring success shall be selected by the regulatory
authority and included in an approved regulatory program. Additionally, 30 CFR 816/817.116(b)(3)(i) require that
minimum stocking and planting arrangements shall be specified by the regulatory authority on the basis of local and
regional conditions after consultation with an approval by the State agencies responsible for the administration
of forestry and wildlife programs. Specific land uses include areas to be developed for fish and wildlife habitat,
recreation, shelter belts, or forest products. Consultation and approval may occur on either a program-wide or a
permit-specific basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule at Chapter IV, Section 2(d)(x)(E) was the result of an extensive coordination effort involving
LQD, the WGFD, and the coal industry. Public meetings and hearings were also held. Therefore, all necessary processing
was conducted that would allow the Director to render a decision on the proposed rule and appendix.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, based on Wyoming's clarification submitted October 7, 1993, in the form of a table specifying rules that
conflict with and rules that complement the statutory provisions, it was demonstrated that much of the proposed rule
and modifications to appendix A, conflict with the proposed statutes (Administrative Record No. WY&hyph;21&hyph;51).
Furthermore, in its October 7, 1993, reply to OSM's concerns, Wyoming clarified that the legislation (statutory
language) prevails over the conflicting rule language. Consequently, the conflicting proposed rules and modifications
to appendix A cannot be approved since they have been superseded by the statutory language.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Director finds the proposed regulations at LQD Rule Chapter IV, Section 2(d)(x)(E) and proposed modifications
to Appendix A, are in conflict with and are superseded by the proposed statutory provision at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)
and W.S. 35&hyph;103&hyph;402 (b) and (c), and thus cannot be approved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director is requiring Wyoming to amend its program to establish revegetation shrub density standards in compliance
with Section 515(b)(24) of SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 780/784.16, 816/817.97 and 816/817.116.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM solicited public comment on the proposed amendment and provided opportunity for a public hearing. Numerous comments
were received and a public meeting was held. Since OSM is not approving Wyoming's submittal for the reasons given in
this rulemaking action and since most of the comments provided technical support for the proposed rule and modifications
to Appendix A, that were superseded by the legislative changes, the merit of these comments becomes moot to this rulemaking
effort. However, general categories of comments included:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Most commenters supported the proposed rules (20% standard) as minimum standards or as reasonable standards.
As discussed in Finding 6, the majority of the proposed rules conflict with the proposed statutory standard and therefore
cannot be approved. The legislative standard (10%) is not being approved because of reasons discussed in Finding
5. Since neither standard can be approved the discussion of various technical merits provided by commenters in support
of the two standards becomes irrelevant to this rulemaking action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Several commenters recommended changes to the proposed rules and appendix. As previously stated OSM cannot approve
the proposed rules and appendix for reasons discussed in Finding 6. Thus, detailed discussion of the comments recommending
changes would be of no value to this rulemaking action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Two commenters supported the proposed statutory standard (10%) and did not support the proposed rules and appendix.
Additionally, they noted that the rules had been superseded by the statutory language and should not be considered
in this amendment. OSM agrees that the proposed rules are superseded by the statutory standard as discussed in Finding
6, but OSM cannot approve the legislative standard (10%) for reasons discussed in Finding 5.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Several commenters supported, and several did not support, the proposed statutory language at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;402(b)
that provides direction to the Environmental Quality Council in establishing standards. As discussed in Finding
4.a., this provision is confusing and is redundant with Wyoming's approved program. The Director is not approving
it and is requiring Wyoming to repeal this provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Most commenters did not support, and several supported, the proposed statutory definitions at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)
(xxviii) through (xxx) that define agricultural lands, critical habitat, and important or crucial habitat. OSM
is not approving these proposed statutory definitions as discussed in Findings 1, 2, and 3. OSM does not agree with
the few comments that supported these definitions as discussed in this rulemaking action.

Pursuant to Section 503(b) of SMCRA and implementing regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), comments were solicited
from various Federal agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Wyoming program. A summary of the comments,
and the Director's responses to them, appear below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The U.S. Department of Interior (USDI)_Bureau of Indian Affairs, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, USDI_Bureau of
Mines, USDI_Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Department of Labor_Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA)_Arlington,
and U.S. Department of Labor_Mine Safety and Health District 9, responded with no comment (Administrative Record
Nos. WY&hyph;21&hyph;7, WY&hyph;21&hyph;41, WY&hyph;21&hyph;65, WY&hyph;21&hyph;8, WY&hyph;21&hyph;12,
WY&hyph;21&hyph;32, WY&hyph;21&hyph;59, WY&hyph;21&hyph;14, WY&hyph;21&hyph;4, WY&hyph;21&hyph;31, WY&hyph;21&hyph;56,
and WY&hyph;21&hyph;28).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The USDI_Geological Survey responded to the rule portion of the amendment by praising the botanical approach to
this portion of the Wyoming regulations (Administrative Record No. WY&hyph;21&hyph;11).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The U.S. Department of Agriculture_Soil Conservation Service commented that the SCS supports the proposed rule
amendment and feels that it is quite workable (Administrative Record Nos. WY&hyph;21&hyph;9, WY&hyph;21&hyph;24,
and WY&hyph;21&hyph;66).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. U.S. Department of Agriculture_Forest Service_Rocky Mountain Region commented that the proposed rule plan is
well written and well thought out. They additionally suggested that weed free native hay be required rather than preferred
as proposed in Appendix A (Administrative Record No. WY&hyph;21&hyph;13). As previously noted, neither the proposed
rule nor the modification to the appendix can be approved. Therefore, the suggested requirements for weed free native
hay becomes moot to this rulemaking action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. U.S. Department of Agriculture_Agricultural Research Service_Northern Plains Area recommended changes to
the proposed rules and appendix. As discussed in Finding 6, the Director is not approving the proposed rules and appendix.
Thus changes to them need not be discussed at this time (Administrative Record No. WY&hyph;21&hyph;10).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The U.S. Department of Interior_U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS or the Service) provided substantial comments
on February 16, April 14, and November 22, 1993 (Administrative Record Nos. WY&hyph;21&hyph;5, WY&hyph;21&hyph;19,
and WY&hyph;21&hyph;64). The comments supported the proposed rules and appendix but not the statutory language.
They additionally recommended several changes to the proposed rules. As discussed above, the majority of the proposed
rules conflict with the statutory language and OSM is not approving either the proposed rules or statutory provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The U.S. Department of Interior_Bureau of Land Management (BLM) provided substantial comments on March 10 and
December 3, 1993 (Administrative Record Nos. WY&hyph;21&hyph;15 and WY&hyph;21&hyph;67). Again the comments
supported the proposed rules and appendix, therefore discussion of BLM's comments would be of no merit.

Based on the above findings, the Director is not approving Wyoming's proposed program amendment as submitted January

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR part 950 codifying decisions concerning the Wyoming program are being amended to
implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment
process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal standards without undo delay.
Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.

VI. Effect of Director's Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 503 of SMCRA provides that a State may not exercise jurisdiction under SMCRA unless the State program is approved
by the Secretary of the Interior. Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(a) require that any alteration of an approved
State program must be submitted to OSM for review as a program amendment. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(g)
prohibit any unilateral changes to approved State programs. Thus, any changes to the State program are not enforceable
by the State as part of the approved State program until approved by the Director. In the oversight of the Wyoming program,
OSM will recognize only statutes, regulations, and other materials approved by the Director, together with any consistent
implementing policies, directives and other materials, and will require the enforcement by Wyoming of only such
provisions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the requirements
of 30 CFR parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.

No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

.). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Hence, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This interim rule implements section 132 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550,
approved October 28, 1992). Section 132 establishes a demonstration program to facilitate self-sufficiency and
to permit the homeownership sale of single family homes administered by the Housing Authority of the City of Omaha
in the State of Nebraska. The purpose of the demonstration is to exhibit the effectiveness of promoting homeownership
and providing support services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This interim rule is closely modeled on the interim rule for the Section 5(h) Homeownership Program codified in 24
CFR part 906. Section 132 specifies that the Housing Authority of the City of Omaha (hereafter the Housing Authority)
is the organization to carry out the demonstration program. The Housing Authority is already administering a homeownership
program approved pursuant to Section 5(h) of the United States Housing Act of 1937. In its correspondence with the
Department concerning the demonstration program, the Housing Authority has indicated that it wishes to operate
the demonstration program in a fashion similar to that of its existing Section 5(h) program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are many areas of similarity between the Section 5(h) homeownership program and the demonstration program.
The Department believes that, in light of the Housing Authority's desire to pattern the demonstration program upon
its existing Section 5(h) homeownership program and the Department's substantial experience with the Section 5(h)
homeownership program, it should use language from the existing 5(h) regulation whenever appropriate in this interim
regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are a number of clear differences between the demonstration and the Section 5(h) regulation. Because the demonstration
program is established pursuant to legislation that is not part of the 1937 Act, it is not subject to the replacement
requirements of the 1937 Act. The demonstration program also gives the Housing Authority greater freedom in selecting
participant homebuyers under the program than the Section 5(h) program permits. There is, however, a specific mandate
that, ``[i]n conducting the demonstration, the Housing Authority shall affirmatively further fair housing objectives.''
There is also a statutory obligation that ``[t]he Housing Authority shall ensure the availability of supportive
services to each family participating in the demonstration program.''

Justification for Interim Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, the Department publishes a rule for public comment before issuing a rule for effect, in accordance with
its own regulations on rulemaking at 24 CFR part 10. However, section 132(g) requires that the Secretary implement
this demonstration by issuing interim regulations, allowing for a 60-day public comment period. The Department
has adopted a policy of setting an expiration date for an interim rule unless a final rule is published before that date.
This ``sunset'' provision appears in &sect;907.1(b) of the interim rule, and provides that the interim rule will
expire on a date 12 months from publication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 132(g) also requires that the interim regulation be effective upon issuance. The Department interprets
this provision as superseding the requirement for a 30-day delay between publication and effective date of a rule
required by section 7(o) of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act.

The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that the
provisions of this interim rule will not have a significant impact on family formation, maintenance or well being,
except to the extent that the program authorized by the interim rule will increase homeownership opportunities for
low-income families in Omaha, Nebraska. Any such impact is beneficial and merits no further review under the Order.

Purpose.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This part implements section 132 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved
October 28, 1992) (hereafter section 132). Section 132 establishes a demonstration program to facilitate self-sufficiency
and permits the homeownership sale of single family homes administered by the Housing Authority of the City of Omaha
in the State of Nebraska (hereafter ``the Housing Authority''). The purpose of the demonstration is to exhibit the
effectiveness of promoting homeownership and providing support services.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This part applies to single-family public housing units administered by the Housing Authority that have been designated
by the Housing Authority for eventual homeownership. Before entering into a contract or other obligation to sell
a home to a homebuyer under this part, the Housing Authority will give the Department of Housing and Urban Development
(hereafter HUD) a written proposed designation that a home is to be sold under this part. The proposed designation
shall specify the address of the unit(s) to be sold. HUD shall review the proposed designation to ensure that the designated
home is single family public housing, that the Housing Authority has not designated more than twenty percent of the
total number of public housing units that it administers and that the location of the homes complies with fair housing
requirements. (The twenty percent ceiling on the number of homes that can be designated is 602 homes plus twenty percent
of any additional public housing units developed by the Housing Authority through the award of public housing development
funds pursuant to section 5 of the 1937 Act subsequent to October 28, 1992 that do not constitute replacement units
for units demolished or disposed of pursuant to Section 18 of the 1937 Act or the Section 5(H) or Title III homeownership
programs under the 1937 Act.) Consistent with the Housing Authority's affirmative obligation to further fair housing
objectives, the Housing Authority shall offer homeownership opportunities in a variety of locations and promote
an expanded housing choice for minorities. Homeownership opportunities for minorities shall include locations
not located in an area of minority concentration.

General authority for sale. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Housing Authority may sell single family homes designated pursuant to &sect;907.2, for purposes of homeownership,
according to a homeownership plan approved by HUD under this part. If the home is subject to indebtedness under the
ACC, HUD will continue to make any debt service contributions for which it is obligated under the ACC, and the property
sold will not be subject to the encumbrance of that indebtedness. (In the case of a home that is part of a development
with financing restrictions (such as a bond-financed development), however, sale is subject to the terms and conditions
of the applicable restrictions.) In reference to housing properties, ``development'' means the same as ``project,''
as defined in the United States Housing Act of 1937 (hereafter the 1937 Act), rather than the statutory definition
of ``development.'' Upon sale in accordance with the HUD-approved homeownership plan, HUD will execute a release
of the title restrictions prescribed by the ACC. Because the property will no longer be subject to the ACC after sale,
it will cease to be eligible for further HUD funding for operating subsidies or modernization under the 1937 Act upon
conveyance of title by the PHA. (That does not preclude any other types of post-sale subsidies that may be available,
under other Federal, State, or local programs, such as the possibility of available assistance under Section 8 of
the 1937 Act, in connection with a plan for cooperative homeownership.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD will approve the Housing Authority's homeownership plan if it meets all three of the following criteria: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The plan must be practically workable, with sound potential for long-term success. Financial viability, including
the capability of purchasers to meet the financial obligations of homeownership, is a critical requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The plan must be consistent with law, including the requirements of this part, any other applicable Federal, State,
and local statutes and regulations, and existing contracts. Subject to the other two criteria stated in this section,
any provision that is not contrary to those legal requirements may be included in the plan, at the discretion of the
Housing Authority, whether or not expressly authorized in this part.

Consultation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In developing a proposed homeownership plan, and in carrying out the plan after HUD approval, the Housing Authority
shall consult with residents of the homes to be designated pursuant to &sect;907.2, and with any resident organization
that represents them, as necessary and appropriate to provide them with information and a reasonable opportunity
to make their views and recommendations known to the Housing Authority. Except where otherwise indicated by the context,
``resident'' means the same as ``tenant,'' as the latter term is used in the 1937 Act. In a case where vacant units are
expected to be available for purchase, the Housing Authority shall consult with any resident organization or organizations
that represent the prospective purchasers, as indicated by the eligibility standards stated in the plan, and with
any Resident Management Corporation (RMC) formed by residents of the Housing Authority's public housing developments.
While this Part gives the Housing Authority sole legal authority for final decisions as to whether or not to participate
in the homeownership program under this part, as to whether or not to submit a proposed homeownership plan and the content
of such a proposal, the Housing Authority shall give residents and their resident organizations full opportunity
for input in the homeownership planning process, and full consideration of their concerns and opinions.

Where individual residents, a RMC, or another form of resident organization may wish to initiate discussion of a possible
homeownership plan, the Housing Authority shall negotiate with them in good faith. Joint development and submission
of the plan by the Housing Authority and RMC, or other resident organization, is encouraged. In addition, participation
of a RMC or other resident organization in the implementation of the plan is encouraged.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The unit must be free from any defects that pose a danger to life, health, or safety and shall meet minimum housing standards
(except as permitted below) before transfer of an ownership interest to a purchaser (or execution of a lease with an
option to purchase). The minimum housing standards requirement shall be met either by complying with local housing
codes or, if no local code exists, the housing quality standards established by HUD for the Section 8 Certificate program.
The Housing Authority prior to sale shall inspect, or ensure inspection of, each unit to determine it does not pose
an imminent threat to the life, health, or safety of current or future residents and that the property has passed recent
fire and other applicable safety inspections conducted by appropriate local officials and that the unit does comply
with minimum housing standards. Higher standards may be proposed by the Housing Authority or required by lenders.
The property also must meet the requirements for elimination of lead-based paint hazards in HUD-associated housing,
under subpart C of 24 CFR part 35. Further, the property must be in good repair, with the major components having a remaining
useful life that is sufficient to justify a reasonable expectation that homeownership will be affordable by the purchasers.
These standards must be met as a condition for sale of a dwelling to an individual purchaser (or execution of a lease
with an option to purchase), unless the terms of sale (or lease) include measures to assure that the work will be completed
within a reasonable time after the purchase (or lease), not to exceed two years (e.g., as a part of a mortgage financing
package that provides the purchaser with a home improvement loan or pursuant to a sound sweat equity arrangement).

Fair housing objectives. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In conducting the demonstration, the Housing Authority shall affirmatively further fair housing objectives. Prior
to marketing the homes, placing an occupant in a vacant public housing unit designated pursuant to &sect;907.2, or
entering into a contract or other obligation to sell the homes, the Housing Authority shall submit to HUD for its approval
an affirmative fair housing marketing strategy for informing and soliciting applications from people who are least
likely to apply, because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin, for the homeownership
program without special outreach. (See &sect;92.351 of this title for an example of an affirmative fair housing marketing
strategy.) HUD shall review the affirmative fair housing marketing strategy to ensure that it complies with all fair
housing requirements. Once HUD approves the affirmative fair housing marketing strategy, the Housing Authority
must comply with the strategy's provisions in marketing the homes to purchasers. If the initial sale will be to a resident-owned
cooperative or condominium, the cooperative or condominium shall also be required to comply with the provisions
of the affirmative fair housing marketing strategy.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The criteria referred to in paragraph (a) of this section shall include evidence of interest by the family in homeownership,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Homebuyer eligibility. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Eligibility shall be limited to residents who are capable of assuming the financial obligations of homeownership,
under minimum income standards for affordability, taking into account the unavailability of public housing operating
subsidies and modernization funds after conveyance of the property by the Housing Authority. A homeownership plan
may, however, take account of any available subsidy from other sources (e.g., if available, assistance under Section
8 of the 1937 Act, in connection with a plan for cooperative ownership). Under this affordability standard, an applicant
must meet the following requirements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The monthly expenditure for principal, interest, taxes, and insurance by an eligible purchaser plus estimated
utility costs and other monthly housing costs (such as maintenance and condominium or cooperative monthly fees)
shall be not more than 35 percent of the adjusted family income of the purchaser, determined in accordance with parts
913 or 905 of this title, as appropriate. The Housing Authority may request that HUD approve a higher percentage cap,
where the application demonstrates that a higher cap than 35 percent is necessary to make the homeownership program
feasible and that the purchaser will be able to afford the higher monthly cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In the case of cooperative or condominium ownership, if the monthly charge to the homeowner includes amounts for
principal, interest, taxes, insurance, or utilities, the portion of the charge covering these amounts shall be considered
for purposes of making the affordability determinations under this paragraph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Housing Authority can pay any amounts required for closing, such as a down payment (if any) and closing costs
chargeable to the purchaser, as may be specified in the homeownership plan.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Procedures/Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Strategy. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Housing Authority must establish written equitable procedures for identifying and selecting eligible families
to participate in the homeownership program. The Housing Authority must have an affirmative fair housing marketing
strategy that applies whenever homeownership opportunities are made available to other than current residents
of the property. Selections made from the Housing Authority's waiting list for the homeownership program must be
in a nondiscriminatory manner in accordance with HUD approved preferences.

Supportive services available under the demonstration program may include counseling, remedial education, education

If an existing resident of a dwelling authorized for sale under a homeownership plan is ineligible to purchase, or

However, no person who is a tenant of public housing may be involuntarily relocated or displaced (forced to relocate
permanently) from his or her dwelling as a result of the demonstration program. A violation of this relocation/ displacement
prohibition may, in addition to applicable program sanctions, trigger a requirement to provide relocation assistance
in accordance with the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, and implementing
rules.

(3) Replacement housing assistance sufficient to permit relocation to suitable, decent, safe and sanitary replacement
housing (at a rent no higher than permitted by the 1937 Act) in accordance with the relocation assistance component
of the HUD-approved homeownership assistance program. This requirement will be met if the resident is offered the
opportunity to relocate to another suitable dwelling under the Public Housing Program, any of the housing assistance
programs under Section 8 of the 1937 Act, or any other Federal, State, or local program that is comparable, as to standards
for housing quality, admission and rent, to the programs under the 1937 Act, and provides a term of assistance of at

To ensure affordability by eligible purchasers, by the standard adopted under &sect;907.8(c), a homeownership
plan may provide for below-market purchase prices or below-market financing, or a combination of the two. Discounted
purchase prices may be determined on a unit-by-unit basis, based on the particular purchaser's ability to pay, or
may be determined by any other fair and reasonable method (e.g., uniform prices for a group of comparable dwellings,
within a range of affordability by a group of potential purchasers).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Financing. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any type of private or public financing may be used (e.g., conventional, Federal Housing Administration (FHA), Department
of Veterans Affairs (VA), or a State or local program). The Housing Authority may finance or assist in financing purchase
by any methods it may choose, such as purchase money mortgages, guarantees of mortgage loans from other lenders, shared
equity, or lease-purchase arrangements. The homeownership plan shall avoid using financing, such as a mortgage
that is not fully amortizing (such as a ``balloon'' mortgage) or that involves negative amortization, that would
impair the continued affordability of the property for eligible families.

A homeownership plan shall include appropriate protections against any risks of fraud or abuse that are presented
by the particular plan, such as extended use of the dwelling by the purchaser as rental property, or collusive sale
that would circumvent the resale profit limitation of &sect;907.14.

General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a dwelling is sold to the initial purchaser for less than fair market value, the homeownership plan shall provide
for appropriate measures to preclude realization by purchasers of windfall profit on resale. ``Windfall profit''
means all or a portion of the resale proceeds attributable to the purchase price discount (the fair market value at
date of purchase from the Housing Authority less the below-market purchase price), as determined by one of the methods
described in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section. Subject to that requirement, however, purchasers should
be permitted to retain any resale profit attributable to appreciation in value after purchase, or a reasonable portion
of such profit, under a limited or shared equity arrangement, along with any portion of the resale profit that is fairly
attributable to improvements made by them after purchase.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Where there is potential for a windfall profit because the dwelling unit is sold to the initial purchaser for less than
fair market value, the initial purchaser shall execute a promissory note, payable to the Housing Authority, along
with a mortgage securing the obligation of the note, on the following terms and conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The principal amount of indebtedness shall be the lesser of:

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) The purchase price discount, as determined by the definition in paragraph (a) of this section and stated in the
note as a dollar amount; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The net resale profit, in an amount to be determined upon resale by a formula stated in the note. That formula shall
define net resale profit as the amount by which the gross resale price exceeds the sum of: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The discounted purchase price; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Reasonable sale costs charged to the initial purchaser upon resale; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Any increase in the value of the property that is attributable to improvements paid for or performed by the initial
purchaser during tenure as a homeowner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) At the option of the Housing Authority, the note may provide for automatic reduction of the principal amount over
a specified period of ownership while the property is used as the purchaser's family residence, resulting in total
forgiveness of the indebtedness over a period of not less than five years from the date of conveyance, in annual increments
of not more than 20 percent. This does not require the Housing Authority's plan to provide for any such reduction at
all, or preclude it from specifying terms that are less generous to the purchaser than those stated in the foregoing
sentence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) To preclude collusive resale that would circumvent the intent of this section, the Housing Authority shall (by
an appropriate form of title restriction) condition the initial purchaser's right to resell upon approval by the
Housing Authority, to be based solely on the Housing Authority's determination that the resale price represents
fair market value or a lesser amount that will result in payment to the Housing Authority, under the note, of the full
amount of the purchase price discount (subject to any accrued reduction, if provided for under paragraph (b)(2) of
this section). If so determined, the Housing Authority shall be obligated to approve the resale. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The Housing Authority may, in its sole discretion, agree to subordination of the mortgage that secures the promissory
note, in favor of an additional mortgage given by the purchaser as security for a home improvement loan.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Limited equity method.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As a second option, the requirement of this section may be satisfied by an appropriate form of limited equity arrangement,
restricting the amount of net resale profit that may be realized by the seller (the initial purchaser and successive
purchasers over a period prescribed by the homeownership plan) to the sum of: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The seller's paid-in equity; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The portion of the resale proceeds attributable to any improvements paid for or performed by the seller during
homeownership tenure; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) An allowance for appreciation in value, calculated by a fair and reasonable method specified in the homeownership
plan (e.g., according to a price index factor or other measure). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Third method. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirements of this section may be satisfied by any other fair and reasonable arrangement that will accomplish
the essential purposes stated in paragraph (a) of this section.

Determinations of fair market value under this section shall be made on the basis of appraisal within a reasonable
time prior to sale by an independent appraiser, to be selected by the Housing Authority.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Sale proceeds may, after provision for sale and administrative costs that are necessary and reasonable for carrying
out the homeownership plan, be retained by the Housing Authority and used for housing assistance to low-income families
(as such families are defined under the 1937 Act). The term ``sale proceeds'' includes all payments made by purchasers
for credit to the purchase price (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
earnest money, down payments, payments out of the proceeds of mortgage loans, and principal and interest payments
under purchase-money mortgages), along with any amounts payable upon resale under &sect;907.14, and interest earned
on all such receipts. (Residual receipts, as defined in the ACC, shall not be treated as sale proceeds.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Permissible uses.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Sale proceeds may be used for any one or more of the following forms of housing assistance for low-income families,
at the discretion of the Housing Authority and as stated in the HUD-approved homeownership plan: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In connection with the homeownership plan from which the funds are derived, for special purposes that are justified
to ensure the success of the plan, and to protect the interests of the homeowners, the Housing Authority and any other
entity with responsibility for carrying out the plan. Examples include a reserve for loans to homeowners to prevent
or cure default, or for other emergency housing needs; a reserve for any contingent liabilities of the Housing Authority
under the homeownership plan (such as Housing Authority guaranty of mortgage loans); and a reserve for Housing Authority
repurchase, repair and resale of homes in the event of defaults. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In connection with another HUD-approved homeownership plan under this part, for assistance to purchasers and
for reasonable planning and administrative costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In connection with a State or local homeownership program for low-income families, for assistance to purchasers
and for reasonable planning and administrative costs. Under such programs, sales proceeds may be used to construct
or acquire additional dwellings for sale to low-income families, or to assist such families in purchasing other dwellings
from public or private owners. Where this kind of use is proposed, the homeownership plan must include a description
of the State or local homeownership program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) In connection with the Housing Authority's other public housing that remains under ACC, for any purposes authorized
for the use of operating funds under the ACC and applicable provisions of the 1937 Act and Federal regulations, as included
in the HUD-approved operating budgets. Examples include maintenance and modernization, augmentation of operating
reserves, protective services, and resident services. Such use shall not result in the reduction of the operating
subsidy otherwise payable to the Housing Authority under 24 CFR part 990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Housing Authority shall be responsible for the maintenance of records (including sales and financial records,
which contain racial and ethnic characteristics of the purchasers) for all activities incident to implementation
of the HUD-approved homeownership plan. These records include those pertaining to the affirmative fair housing
marketing strategy and the nondiscriminatory selection of purchasers. Until all planned sales of individual dwellings
have been completed, the Housing Authority shall submit to HUD annual sales reports, in a form prescribed by HUD. The
receipt, retention, and use of the sale proceeds shall be covered in the regular independent audits of the Housing
Authority's public housing operations, and any supplementary audits that HUD may find necessary for monitoring.
Where another entity is responsible for sale of individual units, pursuant to &sect;907.7(b), the Housing Authority
must ensure that the entity's responsibilities include proper record keeping and accountability to the Housing
Authority, sufficient to enable the Housing Authority to monitor compliance with the approved homeownership plan,
to prepare its reports to HUD, and to meet its audit responsibilities. All books and records shall be subject to inspection
and audit by HUD and the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Whether to develop and submit a proposed homeownership plan is a matter within the discretion of the Housing Authority.
The Housing Authority may initiate a proposal at any time, according to the following procedures: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Conditional approval.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Conditional approval may be given, at HUD discretion, where HUD determines that to be justified. For example, conditional
HUD approval might be a necessary precondition for the Housing Authority to obtain the funding commitments required
to satisfy the requirements for final HUD approval of a complete homeownership plan. Where conditional approval
is granted, HUD will specify the conditions in writing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon HUD notification to the Housing Authority that the homeownership plan is approvable (in final form that satisfies
all applicable requirements of this part), the Housing Authority and HUD will execute a written implementing agreement,
in a form prescribed by HUD, to evidence HUD approval and authorization for implementation. The plan itself, as approved
by HUD, shall be incorporated in the implementing agreement. Any of the items of supporting documentation may also
be incorporated, if agreeable to the parties. The Housing Authority shall be obligated to carry out the approved homeownership
plan and other provisions of the implementing agreement without modification, except with written approval by HUD.

Other information.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Any other information that may reasonably be required for HUD review of the plan. HUD approval is not required for documents
to be prepared and used by the Housing Authority in implementing the plan (such as contracts, applications, deeds,
mortgages, promissory notes, and cooperative or condominium documents), if their essential terms and conditions
are described in the plan. Consequently, those documents need not be submitted as part of the plan or the supporting
documentation.
