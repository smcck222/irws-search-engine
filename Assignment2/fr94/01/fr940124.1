SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model
747 series airplanes. This proposal would require inspections to detect cracking in certain fuselage upper deck
tension ties, and repair or modification of any cracked tension ties. This proposal is prompted by reports of fatigue
cracking in tension ties. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of two or more tension
ties and the resultant rapid decompression of the airplane.

Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Recently, the FAA has received reports of fatigue cracking in the tension ties on several Boeing Model 747 series airplanes.
Most of the cracks were found in the aft channel of the tension tie. These cracks usually occurred in the upper flange
of the aft channel of the tension tie. Only one crack was found in the forward channel of the tension tie. The cause of
this fatigue cracking has been attributed to the tension ties bending under cabin pressurization loads. This condition,
if not corrected, could result in rapid decompression of the airplane in the event of failure of two or more tension
ties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These reports of fatigue cracks were received in response to the Supplemental Structural Inspection Program, which
was required to be implemented by AD 93&hyph;06&hyph;01, Amendment 39&hyph;8526 (58 FR 19571, April 15, 1993). The
purpose of that AD is to implement an inspection program that detects the potential for cracking in specific areas
of the airplane that are critical for flight safety. Whenever cracks are found in a Structural Significant Item, the
FAA takes rulemaking action to correct these findings of an unsafe condition. This proposal is in response to such
a finding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 4, 1984, the FAA issued AD 84&hyph;19&hyph;01, amendment 39&hyph;4913 (49 FR 36365, September 17, 1984),
to require inspections of the tension tie at body station (BS) 760 on a certain group of Model 747 series airplanes,
and at BS 780 on certain other Model 747 series airplanes. The inspections proposed by this rulemaking action do not
retract the inspection requirements of that AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53&hyph;2371, dated July 29, 1993, that describes
procedures for repetitive detailed visual inspections of the outboard ends of certain tension ties, and repair or
modification of cracked tension ties. This modification entails trimming the cracked portion of the channel of the
tension tie. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require repetitive detailed visual inspections of the outboard ends of certain tension
ties, and repair or modification of cracked tension ties. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance
with the service bulletin described previously.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
There are approximately 203 Boeing Model 747 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA
estimates that 113 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
5 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based
on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $31,075, or $275 per airplane.
This total cost figure assumes that no operator has yet accomplished the proposed requirements of this AD action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM is announcing receipt of a proposed amendment submitted by Indiana as a modification to the State's permanent
regulatory program (hereinafter referred to as the Indiana program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation
Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The amendment (number 93&hyph;7) consists of proposed changes to the Indiana Surface Mining
Rules provisions concerning OSM Regulatory Reform I, II, and III issues, required program amendments, and State
initiatives. The primary focus of the amendments is on soil capability and restoration standards, individual civil
penalties, significant/nonsignificant revisions, coal exploration, and performance bonds. The amendment is
intended to resolve outstanding issues that remain present in the approved Indiana program resulting from changes
to the Federal program. The amendment would also incorporate changes desired by the State that address various parts
of the State rules.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background on the Indiana Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On July 29, 1982, the Indiana program was made effective by the conditional approval of the Secretary of the Interior.
Information pertinent to the general background on the Indiana program, including the Secretary's findings, the
disposition of comments, and a detailed explanation of the conditions of approval of the Indiana program can be found
in the July 26, 1982, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (47 FR 32107). Subsequent actions concerning the conditions of approval and program amendments are identified at
30 CFR 914.10, 914,15, and 914.16.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Discussion of the Proposed Amendments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since July 29, 1982, (the date of conditional approval of the Indiana program), a number of changes have been made to
the Federal regulations concerning surface coal mining and reclamation operations. Pursuant to the Federal regulations
at 30 CFR 732.17, OSM informed Indiana on May 22, 1985 (Regulatory Reform I), on August 24, 1988 (Regulatory Reform
II), and on September 20, 1989 (Regulatory Reform III), that a number of Indiana regulations are less effective than
or inconsistent with the revised Federal requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter date December 30, 1993 (Administrative Record No. IND&hyph;1322), the Indiana Department of Natural Resources
(IDNR) submitted to OSM a State program amendment package (number 93&hyph;7) consisting of revisions to 38 sections
of the Indiana rules. These revisions address changes to the Indiana program that were identified in the three letters
referred to above, and certain required program amendments. The State has also proposed additional changes which
Indiana believes will further improve the approved State program. The primary focus of the submittal is on soil capability
and restoration standards, individual civil penalties, significant/non-significant revisions, coal exploration,
and performance bonds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following rulemaking actions are being proposed by Indiana:

The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 and has determined
that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15 and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed State regulatory programs
and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination of whether the submittal is
consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other requirements of 30 CFR parts
730, 731, and 732 have been met.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Hence, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.

regulatory program (hereinafter, the ``Utah program'') under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of
1977 (SMCRA). The additional revisions for Utah's proposed rules pertain to the scope of rulemaking and promulgation
of rules, hearing requirements for designating areas unsuitable for coal mining, confidentiality of coal exploration
information, and mining in special areas, specifically prime farmland. The amendment is intended to incorporate
the additional flexibility afforded by the revised Federal regulations, clarify ambiguities, and improve operational
efficiency.

II. Proposed Amendment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated August 2, 1993, Utah submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA (administrative
record No. UT&hyph;851). Utah submitted the proposed amendment at its own initiative. Utah proposed revisions to
the Utah Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Board of Oil, Gas and Mining (Board) at Utah Administrative Rules (Utah
Admin. R.) 641&hyph;112&hyph;100, scope of rulemaking, and 641&hyph;112&hyph;200, promulgation of rules. Utah
also proposed revisions to the Utah Coal Mining Rules at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;500, petitions to initiate
rulemaking; 645&hyph;103&hyph;441, hearing requirements for designating areas unsuitable for coal mining and
reclamation operations; 645&hyph;203&hyph;200, confidentiality of coal exploration information; 645&hyph;301&hyph;524.661,
permit application blasting level chart; 645&hyph;301&hyph;731.760, permit application cross sections and maps
showing hydrologic information; and 645&hyph;302&hyph;314.110 and 645&hyph;302&hyph;323.310, special areas
of mining, specifically prime farmland and alluvial valley floors.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 45305) announcing receipt of the amendment and inviting public comment on its adequacy (administrative record
No. UT&hyph;865). The public comment period ended September 27, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns for (1) Utah Admin. R. 641&hyph;112, regarding the incorrect
reference to its rulemaking authority at Utah Code Annotated (UCA) 40&hyph;9&hyph;3.5(2), which was repealed by
Utah in 1993; (2) Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;103&hyph;441, regarding the need for agreement between the petitioners
and intervenors to change the location of a public hearing on a petition to designate lands unsuitable for mining;
(3) Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;203&hyph;200, regarding the proposed deletion of the phrase ``and the information is
confidential'' which would impart a change in the criteria for determining coal exploration information that is
or is not allowed to be held confidential under the Utah program, and the proposed reference to Utah's Government Records
Access and Management Act (GRAMA) in that certain aspects of GRAMA were previously found to be less effective than
the Federal regulations with regard to the restrictions it imposes on the availability of coal exploration information;
and (4) Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;302&hyph;314.110, regarding the need to use the prime farmland soil survey standards
in U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Handbook 436, as it existed on October 5, 1982, and USDA Handbook 18, as it
existed on November 16, 1982.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM notified Utah of the concerns by letter dated December 9, 1993 (administrative record No. UT&hyph;878). Utah
responded in a letter dated January 7, 1994, by submitting a revised amendment (administrative record No. UT&hyph;881).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Utah proposes the following additional revisions to its existing rules. At Utah Admin. R. 641&hyph;112, Utah proposes
to reference UCA 40&hyph;8&hyph;6(1), which applies to rulemaking authority under the Utah Mined Land Reclamation
Act. At Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;103&hyph;441, Utah proposes (1) that unless the petitioners and intervenors agree
otherwise, the Board shall hold a public hearing within 10 months after receipt of a complete petition to designate
lands unsuitable for mining; (2) if all petitioners and intervenors agree that a public hearing is not needed, the
hearing need not be held; and (3) all hearings held under Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;103&hyph;441 will be held in the locality
of the area covered by the petition. At Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;203&hyph;200, Utah proposes to require that the Utah
Division of Oil, Gas and Mining will not make coal information available for public inspection if the person submitting
it requests in writing , at the time of submission, that it not be disclosed and the information is confidential under
the standards of the Federal Act (SMCRA). At Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;302&hyph;314.110, Utah proposes to require
that USDA soils Handbooks 436 and 18 are incorporated by reference as they respectively existed on October 5, 1982,
and November 16, 1982.

This proposed rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866
(Regulatory Planning and Review).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

5. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart
Federal regulations.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is proposing to amend its adjudication regulations concerning compensation
for disabilities or deaths resulting from the chronic effects of in-service exposure to mustard gas and other vesicant
agents. This proposed regulation is based on a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) study of the long-term health effects
of exposure to vesicant agents, commissioned by VA, which found a relationship between such exposure and the subsequent
development of certain conditions. The intended effect of this proposed amendment is to expand and extend compensation
eligibility.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On July 31, 1992, VA published a final regulation (38 CFR 3.316) authorizing service connection in claims from veterans
who underwent full-body exposure to mustard gas during field or chamber experiments to test protective clothing
or equipment during World War II, and who subsequently develop chronic forms of laryngitis, bronchitis, emphysema,
asthma, conjunctivitis, keratitis, or corneal opacities (See 57 FR 1699&hyph;1700 and 57 FR 33875&hyph;77). The
regulation was based on a review of the available English language medical literature dealing with the effects of
exposure to mustard gas by Veterans Health Administration (VHA) personnel. VA also contracted with NAS to conduct
a review of the world medical and scientific literature, including that published in languages other than English,
to determine the long-term health effects of exposure to mustard agents and Lewisite. After reviewing almost 2,000
medical and scientific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
papers, consulting with outside experts, and conducting public hearings, NAS issued that report, entitled ``Veterans
at Risk: The Health Effects of Mustard Gas and Lewisite'', on January 6, 1993. We are proposing to amend 38 CFR 3.316
based upon our review of that report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NAS findings confirmed VA's prior determination that there is a relationship between exposure to mustard gas and
the subsequent development of the seven conditions previously mentioned. NAS also found that the evidence indicated
a causal relationship between exposure to mustard gas and the subsequent development of ``recurrent corneal ulcerative
disease'' and ``delayed recurrent keratitis of the eye.'' In our judgment the term ``corneal opacities,'' used in
the current regulation, is broad enough to include corneal ulcerative disease and we do not propose to change the language
in the current regulation. For reasons discussed below, this regulation will cover specified conditions whether
onset occurred immediately after exposure or was delayed, and we find no reason to modify the term ``keratitis'' which
appears in the current regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NAS also found that the evidence indicated a causal relationship between exposure to mustard gas and the subsequent
development of nasopharyngeal, laryngeal, lung, and skin cancers, pigmentation abnormalities of the skin, and
chronic skin ulceration and scar formation. We propose to add nasopharyngeal, laryngeal and lung cancer (except
mesothelioma) to the list of conditions for which presumptive service connection may be granted based on exposure
to mustard gas. We are proposing to exclude mesothelioma from the regulatory amendment, however, since the only known
cause of that condition is asbestos exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although NAS used the term ``skin cancer'' in the summary of its findings, in our judgment the body of the report, which
refers to squamous cell and basal cell carcinomas of the skin but not malignant melanomas, does not support so broad
a presumption of service connection. Although basal cell skin cancers were noted in some animal studies, these studies
constitute evidence of carcinogenicity rather than evidence of skin cancer because there is no good animal model
for human skin response to mustard agents. Likewise, the one occupational study that described basal cell carcinomas,
Bowen's disease, and other hyperkeratotic skin lesions was too seriously flawed to establish a causal relationship
with exposure to mustard agents. As the report notes, the workers in that study were exposed to all types of gases, not
just mustard gas and Lewisite. Also, those individuals who participated in chamber and field testing suffered acute
rather than chronic exposure like the chemical plant workers in the occupational study, which occurred for many hours
each week over many years. The report states that ``cutaneous cancers following acute sulfur mustard exposure usually
localize in scars,'' and scar cancers are squamous cell carcinomas, not basal cell carcinomas. Finally, since the
1973 Jackson and Adams study, which is cited in the NAS report in reference to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the occurrence of basal cell carcinoma and which included two cases of basal cell carcinomas in World War I veterans,
is not an epidemiologic study, it is difficult to draw conclusions as to whether the findings represent an unusual
rate for basal cell carcinoma. For these reasons, we propose to include only squamous cell carcinomas of the skin.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In our judgment, there is no reason to establish presumptive service connection for ``pigmentation abnormalities
of the skin'' because these abnormalities would be obvious from the time of the exposure to vesicant agents rather
than occurring many years after exposure, as in the case of cancer. Also, because the usual places for mustard gas burns
are areas of the body which are not visible, i.e., moist areas of the body such as the groin and axilla, rather than exposed
areas as in the case of sunburn, most pigmentation abnormalities resulting from these burns would not be considered
disabling, unless they interfered with the veteran's ability to function. In this regard, there is no mention in the
NAS report of vitiligo-type lesions, which are usually considered to be disabling because they are disfiguring.
Since compensation is only payable for a disability resulting from an injury suffered or disease contracted in line
of duty or from aggravation of a preexisting injury or disease contracted in line of duty (See 38 U.S.C. 1110, 1121,
1131, and 1310), and since exposure to vesicant agents does not cause a type of pigmentation abnormality which is disabling,
we do not propose to include pigmentation abnormalities of the skin in the regulation. However, we propose to include
scar formation in the regulation.

In addition to the respiratory conditions VA had previously recognized, NAS found that the evidence indicated a causal
relationship between exposure to mustard gas and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. NAS further found that
all these respiratory conditions could also result from exposure to Lewisite, another vesicant agent. We are proposing
to provide service connection for a chronic form of laryngitis, bronchitis, emphysema, asthma or chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, as a result of exposure to mustard gas or Lewisite. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, NAS determined that the evidence indicated a causal relationship exists between exposure to nitrogen
mustard and the subsequent development of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. Based on that information, we propose
to provide service connection for acute nonlymphocytic leukemia as a result of exposure to nitrogen mustard only.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NAS also found evidence that indicates a causal relationship between mustard gas exposure and the subsequent development
of bone marrow depression, immunosuppression, psychological disorders, and sexual dysfunction, but we do not propose
to allow presumptive service connection for these conditions. Bone marrow depression and immunosuppression are
acute effects that may have resulted in greater susceptibility to infections with a possibility of damage to vital
organ systems. Since these acute effects would have resolved within a relatively short period, however, any related
infection would have occurred in service or shortly thereafter and an adequate regulatory framework to establish
direct service connection already exists. Psychological disorders may result from traumatic or stressful features
of the exposure experience, but are not a toxic effect of the agents themselves. An adequate regulatory framework
currently exists to establish service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of exposure to vesicant
agents. Establishing a presumption of service connection for sexual dysfunction would serve no purpose, since sexual
dysfunction is not compensated under VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (38 CFR Part 4) but rather under 38 U.S.C.
1114(k), which provides special monthly compensation for the loss or loss of use of a creative organ. Special monthly
compensation is a benefit established by Congress, not by VA regulation, and is therefore beyond the scope of this
rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were two other categories of findings in the NAS report. NAS found that the evidence was ``suggestive'' of a causal
relationship between exposure to mustard gas and reproductive dysfunction (genotoxicity, mutagenicity, etc.)
and exposure to sulfur mustard and leukemia. NAS found insufficient evidence of a causal relationship between exposure
to mustard gas and gastrointestinal diseases, hematologic diseases, neurological diseases, cardiovascular diseases,
and for reproductive dysfunction as a result of exposure to Lewisite. As NAS itself indicates, further study in these
areas is necessary and in our judgment, the scientific and medical evidence on the whole does not support the establishment
of presumptions for these conditions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the revised regulation will address the effects of Lewisite as well as mustard agents, we propose to revise the
heading of 38 CFR 3.316 to indicate that the regulation addresses claims based on chronic effects of exposure to vesicant
agents rather than mustard gas only. The current regulation applies only to those veterans exposed while participating
in secret tests of protective equipment during World War II; we propose to expand it to cover any verified full-body
exposure during military service, which will allow veterans exposed to mustard gas under battlefield conditions
in World War I, those present at the German air raid on the harbor of Bari, Italy, in World War II, and those engaged in
manufacturing and handling vesicant agents during their military service to be eligible for consideration under
this regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are not proposing to include veterans who were exposed to vesicant agents via patch or drop testing. The literature
upon which the NAS report is based covered animal studies and two types of human studies: (1) Industrial studies of
workers in chemical factories which manufactured mustard gas; and (2) studies of soldiers exposed to mustard gas
in warfare, primarily during World War I. These studies involved full-body exposure, not patch testing. The NAS report
does not discuss any studies relevant to patch or drop testing. However, the NAS report concluded that the exposure
of many participants in chamber and field tests was equivalent to that of soldiers in World War I, and therefore the
NAS report concluded that the World War I and chronic exposure studies were relevant to the experience in the chamber
and field tests. Since the NAS report only considered studies involving full-body exposure, we believe that the NAS
findings regarding specific diseases are linked only to full-body exposure, and not to patch or drop testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also propose to amend 38 CFR 3.316 by adding a requirement that service connection will not be established if there
is affirmative evidence that establishes a nonservice-related supervening condition or event as the cause of the
claimed condition. The current regulation is based upon a literature search of the immediate and short-term effects
of mustard gas exposure by the Veterans Health Administration, which revealed that nonfatal exposures to mustard
gas result in an immediate acute injury. It was also reported that any chronic disability related to mustard gas exposure
should appear shortly after the exposure and continue to the present. The NAS report, however, found that delayed
effects of mustard gas exposure may appear even though no acute effects were noted. Because of this delay in manifestation
of effects of mustard gas exposure reported by the NAS, during which time the veteran may have been exposed to other
nonservice-related causative conditions or events, we have determined that it is reasonable to consider evidence
of intervening cause which may exist, just as we do for other presumptive conditions (See 38 CFR 3.307(b)).

The Secretary hereby certifies that this regulatory amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. The reason
for this certification is that this amendment would not directly affect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries
could be directly affected. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), this amendment is exempt from the initial and
final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of sections 603 and 604.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing this action to impose sanctions on California under the discretionary
sanction authority provided the Agency under the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, (CAA or Act) for failure by the State
to submit a complete SIP revision for an enhanced motor vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) program as required
by the Act for certain ozone and carbon monoxide (CO) nonattainment areas. On November 13, 1992, the California Air
Resources Board (CARB), acting as the governor's designee, submitted a commitment (committal SIP) to adopt an I/M
program by November 15, 1993. The committal SIP provides for the adoption and implementation of an enhanced I/M program
meeting all requirements of EPA's I/M regulations and includes an implementation schedule. On June 28, 1993, EPA
proposed to conditionally approve this committal SIP or alternatively to disapprove it if certain milestones contained
in the schedule were missed. A full SIP revision including state legislative authority to implement the program was
required by November 15, 1993. The State Legislature adjourned on September 10, 1993 without having enacted legislation
providing authority for implementing the enhanced I/M program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 15, 1993, the State submitted a document entitled ``Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance Program SIP Revision''
(the ``proposed SIP revision''). The proposed SIP revision was missing critical elements required for compliance
with section 182(c)(3) of the Act. On December 30, 1993, EPA Region 9 issued a letter finding that the State had failed
to submit a complete SIP revision required under sections 110 and 182 of the Act. The letter dated December 30, 1993,
notified the State that the proposed SIP revision was incomplete because it had not been subject to public notice.
Due to the failure of the State to submit a complete SIP revision fulfilling either the requirements of the Act or its
commitment to adopt and implement an enhanced I/M program as promised in its committal SIP, EPA proposes to exercise
its discretionary authority under the Act to apply a statewide highway funding limitation sanction and a 2 for 1 offset
sanction in all areas required to have a permit program under the new source review provisions of the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As amended in 1990, the Clean Air Act requires states to make changes to improve existing I/M programs or to implement
new ones for certain nonattainment areas. Section 182(a)(2)(B) of the Act directed EPA to publish updated guidance
for state I/M programs, taking into consideration findings of the Administrator's audits and investigations of
these programs. The Act further requires each area required to have an I/M program to incorporate this guidance into
the SIP. Based on these requirements, EPA promulgated I/M regulations on November 5, 1992 (57 FR 52950). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under sections 182(c)(3) and 187(b)(1) of the Act, areas designated as serious and worse ozone nonattainment areas
with 1980 populations of 200,000 or more and CO nonattainment areas with design classifications above 12.7 ppm and
populations of 200,000 or more, in addition to metropolitan statistical areas with populations of 100,000 or more
in the northeast ozone transport region, are required to meet EPA regulations for ``enhanced'' I/M programs. These
areas were required to submit a SIP revision to incorporate an enhanced I/M program into the SIP by November 15, 1992.
In California, the State must adopt and implement enhanced I/M programs for the following urbanized areas:

The I/M regulation establishes minimum performance standards for basic and enhanced I/M programs as well as requirements
for the following: Network type and program evaluation; adequate tools and resources; test frequency and convenience;
vehicle coverage; test procedures and standards; test equipment; quality control; waivers and compliance via diagnostic
inspection; motorist compliance enforcement; motorist compliance enforcement program oversight; quality assurance;
enforcement against contractors, stations and inspectors; data collection; data analysis and reporting; inspector
training and licensing or certification; public information and consumer protection; improving repair effectiveness;
compliance with recall notices; on-road testing; SIP revisions; and implementation deadlines. For enhanced I/M
programs, all requirements must be implemented by January 1, 1995 except that areas switching from an existing test-and-repair
network to a test-only network may phase in that change between January 1995 and January 1996. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each State required to implement an I/M program was required to submit by November 15, 1992, a SIP revision (here and
after referred to as the ``I/M committal SIP'') including two elements: (1) A commitment from the Governor or his/her
designee to the timely adoption and implementation of an I/M program meeting all requirements of the I/M regulation;
and (2) a schedule for adoption of the program with interim milestones including passage of enabling statutory or
other legal authority and adoption of final regulations. Acceptance of I/M committal SIPs in lieu of full SIPs was
justified by the fact that States could not have been expected to begin development of an I/M program meeting the requirements
of the Act and the I/M regulation until the I/M regulation was adopted as a final rule, which did not occur until November
5, 1992. A complete SIP revision which contained all of the elements identified in the adoption schedule, including
the authorizing legislation and implementing regulations, was required to be submitted no later than November 15,
1993.

B. I/M Program in California 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. California Committal SIP: The State of California submitted an I/M committal SIP on November 13, 1992. The committal
SIP submittal became complete by operation of law under section 110(k)(1)(B) on May 13, 1993. The submittal includes
a letter from the Executive Officer of the CARB and a copy of Resolution 92&hyph;74 which was adopted at a public hearing
held by the CARB on November 13, 1992. The Resolution directs the Executive Officer to submit the committal letter
to EPA as a revision to the SIP. The submittal included a commitment by the governor's designee, the CARB Executive
Officer, to the timely adoption and implementation of I/M programs meeting all requirements of the I/M regulation
and the Act in all nonattainment areas in California where these programs are required. A schedule of adoption was
included in a letter sent by the CARB Executive Officer to EPA on January 15, 1993 clarifying certain details of the
November 13, 1992 I/M committal SIP submittal. In the schedule California committed to passing legislation authorizing
an I/M program by September 10, 1993. The committal SIP lists October 10, 1993 as the deadline for the legislation to
be signed by the governor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. EPA Proposed Approval: On June 28, 1993 (58 FR 34553) EPA proposed to conditionally approve the committal SIP under
section 110(k)(4) of the Act. In the alternative, however, EPA proposed that, if the State failed to adopt legislative
authority or meet certain other applicable interim milestones in the commitment prior to EPA's final action on the
submittal, EPA would disapprove the committal SIP. The basis for such disapproval would be a determination that California
could not meet the November 15, 1993 SIP revision submission date if it failed to meet the interim milestones. Therefore,
since the State could not meet its commitment, final approval under section 110(k)(4) would not be appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. State Legislative Action: On November 15, 1993 California failed to meet its commitment to EPA. By letter dated
December 30, 1993, EPA Region 9 notified the State that the proposed SIP revision submitted on November 15, 1993, did
not contain the critical elements required by statute and that the State had failed to submit a complete SIP revision
as required by the Act. For example, the proposed SIP revision did not contain legislative authority for the State
to implement the proposed SIP revision. In addition, EPA Region 9 notified the State that the proposed SIP revision
was an incomplete SIP submittal because it was not subject to a public hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the State failed to meet the interim deadlines in its committal SIP. California was required to obtain legislative
authority for the adoption and implementation of an enhanced I/M program during the 1993 legislative session under
the November 15, 1992 I/M committal SIP submittal. Bills to change California's existing I/M program were introduced
during the 1993 legislative session and hearings were held by the Senate and Assembly Transportation Committees.
The legislature adjourned, however, on September 10, 1993 without having adopted I/M legislation. Failure to provide
such authority prevented California from submitting a complete SIP revision by November 15, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Earlier this year, EPA anticipated the possibility that the California legislature would fail to adopt necessary
legislation during the 1993 legislative session. On April 13, 1993, EPA and the U.S. Department of Transportation
sent a joint letter to Governor Wilson advising him that EPA would exercise its discretionary authority under section
110(m) of the Act to impose sanctions if the legislature failed to adopt adequate legislation. On November 24, 1993,
EPA issued a press statement indicating that EPA would temporarily halt the process of imposing sanctions to permit
discussions between the parties to resolve the issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Importance of Timely Implementation of Appropriate I/M Programs: Beyond being a specific mandate of the Act, enhanced
I/M programs play an important role in the ability of California areas to comply with the CAA requirements for achieving
the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone and CO, as well as the Act's requirements for reasonable
further progress (RFP) reductions for ozone. The Act provides that each state in which all or part of an ozone and/or
CO nonattainment area are located is required to provide an attainment demonstration showing that its SIP, as revised,
will provide for attainment of the ozone and/or CO NAAQS by the applicable attainment date(s). The Act further requires
that each state in which all or part of a serious, severe, or extreme ozone nonattainment area is located shall submit
SIP revisions that will reduce VOC emissions by November 15, 1996 by at least 15% of the 1990 baseline emissions. If
the reductions identified in the SIP revisions are less than 15% of the baseline emissions, the State may obtain a waiver
under section 182(b)(1)(A)(ii); this requires the State to make several demonstrations, including one that the
plan reflecting the lesser amount includes all measures that can feasibly be implemented in the area in light of technological
achievability. Many areas in California will have difficulty meeting the RFP requirements because credit for certain
pre-1990 CAA programs, such as the federal motor vehicle control program and basic I/M, is not allowed. The additional
benefits of enhanced I/M, however, are fully creditable towards meeting the RFP requirement. Enhanced I/M is one
of the most powerful tools available to areas in terms of providing expeditious reductions in both VOC and NOx, both
of which are treated in most California plans as precursors of ozone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, a federally approvable enhanced I/M program represents one of the most cost-effective air quality control
strategies available. Without an effective I/M program, attainment of the ozone and CO air quality standard is virtually
impossible. Without appropriate enabling legislation, an enhanced I/M program cannot be implemented.

II. Sanctions Under the Clean Air Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This sanction action is being proposed under EPA's discretionary authority contained in section 110(m) of the Act.
The predicate findings and types of sanctions are described in section 179 of the Act. The two sanctions available
to EPA for application under section 110(m), as provided in section 179(b), are: (1) A prohibition on the funding of
certain highway projects; and (2) an increase in the emission offset requirement for new and modified major stationary
sources. The highway funding sanction prohibits approval by the Secretary of Transportation of any projects or the
awarding by the Secretary of any grants, under Title 23 of the U.S. Code, other than projects or grants for safety and
certain other categories of projects listed in section 179(b)(1). The offset sanction requires that, when States
apply the emission offset requirement of section 173 to new or modified sources, the ratio of emission reductions
to increased emissions must be at least 2 to 1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 179(a) of the Act sets forth the findings
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 which provide EPA with discretion under section 110(m) to impose one or both of the sanctions specified under section
179(b). The four findings are: (1) A state has failed, for a nonattainment area, to submit a SIP or an element of a SIP,
or that the SIP or SIP element submitted fails to meet the completeness criteria of section 110(k); (2) EPA disapproves
a SIP submission for a nonattainment area based on the submission's failure to meet one or more plan elements required
by the Act; (3) a State has not made any other submission required by the Act or has made a submission that does not meet
the completeness criteria or has made a required submission that is disapproved by EPA for not meeting the Act's requirements;
or (4) a requirement of an approved plan is not being implemented.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 179(a), unless the State corrects the deficiency, one of the two sanctions listed in section 179(b)
must be imposed 18 months after a finding is made, and the second must be imposed 6 months after the first sanction is
imposed if the deficiency remains uncorrected.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, both sanctions shall apply after 18 months if the Administrator finds a lack of good faith on the part of
the State.

On October 1, 1993, EPA proposed a rule governing the order in which the sanctions shall apply under section 179 of the
Act. 58 FR 51270. The rule proposes that the offset sanctions apply first and the highway sanctions apply second. According
to the proposed rule, EPA may change this sequence of sanctions through individual notice and comment rulemaking.
This proposed sequencing applies only to mandatory sanctions that apply under section 179(a) and does not govern
sanctions imposed under section 110(m).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although section 179(a) establishes mandatory deadlines for the application of sanctions at certain points after
a finding of deficiency, section 110(m) provides EPA with the discretion to impose section 179(b) sanctions at any
time (or at any time after) a section 179(a) finding. Likewise, although mandatory sanctions under section 179 are
limited to the area with the deficiency, section 110(m) authorizes EPA to apply discretionary sanctions to any portion
of the state that EPA deems reasonable and appropriate to ensure that the requirements of the Act are met. See 57 FR 44534,
44536&hyph;44537. However, the Act requires EPA to establish by rule criteria to ensure that such sanctions are not
applied on a statewide basis where one or more political subdivisions covered by the applicable implementation plan
are principally responsible for the deficiency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 28, 1992, EPA proposed criteria under section 110(m) that it would use when proposing statewide sanctions
to determine if one or more political subdivisions is principally responsible for a SIP deficiency. 57 FR 44534. These
proposed criteria are discussed later in this notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to California, EPA is using its discretionary authority under section 110(m) to propose early sanctions
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 based on California's failure to adopt legislation to improve its I/M program. EPA is taking this action for two reasons:
(1) Congress required timely submittal of enhanced I/M programs as a measure central to allowing the State's metropolitan
areas to meet CAA deadlines, and any legislative delay threatens the States's ability to meet those deadlines, and
(2) enhanced I/M is the single most effective air pollution control measure available. Delayed legislative approval
of an acceptable I/M program places a disproportionate burden for cleaning the air on the State's major industrial
sources_additional burdens which are especially problematic given California's current economic difficulties.

EPA issued its letter on December 30, 1993, finding that the state's proposed SIP revision was a failure to submit a
SIP revision as required by the Act and, in addition, was an incomplete SIP submittal. Mandatory sanctions were triggered
under Section 179(a) by issuance of the letter notifying the state of the finding of deficiency.

III. Proposed Sanctions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Finding Under Section 179(a)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated previously, on December 30, 1993, EPA Region 9 issued a letter notifying the state of its failure to submit
a complete SIP revision on November 15, 1993, as required by the Act. EPA's letter constitutes a finding under section
179(a) that triggers EPA's discretionary authority to impose the sanctions proposed in this notice under section
110(m). Further, on June 28, 1993, EPA proposed to conditionally approve California's I/M committal SIP for both
basic and enhanced I/M programs. EPA also proposed, in the alternative, to disapprove this commitment if the state
failed to adopt authorizing legislation and to submit the required I/M programs by the November 15, 1993 date. California
has also now failed to adopt and submit such programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If sufficient progress has not been made by California toward the implementation of an approvable I/M program to be
operational on or before January 1, 1995, EPA hereby announces its intention to impose sanctions on May 15, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Rationale and Approach for Section 110(m) Sanctions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 110(m) of the Act allows EPA to apply the highway and offset sanctions at any time (or at any time after) it makes
a finding under section 179(a). Based on its finding dated December 30, 1993, EPA is proposing to impose both the highway
and offset sanctions. EPA believes that the imposition of highway sanctions is appropriate because of California's
failure to adopt legislation to enhance its existing smog check program. In the absence of improved smog check, the
ability of the State's metropolitan areas to meet the Clean Air Act deadlines for attaining healthy air quality is
severely compromised. As previously noted, enhanced smog check is the single most effective air pollution control
measures available and delayed legislative approval of an acceptable program further burdens major industrial
sources of air pollution with responsibility for cleaning the air.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 110(m), EPA may apply sanctions to any portion of the state it determines is reasonable and appropriate.
During the 24 months following the finding, EPA may not impose the sanctions statewide if one or more political subdivisions
within the state is principally responsible for the deficiency that is the basis for sanctions. EPA has proposed criteria
for determining when a political subdivision is principally responsible (57 FR 44534, September 28, 1992). The criteria
provide that a political subdivision is principally responsible if: (1) It has the legal authority to perform the
required activity; (2) it has traditionally performed, or has been delegated the responsibility to perform, the
required activity; (3) it has received, where appropriate, adequate funding, or authority to obtain funding, from
the state to perform the required activity; (4) it has agreed to perform (and has not revoked that agreement), or is
required by state law to accept responsibility for performing, the required activity; and (5) it has failed to perform
the required activity. A ``political subdivision'' is defined as the representative body that is responsible for
adopting and/or implementing air pollution controls for any combination of political subdivisions created by,
or pursuant to, Federal or State law. If no political subdivision meets all 5 criteria, EPA may use its discretion to
determine whether it is reasonable and appropriate to apply sanctions on a statewide basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this notice, EPA is proposing to use the above proposed criteria to determine if it may impose the highway sanction
statewide for California because of the State's failure to submit a complete SIP revision complying with the I/M committal
SIP revision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the first criterion has not been met by any political subdivision. Only the California legislature
has the authority to revise the state statute to provide for an enhanced I/M program meeting the CAA and EPA requirements.
Once the legislature has acted, only state government agencies can adopt any implementing regulations. While individual
air pollution control district or air quality management districts may request implementation of the state I/M program
once adopted, this authority is meaningless unless the State has first established an appropriate program through
legislation and regulations. Since the state legislature has not enacted the legislation required to provide the
legal authority for an enhanced I/M program meeting the CAA and EPA requirements, an enhanced I/M program is not available
to areas within the state that require the program.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since no political subdivision within the state has met the first criterion, EPA believes that no political subdivision
is principally responsible for the failure to have an enhanced I/M program. Therefore, EPA is not prohibited from
imposing highway sanctions statewide. As noted above, the state legislature bears the ultimate responsibility
to adopt the requisite legislative authority and CARB, not the individual air quality districts, must subsequently
adopt adequate regulations. Since the state bears ultimate responsibility, EPA believes that it is reasonable and
appropriate to impose sanctions on the entire State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The offset requirements apply only to new or modified major stationary sources located in or to be located in areas
that are required to have a permit program pursuant to section 173. Thus, the offset sanctions are limited to those
areas which are required to have a permit program, i.e., the ozone and CO nonattainment areas. For ozone, those areas
are: Monterey, Santa Barbara, San Diego, San Francisco Bay Area, South Coast, Ventura, Sacramento, San Joaquin Valley,
and the South East Desert. The offset sanction would apply to all new or modified major stationary sources for VOCs
and NOx that are locating to or located in each of these areas and for such sources of CO that are located in or locating
to the following CO nonattainment areas: Chico, Sacramento, San Diego, San Francisco, San Joaquin, and South Coast.
EPA proposes to impose the offset sanctions in the manner described in the proposed action on the sequencing of sanctions
(58 FR 51270, 51275&hyph;51277 (October 1, 1993)).

C. Removal of Discretionary Sanctions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to temporarily lift (i.e., toll)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the highway and offset sanctions imposed under section 110(m) upon passage by the California legislature and signature
by the Governor of legislation which EPA preliminarily determines provides legal authority for an enhanced I/M program
meeting the requirements of the CAA and the I/M regulation. EPA proposes to notify the state of this tolling by a letter
to the Governor and the public by a notice published in the notice section of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The section 110(m) sanctions would not be completely lifted until the State makes a complete submittal of its enhanced
I/M program for the State of California. EPA will take action to completely lift section 110(m) sanctions at the time
it determines the State's submittal to be complete or it is deemed complete. A complete submittal is one that contains
all the critical elements listed in the I/M regulation as determined through the completeness criteria in section
110(k)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
As a general rule, an Agency must go through rulemaking to remove or alter a requirement imposed through rulemaking.
While U.S. EPA intends to issue a notice tolling the 110(m) sanction upon the occurrence of the events described, U.S.
EPA will use the good cause exception to the otherwise applicable requirement for proposed rulemaking. EPA believes
there is good cause to toll the sanctions once the state takes the action which cures the defficiency that resulted
in the imposition of sanctions. See 5 U.S.C.&sect;553(b)(B). Therefore, no proposed action for removal will be issued.
Consistent with U.S. EPA's intent to impose discretionary sanctions only on those areas that lack legislative authority,
EPA believes that it is in the public interest to remove, at least temporarily, these discretionary sanctions as expeditiously
as possible once the State of California has enacted legislative authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As an alternative, if EPA takes final action disapproving California's committal SIP prior to taking final action
imposing sanctions, EPA proposes that such disapproval be the basis for imposing the discretionary sanctions. In
such case, the sanctions would be tolled in the same manner; however, if the disapproval is the final basis for imposing
the sanctions, such sanctions would not be completely lifted until EPA formally approves an enhanced I/M program
for the State of California. In such a case, EPA would take action to lift the sanctions at the same time as EPA took final
action approving the State's I/M program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's action imposing or tolling the section 110(m) sanctions will in no manner affect EPA's obligation to impose
mandatory sanctions under section 179(a) where one mandatory sanction shall apply 18 months after EPA's finding
of incompleteness and the second mandatory sanction shall apply 6 months later. Sanctions under section 179(a) apply
to the area for which the deficiency exists. If the State does not adopt and submit to EPA a complete submittal providing
for an I/M program within the 18-month and additional 6-month periods, the sanctions will automatically apply to
those areas of the state that were required to have but do not have such a complete I/M program under the amended Act.
See 58 FR 51270 (October 1, 1993). Moreover, if EPA takes final action disapproving California's I/M committal SIP,
a second sanctions clock will be triggered and California must not only submit an I/M program, but EPA must also approve
that program within the relevant time frames to stop the mandatory sanctions clock and avoid sanctions on the final
disapproval.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and, therefore, subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review and the requirements
of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule
that may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the right and obligations

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory
action''. Nevertheless after reviewing information regarding this action, OMB has waived review.

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.
Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction
over populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA cannot reliably predict the impact of these restrictions because of the exemptions authorized for certain highway
projects related to mass transit, public safety, and those that have beneficial air quality impacts. Careful review
and evaluation of each project is necessary to determine whether or not a project is exempt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If EPA takes final action on this proposal, the 2 to 1 emissions offset requirement will apply to major new sources and
major modifications to the existing sources of volatile organic compounds (VOC), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and carbon
monoxide (CO) in the California ozone and carbon monoxide areas subject to section 173(c) offset requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Major stationary sources of VOC, NOX, and CO are generally not small entities. Also, the 2 to 1 emission offset requirement
does not prevent growth and modification but sets a higher offset standard than the current offset required. It is
not expected that a large number of small entities will be affected by the emission offset requirement. In the past,
when EPA has made efforts to quantify the impact of the Act's rules on the construction and modification of sources,
EPA has been unable to do so due, in part, to the need to obtain information on future plans for business growth. This
information is difficult to obtain, as business are understandably reluctant to make their plans public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing to impose Federal highway funding assistance limitations statewide. This limitation could affect
a number of government entities with populations of less than 50,000 since government entities often apply for and
receive federal funding under Title 23, United States Code, for road improvement projects. Although a great many
projects are exempted under section 179(b)(1)(B), a number of projects are expected to be affected if EPA takes final
action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons stated above, EPA cannot further analyze the economic impacts of this action on small entities. The
statements in this package constitute EPA's full regulatory flexibility analysis.

C. Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule does not contain any information collection requirements which require OMB approval under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.). Should the highway sanctions become effective, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT)
is required to determine which projects or grants should not be affected by the sanction and which, therefore, are
exempt. This determination will be based on information readily available in existing documentation gathered for
the purpose of evaluating the environmental, social, and economic impacts of different alternatives for transportation

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projects. These analyses are already required for the preparation of environmental assessments and impact statements
under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Historically, exemption determinations by USDOT for sanctions have been based on such NEPA documentation and have
not necessitated additional information gathering and analysis by the States. In addition, since under NEPA final
environmental documents must be approved by USDOT, in most cases the NEPA documentation will already be in USDOT's
possession. Therefore, EPA does not believe that the highway sanction, when applied, will impose an additional information
collection burden on the states.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the offset sanction applies, sources subject to it will not incur an additional information collection burden
because sources are already required under the section 173 offset requirements to obtain an emission offset from
between 1 to 1 and 1.5 to 1 (depending on the classification of the nonattainment area in which they are located). Should
the offset sanction apply, it would not impose an additional information collection burden because sources will
not have to provide additional information in the application beyond that which they would already have to provide
in the absence of the sanction. (For the information collection burden of new requirements of the amended Act for nonattainment
new source review (NSR) and prevention of significant deterioration, an information collection request is being
prepared to support rulemaking changes to parts 51 and 52.)

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) is proposing this action to impose sanctions on Illinois under
the discretionary authority provided to the Agency under the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, (CAA or Act) for failure
by the State to meet its commitment to adopt a basic and enhanced motor vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) program
as required by the Act for certain ozone nonattainment areas. On November 11, 1992, the Illinois Environmental Protection
Agency (IEPA), acting as the governor's designee, submitted a commitment to adopt (Committal SIP) an I/M program
to meet the requirements of the Act and the I/M rule by November 15, 1993. The committal SIP provides for the adoption
and implementation of a basic and enhanced I/M program meeting all requirements of US EPA's I/M regulations and includes
an implementation schedule. On December 2, 1993, US EPA proposed to disapprove this SIP revision based on the failure
by the State to meet milestones contained in the committal SIP's implementation schedule pertaining to the enactment
of necessary legislative authority. A full SIP revision including State legislative authority to implement the
program was required by November 15, 1993. The Illinois General Assembly adjourned on November 4, 1993, for the second
time this year without taking necessary action to provide for implementation of the basic and enhanced I/M programs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 30, 1993, EPA Region 5 issued a letter finding that the State had failed to submit the SIP revision required
under sections 110 and 182 of the Act. Due to the failure of the State to submit a complete SIP revision fulfilling either
the requirements of the Act and its commitment to adopt and implement the required I/M programs as promised in its committal
SIP, USEPA proposes to exercise its discretionary authority under the Act to apply a statewide highway funding limitation
sanction and a 2 for 1 growth offset sanction in all areas required to have a permit program under the new source review
provision of the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Pursuant to the 1977 amendments to the Act, vehicle I/M programs were mandated for certain areas with long standing
air quality problems. The 1990 amendments to the Act expanded the role of I/M programs as an attainment strategy and
required USEPA to develop different performance standards for ``basic'' and ``enhanced'' I/M programs. The performance
standard is the minimum amount of emission reductions a program must achieve, based on a model or benchmark program
design. In addition, the amended Act directed USEPA to address requirements for specific design elements and program
implementation issues for both basic and enhanced I/M programs. The amended Act requires states containing nonattainment
areas to make changes to improve existing I/M programs or implement new ones. Section 182(a)(2)(B) of the Act directed
USEPA to publish updated guidance for state I/M programs, taking into consideration findings of the Administrator's
audits and investigations of these programs. The Act further requires each area required by the Act to have an I/M program
to incorporate this guidance into the SIP. Based on these requirements, USEPA promulgated an I/M regulation on November
5, 1992. (57 FR 52950) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 182(c)(3) of the Act, areas designated as serious or worse ozone nonattainment areas with 1980 populations
of 200,000 or more, in addition to metropolitan statistical areas with populations of 100,000 or more in the northeast
ozone transport region, are required to meet USEPA requirements for ``enhanced'' I/M programs. These areas were
required to submit a SIP revision to incorporate an I/M program by November 15, 1992. In Illinois, the State must implement
I/M programs in the urbanized areas of the Chicago and East St. Louis ozone nonattainment areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The I/M regulation establishes minimum performance standards for basic and enhanced I/M programs as well as requirements
for the following: Network type and program evaluation; adequate tools and resources; test frequency and convenience;
vehicle coverage; test procedures and standards; test equipment; quality control; waivers and compliance via diagnostic
inspection; motorist compliance enforcement; motorist compliance enforcement program oversight; quality assurance;
enforcement against contractors, stations and inspectors; data collection; data analysis and reporting; inspector
training and licensing or certification; public information and consumer protection; improving repair effectiveness;
compliance with recall notices; on-road testing; SIP revisions; and implementation deadlines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For enhanced I/M programs, all requirements must be implemented by January 1, 1995 except that areas switching from
an existing test-and-repair network to a test-only network may phase in that change between January 1995 and January
1996.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Each state required to implement an I/M program was required to submit by November 15, 1992, a SIP revision (here and
after referred to as the ``I/M committal SIP'') including two elements: (1) A commitment from the Governor or his/her
designee to the timely adoption and implementation of an I/M program meeting all the requirements of the I/M regulation;
and (2) a schedule for adoption of the program, with interim milestones including passage of enabling statutory or
other legal authority and adoption of final regulations. Acceptance of I/M committal SIPs in lieu of full SIPs was
justified by the fact that states could not have been expected to begin development of an I/M program meeting the requirements
of the Act and the I/M regulation until the I/M regulation was adopted as a final rule, which did not occur until November
5, 1992. A complete SIP revision which contained all of the elements identified in the adoption schedule, including
the authorizing legislation and implementing regulations, was to be submitted no later than November 15, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 11, 1992, the State of Illinois submitted a committal SIP to USEPA. A public hearing on this submittal was
held by the State on October 27, 1992, in Springfield, Illinois. The submittal included a schedule of implementation
and a commitment to the timely adoption and implementation of an I/M program in the Chicago and East St. Louis ozone
nonattainment areas meeting all the requirements of the I/M regulation and the amended Act by November 15, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 13, 1993, the Illinois General Assembly adjourned without taking the necessary action to enable Illinois
to adopt and implement the I/M provisions mandated by the amended Act and the final I/M rule in Chicago and East St. Louis
ozone nonattainment areas. Failure to provide such authority prevented the State from submitting a complete SIP
revision containing all the required elements of the program by November 15, 1993. On September 28, 1993, USEPA sent
a letter to Illinois Governor Edgar advising him that USEPA had decided to exercise its discretionary authority under
section 110(m) of the Act to impose sanctions at any time once a finding of SIP deficiency is made if necessary legislation
was not adopted during the October 1993 veto session of the Illinois General Assembly. The Illinois General Assembly
reconvened on October 12, 1993, for the fall veto session. During this session which adjourned November 4, 1993, the
legislature failed for the second time to enact the legislation needed to implement the required I/M program meeting
the requirements of the Act in the State of Illinois. After review of the committal SIP, USEPA proposed to disapprove
the commitment on December 2, 1993 (58 FR 63547), based on the failure by the State to meet interim and final milestones
in the schedule contained in the SIP submittal pertaining to the enactment of necessary authority to implement I/M
requirements during the 1993 Illinois General Legislative session. On November 15, 1993, the State of Illinois failed
to meet its commitment to USEPA by failing to submit a full SIP revision for I/M program implementation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Beyond being a specific mandate of the Act, I/M programs play an important role in the ability of the Chicago and East
St. Louis ozone nonattainment areas to comply with the requirements of the Act for achieving the National Ambient
Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone, as well as the Act's requirements for reasonable further progress (RFP)
reductions for ozone. The Act provides that each state in which all or part of certain classifications for ozone nonattainment
areas are located is required to provide an attainment demonstration showing that its SIP, as revised, will provide
for attainment of the ozone NAAQS by the applicable attainment date(s). The Act further requires that each state in
which all or part of a serious, severe, or extreme ozone nonattainment area is located shall submit SIP revisions that
will reduce VOC emissions by November 15, 1996 by at least 15% of the 1990 baseline emissions. If the reductions identified
in the SIP revisions are less than 15% of baseline emissions, the State may obtain a waiver under section 182(b)(1)(A)(ii);
this requires the State to make several demonstrations, including one that the plan reflecting the lesser amount
includes all measures that can feasibly be implemented in the area in light of technological achievability. The Chicago
and East St. Louis ozone nonattainment areas in Illinois will have difficulty meeting the applicable RFP requirements
because credit for certain pre-1990 CAA programs, such as the federal motor vehicle control program and basic I/M
is not allowed. The additional benefits resulting from implementing an I/M program that meets the requirements of
the final November 5, 1992, I/M regulation, however, are fully creditable towards meeting the RFP requirement. An
I/M program is one of the most powerful tools available to areas in terms of providing expeditious reductions in both
VOC and NOx, both of which are precursors of ozone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, a federally approvable basic and enhanced I/M program represents one of the most cost-effective air quality
control strategies available. Without an effective I/M program, attainment of the ozone air quality standard is
virtually impossible, and without appropriate enabling legislation, an I/M program meeting final USEPA I/M regulations
cannot be implemented.

II. Sanctions Under the Clean Air Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This sanction action is being proposed under USEPA's discretionary authority contained in section 110(m) of the
Act. The predicate findings and types of sanctions are in section 179. The two sanctions available to USEPA for application
under section 110(m), as provided in section 179(b), are: (1) A prohibition on the funding of certain highway projects;
and (2) an increase in the emission offset requirement for new and modified major stationary sources. The highway
funding sanction prohibits the approval by the Secretary of Transportation of any projects or the awarding by the
Secretary of any grants, under Title 23 of the U.S. Code, other than projects or grants for safety and certain other
categories of projects listed in section 179(b)(1). The offset sanction requires that, when states apply the emission
offset requirement of section 173 to new or modified sources, the ratio of emission reductions to increased emissions
must be at least 2 to 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 179(a) of the Act sets forth the findings
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 which provide USEPA with discretion under section 110(m) to impose one or both of the sanctions specified under section
179(b). The four findings are: (1) A state has failed, for a nonattainment area, to submit a SIP or an element of the SIP,
or that the SIP or SIP element submitted fails to meet the completeness criteria of section 110(k); (2) USEPA disapproves
a SIP submission for a nonattainment area based on the submission's failure to meet one or more plan elements required
by the Act; (3) a state has not made any other submission required by the Act or has made a submission that does not meet
the completeness criteria or has made a required submission that is disapproved by USEPA for not meeting the Act's
requirements; or (4) a requirement of an approved plan is not being implemented.

Under section 179(a), unless the state corrects the deficiency, one of the two sanctions listed in section 179(b)
must be imposed 18 months after a finding is made, and the second must be imposed 6 months after the first sanction is
imposed, if the deficiency remains uncorrected.

On October 1, 1993, U.S. EPA proposed a rule governing the order in which the sanctions shall apply under section 179
of the Act. 58 FR 51270. The rule proposes that the offset sanction apply first and the highway funding sanction apply
second. According to the proposed rule, U.S. EPA may change this sequence of sanctions through individual notice-and-comment
rulemaking. This proposed sequencing applies only to mandatory sanctions that apply under section 179(a) and does
not govern sanctions imposed under section 110(m).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although section 179(a) establishes mandatory deadlines for the application of sanctions at certain points after
a finding of deficiency, section 110(m) provides USEPA with the discretion to impose section 179(b) sanctions at
any time (or at any time after) a section 179(a) finding. Likewise, although mandatory sanctions under section 179
are limited to the area with the deficiency, section 110(m) authorizes USEPA to apply discretionary sanctions to
any portion of the state that USEPA deems reasonable and appropriate to ensure that the requirements of the Act are
met. See 57 FR 44534, 44536&hyph;44537. However, the Act requires USEPA to establish by rule criteria to ensure that
such sanctions are not applied on a statewide basis where one or more political subdivisions covered by the applicable
implementation plan are principally responsible for the deficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 28, 1992, USEPA proposed criteria under section 110(m) that it would use when proposing statewide sanctions
to determine if one or more political subdivisions is principally responsible for a SIP deficiency. 57 FR 44534. These
proposed criteria are discussed later in this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to Illinois, USEPA is using its discretionary authority under section 110(m) to propose early sanctions
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 based on Illinois' failure to submit a complete I/M program. USEPA is taking this action for two reasons: (1) Congress
required timely submittal of I/M programs as a measure central to allowing the State's metropolitan areas to meet
CAA deadlines and any legislative delay threatens the State's ability to meet those deadlines, and (2) enhanced I/M
is the single most effective air pollution control measure available. Delayed legislative approval of an acceptable
I/M program places a disproportionate burden for cleaning the air on the State's major industrial sources.

U.S. EPA issued a letter on December 30, 1993, finding that the state's failed to submit a SIP revision as required by

A. Finding Under Section 179(a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated previously, on December 30, 1993, USEPA Region 5 issued a letter notifying the State of its failure to submit
a complete SIP revision on November 15, 1993, as required by the Act. USEPA's letter constitutes a finding under section
179(a) that triggers EPA's discretionary authority to impose the sanctions proposed in this notice under section
110(m). Further, on December 2, 1993, USEPA proposed to disapprove the I/M committal SIP containing Illinois' commitment
to adopt and submit both basic and enhanced I/M programs meeting the requirements of the Act and USEPA's I/M regulation
by November 15, 1993. Illinois has now failed to adopt and submit such programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If sufficient progress has not been made by Illinois toward the implementation of an approvable I/M program to be operational
on or before January 1, 1995, EPA hereby announces its intention to impose sanctions on May 15, 1994.

B. Rationale and Approach for Section 110(m) Sanctions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 110(m) of the Act allows USEPA to apply the Federal highway funding assistance limitations and the 2:1 emission
offset sanction at any time (or at any time after) it makes a finding under section 179(a). Based on its finding dated
December 30, 1993, USEPA is proposing to impose both the Federal highway funding assistance limitations and 2:1 emission
offset sanctions. USEPA believes that the imposition of both sanctions is appropriate because of Illinois' failure
to submit a complete SIP revision to enhance its existing vehicle I/M program. In the absence of improved vehicle I/M,
the ability of the State's metropolitan areas to meet the CAA deadlines for attaining healthy air quality is severely
compromised. As previously noted, I/M programs are the single most effective air pollution control measures available
and delayed legislative approval of an acceptable program further burdens major industrial sources of air pollution
with responsibility for cleaning the air.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 110(m), USEPA may apply sanctions to any portion of the state it determines is reasonable and appropriate.
During the 24 months following the finding, USEPA may not impose the sanctions statewide if one or more political subdivisions
within the state is principally responsible for the deficiency that is the basis for sanctions. USEPA has proposed
criteria for determining when a political subdivision is principally responsible (57 FR 44534, September 28, 1992).
The criteria provide that a political subdivision is principally responsible if: (1) It has the legal authority to
perform the required activity; (2) it has traditionally performed, or has been delegated the responsibility to perform,
the required activity; (3) it has received, where appropriate, adequate funding, or authority to obtain funding,
from the state to perform the required activity; (4) it has agreed to perform (and has not revoked the agreement), or
is required by state law to accept responsibility for performing, the required activity; and (5) it has failed to perform
the required activity. A ``political subdivision'' is defined as the representative body that is responsible for
adopting and/or implementing air pollution controls for any combination of political subdivisions created by,
or pursuant to, Federal or State law. If no political subdivision meets all 5 criteria, USEPA may use its discretion
to determine whether it is reasonable and appropriate to apply sanctions on a statewide basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this notice, USEPA is proposing to use the above proposed criteria to determine if it may impose sanctions statewide
for Illinois because of the failure to comply with the I/M committal SIP revision adopting an I/M program. USEPA believes
that the first criterion has not been met by any political subdivision. Only the Illinois General Assembly, composed
of representatives from all portions of the State of Illinois, has the authority to revise the state statute to provide
for a basic and enhanced I/M program meeting the CAA and USEPA requirements. Once the legislature has acted, only state
government agencies can adopt any implementing regulations. While individual air pollution control districts
or air quality management districts may request implementation of the state I/M program within their districts once
that program is adopted, this authority is meaningless unless the State has first established an appropriate program
through legislation and regulations. Since the State legislature has not enacted the legislation required to provide
the legal authority for an 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
I/M program meeting the CAA and USEPA requirements an I/M program meeting such requirements is not available to areas
within the State that require the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since no political subdivision within the State has met the first criterion, USEPA believes that no political subdivision
is principally responsible for the failure to have an I/M program that meets final USEPA regulations. Therefore,
USEPA is not prohibited from imposing sanctions statewide. As noted above, the State legislature bears the ultimate
responsibility to adopt the requisite legislative authority and IEPA, not the individual air quality districts,
must subsequently adopt adequate regulations. Since the State does bear the ultimate responsibility, USEPA believes
that it is reasonable and appropriate for USEPA to impose the highway sanction on the entire State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 2:1 offset sanction requirements apply only to new or modified major stationary sources located in or to be located
in areas that are required to have a permit program pursuant to section 173. Thus, USEPA is proposing to impose the 2:1
emission offset sanction only in those areas in which it will have an effect, i.e., the following ozone nonattainment
counties: Cook, Lake, Kane, DuPage, Will, McHenry, Madison, Monroe, St. Clair, Grundy (Aux Sable and Gooselake Townships
only), and Kendall (Oswego Township only). The 2:1 emission offset would apply to all new or modified major stationary
sources of VOC and NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that are locating to or located in each of these areas. USEPA proposes to impose the offset sanctions in the manner described
in the proposed action on the sequencing of sanctions (58 FR 51270, 51275&hyph;51277 (October 1, 1993)).

C. Removal of Discretionary Sanctions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
USEPA is proposing to temporarily lift (i.e., toll)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the highway and offset sanctions imposed under section 110(m) upon the passage by the Illinois General Assembly and
signature by the Governor of legislation which USEPA preliminary determines provides legal authority for a basic
and enhanced I/M program meeting the requirements of the CAA and the I/M regulations. USEPA proposes to notify the
State of this tolling by a letter to the Governor and the public by a notice published in the notice section of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The section 110(m) sanctions would not be completely lifted until the State submits a complete enhanced I/M program.
USEPA will take action to completely lift section 110(m) sanctions upon a determination that the State has submitted
a complete enhanced I/M program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 As a general rule, an Agency must go through rulemaking to remove or alter a requirement imposed through rulemaking.
While USEPA intends to issue a notice tolling the 110(m) sanctions upon the occurrence of the events described, USEPA
will use the good cause exception to the otherwise applicable requirement for proposed rulemaking. EPA believes
there is good cause to toll the sanctions once the state takes the action which cures the deficiency that resulted in
imposition of sanctions. See 5 U.S.C. &sect;553(b)(B). Therefore, no proposed action for removal will be issued.
Consistent with USEPA's intent to impose discretionary sanctions only on those areas that lack legislative authority,
USEPA believes that it is in the public interest to remove, at least temporarily, these discretionary sanctions as
expeditiously as possible once the State of Illinois has enacted legislative authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As an alternative, if EPA takes final action disapproving Illinois's committal SIP prior to taking final action imposing
sanctions, EPA proposes that such disapproval be the basis for imposing the discretionary sanctions. In such case,
the sanctions would be tolled in the same manner; however, if the disapproval is the final basis for imposing the sanctions
such sanctions would not be completely lifted until EPA formally approves an enhanced 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
I/M program for the State of Illinois. In such a case, EPA would take action to lift the sanctions at the same time as EPA
took final action approving the State's I/M program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USEPA's action imposing or tolling the section 110(m) sanctions will in no manner affect USEPA's obligation to impose
mandatory sanctions under section 179(a) where one mandatory sanction shall apply 18 months after USEPA's finding
of failure to submit a complete SIP and the second mandatory sanction shall apply 6 months later. Sanctions under section
179(a) apply to the areas for which the deficiency exists. If the State does not adopt and submit to USEPA a complete
submittal providing for an I/M program within the 18-month and additional 6-month periods, the sanctions will automatically
apply on those areas of the State that were required to have but do not have such a complete I/M program under the amended
Act. See 58 FR 51270 (October 1, 1993). Moreover, if EPA takes final action disapproving Illinois's I/M committal
SIP, a second sanctions clock will be triggered and Illinois must not only submit an I/M program, but EPA must also approve
that program within the relevant time frames to stop the mandatory sanctions clock and avoid sanctions based on the
final disapproval.

A. Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review and the requirements of
the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule
that may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely effect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory
action.'' Nevertheless, after reviewing information regarding this action, OMB has waived review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities. Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number
of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The USEPA cannot reliably predict the impact of these restrictions because of the exemptions authorized for certain
highway projects related to mass transit, public safety, and those that have beneficial air quality impacts. Careful
review and evaluation of each project is necessary to determine whether or not a project is exempt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If USEPA takes final action on this proposal, the 2:1 emission offset requirement will apply to major new sources and
major modifications to existing sources of VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, in the Illinois ozone areas subject to the section 173 offset requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Major stationary sources of VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 with emissions are generally not small entities. Also, the 2:1 emission offset requirement does not prevent growth
and modification but sets a higher offset standard than the current offset required. It is not expected that a large
number of small entities will be affected by the emission offset requirement. In the past, when USEPA has made efforts
to quantify the impact of the Act's rules on the construction and modification of sources, USEPA has been unable to
do so due, in part, to the need to obtain information on future plans for business growth. This information is difficult
to obtain, as businesses are understandably reluctant to make their plans public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The USEPA is also proposing to impose Federal highway funding assistance limitations statewide. This limitation
could affect a number of government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000 since government
entities often apply for and receive federal funding under Title 23, United States Code, for road improvement projects.
Although a great many projects are exempted under section 179(b)(1)(B), a number of projects are expected to be affected
if the USEPA takes final action. For the reasons stated above, USEPA cannot further analyze the economic impacts of
this action on small entities. The statements in this package constitute USEPA's full regulatory Flexibility analysis.

C. Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule does not contain any information collection requirements which require OMB approval under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.). Should the highway sanctions become effective, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT)
is required to determine which projects or grants should not be affected by the sanction and which, therefore, are
exempt. This determination will be based on information readily available in existing documentation gathered for
the purpose of evaluating the environmental, social, and economic impacts of different alternatives for transportation
projects. These analyses are already required for the preparation of environmental assessments and impact statements
under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Historically, exemption determinations by USDOT for sanctions
have been based on such NEPA documentation and have not necessitated additional information gathering and analysis
by the states. In addition, since under NEPA, final environmental documents must be approved by USDOT, in most cases
the NEPA documentation will already be in USDOT's possession. Therefore, USEPA does not believe that the highway
sanctions, when applied, will impose an additional information collection burden on the states. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the offset sanction applies, sources subject to it will not incur an additional information collection burden
because sources are already required under section 173 offset requirements to obtain an emission offset from between
1 to 1 and 1.5 to 1 (depending on the classification of the nonattainment area in which they are located). Should the
offset sanction apply, it would not impose an additional information collection burden because sources will not
have to provide additional information in the application beyond that which they would already have to provide in
the absence of the sanction. (For the information collection burden of new requirements of the amended Act for nonattainment
new source review and prevention of significant deterioration, an information collection request is being prepared
to support rulemaking changes to parts 51 and 52.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) is proposing this action to impose sanctions on Indiana under the
discretionary sanction authority provided under the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, (CAA or Act) for failure by
the State to submit a complete SIP revision for an enhanced motor vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) program
as required by the Act for certain ozone nonattainment areas. On December 2, 1992, the Indiana Department of Environmental
Management (IDEM), acting as the governor's designee, submitted a commitment (Committal SIP) to adopt an I/M program
to meet the requirement of the Act and the I/M rule by November 15, 1993. The committal SIP provides for the adoption
and implementation of an enhanced I/M program meeting all requirements of USEPA's I/M regulations and includes an
implementation schedule. On September 9, 1993, USEPA proposed to disapprove this SIP revision and on November 29,
1993, USEPA disapproved this SIP revision based on the failure by the State to meet milestones contained in the committal
SIP's implementation schedule pertaining to the enactment of necessary legislative authority. A full SIP revision
including State legislative authority to implement the program was required by November 15, 1993. The Indiana legislature
adjourned on June 30, 1993, without taking necessary action to provide for implementation of an enhanced I/M program.
On December 30, 1993, USEPA Region 5 issued a letter finding that the State had failed to submit the SIP revision required
under sections 110 and 182 of the Act. Due to the failure of the State to submit a complete SIP revision fulfilling either
the requirements of the Act or its commitment to adopt and implement an enhanced I/M program as promised in its committal
SIP, USEPA proposes to exercise its discretionary authority under the Act to apply a statewide highway funding limitation
sanction and a 2 for 1 growth offset sanction in all areas required to have a permit program under the new source review
provisions of the Act.

I. I/M Program Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the 1977 amendments to the Act, vehicle I/M programs were mandated for certain areas with long standing
air quality problems. The 1990 amendments to the Act expanded the role of I/M programs as an attainment strategy and
required USEPA to develop different performance standards for ``basic'' and ``enhanced'' I/M programs. The performance
standard is the minimum amount of emission reductions a program must achieve, based on a model or benchmark program
design. In addition, the amended Act directed USEPA to address requirements for specific design elements and program
implementation issues for both basic and enhanced I/M programs. The amended Act requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
states containing nonattainment areas to make changes to improve existing I/M programs or implement new ones. Section
182(a)(2)(B) of the Act directed USEPA to publish updated guidance for state I/M programs, taking into consideration
findings of the Administrator's audits and investigations of these programs. The Act further requires each area
required by the Act to have an I/M program to incorporate this guidance into the SIP. Based on these requirements, USEPA
promulgated an I/M regulation on November 5, 1992. (57 FR 52950) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 182(c)(3) of the Act, areas designated as serious or worse ozone nonattainment areas with populations
of 200,000 or more, in addition to metropolitan statistical areas with populations of 100,000 or more in the northeast
ozone transport region, are required to meet USEPA requirements for ``enhanced'' I/M programs. These areas were
required to submit a SIP revision to incorporate an enhanced I/M program by November 15, 1992. In Indiana, the State
must implement a basic I/M program in the urbanized areas of Clark and Floyd counties; it must implement an enhanced
I/M program in the urbanized areas of Lake and Porter counties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The I/M regulation establishes minimum performance standards for basic and enhanced I/M programs as well as requirements
for the following: Network type and program evaluation; adequate tools and resources; test frequency and convenience;
vehicle coverage; test procedures and standards; test equipment; quality control; waivers and compliance via diagnostic
inspection; motorist compliance enforcement; motorist compliance enforcement program oversight; quality assurance;
enforcement against contractors, stations and inspectors; data collection; data analysis and reporting; inspector
training and licensing or certification; public information and consumer protection; improving repair effectiveness;
compliance with recall notices; on-road testing; SIP revisions; and implementation deadlines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For enhanced I/M programs, all requirements must be implemented by January 1, 1995 except that areas switching from
an existing test-and-repair network to a test-only network may phase in that change between January 1995 and January
1996. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each state required to implement an I/M program was required to submit by November 15, 1992, a SIP revision (here and
after referred to as ``I/M committal SIP'') including two elements: (1) A commitment from the Governor or his/her
designee to the timely adoption and implementation of an I/M program meeting all the requirements of the I/M regulation;
and, (2) a schedule for adoption of the program, with interim milestones including passage of enabling statutory
or other legal authority and adoption of final regulations. Acceptance of I/M committal SIPs in lieu of full SIPs was
justified by the fact that states could not have been expected to begin development of an I/M program meeting the requirements
of the Act and the I/M regulation until the I/M regulation was adopted as a final rule, which did not occur until November
5, 1992. A complete SIP revision which contained all of the elements identified in the adoption schedule, including
the authorizing legislation and implementing regulations, was to be submitted no later than November 15, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 2, 1992, the State of Indiana submitted a committal SIP to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USEPA. A public hearing on this submittal was held by the State on October 22, 1992, in Gary, Indiana. The submittal
included a schedule of implementation and a commitment to the timely adoption and implementation of an I/M program
in the Lake, Porter, Clark, and Floyd County ozone nonattainment areas meeting all the requirements of the I/M regulation
and the amended Act by November 15, 1993.

On June 30, 1993, the Indiana legislature adjourned without taking the necessary action to enable Indiana to adopt
and implement the I/M provisions mandated by the amended Act and the final I/M rule in Lake and Porter Counties. Failure
to provide such authority prevented the State from submitting a complete SIP revision containing all the required
elements of the program by November 15, 1993. On August 17, 1993, USEPA sent a letter to Governor Bayh of Indiana and
to the Regional Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration advising them that USEPA had decided to exercise
its discretionary authority under section 110(m) of the Act to impose sanctions at any time once a finding of SIP deficiency
is made. After review of the committal SIP, USEPA proposed to disapprove the commitment on September 9, 1993 (58 FR
47415), and on November 29, 1993 USEPA disapproved this SIP revision based on the failure by the State to meet interim
and final milestones in the schedule contained in the SIP submittal pertaining to the enactment of necessary authority
to implement I/M requirements during the 1993 Indiana General Legislative session. On November 15, 1993, the State
of Indiana failed to meet its commitment to USEPA by failing to submit a full SIP revision for I/M program implementation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beyond being a specific mandate of the Act, enhanced I/M programs play an important role in the ability of Lake and Porter
Counties to comply with the CAA requirements for achieving the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for
ozone, as well as the Act's requirements for reasonable further progress (RFP) reductions for ozone. The Act provides
that each state in which all or part of certain classifications for ozone and/or CO nonattainment areas are located
is required to provide an attainment demonstration showing that its SIP, as revised, will provide for attainment
of the NAAQS by the applicable attainment date(s). The Act further requires that each state in which all or part of a
serious, severe, or extreme ozone nonattainment area is located shall submit SIP revisions that will reduce VOC emissions
by November 15, 1996 by at least 15% of 1990 baseline emissions. If the reductions identified in the SIP revisions are
less than 15% of baseline emissions, the state may obtain a waiver under section 182(b)(1)(A)(ii); this requires
the State to make several demonstrations, including one that the plan reflecting the lesser amount includes all measures
that can feasibly be implemented in the area in light of technological achievability. The Lake and Porter areas in
Indiana will have difficulty meeting the RFP requirements because credit for certain pre-1990 CAA programs, such
as the federal motor vehicle control program and basic I/M is not allowed. The additional benefits of enhanced I/M,
however, are fully creditable towards meeting the RFP requirement. Enhanced I/M is one of the most powerful tools
available to areas in terms of providing expeditious reductions in both VOC and NOx, both of which are precursors of
ozone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, a federally approvable enhanced I/M program represents one of the most cost-effective air quality control
strategies available. Without an effective I/M program, attainment of the ozone air quality standard is virtually
impossible, and without appropriate enabling legislation, an enhanced I/M program cannot be implemented.

This sanction action is being proposed under USEPA's discretionary authority contained in section 110(m) of the
Act. The predicate findings and types of sanctions are in section 179. The two sanctions available to USEPA for application
under section 110(m), as provided in section 179(b), are: (1) A prohibition on the funding of certain highway projects;
and (2) an increase in the emission offset requirement for new and modified major stationary sources. The highway
funding sanction prohibits the approval by the Secretary of Transportation of any projects or the awarding by the
Secretary of any grants, under Title 23 of the U.S. Code, other than projects or grants for safety and certain other
categories of projects listed in section 179(b)(1). The offset sanction requires that, when states apply the emission
offset requirement of section 173 to new or modified sources, the ratio of emission reductions to increased emissions
must be at least 2 to 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 179(a) of the Act sets forth the findings
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 which provide USEPA with discretion under section 110(m) to impose one or both of the sanctions specified under section
179(b). The four findings are: (1) A state has failed, for a nonattainment area, to submit a SIP or an element of the SIP,
or that the SIP or SIP element submitted fails to meet the completeness criteria of section 110(k); (2) USEPA disapproves
a SIP submission for a nonattainment area based on the submission's failure to meet one or more plan elements required
by the Act; (3) a state has not made any other submission required by the Act or has made a submission that does not meet
the completeness criteria or has made a required submission that is disapproved by USEPA for not meeting the Act's
requirements; or (4) a requirement of an approved plan is not being implemented.

Under section 179(a), unless the state corrects the deficiency, one of the two sanctions listed in section 179(b)
must be imposed 18 months after a finding is made, and the second must be imposed 6 months after the first sanction is
imposed, if the deficiency remains uncorrected.

 In addition, USEPA may apply both sanctions after 18 months if the Administrator finds a lack of good faith on the part

On October 1, 1993, U.S. EPA proposed a rule governing the order in which the sanctions shall apply under section 179
of the Act. 58 FR 51270. The rule proposes that the offset sanction apply first and the highway funding sanction apply
second. According to the proposed rule, U.S. EPA may change this sequence of sanctions through individual notice-and-comment
rulemaking. This proposed sequencing applies only to mandatory sanctions that apply under section 179(a) and does
not govern sanctions imposed under section 110(m).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although section 179(a) establishes mandatory deadlines for the application of sanctions at certain points after
a finding of deficiency, section 110(m) provides USEPA with the discretion to impose section 179(b) sanctions at
any time (or at any time after) a section 179(a) finding. Likewise, although mandatory sanctions under section 179
are limited to the area with the deficiency, section 110(m) authorizes USEPA to apply discretionary sanctions to
any portion of the state that USEPA deems reasonable and appropriate to ensure that the requirements of the Act are
met. See 57 FR 44534, 44536&hyph;44537. However, the Act requires USEPA to establish by rule criteria to ensure that
such sanctions are not applied on a statewide basis where one or more political subdivisions covered by the applicable
implementation plan are principally responsible for the deficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 28, 1992, USEPA proposed criteria under section 110(m) that it would use when proposing statewide sanctions
to determine if one or more political subdivisions is principally responsible for a SIP deficiency. 57 FR 44534. These
proposed criteria are discussed later in this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to Indiana, EPA is using its discretionary authority under section 110(m) to propose early sanctions
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 based on Indiana's failure to submit a complete SIP to improve its I/M program. EPA is taking this action for two reasons:
(1) Congress required timely submittal of enhanced I/M programs as a measure the State's metropolitan areas to meet
CAA deadlines, and any legislative delay threatens the State's ability to meet those deadlines, and (2) enhanced
I/M is the single most effective air pollution control measure available. Delayed legislative approval of an acceptable
I/M program places a disproportionate burden for cleaning the air on the State's major industrial sources.

U.S. EPA issued a letter on December 30, 1993, finding that the State's proposed SIP revision was a failure to submit
a SIP revision as required by the Act. Mandatory sanctions under section 179(a) were triggered by issuance of the letter
notifying the State of the finding of the deficiency.

As stated previously on December 30, 1993, USEPA Region 5 issued a letter notifying the State of its failure to submit
a complete SIP revision on November 15, 1993, as required by the Act. USEPA's letter constitutes a finding under section
179(a) that triggers USEPA's discretionary authority to impose the sanctions proposed in this notice under section
110(m). Further, on November 29, 1993, USEPA disapproved Indiana's committal SIP revision because the State had
failed to meet its commitment.

B. Rationale and Approach for Section 110(m) Sanctions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 110(m) of the Act allows USEPA to apply the Federal highway funding assistance limitations and 2:1 emission
offset sanction at any time (or at any time after) it makes a finding under section 179(a). Based on its finding dated
December 30, 1993, USEPA is proposing to impose both the Federal highway funding assistance limitations and 2:1 emission
offset sanctions. USEPA believes that the imposition of both sanctions is appropriate because of Indiana's failure
to adopt legislation to enhance its existing vehicle inspection and maintenance program. In the absence of an improved
vehicle inspection and maintenance program, the ability of the State's metropolitan areas to meet the Clean Air Act
deadlines for attaining healthy air quality is severely compromised. As previously noted, enhanced vehicle inspection
and maintenance is the single most effective air pollution control measure available and delayed legislative approval
of an acceptable program further burdens major industrial sources of air pollution with responsibility for cleaning
the air. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 110(m), USEPA may apply sanctions to any portion of the state it determines is reasonable and appropriate.
During the 24 months following the finding, USEPA may not impose the sanctions statewide if one or more political subdivisions
within the state is principally responsible for the deficiency that is the basis for sanctions. USEPA has proposed
criteria for determining when a political subdivision is principally responsible (57 FR 44534, September 28, 1992).
The criteria provide that a political subdivision is principally responsible if: (1) It has the legal authority to
perform the required activity; (2) it has traditionally performed, or has been delegated the responsibility to perform,
the required activity; (3) it has received, where appropriate, adequate funding, or authority to obtain funding,
from the state to perform the required activity; (4) it has agreed to perform (and has not revoked the agreement), or
is required by state law to accept responsibility for performing, the required activity; and (5) it has failed to perform
the required activity. A ``political subdivision'' is defined as the representative body that is responsible for
adopting and/or implementing air pollution controls for any combination of political subdivisions created by,
or pursuant to, Federal or State law. If no political subdivision meets all 5 criteria, USEPA may use its discretion
to determine whether it is reasonable and appropriate to apply sanctions on a statewide basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this notice, USEPA is proposing to use the above proposed criteria to determine if it may impose highway sanction
statewide for Indiana because of the failure to submit a complete enhanced I/M program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USEPA believes that the first criterion has not been met by any political subdivision. Only the Indiana legislature,
composed of representatives from all portions of the State of Indiana, has the authority to revise the state statute
to provide for an enhanced I/M program meeting the CAA and EPA requirements. Once the legislature has acted, only state
government agencies can adopt any implementing regulations. While individual air pollution control districts
or air quality management districts may request implementation of the state I/M program within their districts once
that program is adopted, this authority is meaningless unless the State has first established an appropriate program
through legislation and regulations. Since the State legislature has not enacted the legislation required to provide
the legal authority for an enhanced I/M program meeting the CAA and USEPA requirements, the program is not available
to areas within the State that require the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since no political subdivision within the State has met the first criterion, EPA believes that no political subdivision
is principally responsible for the failure to have an enhanced I/M program. Therefore, EPA is not prohibited from
imposing sanctions statewide. As noted above, the State legislature bears the ultimate responsibility to adopt
the requisite legislative authority and IDEM, not the individual air quality districts, must subsequently adopt
adequate regulations. Since the State does bear the ultimate responsibility, USEPA believes that it is reasonable
and appropriate for USEPA to impose the highway sanction on the entire State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 2:1 offset sanction requirements apply only to new or modified major stationary sources located or to be located
in areas that are required to have a permit program pursuant to section 173. Thus, USEPA is proposing to impose the 2:1
emission offset sanction in the following ozone nonattainment counties: Lake, Porter, Clark, Floyd, Marion, St.
Joseph, Elkhart, and Vanderburgh. The 2:1 emission offset would apply to all new or modified major stationary sources
for volatile organic compounds and oxides of nitrogen that are locating to or located in each of these areas. USEPA
proposes to impose the offset sanction in the manner described in the proposed action on the sequencing of sanctions
(58 FR 51270, 51275&hyph;51277 (Oct. 1, 1993)).

C. Removal of Discretionary Sanctions

USEPA is proposing to temporarily lift (i.e., toll)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the highway and offset sanctions imposed under section 110(m) upon the passage by the Indiana legislature and signature
by the Governor of legislation which USEPA preliminary determines provides legal authority for an enhanced I/M program
meeting the requirements of the CAA and the I/M regulations. USEPA proposes to notify the State of this tolling by a
letter to the Governor and the public by a notice published in the notice section of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The section 110(m) sanctions would not be completely lifted until the State of Indiana submits a complete enhanced
I/M program to USEPA. USEPA will take action to completely lift section 110(m) sanctions upon its determination that
the State has submitted a complete enhanced I/M program.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 As a general rule, an Agency must go through rulemaking to remove or alter a requirement imposed through rulemaking.
While U.S. EPA intends to issue a notice tolling the 110(m) sanctions upon the occurrence of the events described,
U.S. EPA will use the good cause exception to the otherwise applicable requirement for proposed rulemaking. EPA believes
there is good cause to toll the sanctions once the state takes the action which cures the deficiency that resulted in
the imposition of sanctions. See 5 U.S.C. &sect;553(b)(B). Therefore, no proposed action for removal will be issued.
Consistent with U.S. EPA's intent to impose discretionary sanctions only on those areas that lack legislative authority
U.S. EPA believes that it is in the public interest to remove, at least temporarily, these discretionary sanctions
as expeditiously as possible once the State of Indiana has enacted legislative authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As an alternative, EPA proposes that the basis for the discretionary sanctions is EPA's disapproval of Indiana's
committal SIP. If the EPA's disapproval of the committal SIP is the basis for the discretionary sanctions, such sanctions
would be tolled in the same manner as if the finding of failure to submit were the basis; however, if the disapproval
is the basis for imposing the sanctions such sanctions would not be completely lifted until EPA formally approves
an enhanced I/M program for the State of Indiana. In such a case, EPA would take action to lift the sanctions at the same
time as EPA took final action approving the State's I/M program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USEPA's action imposing or tolling the section 110(m) sanctions will in no manner affect EPA's obligation to impose
mandatory sanctions under section 179(a). The mandatory sanctions clock for Indiana was triggered on November 29,
1993 by EPA's disapproval of Indiana's committal SIP. Therefore, one mandatory sanction shall apply 18 months after
USEPA's final disapproval of the committal SIP and the second mandatory sanction shall apply 6 months later. Sanctions
under section 179(a) apply to the areas for which the deficiency exists and until such deficiency has been corrected.
Moreover, if the State does not adopt and USEPA does not approve regulations providing for an I/M program within the
18-month and additional 6-month periods following the effective date of EPA's disapproval, the sanctions will automatically
apply on those areas of the State that were required to have but do not have such a USEPA-approved I/M program under the
amended Act. See 58 FR 51270 (October 1, 1993).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review and the requirements of
the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule
that may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely effect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory
action.'' Nevertheless, this action has been informally submitted to OMB for review.

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. For reasons cited below, USEPA has not completed
a regulatory flexibility analysis for this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The USEPA cannot reliably predict the impact of these restrictions because of the exemptions authorized for certain
highway projects related to mass transit, public safety, and those that have beneficial air quality impacts. Careful
review and evaluation of each project is necessary to determine whether or not a project is exempt.

 with emissions are generally not small entities. Also, the 2:1 emission offset requirement does not prevent growth
and modification but sets a higher offset standard than the current offset required. It is not expected that a large
number of small entities will be affected by the emission offset requirement. In the past, when USEPA has made efforts
to quantify the impact of the Act's rules on the construction and modification of sources, USEPA has been unable to
do so due, in part, to the need to obtain information on future plans for business growth. This information is difficult
to obtain, as businesses are understandably reluctant to make their plans public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The USEPA is also proposing to impose Federal highway funding assistance limitations statewide. This limitation
could affect a number of government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000 since government
entities often apply for and receive federal funding under Title 23, United States Code, for road improvement projects.
Although a great many projects are exempted under section 179(b)(1)(B), a number of projects are expected to be affected
if the USEPA takes final action.

For the reasons stated above, EPA cannot further analyze the economic impacts of this action on small entities. The
statements in this package constitute EPA's full regulatory flexibility analysis.

C. Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule does not contain any information collection requirements which require OMB approval under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Should the highway sanctions become effective, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT)
is required to determine which projects or grants should not be affected by the sanction and which, therefore, are
exempt. This determination will be based on information readily available in existing documentation gathered for
the purpose of evaluating the environmental, social, and economic impacts of different alternatives for transportation
projects. These analyses are already required for the preparation of environmental assessments and impact statements
under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Historically, exemption determinations by USDOT for sanctions
have been based on such NEPA documentation and have not necessitated additional information gathering and analysis
by the states. In addition, since under NEPA, final environmental documents must be approved by USDOT, in most cases
the NEPA documentation will already be in USDOT's possession. Therefore, USEPA does not believe that the highway
sanctions, when applied, will impose an additional information collection burden on the states. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the offset sanction applies, sources subject to it will not incur an additional information collection burden
because sources are already required under section 173 offset requirements to obtain an emission offset from between
1 to 1 and 1.5 to 1 (depending on the classification of the nonattainment area in which they are located). Should the
offset sanction apply, if would not impose an additional information collection burden because sources will not
have to provide additional information in the application beyond that which they would already have to provide in
the absence of the sanction. (For the information collection burden of new requirements of the amended Act for nonattainment
new source review (NSR) and prevention of significant deterioration, an information collection request is being
prepared to support rulemaking changes to parts 51 and 52.)

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary proposes to amend the regulations governing the Secretary's recognition of accrediting agencies.
The proposed regulations are needed to implement provisions added to the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) by the
Higher Education Amendments of 1992. The purpose of the Secretary's recognition of accrediting agencies is to assure
that those agencies are, for HEA and other Federal purposes, reliable authorities as to the quality of education or
training offered by the institutions of higher education or higher education programs they accredit.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In order to approve a postsecondary education institution to participate in the student financial assistance (SFA)
programs authorized under Title IV of the HEA and many other Federal programs, the Secretary must determine, in part,
that the institution satisfies the statutory definition of an ``institution of higher education.'' Under the HEA
and other Federal statutes, one element of that definition requires an eligible institution of higher education
to be accredited or preaccredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Secretary as a reliable authority as
to the quality of the education or training provided by the institution. Another element requires an eligible institution
to be legally authorized to provide an educational program beyond the secondary level in the State in which it is located.
Thus, the statutory definition of an institution of higher education provides the framework for a shared responsibility
among accrediting agencies, States, and the Federal government to ensure that the ``gate'' to SFA programs is opened
to only those institutions that provide students with quality education or training worth the time, energy, and money
they invest in it. The three ``gatekeepers'' sharing this responsibility have traditionally been referred to as
``the triad.'' While the concept of a triad of entities responsible for gatekeeping has had a long history, the triad
has not always worked as effectively as it should to ensure educational quality, nor has it served as an effective deterrent
to abuse by institutions participating in SFA programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For several years, certain institutions participating in SFA programs have failed to provide students with education
or training of an acceptable level of quality; they have also failed to treat students fairly. In addition, they have
failed to meet acceptable standards of financial responsibility and administrative capability and to adequately
protect the SFA program funds entrusted to them. The institutions that have engaged in these abusive practices are
not restricted to a particular sector of higher education. Rather, the abuses have been found in all types of institutions
participating in SFA programs, including those in the private non-profit and public sectors of higher education
as well as those in the proprietary sector. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time, gatekeeping functions have not been carried out effectively. For example, some accrediting agencies
have not taken sufficient care to ensure the quality of the education or training provided by the institutions or programs
they accredit or to protect student interests when they accredit particular institutions or programs. Moreover,
some States have also not taken sufficient care to ensure the quality of the education or training provided by the institutions
they authorize or license to operate in the State or to protect student interests. Finally, the Federal government's
management of its responsibilities to determine eligibility and to certify institutions to participate in SFA programs
has not always been adequate to prevent abusive practices at institutions that participate in SFA programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, in the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;325, Congress amended the HEA to provide
for a new part H of Title IV entitled ``Program Integrity Triad.'' Under that part, States and accrediting agencies
are required to assume major new oversight responsibilities, and States, accrediting associations, and the Secretary
are linked to create a stronger and more coordinated evaluation of institutions that participate or wish to participate
in the SFA programs. The Secretary believes that the most appropriate approach to this coordinated evaluation of
institutions by the three components of the triad is a complementary one with each component focusing its evaluation
on its obligations within the context of the HEA. Thus, the focus for accrediting agencies is the quality of education
or training provided by the institutions or programs they accredit. For States, which already had responsibility
for determining that institutions have the legal authority to operate within the State, the HEA added a new focus:
reviewing institutions that meet certain statutory review criteria. The focus of the Secretary's evaluation of
institutions is the administrative and financial capacity of those institutions to participate in the SFA programs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statute allocates legal responsibility among the entities that compose the program integrity triad. While specific
statutory responsibilities for the three triad entities may overlap, when viewed as a whole the triad brings together
in a coordinated fashion three different but very important aspects of institutional review. Within this statutory
scheme, the Secretary has sought to assure that the gatekeeping system operates as efficiently as possible, with
maximum integration among the three triad entities and without unnecessary burden on postsecondary institutions.
In order to assist the Secretary in designing a final regulation that achieves these goals, the Secretary specifically
requests comment on the following questions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In several areas, the statute specifically requires each triad entity to evaluate an institution under the same
or similar standards. For example, a SPRE and an accrediting agency may establish different standards for evaluating
the financial responsibility of an institution or for evaluating the success of an institution's educational program.
Thus, a reviewed institution would need to satisfy the SPRE's and the accrediting agency's standards even though
those standards address the same areas. How should final regulations be structured to both reduce the burden on institutions
and enable the triad entities to carry out effectively their statutory functions? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Should the final regulations be more explicit in identifying levels, characteristics, or definitions for any
of the assessment or review criteria that a triad entity is expected to consider in its evaluation of an institution?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart 1 of part H establishes a State Postsecondary Review Program under which each State designates a single State
postsecondary review entity that is responsible for reviewing institutions of higher education that the Secretary
identifies as meeting certain review criteria and for determining whether those institutions should continue to
participate in the SFA programs. Subpart 3 specifies the procedures the Secretary uses to determine whether an institution
meets the eligibility requirements and has the administrative capacity and financial responsibility to administer
the SFA programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In subpart 2 of part H, the Secretary is charged with making a comprehensive and careful evaluation of an accrediting
agency before recognizing that agency as a reliable authority as to the quality of the education or training offered
by institutions or programs that the agency accredits. Moreover, as part of this evaluation, the Secretary is charged
with establishing recognition standards that must include ``an appropriate measure or measures of student achievement.''
Accordingly, the standards that the Secretary proposes in this notice of proposed rulemaking require an accrediting
agency to make a detailed and careful evaluation of the institutions or programs it accredits and to include in that
evaluation ``appropriate measure or measures of student achievement.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed regulations were subject to the negotiated rulemaking process set forth in section 492 of the HEA.
Under that process, the Secretary convened four regional meetings in September, 1992 to obtain public involvement
in the development of these proposed regulations. The meetings were held in San Francisco, Atlanta, New York, and
Kansas City. Before convening the meetings, the Secretary held a meeting in Washington, DC in August 1992 to invite
comments from interested parties as to the key issues that should be addressed at the regional meetings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the four regional meetings, the Secretary provided attendees with a list of issues that needed to be addressed in
these proposed regulations. A summary of the responses of the attendees is contained in Appendix A to these proposed
regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Individuals and groups who attended the regional meetings nominated individuals to participate in the negotiated
rulemaking process. The Secretary selected negotiators from the list of nominees to reflect all the groups that are
involved in the SFA programs. With regard to these proposed regulations, the Secretary chose negotiators who reflected
the diversity of the accrediting community as well as the interests of States, higher education institutions, and
students. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 492(b) of the HEA, the Secretary prepared a draft proposed regulation and negotiated the
provisions of that draft with the negotiators. Two negotiating sessions were held: one in January 1993 and one in February
1993. During those sessions, consensus was reached on several of the provisions that are included in this notice of
proposed rulemaking. On the remaining provisions, however, the negotiators agreed to disagree. Where agreement
was not reached on a particular provision, that fact is noted in the discussion that follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On several issues that were negotiated, there was general discussion on various approaches to take with regard to
those issues. The Secretary believes those issues are important enough to include in this preamble possible alternative
approaches in order to give the public a fuller understanding of the issues and the available potential solutions.
Finally, on most issues where consensus was reached, the negotiators also reached general agreement on the language
of a proposed regulatory provision. However, the Secretary wishes to reiterate the remarks of the Federal negotiators
that the agreed-to language with regard to a specific provision would be subject to change in the proposed regulations
for technical reasons but the substance of the provision would remain unchanged, wherever possible. Where a substantive
change was made in a particular provision, that fact is noted in the discussion that follows, and an explanation of
the reasons for the change is provided.

Significant Changes Proposed by the Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following discussion reflects proposed significant changes to the existing regulations governing the Secretary's
Procedures and Criteria for Recognition of Accrediting Agencies. The changes are discussed in the order in which
they appear in the proposed regulations. If a provision applies to more than one section or is included in more than
one section, it is discussed the first time it appears with an appropriate cross-reference to its other appearances.
The general format for the discussion of each section is to state the appropriate statutory provision for that section
and to explain any provisions that interpret or clarify the statute that the Secretary believes are necessary to implement
the statutory provision through regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing these proposed regulations, the Secretary has regulated as little as possible. He has regulated narrowly
to the law, except where the Secretary deems further interpretation is necessary. In these cases, either the proposed
regulations include the specific language agreed to by negotiators during negotiated rulemaking, if an agreement
was reached, or the Secretary proposes language where agreement was not reached. In both cases, the Secretary solicits
comments on the clarifications and interpretations included in the proposed regulations.

Section 602.1&blank;Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current regulations permit the Secretary to recognize any accrediting agency the Secretary determines to be a reliable
authority as to the quality of postsecondary education or training provided by the institutions or programs it accredits.
However, section 496(m) of the HEA now authorizes the Secretary to recognize only those agencies that accredit institutions
of higher education or higher education programs for the purpose of enabling those institutions or programs to establish
eligibility to participate in programs administered either by the Secretary or by other Federal agencies. In &sect;602.1
of the proposed regulations, the Secretary reiterates the statutory provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Section 602.2&blank;Definitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most of the definitions included in the proposed regulations are self-explanatory. Three, however, warrant additional
comment based on the discussions that took place during the negotiated rulemaking sessions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Institution of higher education. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the proposed regulations, the Secretary defines an institution of higher education to be an educational institution
that qualifies or may qualify as an eligible institution under 34 CFR part 600, Institutional Eligibility under the
Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended. Some of the non-Federal negotiators, however, pointed out that it is not
clear that this definition includes certain types of hospitals and health care facilities. For this reason, the Secretary
wishes to make clear that a hospital or health care facility may qualify as an eligible institution of higher education
if the hospital or facility satisfies any definition of that term, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a ``public or nonprofit private institution of higher education,'' a ``proprietary institution of higher education,''
or a ``postsecondary vocational institution.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Prebaccalaureate vocational education programs and vocational education programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;602.2, the Secretary proposes to define the term ``vocational education program'' based upon the statutory
provision included in the definition of various types of eligible institutions of higher education. Thus, the Secretary
defines a vocational education program as a program that ``prepares students for gainful employment in a recognized
occupation.'' (See, for example, section 481(b)(1) of the HEA for a ``proprietary institution of higher education;''
section 481(c)(1) for a ``postsecondary vocational institution;'' and the second sentence of section 1201(a) of
the HEA for a ``public and private nonprofit institution of higher education.'') 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This definition, if read literally, could be viewed as including all postsecondary programs. To avoid this overreaching
conclusion, the Secretary proposes that the vocational education programs that trigger actions under these regulations
are prebaccalaureate vocational education programs. See, for example, &sect;602.24(c). This latter term is defined
as a vocational education program that leads to a certificate, degree, or other education credential that is less
than a bachelor's degree. The Secretary invites comment on these definitions, as well as alternative definitions,
in light of the fact that the non-Federal negotiators could not agree among themselves as to the acceptability of these
definitions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
One alternative definition for prebaccalaureate vocational education that the Secretary is considering is ``undergraduate
vocational education that leads to a certificate or other educational credential but not to a degree.'' The Secretary
is considering this definition in order to ease the burden on institutions whose vocational education programs leading
to an associate degree would also trigger special action under the proposed regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If this alternative definition were to be adopted, however, the Secretary is concerned that some institutions might
try to stretch their non-degree programs into associate-degree programs simply to avoid the additional requirements
that, as a result of these proposed regulations, accrediting agencies will have to impose on institutions that provide
prebaccalaureate vocational education. The Secretary invites comments on the alternative definition of prebaccalaureate
vocational education and suggestions for preventing unwarranted course or program stretching, should the alternative
definition be adopted. The Secretary also wishes to know if commenters believe there are other risks associated with
adopting the alternative definition that might outweigh any benefits derived by the degree-granting sector of the
higher education community through its adoption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary acknowledges that the definition of ``vocational education'' in these proposed regulations differs
from the definition of ``vocational program'' as that term is defined in the proposed regulations for the State Postsecondary
Review Program (``an educational program below the baccalaureate degree level, that is not classified as a professional
program, that prepares students for gainful employment in a recognized profession''). The Secretary requests specific
comment on whether the same definition should be used in both regulations and, if so, what that definition should be.

Section 602.3&blank;Organization and Membership 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 496(a) of the HEA requires accrediting agencies whose accreditation enables the institutions they accredit
to participate in programs authorized under the HEA to be administratively and financially separate from and independent
of any related, associated, or affiliated trade association or membership organization. The term ``separate and
independent'' is defined in section 496(b) of the HEA. In &sect;602.3 (a), (b), and (c) of the proposed regulations,
the Secretary reiterates the statutory requirement and definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the negotiated rulemaking sessions, non-Federal negotiators expressed concern that the ``separate and
independent'' requirement would prevent any joint use of personnel, services, equipment, or facilities by an accrediting
agency and a related, associated, or affiliated trade association or membership organization, a practice that is
fairly common among accrediting agencies and helps reduce the cost of accreditation. To address this concern, in
&sect;602.3(d) the Secretary proposes conditions that accrediting agencies must meet regarding the joint use of
personnel, services, equipment, or facilities if that use is not to be considered a violation of the ``separate and
independent'' requirement. The Secretary believes this approach respects the intent of Congress yet eases the financial
burden on agencies to implement the new requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 496(a) of the HEA permits the Secretary to waive the ``separate and independent'' requirement if the agency
is one that, for purposes of determining eligibility for SFA programs, either conducts accreditation through a voluntary
membership organization of individuals participating in a profession or has as its principal purpose the accreditation
of programs within institutions that are accredited by another agency recognized by the Secretary. In &sect;602.3(e)
of the proposed regulations, the Secretary proposes conditions under which the Secretary may waive the ``separate
and independent'' requirement. Specifically, the Secretary proposes to grant an agency's request for a waiver if
the agency demonstrates to the Secretary's satisfaction that the existing relationship between the agency and the
trade association or membership organization has not compromised the independence of its accreditation process.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In providing comments with regard to this section, the Secretary advises commenters that only the type of accrediting
agency described in &sect;602.3(b)(4) may seek a waiver of the separate and independent requirement under the law.
Thus, the Secretary is precluded by statute from waiving this requirement for any other type of accrediting agency.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Secretary wishes to note that the language in &sect;602.3(c)(2) specifying that no less than one-seventh
of an agency's decision-making body must consist of representatives of the public is derived from language in the
Conference Report stating that the House agrees to the requirement in the Senate bill that ``at least one out of every
seven members of an accreditation association's board be members of the general public.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 602.4&blank;Submission of Information to the Secretary by Recognized Accrediting Agencies
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 496 does not specifically address the type of information that a recognized accrediting agency must submit
to the Secretary to enable the Secretary to evaluate whether the agency continues to comply with the requirements
for recognition throughout its recognition period. In &sect;602.4 (a),(b), (c), (d), and (f) of the proposed regulations,
the Secretary proposes various types of information that recognized agencies must routinely submit to the Secretary
during their recognition period. All of the items on the list were agreed to by the negotiators, who did not perceive
them to be particularly burdensome to agencies to provide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of particular note is the requirement in &sect;602.4(e) that accrediting agencies must submit to the Secretary,
upon request, information to assist the Secretary in resolving problems with any institution or program accredited
by the agency, provided the Secretary's request does not conflict with the agency's policies on confidentiality
with respect to its records on its institutions or programs. This provision reflects the agreement of negotiators.
However, the Secretary has reconsidered the ``confidentiality'' aspect of this provision because of a concern that
certain information that the Secretary may need to resolve a problem with a particular institution or program may
not be obtainable from an agency because of its confidentiality policies. The Secretary believes this situation
is untenable because it allows agencies to withhold information that the Secretary may need to carry out the Secretary's
responsibilities under the Act, such as determining whether an institution or program accredited by the agency should
remain eligible to participate in SFA programs. The Secretary seeks suggestions for resolving this dilemma in a manner
that respects both the agency's need for confidentiality and the Secretary's need for information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also is considering adding to this section a requirement that an accrediting agency must refer to the
Department's Office of Inspector General any fraudulent activities it discovers on the part of an institution or
program that it accredits, if the institution or program participates in Department programs. The Secretary invites
comments on this possible additional requirement and alternative approaches to sharing information among members
of the triad concerning suspected fraudulent activity by an institution or program.

Subpart B_Recognition and Termination Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 496(o) of the HEA requires the Secretary to provide, by regulation, the procedures the Secretary uses for
recognizing accrediting agencies. In the proposed regulations, the Secretary proposes to specify procedures for
recognizing accrediting agencies in far greater detail than in current or previous regulations. The Secretary believes
this greater detail is necessary to ensure that all agencies applying for recognition, as well as other interested
parties, have a clear understanding of the entire process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary acknowledges that the application for recognition constitutes a significant burden on agencies seeking
recognition by the Secretary. For this reason, the Secretary is considering ways to minimize the burden. One approach
under consideration is to allow an agency to provide a simple statement of assurance, along with supporting documentation,
that it meets certain requirements for recognition. The Secretary estimates that at least two-thirds of the requirements
in the proposed regulations are amenable to this type of approach, and the resultant savings in time, effort, and cost
to prepare an application for recognition would be significant. The Secretary invites comments on this approach
and alternative methods for minimizing the burden on agencies of the application process without adversely affecting
the Secretary's ability to conduct a thorough evaluation of the agency.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The recognition process, as described in subpart B of the proposed regulations, consists of an application to the
Secretary by the agency, an analysis of the application by a designated Department official, an opportunity for a
written response to that analysis by the applicant agency, a review of the agency's application by the National Advisory
Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity (Advisory Committee), a recommendation to the Secretary by the
Advisory Committee with regard to that application, an opportunity to contest the Advisory Committee's recommendation
by either the agency or the designated Department official, and, finally, a decision on that application by the Secretary.
The analysis of an agency's application by the designated Department official includes publication of a notice of
the agency's application in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 inviting comment on the agency's compliance with the requirements for recognition and a review by the designated
Department official of any public comment received. The Secretary believes the new procedures for recognition allow
an agency a full and fair review of its application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Additional appeal procedures.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed regulations add two key new steps to the recognition process. First, in &sect;602.11(b) the Secretary
gives an accrediting agency seeking recognition by the Secretary an opportunity to respond in writing to the designated
Department official's analysis of its application for recognition before the application is reviewed by the Advisory
Committee. Second, in &sect;602.13(b), after the Advisory Committee completes its review of the agency's application
and makes a recommendation to the Secretary on the agency's application, the Secretary gives both the agency and the
designated Department official an opportunity to contest the Advisory Committee's recommendation. The contesting
party, however, may not submit any evidence to the Secretary that it did not submit to the Advisory Committee. This
restriction is to ensure that the Advisory Committee's authority is not circumvented. The Secretary believes that
in general the only reasonable grounds for contesting an Advisory Committee recommendation would be if the contesting
party could demonstrate that the Advisory Committee either misunderstood or did not take into proper account certain
information presented by the contesting party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The negotiators reached consensus during the negotiated rulemaking sessions on the first step. The Secretary added
the second step after the negotiated rulemaking sessions ended to address the non-Federal negotiators' concerns
about the lack of sufficient appeal mechanisms for agencies prior to the Secretary's final decision. The Secretary
believes that these two new steps in the proposed recognition process provide agencies with sufficient opportunity
to present any concerns they might have regarding the recommendation of either the designated Department official
or the Advisory Committee before the Secretary reaches a decision on the agency's application.

Announced and unannounced site visits by the Secretary.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 496(n) of the HEA requires the Secretary to conduct an independent analysis of an agency's application for
recognition, which must include a site visit to the accrediting agency and may, at the Secretary's discretion, include
site visits to representative institutions or programs accredited by the agency. Section 496(n) of the HEA also provides
that the site visits may be unannounced, as appropriate. Accordingly, both &sect;602.10(b) and &sect;602.11(b)
of the proposed regulations provide for unannounced site visits. Specifically, the Secretary proposes to conduct
unannounced site visits only, where necessary in the judgment of the Secretary, to obtain information to verify the
agency's compliance with the requirements for recognition and the information would not be forthcoming in an announced
site visit. The Secretary wishes to make it clear that this Secretarial judgment is not subject to challenge by an accrediting
agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;602.11(b), the Secretary also proposes that the Secretary's evaluation of an agency may include a review
of information directly related to the institutions or programs accredited by the agency, as this information relates
to the institution's or program's compliance with the agency's standards, the effectiveness of those standards,
or the agency's application of those standards. The Secretary believes that the inclusion of this language in the
proposed regulations, which was agreed to by negotiators, provides the agency, the institutions and programs it
accredits, and the general public with a clear understanding of the scope of the Secretary's evaluation of an agency.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In sum, to implement section 496(n) of the HEA, the proposed regulations make it clear that in evaluating an agency's
application for recognition, the Secretary may not and does not depend solely on written submissions from the accrediting
agency or on announced visits to the agency or its member institutions or programs. The Secretary makes a more thorough
and independent evaluation of an agency's application for recognition, including, where appropriate, unannounced
visits to ensure that information available to the designated Department official is comprehensive, accurate,
and unbiased, and to ensure that the agency is actually carrying out its stated policies and procedures.

Scope of recognition requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under &sect;602.10(b) of the current regulations, in order for an accrediting agency to be recognized by the Secretary,
the agency has to meet each recognition criterion taken as a whole unless it can demonstrate to the Secretary's satisfaction
that one or more criteria should not be applied. In &sect;602.13(c) of the proposed regulations, the Secretary requires
an agency to meet each of the requirements contained in this part. However, in &sect;602.13(e) the Secretary proposes
that the Secretary may exercise discretion and grant recognition to an agency that does not comply with each requirement
if the Secretary determines that the agency's effectiveness is not impaired by its noncompliance. Such discretion
might, for example, be exercised if an accrediting agency is unable to conduct an unannounced site visit, as required
by &sect;602.24, because the program being evaluated is offered on a military installation that requires prior approval
before any visitors are permitted on the installation. The Secretary believes that Secretarial discretion provides
the desired flexibility that non-Federal negotiators sought during the negotiated rulemaking sessions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consensus was reached by negotiators regarding the elements to be included in the scope of recognition the Secretary
grants to an agency, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., geographic area, the degrees or certificates awarded, the types of courses or programs offered, and the length
of the recognition period. In the proposed regulations, the Secretary has clarified that an agency's scope of recognition
does not automatically extend to any preaccreditation status it offers. Rather, when an agency formally applies
for recognition, it must include the types of preaccreditation status for which it seeks recognition, and the Secretary
grants recognition to an agency for each preaccreditation status if the agency complies with all the requirements
for recognition with regard to that preaccreditation status.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 496(l) of the HEA permits the Secretary to limit, suspend, or terminate the Secretary's recognition of an
accrediting agency before the completion of the agency's recognition period if the Secretary determines that the
agency has failed to meet any of the requirements of part 602. In &sect;602.14 of the proposed regulations, the Secretary
establishes the procedures to be followed before the Secretary may limit, suspend, or terminate an agency's recognition.
The proposed procedures allow the agency to request a hearing to contest that action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes that, if an agency requests a hearing, the hearing will be conducted by the Advisory Committee.
However, the Secretary further proposes that the hearing may be conducted by a subcommittee of the Advisory Committee,
consisting of three members of the Advisory Committee, if the schedule of the full Advisory Committee would not permit
a hearing to be held in a timely manner. After evaluating the evidence presented before it, the Advisory Committee
or subcommittee makes a recommendation to the Secretary as to whether the sanction proposed by the designated Department
official, no sanction, or another sanction is warranted. Any hearing held under this section is open to the public.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the negotiated rulemaking sessions, in response to non-Federal negotiators' concerns about the lack of sufficient
appeal mechanisms, the Secretary added to this section a provision that either party in a hearing may appeal the Advisory
Committee's or subcommittee's recommendation to the Secretary.

Section602.15&blank;Requests for Reconsideration of the Secretary's Decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 496(o) of the HEA requires the Secretary to provide in regulation the procedures to be followed by an accrediting
agency for the appeal of the Secretary's decision regarding its application for recognition. Accordingly, in &sect;602.15
of the proposed regulations, the Secretary permits an agency to request reconsideration of a final decision of the
Secretary regarding either the agency's application for recognition or the limitation, suspension, or termination
of the agency's recognition. However, &sect;602.15(a)(2) proposes that a request for reconsideration may be made
only under limited conditions. Under these limited conditions, the agency may request reconsideration only if it
demonstrates that it has new information that could not have been presented previously and that the information is
likely to result in reversal of the Secretary's decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While, as noted by the non-Federal negotiators at the negotiated rulemaking sessions, the grounds for reconsideration
are narrow, the Secretary believes the narrow grounds are appropriate. Adverse decisions regarding an agency's
application for recognition are made by the Advisory Committee and forwarded to the Secretary. Under &sect;602.13,
the agency may appeal the Advisory Committee's recommendation to the Secretary. Similarly, under &sect;602.14,
the agency may appeal an adverse Advisory Committee or subcommittee recommendation to the Secretary under a limitation,
suspension or termination proceeding. Therefore, the Secretary believes that reconsideration requests should
be narrowly circumscribed. The Secretary notes that non-Federal negotiators requested opportunities for agencies
to request reconsideration in cases where the Secretary had not established appeal procedures. Given the provisions
for appeal that are now in the proposed regulations, the Secretary requests public comment on whether reconsideration
procedures are necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary wishes to make clear that any agency that fails to notify the Secretary of its intent to file a written
request for reconsideration within the 10-day time frame specified in the regulations forfeits its right to reconsideration.
Additionally, the Secretary wishes to reiterate that, in general, any failure to meet a required deadline date in
any appeal to the Secretary results in a forfeiture of that appeal right. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While consensus was reached during the negotiated rulemaking sessions that an agency should have 45 days to submit
its written request for reconsideration, the Secretary questions whether a shorter period_30 days_is sufficient
for the agency to prepare an adequate request, given the fact that 30 days is the usual time frame specified by the Department
for other types of appeals to the Secretary. The Secretary requests comments on the shorter period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because requests for reconsideration are restricted to instances where the Secretary's decision involves denial,
limitation, suspension, or termination of an agency's recognition, it is anticipated that, due to the extensive
material that must be reviewed, the Secretary will require more than 30 days to reach a final decision on an agency's
request for reconsideration. Non-Federal negotiators were concerned that there be some time limit imposed to bring
the issue to closure. Accordingly, the Secretary is proposing a 60-day time frame for reaching a final decision on
an agency's request for reconsideration.

As mentioned in &sect;602.15, section 496(o) of the HEA requires the Secretary to provide for the appeal of the Secretary's
decision regarding an accrediting agency's application for recognition. In &sect;602.16 of the proposed regulations,
the Secretary provides for an appeal to the Federal courts of all final decisions of the Secretary regarding an agency's
application for recognition. During the negotiated rulemaking sessions, non-Federal negotiators urged an appeals
procedure other than through the courts, as, for example, through an administrative law judge. However, the Secretary
believes that there can be no administrative appeal within the Department of a Secretarial decision since the Secretary,
as head of the Department of Education, makes all final decisions on behalf of the Department. It should be noted, however,
that in response to the non-Federal negotiators' concerns, the Secretary has modified the proposed recognition
procedures to include an opportunity for an agency to appeal an Advisory Committee's recommendation to the Secretary
before the Secretary reaches a final decision on the agency's application. The proposed limitation, suspension,
and termination procedures also have been modified to provide for an appeal to the Secretary of an Advisory Committee
or subcommittee recommendation.

Section 602.22&blank;Demonstration of Accreditation Experience 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 496(a)(1) of the HEA requires accrediting agencies to demonstrate experience in operating as an accrediting
agency as a condition for recognition. In &sect;602.22 of the proposed regulations, the Secretary defines what a
demonstration of accrediting experience must include, basically reiterating the requirements for experience
set forth in &sect;602.14 of the current regulations. However, &sect;602.22 does not contain the requirement set
forth in &sect;602.14(c) of the current regulations that agencies must demonstrate that their policies, evaluation
methods, and decisions are accepted throughout the United States by recognized accrediting agencies. The Secretary
is aware, as argued by the non-Federal negotiators, that this requirement is an important indicator of an agency's
acceptance. On the other hand, this requirement has been subject to criticism by persons and institutions interested
in forming new accrediting agencies. These individuals and agencies have often expressed concern to the Secretary
that this requirement imposes unfair hurdles for them and unduly stifles competition among accrediting agencies.
The Secretary proposes to eliminate this requirement because the Secretary believes that it is inappropriate to
require acceptance by recognized agencies as a condition for recognition even though evidence of acceptance by recognized
accrediting agencies provides some measure of an agency's reliability.

Section 602.23&blank;Application of Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current regulations require accrediting agencies to maintain a systematic program of review designed to assess
the validity and reliability of their criteria, procedures, and standards and their relevance to the educational
and training needs of affected students. As this requirement is fundamental to sound accrediting practice, there
was consensus among negotiators that it should continue to be part of any regulations governing the accrediting agency
recognition process. However, the language of the requirement has been changed in the proposed regulations from
the language of the current regulations in response to the non-Federal negotiators' concerns about various technical
interpretations of the words ``validity and reliability.'' The substance of the requirement, as expressed in &sect;602.23(b)(5),
is unchanged. The Secretary wishes to emphasize the importance of this requirement, which is fundamental to the establishment
of sound standards for the accreditation process and the determination of educational quality.

Section 602.24&blank;Accreditation Processes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 496(c)(1) of the HEA requires that, in addition to the announced on-site review that is part of the regular
accreditation process, an accrediting agency whose accreditation enables the institutions it accredits to participate
in programs authorized under the HEA must conduct, some time during any accreditation or preaccreditation period,
at least one unannounced on-site review at each institution that provides vocational education or training. Accordingly,
in &sect;602.24(c) of the proposed regulations, the Secretary requires unannounced site visits by these accrediting
agencies. However, as noted in the discussion of &sect;602.2, if the term ``vocational education'' is interpreted
literally, it could be viewed as including all postsecondary education, and, under this interpretation, accrediting
agencies would have to conduct unannounced site visits to all institutions. To avoid this outcome, in &sect;602.24(c)
of the proposed regulations, the Secretary limits the type of vocational education programs that trigger unannounced
visits to the prebaccalaureate level. As non-Federal negotiators were divided among themselves as to the definition
of vocational education, they did not reach consensus on this point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As mentioned in the discussion under &sect;602.2, the Secretary is considering an alternative definition of prebaccalaureate
vocational education that would not require unannounced site visits to degree-granting institutions whose prebaccalaureate
vocational programs lead to the associate degree. This would minimize the burden of the new requirement for unannounced
visits, hopefully without any adverse consequences. The Secretary invites comments on this approach and suggestions
for alternative ways of reducing the burden without eliminating from review those institutions offering vocational
education that have abused the Title IV program.

Section 602.25&blank;Additions to or Substantive Changes in Educational Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 496(a) of the HEA authorizes the Secretary to recognize accrediting agencies that are reliable authorities
as to the quality of the education or training provided by the institutions or programs they accredit. Section 496
does not specifically address the manner in which accrediting agencies evaluate either new programs begun by institutions
after their last grant of accreditation or preaccreditation or programs that are substantially changed after the
institution is accredited or preaccredited. However, the Secretary believes that an agency cannot be a reliable
authority as to the quality of education or training offered by an institution if the agency does not assess those new
or substantively changed programs. Accordingly, in &sect;602.25 of the proposed regulations, the Secretary establishes
the framework for a policy that accrediting agencies must have to address additions to and substantive changes in
educational programs. Specifically, in &sect;602.25(a) the Secretary proposes that an accrediting agency may
include within its previous grant of accreditation or preaccreditation an educational program that an institution
initially offers or substantively changes after that grant of accreditation or preaccreditation only if the agency
specifically evaluates and approves the program. The Secretary proposes this requirement based upon the past actions
of some accrediting agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certain accrediting agencies that accredit institutions offering specific prebaccalaureate vocational education
programs have, on occasion, extended their accreditation to additional programs that these institutions offered
after being accredited, without evaluating the quality of those additional programs, even though the additional
programs were totally unrelated to the programs initially accredited. For example, an accrediting agency that accredited
an institution that offered cosmetology courses extended its accreditation to additional programs that the institution
subsequently offered in jet airplane mechanics and air conditioning and refrigeration without ever evaluating
the quality of those additional programs. The Secretary believes that this practice violates the purpose of accreditation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, the Secretary believes that prior approval of programs is not necessary in all circumstances, a
belief shared by negotiators, although no consensus was reached as to the circumstances. In &sect;602.25(b) the
Secretary proposes an exception to this requirement if the institution notifies the accrediting agency of the new
or substantially changed program before it is offered, and the new or substantially changed program does not provide
prebaccalaureate vocational education. The Secretary proposes this exception because the Secretary believes
that new bachelor and higher degree programs are thoroughly reviewed by a variety of entities before they may be offered.
Most institutional accrediting agencies, for example, require institutions to have thorough internal reviews
of all new degree programs by curriculum committees, governing boards, and other appropriate units within the institution
and to obtain appropriate state authorization for those new degree programs before they are offered. However, even
though an accrediting agency may not be required by these proposed regulations to evaluate a new or substantially
changed program before it is offered under &sect;602.25(b), accrediting agencies are certainly free, and encouraged,
to do so under their own policies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary acknowledges that the task of deciding which programs should require preapproval by accrediting agencies
is a difficult one and seeks suggestions from commenters. For commenters who suggest that preapproval be allowed
for prebaccalaureate vocational education programs that are ``related'' to a previously accredited program, the
Secretary requests specific suggestions on how to determine whether the new or substantially changed program is
``related'' to the other program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary notes that most accrediting agencies already have a definition of ``substantive change'' but observes
that there is considerable variation among agencies as to what this term means. Most agencies' definitions generally
include the following kinds of changes: a substantial change in the length of a program, its content, or both, as, for
example, when a secretarial program increases from 1200 clock hours to 1600 clock hours to provide a 400-hour component
in office automation; a change from a traditional 15-week semester format to an alternate weekend format; and a change
from a certificate program to an associate degree program. The Secretary seeks to require preapproval for these and
similar types of changes and proposes that an agency's definition of a substantive change in an educational program
include, at a minimum, a substantial change in the number of clock or credit hours, the number of weeks, or the content
of a program, a change in the type of program offered, a change in the credential awarded for completion of the program,
and a change in the manner in which the institution measures the educational quantity of the program from clock hours
to credit hours. The Secretary invites comments on this approach as well as suggestions for alternative approaches
to defining which types of programs require preapproval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Secretary acknowledges that the proposed requirement for a substantive change policy may result in
increased costs to agencies and, in turn, institutions. However, for the reasons noted above, the Secretary believes
the benefits far outweigh the costs. The Secretary also wishes to note that there was general consensus among non-Federal
negotiators about the appropriateness of including a substantive change requirement in the proposed regulations.
However, not all of the negotiators agreed that the approach proposed by the Secretary was appropriate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 496 of the HEA authorizes the Secretary to recognize accrediting agencies that are reliable authorities
as to the quality of the education or training provided by the institutions or programs only if the agencies satisfy
standards established by the Secretary. Section 496(a) specifically requires the Secretary to establish standards
and requires the standards to include ``an appropriate measure or measures of student achievement.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 496(a)(5) of the HEA provides that the Secretary's standards for recognition of accrediting agencies must
require that an accrediting agency establish accreditation standards that assess 12 areas pertaining to the institutions
or programs it accredits. These areas are: (1) Curricula; (2) faculty; (3) facilities, equipment and supplies; (4)
fiscal and administrative capacity as appropriate to the specified scale of operation; (5) student support services;
(6) recruiting and admissions practices, academic calendars, catalogs, publications, grading and advertising;
(7) program length and tuition and fees in relation to the subject matters taught and the objectives of the degrees
or credentials offered; (8) measures of program length in clock hours or credit hours; (9) success with respect to
student achievement in relation to the institution's mission; (10) default rates in student loan programs under
Title IV of the HEA; (11) record of student complaints received by, or available to, the accrediting agency; and (12)
the institution's compliance with its program responsibilities under title IV of the HEA. However, under section
496(a)(5), accrediting agencies that have as their principal purpose the accrediting of institutions of higher
education or higher education programs to enable them to participate in Federal programs not authorized under the
HEA are exempt from the requirement to have standards for the areas listed in (7), (8), (9), (10), and (12). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary notes that most accrediting agencies already have standards addressing many of these areas. However,
to the extent that an agency does not have standards for all of them, there is an increased cost to that agency to develop
and implement the new standards. The Secretary believes that the proposed regulations minimize the increased cost
by allowing agencies maximum flexibility to set their standards to best suit their needs and the needs of the institutions
or programs they accredit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the ultimate purpose of section 496 is to authorize the Secretary to recognize accrediting agencies that are reliable
authorities as to the quality of the education or training provided by the institutions or programs they accredit,
so that recognized agencies only accredit institutions or programs of demonstrated quality, then the Secretary
believes that each agency's standard for a particular area listed in section 496(a)(5) must evaluate the quality
of the effort the institution or program is making in that area.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, in &sect;602.26 of the proposed regulations, the Secretary requires accrediting agencies to have
standards assessing the 12 areas cited in section 496(a)(5) of the HEA. In &sect;602.26(a)(3), the Secretary exempts
accrediting agencies whose accreditation enables their institutions or programs to participate only in Federal
programs not authorized under the HEA from having to establish standards for the areas listed under (7), (8), (10),
and (12). However, the Secretary does not exempt these agencies from the requirement to establish standards that
assess success with respect to student achievement. The Secretary believes that the standards specified in &sect;602.26(b)(9)
fulfill the requirement in section 496(a) of the HEA that the Secretary recognize accrediting agencies that meet
the Secretary's standards, which must include ``an appropriate measure or measures of student achievement.'' Furthermore,
the Secretary believes that any determination by an accrediting agency that the program or institution it accredits
provides quality education or training must be based, in part, on an assessment of the achievement of students enrolled
in the institution or program. The Secretary notes that the exemption provided in section 496(a)(5) of the HEA for
certain standards was not discussed during negotiated rulemaking because it was added as a technical legislative
amendment after the negotiations took place. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each of the 12 required standards is discussed below. The title for each standard is based on the statutory language
used in section 496(a)(5) for that standard. Unless otherwise noted, consensus was reached among negotiators as
to language for each of the standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulatory language in &sect;602.26(b) for standards addressing areas (1), (2), (3), and (5) follows
the recommendations of negotiators and simply restates the law. These four provisions require that, to be recognized
by the Secretary, an accrediting agency must adopt standards under which it evaluates the quality of an institution's
or program's curricula; faculty; facilities, equipment, and supplies; and student support services. The Secretary
has reexamined the manner in which these four standards are described in the proposed regulations and believes that
it may be more useful to provide guidance as to the manner in which quality may or should be discussed under these standards
than to simply restate the law. The Secretary requests comment on this matter. To assist commenters in this regard,
for each of the four areas, the Secretary examined the standards of several accrediting agencies to determine how
these agencies addressed quality standards for those areas and presents the results of that examination under the
appropriate topic. The Secretary invites comments on those approaches and additional suggestions for focusing
on quality assessment.

. The Secretary found that the standards most accrediting agencies have adopted to evaluate an institution's or program's
faculty relate to the overall quality of the faculty, the extent to which the institution or program relies on part-time
faculty to teach students, and the effectiveness of the teaching provided by all faculty. Some agencies also include
in their standards an assessment of the procedures an institution or program uses for the hiring, promotion, evaluation,
and professional development of faculty, while other agencies merely examine these issues in light of whether the
institution's or program's policies provide for the fair and equitable treatment of faculty. The Secretary considers
all of these to be elements of good practice in the assessment of an institution's or program's faculty. Accordingly,
the Secretary requests specific comment as to whether the manner in which these agencies handle standards for faculty
would be a useful addition to these regulations. The Secretary also invites additional comments regarding other

found that most accrediting agencies assess, in light of an institution's or program's educational objectives,
the adequacy and appropriateness of: libraries, learning resource centers, and other academic and instructional
support facilities; the equipment and supplies that support the instructional program; and any other physical resources
the institution or program uses to achieve its educational objectives. The Secretary considers all of these elements
to be good practices for the assessment of facilities, equipment, and supplies. Accordingly, the Secretary requests
specific comment as to whether the manner in which these agencies handle standards for this area would be a useful addition
to these regulations. The Secretary also invites additional comments regarding other elements that the Secretary
should include in the evaluation of accrediting agencies for compliance with this requirement.

Fiscal and administrative capacity as appropriate to the specified scale of operations
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Section 496(a)(5)(D) requires an accrediting agency to have standards that address the fiscal and administrative
capacity of an institution or program in relation to its scale of operation. It is the Secretary's view that the purpose
of this requirement is to enable the agency to determine whether the institution or program is fiscally and administratively
sound and will likely remain so for a future period. Because the financial condition of an institution is subject to
change, the Secretary proposes that an agency must make this determination each time it grants accreditation, preaccreditation,
or reaccreditation. The Secretary also proposes that an agency must examine each institution's financial capacity
in sufficient depth on an annual basis to determine if the financial capacity of the institution threatens the ability
of the institution or program to continue to meet the agency's standards and, if so, to take appropriate follow-up
action. The Secretary invites comments as to whether this follow-up action should include notifying the Secretary
of the institution's financial condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that the enhanced financial monitoring by accrediting agencies that is required by these
proposed regulations will provide increased protection to students with regard to problems arising from an institution's
financial instability.

. Section 496(a)(5)(F) requires an accrediting agency to have standards that address an institution's or program's
recruiting and admissions practices, as well as its academic calendars, catalogs, publications, grading, and advertising.
The Secretary believes this statutory provision contains two different standards. One standard relates to the appropriateness
of the institution's or program's recruiting and admission practices. Under this standard, the agency must determine
whether an institution's practices are reasonable in light of the institution's or program's educational mission.

Program length and tuition and fees in relation to the subject matters taught and the objectives of the degrees or credentials

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 496(a)(5)(G) requires an accrediting agency to have standards that address program length and tuition and
fees in relation to the subject matters taught and the objectives of the degree or credential offered. It is the Secretary's
view that one of the purposes of this requirement is to eliminate certain abuses that have been discovered at institutions
participating in Title IV, HEA programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These abusive practices fall into three main categories. One category involves accredited institutions that offer
prebaccalaureate vocational programs and charge an excessive amount of tuition and fees for programs that lead to
dead end or very low-paying jobs. In some cases, the tuition and fees for a short-term program to prepare students for
a particular job exceeded the annual income that a person employed in that job could expect to earn. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another category involves accredited institutions that offer prebaccalaureate vocational education programs
and inflate either the clock or credit hours for the program or the length of the program without educational justification,
simply to increase the amount of SFA funds these institutions may receive. The third category involves accredited
institutions that offer prebaccalaureate vocational education that are simply too short to be able to provide training
that has any value in the workplace. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to address the statutory requirement for standards related to program length and tuition
and fees by requiring an accrediting agency to establish minimum and maximum program lengths for prebaccalaureate
vocational programs. In this context, program length means both the number of clock hours or credit hours in a program
and the number of weeks that a program is offered. The Secretary invites specific comments with regard to this requirement.
The topic of standards for establishing minimum and maximum program lengths was not discussed during the negotiated
rulemaking sessions, and the Secretary invites comments on this topic as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the negotiated rulemaking sessions, consensus was reached on various factors that should be considered when
an agency establishes its standard for program length in relation to tuition and fees. These factors are listed under
&sect;602.26(b)(7) (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv). The Secretary has reconsidered this matter and now proposes two additional
factors. The first concerns any applicable Federal statutes and regulations. The Secretary does not believe the
addition of a requirement for agencies to take into account applicable statutes and regulations when developing
their standards goes beyond the intent of the HEA because it does not require agencies to adopt the Federal policies
but simply to take them into account. The second factor concerns the relationship between tuition and fees for a prebaccalaureate
vocational program and the remuneration that a graduate of that program can reasonably be expected to receive. The
Secretary is concerned about this issue for this type of program because the very purpose of a prebaccalaureate vocational
program is to prepare a student for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. Moreover, the Secretary is concerned
that tuition and fees being charged for prebaccalaureate vocational programs may be excessive given the type of job
for which a graduate of the program qualifies. Accordingly, the Secretary requests specific comment regarding standards
that address tuition and fee charges for a prebaccalaureate vocational program 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
vis-a-vis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the remuneration that graduates of a program may receive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary requests comments on the various factors proposed for standards that assess program length and tuition
and fees. In calling for comments with regard to this standard, the Secretary wishes to remind commenters that a violation
of a standard does not necessarily preclude an agency from accrediting an institution or program. The violation would,
however, at least require the institution to justify its tuition and fee charges to the agency.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary acknowledges that the development of standards for this area involves very complex issues. For the
purpose of stimulating discussion in this area, the Secretary offers the following possible approaches to the development
of standards. Under one approach, the standard might require that annualized tuition and fees for a program not exceed
a percentage of the annualized minimum wage. Under another approach, the standard might require that annualized
tuition and fees for a program not exceed a percentage of the program's graduates' average earnings for their first
year of employment. Under still another approach, annualized tuition and fees for a program could not exceed a percentage
of the average annualized wages, as reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in occupations for which the program
prepares students. In suggesting possible approaches to the establishment of standards for this area, the Secretary
reminds commenters of the difficulty in obtaining employment information, including salaries and wages, from graduates
of an institution for periods beyond the first year after graduation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary is considering establishing in other regulations requirements governing program length and tuition
and fees for programs that are eligible to participate in the SFA programs. Accordingly, if those regulatory requirements
are established, the Secretary would consider requiring an accrediting agency to notify the Secretary if it knows
that an institution's program is too long or too short under that requirement, or if it knows that an institution's
tuition and fee charges violate that other requirement. The Secretary invites comments about the feasibility of
adding this notification requirement or any alternative method of obtaining this information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Secretary notes that the requirement to establish a standard for program length and tuition and fees
applies only to those accrediting agencies whose accreditation enables the institutions they accredit to participate
in programs authorized under the HEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 602.26(b)(8)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Measures of program length in clock hours or credit hours.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 496(a)(5)(H) requires an accrediting agency to have standards that address measures of program length in
clock or credit hours. It is the Secretary's view that the purpose of this requirement is to enable the agency to determine
if an institution take into proper account, as appropriate, factors such as program objectives and content, the types
and locations of instructional delivery, and the knowledge and skills necessary for students to reach competence
in the field being taught when determining the length of its programs in clock or credit hours. General agreement was
reached by negotiators with regard to the substance of this standard. However, the Secretary has reconsidered this
matter and now proposes an additional factor: any applicable Federal statutes and regulations. The Secretary does
not believe the addition of a requirement for agencies to take into account applicable statutes and regulations when
developing their standards goes beyond the HEA because it does not require agencies to adopt the Federal policies
but simply to take them into account. The Secretary invites comments on this proposed addition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To the extent that the Secretary regulates this area in other regulations governing the SFA programs, these regulations
may need to be modified. Moreover, as indicated with regard to &sect;602.26(b)(7), if those other regulations are
established, the Secretary may consider requiring an accrediting agency to notify the Secretary if it knows that
an institution's measure of the number of credits hours in its programs does not satisfy that other regulatory requirement.
The Secretary invites comments about the feasibility of adding this notification requirement or on alternative
methods of obtaining this information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary notes that the requirement to establish a standard for measures of program length in clock or credit
hours applies only to those accrediting agencies whose accreditation enables the institutions they accredit to
participate in programs authorized under the HEA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 496(a)(5)(I) of the HEA requires an accrediting agency to have standards that address success with respect
to student achievement in relation to mission, including, as appropriate, consideration of course completion rates,
pass rates on State licensing examinations, and job placement rates. It is the Secretary's view that standards for
student achievement are the most important of all accreditation standards because the true success of an institution
or program is measured by the success of its students. For institutions that offer prebaccalaureate vocational programs,
the Secretary proposes to require agencies to establish minimum quantitative standards for completion rates, job
placement rates, and pass rates on State licensing examinations for those programs, since gainful employment is
the purpose of those programs. The Secretary proposes this additional requirement for institutions offering prebaccalaureate
vocational education programs because, as noted in the discussion under &sect;602.26(b)(7), these institutions
have often engaged in abusive practices. The Secretary notes that the concept of minimum quantitative standards,
even when restricted to prebaccalaureate vocational education, was not supported by non-Federal negotiators.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary acknowledges that there are many possible approaches to the establishment of the standards for measuring
success in prebaccalaureate vocational programs, both in terms of the information collected and the minimum standard
selected. For example, if an institution's students are mainly first-time, full-time students in short-term programs,
agencies could use data collected by institutions under the Student Right-to-Know and Campus Security Act of 1990
for calculating completion rates. Minimum job placement rate standards might be developed using three-year moving
averages, adjusted for regional unemployment rates as computed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department
of Labor. Further, a job placement rate could be calculated only for those jobs in the areas for which training was offered,
all jobs obtained by graduates, or a combination of the two. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary specifically invites suggestions for standards in this area. Further, the Secretary understands
that developing appropriate standards in these areas is not easy and requests suggestions with regard to specific
rates for the standards in these areas. The Secretary suggests as a reference point for completion and placement rates
the statutory requirement, contained in section 481(e)(2) of the HEA, that, to be an eligible short-term vocational
program under the SFA programs, a program must have a 70 percent completion and a 70 percent placement rate.

Default rates in the student loan programs established under Title IV of the HEA
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Section 496(a)(5)(J) of the HEA requires an accrediting agency to have standards that address an institution's
default rates in the student loan programs established under Title IV of the HEA. It is the Secretary's view that the
purpose of this requirement is to enable the agency to determine if an institution is out of compliance with its accrediting
standards when the institution's latest cohort default rate under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) programs
exceeds a certain threshold or has increased significantly over its previous rate. The Secretary proposes to require
an agency to conduct a review if an institution's latest cohort default rate equals or exceeds 25 percent. The Secretary
establishes this rate as the trigger for review because that is the rate, beginning in fiscal year 1994, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 October 1, 1993, at which an institution will be disqualified from participating in the FFEL programs. An accrediting
agency is free, of course, to set its trigger for review at a default rate below 25 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also is concerned that a significant change in an institution's default rate could be an indication
of other serious problems that may affect the institution's compliance with an agency's standards. For this reason,
the Secretary proposes to require an agency to conduct a review when the institution's latest cohort default rate
increases significantly over its rate the previous year. The Secretary does not propose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to define the term ``significant increase'' in the proposed regulations but invites comments on an appropriate definition.
One possibility that the Secretary is considering is to require an agency to conduct a review when the institution's
default rate increases by more than 50 percent from its previous rate, provided that previous rate exceeds 10 percent.
The Secretary believes that a cohort default rate below 10 percent is not necessarily an indication that the institution
may be in violation of its accrediting agency's standards. Therefore, this provision would apply only if the institution's
latest cohort default rate exceeds 15 percent and has increased by more than 50 percent from its previous rate. The
Secretary invites comments on this approach and other approaches that will provide guidance to agencies on what constitutes
a significant increase in default rate.

. Section 496(a)(5)(K) of the HEA requires an accrediting agency to have standards that address the record of student
complaints received by, or available to, an agency concerning an institution or program it accredits. It is the Secretary's
view that the purpose of this requirement is to enable an agency to focus its evaluation of the institution or program
on the matters that gave rise to the student complaints when the agency undertakes its next evaluation of the institution
or program.

Compliance with an institution's program responsibilities under Title IV of the Act
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Section 496(a)(5)(L) of the HEA requires an accrediting agency to have standards that address an institution's
compliance with its program responsibilities under Title IV of the Act. It is the Secretary's view that an institution's
failure to comply with its Title IV responsibilities should be a factor in an accrediting agency's determination
as to whether that institution should continue to be accredited by the agency. The Secretary recognizes that accrediting
agencies do not have the responsibility, expertise, personnel, or time to evaluate, on a routine basis, whether the
institutions they accredit are in compliance with their Title IV responsibilities. On the other hand, agencies may
not ignore information provided to them regarding the lack of compliance of those institutions. Accordingly, the
Secretary proposes that, in assessing an institution's compliance under this standard, the agency relies on documentation
forwarded to it by the Secretary. The Secretary wishes to make it clear that this section of the proposed regulations
does not require accrediting agencies to review an institution to determine whether the institution is fulfilling
its responsibilities under the SFA programs, as, for example, by verifying that an institution is calculating Pell
distributions properly. Rather, the Secretary expects agencies to use the information provided by the Secretary
on the institution to trigger a review of the institution for compliance with agency standards if the documentation
provided by the Secretary indicates a problem that is related to one or more of the agency's standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary notes that the requirement to establish standards for this area applies only to those accrediting agencies

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The institution's practice of making refunds to students
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Under section 484B of the HEA, an institution participating in the SFA programs must have a fair and equitable refund
policy. An institution's refund policy is judged to be fair and equitable if it provides a refund in an amount of at least
the largest of the amounts provided under ``(1) the requirements of applicable State law; (2) the specific refund
requirements established by the institution's nationally recognized accrediting agency and approved by the Secretary;
or (3) the pro rata refund calculation'' described elsewhere in section 484B. To permit an institution to satisfy
the fair and equitable refund requirement using this criterion, the Secretary proposes not to recognize an accrediting
agency unless the agency has a refund policy that provides for a fair and equitable refund to a student of tuition, fees,
and other institutional charges. Thus, the Secretary's recognition of an agency means that the Secretary has approved
that agency's refund policy. Non-Federal negotiators objected to the inclusion of this requirement in the proposed
regulations on the grounds that section 496(g) of the HEA explicitly states that the Secretary may not establish standards
for accrediting agencies that are not required by section 496. The Secretary believes, however, that the inclusion
of a requirement for a standard addressing an institution's refund policy in the proposed regulations is necessary
to comply with section 484B of the HEA.

. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;602.26(c), the Secretary proposes that, when an institution or program fails to meet an agency standard,
the agency may permit the institution or program a period, which may not exceed 18 months, during which time it must
take corrective action to bring itself back into compliance with the standard. The agency is free to set the time frame
for coming into compliance at less than 18 months. If the institution or program fails to bring itself into compliance
during the specified period, the agency must take adverse action, unless it finds that the time frame for achieving
compliance should be extended for cause. Of course, the agency may take adverse action against an institution or program,
either immediately or in less than 18 months, without offering the institution or program the opportunity to take
corrective action if the agency believes that the adverse action is necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that the 18-month time frame is necessary to ensure that institutions and programs make serious
efforts to improve the quality of their offerings and to ensure that accrediting agencies take adverse actions when
institutions fail to make those efforts. Accordingly, the Secretary anticipates that extensions beyond 18 months
for cause will not be routinely granted. Additionally, the Secretary anticipates that for violations that are easily
correctable, the appropriate period will be significantly less than 18 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary is considering adding to this section a requirement that an accrediting agency must take action not
only if it determines that an institution or program is not in compliance with a standard but also if it determines that
an institution or program may currently meet the standard but is unlikely to be able to continue to meet the standard.
The Secretary invites comments on this possible addition to the section.

Section 496(c) of the HEA requires accrediting agencies whose accreditation enables institutions to participate

in ownership that result in changes in control. Accordingly, in &sect;602.27 of the proposed regulations, the Secretary
reiterates the requirement for special action set forth in that section. For purposes of this section, the Secretary
notes that the term ``branch campus'' includes any ``additional location,'' which the Secretary defines to be a location
that is geographically apart from the main campus, that has its own separate administrative structure, services,
and facilities, and at which the institution plans to offer a complete educational program. The Secretary believes
the inclusion of additional locations in this requirement is consistent with the intent of Congress. The close scrutiny
of branch campuses and additional locations includes the requirement contained in sections 496(c)((2) and (3) to
approve a business plan for a branch prior to its opening; to extend accreditation to the branch only after determining
that it has sufficient educational, financial, operations, management, and physical resources to provide education
or training consistent with the accreditation standards; and to conduct on-site reviews within six months for all
new branches and all institutions that change ownership that results in a change in control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another requirement of section 496(c) of the HEA is that any institution participating in Title IV, HEA programs that
enters into a teach-out agreement with another institution must agree to submit to its accrediting agency for approval
a teach-out agreement that is consistent with applicable standards and regulations. In &sect;602.27(b) of the proposed
regulations, the Secretary reiterates this requirement.

Section 602.28&blank;Due Process for Institutions and Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 496(a)(6) of the HEA requires an accrediting agency seeking recognition by the Secretary to use procedures
throughout its accreditation process that satisfy due process requirements. Accordingly, in &sect;602.28 of the
proposed regulations, the Secretary sets out this due process requirement. Specifically, in &sect;602.28 the Secretary
requires an agency to set forth in writing all of its procedures governing its accreditation and preaccreditation
processes, including its processes for the appeal of an adverse action it takes against an institution or program,
to notify an institution or program in writing of any adverse action the agency takes against it, and to afford the institution
or program the opportunity to appeal the adverse action. In accordance with section 496(a)(6)(D) of the HEA, in &sect;602.28(b)(5)
the Secretary specifically requires that an agency permit an institution or program the right to representation
by counsel during an appeal of an adverse action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary acknowledges that the cost to an agency when an institution or program appeals an adverse action can
be substantial. To minimize this cost, the Secretary has included in &sect;602.28(b)(5) a provision, suggested
by non-Federal negotiators, that agencies be given the discretion to determine when an appeal may be made only in writing.

Section 602.29&blank;Notification of Accrediting Decisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 496(a)(7) of the HEA requires accrediting agencies to notify the Secretary, the appropriate State postsecondary
review entities, and the public of any final adverse accrediting action regarding an institution or program. Accordingly,
in &sect;602.29(a) of the proposed regulations, the Secretary establishes this notification requirement. The
Secretary proposes an additional requirement in &sect;602.29(a) that is not specified in the law: that accrediting
agencies notify other appropriate accrediting agencies of all final adverse actions. The Secretary believes this
additional notification requirement, which was suggested after the negotiated rulemaking sessions by one of the
non-Federal negotiators, is necessary because of the requirement, implied in section 496(l)(2) of the HEA, that
an accrediting agency must take into account the adverse accrediting actions of other accrediting agencies in making
its own accrediting decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 496(a)(8) of the HEA requires accrediting agencies to make available to the Secretary, the appropriate State
postsecondary review entity and, upon request, the public a brief statement supporting any decision to deny, withdraw,
suspend, or terminate the accreditation or preaccreditation of an institution or program, together with the comments
of the affected institution or program concerning that decision. Accordingly, in &sect;602.29 of the proposed regulations,
the Secretary establishes this requirement. To ensure that the statement is made available in a timely fashion, the
Secretary proposes to require that the statement be made available within 60 days of an agency's final decision.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary is considering adding to this section a requirement that agencies notify the Secretary prior to taking
final adverse action against an institution when the information that caused the agency to take the adverse action
may relate to the institution's continued participation in Title IV, HEA programs, as, for example, in the case of
fraud or gross mismanagement of Federal funds. The Secretary is considering this additional notification requirement
because of the length of time it often takes agencies to reach a final adverse decision, due to an institution's rights
under due process, even when circumstances indicate a gross violation of agency standards. The Secretary invites
comments on this additional requirement and alternative approaches to notifying the Secretary when an agency has
such serious concerns about an institution that it initiates an adverse action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Secretary is considering adding to this section a requirement that an accrediting agency must notify
the Secretary and the appropriate State postsecondary review entity of any final adverse accrediting action at the
same time the agency notifies the institution of this action. The Secretary believes this addition would prevent
excessive draw-down of SFA funds by an institution after it loses accreditation. The Secretary notes that, while
this topic was not discussed during negotiated rulemaking, many negotiators have told Department staff that this
additional requirement would not present an undue hardship to their agencies. The Secretary invites comments on
this proposed additional requirement and suggestions for alternative approaches to prevent unwarranted expenditure
of SFA funds by institutions that have lost accreditation.

Section 602.30&blank;Regard for Decisions of States and Other Accrediting Agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 496(l)(2) of the HEA implies that accrediting agencies are responsible for knowing what actions other recognized
accrediting agencies have taken against an institution. The Secretary addresses this issue in &sect;602.30 by proposing
that all agencies, including those that accredit only programs, take into account the decisions of States and other
accrediting agencies when making any accreditation or preaccreditation decision involving an institution or program.
The Secretary believes the inclusion of programmatic accrediting agencies in this requirement is essential to ensure
that the problems that caused a programmatic accrediting agency to take adverse action against a program within an
institution are promptly reviewed by the institutional accrediting agency that accredits the institution to determine
if the institution is still in compliance with the latter agency's standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;602.30(a)(3) of the proposed regulations, the Secretary requires that agencies routinely share with other
appropriate recognized accrediting agencies and State agencies information about any actions they have taken regarding
an institution's or programs's accreditation or preaccreditation. The Secretary is considering adding to this
section a requirement that agencies share information about actions they are taking or are about to take regarding
an institution's or program's accreditation or preaccreditation. The Secretary invites comments on this additional
requirement and alternative approaches to sharing information with the other members of the triad regarding actions
either under way or planned by the agency with respect to an institution or program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, in &sect;602.30(b) the Secretary proposes that agencies are subject to the requirements in &sect;602.30(a)
if they ``knew, or should have known,'' of the actions being taken by another recognized accrediting agency or State
agency. The Secretary believes that it is reasonable to expect an agency to have known of these actions if there is evidence
that the other agencies have sent information concerning these actions to the agency.

The following discussion addresses other issues either discussed by negotiators or raised by the Secretary after
the negotiations. None of the issues, however, involves a significant change from the current policies and procedures
governing the accrediting agency recognition process, and thus none warrants inclusion in the previous section.

Section 602.2&blank;Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accrediting agency. While the definition in the proposed regulations eliminates the language in the current regulations
describing the type of entity that may comprise an agency, the Secretary wishes to make clear that the legal entity
that is an accrediting agency may be an association, council, commission, or corporation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Designated Department official. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While this term is not used in the current regulations, the Secretary proposes to use it in subpart B on recognition
and termination procedures to describe much of what has, in fact, been the Department's practice with respect to the
accrediting agency recognition process. For example, the Assistant Secretary for Postsecondary Education has,
on occasion, presented the summary of the preliminary analysis of an accrediting agency to the Advisory Committee;
on other occasions, the Assistant Secretary has delegated that responsibility to a member of the Assistant Secretary's
staff. After the Advisory Committee meeting, the Assistant Secretary has routinely forwarded to the Secretary the
Advisory Committee's recommendation on an agency's application for recognition, along with the Assistant Secretary's
recommendation. Finally, the Assistant Secretary has routinely advised the Secretary on issues related to the recognition
of agencies. The Secretary believes that the inclusion of the term ``designated Department official'' and its use
throughout subpart B clarifies the longstanding involvement of individuals other than the Secretary in the accrediting
agency recognition process.

The Secretary wishes to make clear that under an agency's policy on conflicts of interest, a representative of the
public may not participate in any accrediting decisions pertaining to an institution or program with which he or she
may have any direct or indirect affiliation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consensus was reached by negotiators regarding the provisions specified in this section for demonstrating that
an accrediting agency has the necessary administrative and fiscal resources to carry out its accrediting responsibilities.
However, the Secretary is concerned that the provisions contained in this section do not adequately address whether
an agency's personnel and fiscal resources will continue to be adequate during any recognition period granted. The
Secretary invites suggestions on how to address this concern.

These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. An assessment of the potential
costs and benefits of the various requirements contained in the proposed regulations has been incorporated into
the relevant sections of this preamble. The Secretary notes that, as these proposed regulations were subject to negotiated
rulemaking, the costs and benefits of the various requirements were discussed thoroughly by negotiators. The resultant
consensus reached on a particular requirement reflected agreement on the best possible approach to that requirement
in terms of cost and benefit.

The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The small number of entities that would be affected by these proposed regulations are accrediting
agencies that apply for recognition by the Secretary. The regulations would not have a significant economic impact
on the institutions affected because the regulations would not impose excessive regulatory burdens or require unnecessary
Federal supervision. The regulations would impose the minimum requirements needed to ensure the proper implementation
of the Secretary's statutory mandate to recognize accrediting agencies.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 602.4, 602.10, 602.26, and 602.27 contain information collection requirements. In addition, section
602.21(b)(7) contains specific record retention requirements. As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980,
the Department of Education will submit a copy of these sections to the Office of Management and Budget for its review.
(44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed regulations contain substantial information collection requirements for accrediting agencies
applying for recognition by the Secretary, as well as additional requirements for recognized agencies during their
recognition period. The Department needs and uses the information collected to determine whether an agency seeking
recognition by the Secretary meets the requirements for recognition and whether, if the agency is recognized, it
continues to operate in compliance with the requirements for recognition throughout its recognition period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection requirements should direct
them to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, room 3002, New Executive Office Building, Washington,

To assist the Department in complying with the specific requirements of Executive Order 12866, the Secretary invites
comments on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce any potential costs or increase potential benefits
resulting from these proposed regulations without impeding the effective and efficient administration of the accrediting
agency recognition process.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a)(1) This part establishes procedures and criteria for the Secretary's recognition of accrediting agencies.
The purpose of the Secretary's recognition of agencies is to assure that these agencies are, for the purposes of the
Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), or for other Federal purposes, reliable authorities as to the quality
of education or training offered by the institutions of higher education or the higher education programs they accredit.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Secretary's recognition of an accrediting agency is based on the Secretary's determination that the agency
satisfies the requirements of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Secretary grants recognition only to those agencies that_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Accredit institutions of higher education for the purpose of enabling them to establish eligibility to participate
in HEA programs; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Accredit institutions of higher education or higher education programs for the purpose of enabling them to establish
eligibility to participate in other programs administered by the Department or by other Federal agencies.

of the institution or program to continue to meet the agency's standards; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Review, as appropriate on an annual basis, the information obtained under paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section
to determine if there is reason to take any follow-up action based on a reduced financial capacity.

Appendix A to Preamble_Major Issues Discussed at the Regional Meetings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department convened four regional meetings in September 1992 to obtain public involvement in the development
of regulations to implement Title IV, part H, subpart 2 of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended by the Higher
Education Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;325. This subpart describes the procedures and criteria to be
used for the Secretary's recognition of accrediting agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department invited individuals and representatives of groups involved in student financial assistance programs
to the four regional meetings. At each meeting, the Department provided for a comprehensive discussion and exchange
of information regarding the implementation of subpart 2 by providing participants with an issue paper that raised
issues and questions with regard to the statutory provisions included in subpart 2. The following is a summary of the
information provided to the Department by participants at the regional meetings. The section of the proposed regulations
that is the subject of the information is provided as a reference.

Separate and independent requirement_&sect;602.3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants in the regional meetings suggested that, in order for an accrediting agency to obtain a waiver of the
requirement that it be separate from and independent of, both administratively and financially, any related, associated,
affiliated, trade association or membership organization, an agency should have to demonstrate that (a) its parent
body has no role in making or ratifying its accrediting decisions, (b) it has sufficient budget and administrative
autonomy to carry out its required accrediting responsibilities, and (c) information obtained in the course of its
accrediting process is not made available to the parent body unless it is public information.

Unannounced visits by the Secretary_&sect;602.10. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants discussed the conditions under which an unannounced visit to either an accrediting agency or an institution
or program that it accredits, as part of the Secretary's comprehensive review and evaluation of the agency, was appropriate
and suggested that such a visit would be appropriate only if (a) the Secretary had evidence of the agency's non-compliance
with the statute or Departmental regulations and (b) an unannounced site visit would assist in investigating the
non-compliance.

Review by the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity_&sect;602.12. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants discussed the role of the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity in reviewing
the applications of accrediting agencies seeking recognition by the Secretary and suggested that an agency should
have an opportunity to appeal the Advisory Committee's recommendation before the Secretary reaches a final decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Limitation, suspension, or termination of recognition_&sect;602.14. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants discussed the process the Secretary should use in determining whether to limit, suspend, or terminate
an accrediting agency's recognition if the Secretary determines, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that
the agency has failed to satisfy one or more of the requirements for recognition. They suggested that the proposed
regulations should afford the agency due process by providing (a) written notice to the agency, (b) opportunity for
the agency to respond in writing, (c) public review by the Advisory Committee, (d) a written decision by the Advisory
Committee, and (e) an appeal to the Secretary.

Ability and experience_&sect;602.21&hyph;&sect;602.22.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants discussed what standards the Secretary should use to determine whether an accrediting agency demonstrates
sufficient ability and experience in operating as an accrediting agency. Most favored retention of the language
contained in the current regulations on these issues, but a minority expressed concern that these requirements placed
undue burden on new agencies seeking initial recognition.

Participants discussed whether the proposed regulations should contain specific guidance on how and when accrediting
agencies were to conduct unannounced site visits to institutions that offer vocational education and training and
also what institutions were to be visited. They were in agreement that the agency should have discretion to decide
how and when the visits took place; they were divided on the definition of institutions that offer vocational education,
so they were divided on what institutions should be visited.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants discussed the standards that accrediting agencies must have for 13 specific areas. They felt that programmatic
accrediting agencies and those agencies that do not accredit for purposes of Title IV should be exempt from the standards
that address default rates, institutional compliance with its program responsibilities under Title IV, and refund
policies. Their comments on specific standards were as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Program length and tuition and fees_&sect;602.26(b)(7). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants felt that accrediting agencies should assess these in relation to the subject matter taught and the
objectives of the degrees or credentials offered. They also felt that the proposed regulations should protect agencies
against lawsuits alleging violation of anti-trust laws.

Measures of program length in clock hours or credit hours_&sect;602.26(b)(8). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants felt that accrediting agencies should be expected to evaluate program length at non-degree granting
institutions for consistency with the time required to develop the knowledge base and skills necessary for entry
level to the vocation for which the students are being prepared. In the case of degree-granting institutions, participants
felt that agencies should evaluate program length for consistency with usual practice in higher education.

Success with respect to student achievement_&sect;602.26(b)(9). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants felt that accrediting agencies should be required to consider completion rates, job placement rates,
and State licensing examination pass rates for institutions or programs that purport to train individuals for occupations,
vocations, or professions. Most participants felt that agencies should be given the flexibility to establish standards
for these areas, but a minority felt that the proposed regulations should contain specific requirements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most participants felt that accrediting agencies should review schools for compliance with agency standards if
their default rate exceeded a certain rate, but some felt that agencies should have to remove accreditation if the
default rate exceeded a certain value.

fairness in dealing with institutions or programs. They also felt that any opportunity for a hearing that an agency
might provide did not necessarily imply a personal appearance by representatives of the institution or program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary proposes regulations to implement the State Postsecondary Review Program (SPRP) authorized under
title IV, part H, subpart 1 of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA). Under the SPRP, the Secretary enters
into an agreement with a State in which the State designates a postsecondary review entity (SPRE) that is responsible
for conducting or coordinating reviews of institutions of higher education referred to the State by the Secretary
under specific statutory provisions. The purpose of the reviews is to determine whether those institutions should
continue to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs. The SPRE reviews institutions on the basis of standards developed
in consultation with institutions located in the State. The Secretary reimburses SPREs for costs they incur under
the SPRP.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In order to approve a postsecondary education institution to participate in the student financial assistance programs
authorized under Title IV of the HEA (Title IV, HEA programs) and many other Federal programs, the Secretary must determine,
in part, that the institution satisfies the statutory definition of an ``institution of higher education.'' Under
the HEA and other Federal statutes, one element of that definition requires an eligible institution of higher education
to be accredited or preaccredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Secretary as a reliable authority as
to the quality of the education or training provided by the institution. Another element requires an eligible institution
to be legally authorized to provide an educational program beyond the secondary level in the State in which it is located.
Thus, the statutory definition of an institution of higher education provides the framework for a shared responsibility
among accrediting agencies, States, and the Federal government to ensure that the ``gate'' to the Title IV, HEA programs
is opened to only those institutions that provide students with quality education or training worth the time, energy,
and money they invest in it. The three ``gatekeepers'' sharing this responsibility have traditionally been referred
to as ``the triad.'' While the concept of a triad of entities responsible for gatekeeping has had a long history, the
triad has not always worked as effectively as it should to ensure educational quality, nor has it served as an effective
deterrent to abuse by institutions participating in the Title IV, HEA programs. For several years, certain institutions
participating in the Title IV, HEA programs have failed to provide students with education or training of an acceptable
level of quality; they have also failed to treat students fairly. In addition, they have failed to meet acceptable
standards of financial responsibility and administrative capability and to adequately protect Title IV, HEA program
funds entrusted to them. The institutions that have engaged in these abusive practices are not restricted to a particular
sector of higher education. Rather, the abuses have been found in all types of institutions participating in the Title
IV, HEA programs, including those in the private non-profit and public sectors of higher education as well as those
in the proprietary sector.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the same time, gatekeeping functions have not been carried out effectively. For example, some accrediting agencies
have not taken sufficient care to ensure the quality of the education or training provided by the institutions or programs
they accredit or to protect student interests when they accredit particular institutions or programs. Moreover,
some States have also not taken sufficient care to ensure the quality of the education or training provided by the institutions
they authorize or license to operate in the State or to protect student interests. Finally, the Federal government's
management of its responsibilities to determine eligibility and to certify institutions to participate in the Title
IV, HEA programs has not always been adequate to prevent abusive practices at institutions that participate in those
programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, in the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;325, Congress amended the HEA to provide
for a new part H of Title IV entitled ``Program Integrity Triad.'' Under that part, States and accrediting agencies
are required to assume major new oversight responsibilities, and States, accrediting associations, and the Secretary
are linked to create a stronger and more coordinated evaluation of institutions that participate or wish to participate
in the Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary believes that the most appropriate approach to this coordinated evaluation
of institutions by the three components of the triad is a complementary one with each component focusing its evaluation
on its obligations within the context of the HEA. Thus, the focus for accrediting agencies is the quality of education
or training provided by the institutions or programs they accredit. For States, which already had responsibility
for determining that institutions have the legal authority to operate within the State, the HEA added a new focus:
reviewing institutions that trigger certain statutory review criteria. The focus of the Secretary's evaluation
of institutions is the administrative and financial capacity of those institutions to participate in the Title IV,
HEA programs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statute allocates legal responsibility among the entities that compose the program integrity triad. While specific
statutory responsibilities for the three triad entities may overlap, when viewed as a whole the triad brings together
in a coordinated fashion three different but very important aspects of institutional review. Within this statutory
scheme, the Secretary has sought to assure that the gatekeeping system operates as efficiently as possible, with
maximum integration among the three triad entities and without unnecessary burden on postsecondary institutions.
In order to assist the Secretary in designing a final regulation that achieve these goals, the Secretary specifically
requests comment on the following questions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In several areas, the statute specifically requires each triad entity to evaluate an institution under the same
or similar standards. For example, a SPRE and an accrediting agency may establish different standards for evaluating
the financial responsibility of an institution or for evaluating the success of an institution's educational program.
Thus, a reviewed institution would need to satisfy the SPRE's and the accrediting agency's standards even though
those standards address the same areas. How should final regulations be structured to both reduce the burden on institutions
and enable the triad entities to carry out effectively their statutory functions? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Should the final regulations be more explicit in identifying levels, characteristics, or definitions for any
of the assessment or review criteria that a triad entity is expected to consider in its evaluation of an institution?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart 1 of part H creates a new program, the State Postsecondary Review Program, or SPRP, under which State oversight
of institutions participating in the Title IV, HEA programs is strengthened. Subpart 2 of part H establishes procedures
and criteria under which the Secretary recognizes an accrediting agency as a reliable authority as to the quality
of the education or training offered by institutions that the agency accredits. Lastly, Subpart 3 specifies the procedures
the Secretary uses to determine whether an institution meets the eligibility requirements and has the administrative
capacity and financial responsibility to administer the Title IV, HEA programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Along with this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the Secretary publishes in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the NPRM to implement the accrediting agency provisions in Subpart 2 of part H of the HEA. This provides interested
parties the opportunity to comment on the SPRP and accreditation NPRMs in a coordinated way. The Secretary also intends
to publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a NPRM implementing subpart 3 of part H of the HEA before the date the proposed regulations for Subparts 1 and 2 of part
H of the HEA become final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the SPRP, each State designates a single SPRE that reviews institutions participating in the Title IV, HEA programs
that are referred to the State for review by the Secretary under specific statutory provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SPRE reviews referred institutions using standards that it must develop in consultation with institutions located
in the State. Areas that those standards must cover are also set forth in specific statutory provisions. Before a SPRE
may review an institution under those standards, the standards must be evaluated by the Secretary and not disapproved
by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a SPRE finds that an institution it reviews does not satisfy the State's review standards, the SPRE may require the
institution to take prompt actions to bring itself into compliance with the State's standards, or the SPRE may determine
that the institution should no longer participate in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary recognizes that, in the former case, an institution may have cause for not meeting
the State's review standards. Therefore, the Secretary proposes that SPREs provide the institution the opportunity
to present compelling evidence that demonstrates that its failure to meet the State's review standards does not warrant
any further action by the SPRE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where the SPRE determines that an institution should no longer participate in the Title IV, HEA programs, the SPRE
notifies the Secretary of that determination; and, as required under section 494C(h) of the HEA, the Secretary immediately
terminates the institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In implementing their role under the State Postsecondary Review Program, the Secretary expects States to develop
rigorous educational, administrative, and financial review standards and to conduct thorough, impartial reviews
of referred institutions under those standards. Therefore, the Secretary anticipates that SPRE reviews will lead
to increases in the quality of education and training provided by institutions that comply with or ascribe to the State's
review standards. The Secretary also anticipates that, through reviews of referred institutions, SPREs will help
to reduce fraud, waste, and abuse in the Title IV, HEA programs by taking actions to effect the termination of institutions
that (1) fail substantially to meet the State's review standards, and are recalcitrant in taking actions to come into
compliance with those standards, or (2) are involved in fraudulent practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed regulations were subject to the negotiated rulemaking process in accordance with section 492 of the
HEA. Under the negotiated rulemaking process, the Secretary convened four regional meetings in September 1992 to
obtain public involvement in the development of these proposed regulations. The meetings were held in San Francisco,
Atlanta, New York, and Kansas City. Before convening the meetings, the Secretary held a meeting in Washington, DC
in August 1992 to invite comments from interested parties as to the key issues that should be addressed at the regional
meetings. At the four regional meetings, the Secretary provided attendees with a list of issues that needed to be addressed
in these proposed regulations. A summary of the responses of the attendees is contained in Appendix A to these proposed
regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Individuals and groups who attended the regional meetings nominated individuals to participate in the negotiated
rulemaking process. The Secretary selected negotiators from the list of nominees to reflect all the groups that are
involved in the Title IV, HEA programs. With regard to these proposed regulations, the Secretary chose negotiators
who reflected the diversity of State higher education authorities, the interests of accrediting bodies, national
organizations of student financial aid administrators, institutions of higher education, and students. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 492(b) of the HEA, the Secretary prepared draft proposed regulations and negotiated provisions
of the draft with the negotiators. Two negotiating sessions were held: one in April 1993 and one in June 1993. During
the second session, the negotiators elected not to reach consensus on any of the provisions included in this notice
of proposed rulemaking until they had an opportunity to review all the proposed regulations implementing the Program
Integrity Triad. On September 20, 1993, the Secretary convened a meeting and distributed to the negotiators the proposed
regulations for each part of the Program Integrity Triad. The negotiators who attended this meeting could not reach
consensus on the provisions included in this proposed regulation. However, several negotiators submitted written
comments on the draft regulations, and many of those comments were incorporated in this notice of proposed rulemaking.

The following discussion reflects the proposed provisions governing the State Postsecondary Review Program. The
provisions are discussed in the order in which they appear in the proposed regulations. If a provision applies to more
than one section or is included in more than one section, it is discussed the first time it appears with an appropriate
cross-reference to its other appearances. In addition, each section of the proposed provisions references or contains
a description of the applicable statutory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing these provisions, the Secretary has regulated narrowly to the statute, except where the Secretary
was required by the statute to promulgate specific regulations or where the Secretary determined that regulations
were required to implement the statute. In this regard, the Secretary requests respondents to comment only on provisions
where the Secretary has made a regulatory proposal that interprets or implements the statute, rather than on provisions
that are statutorily required and cannot be changed by the Secretary.

Section 667.1&blank;Scope and Purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the State Postsecondary Review Program is to strengthen State oversight of institutions participating
in the title IV, HEA programs through the development of State standards for those institutions, and State review
of referred institutions using those standards. States will be reimbursed by the Secretary for developing these
standards and conducting these reviews. However, a State will not be required to incur any cost or carry out any activity
if the State will not be reimbursed for that cost or activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several negotiators were concerned that SPREs had the authority under the SPRP to select any institution for review.
Reviews by a SPRE are limited to those institutions that currently participate in the title IV, HEA programs that the
Secretary or a State identify as meeting one or more of the review criteria in section 494C(b) of the HEA, and those institutions
a State has reason to believe are engaged in fraudulent practices. As provided in section 494C(a) of the HEA, a State
must request approval from the Secretary before it may conduct a review of an institution the State determines either
meets a statutory referral criterion or is engaged in fraudulent practices. If the Secretary approves the State's
request or does not disapprove that request within 21 days, the SPRE may conduct a review of that institution under
this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the standards that a State develops will be used for the purpose of reviewing referred institutions under
this program, nothing in this part or in the statute authorizing the SPRP, title IV, part H, subpart 1 of the HEA, precludes
a State from using these developed standards for determining whether to grant a license to or otherwise authorize
an institution to provide postsecondary education in the State. However, if a State reviews nonreferred institutions
under the standards developed for the SPRP, reviews of those institutions will not be reimbursed. Moreover, the State
may not take an action against nonreferred institutions under the SPRP.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Professional program
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The definition of a professional program applies directly to the review standards described in sections 494C(d)(8)(A)
and (14)(C) of the HEA and &sect;&sect;667.21(11)(1) and (18)(iii), respectively. The Secretary proposed to define
a ``professional program'' as an undergraduate or graduate educational program that prepares individuals for an
occupation, if that occupation_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Is listed in a Federal educational program classification manual; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Requires at least an associate degree to qualify for entry; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Involves the independent practice or application of a defined or organized body of competencies that is unique
to the occupation; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Is formally recognized and regulated under a national or State licensure, accreditation, or permit system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several negotiators argued that many educational programs that would satisfy this proposed definition of a ``professional
program'' would also satisfy the proposed definition of a ``vocational program''. Those negotiators believed that,
for purposes of developing standards under the SPRP, there should be a clear distinction between the classification
of these programs. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Vocational program
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The definition of ``vocational program'' applies directly to two review standards a State must develop under section
494C(d) of the HEA and &sect;667.21 of these regulations. Under the first standard, described in section 494C(d)(7)
of the HEA and repeated in &sect;667.21(a)(10), if an institution offers a program that is designed to prepare students
for gainful employment, the State must develop a standard to determine whether the tuition and fees charged for that
program by the institution are reasonable given the amount of money that a student who successfully completes that
program may reasonably be expected to earn. Under the second review standard, described in section 494C(d)(14)(C)
of the HEA and repeated in &sect;667.21(a)(18)(iii), if an institution offers vocational or professional programs,
the State must develop standards to determine if those programs are successful as measured, in part, by the placement
rate of the graduates of those programs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During negotiated rulemaking, the Secretary proposed to define the term ``vocational program'' based on the statutory
provision included in the definition of various types of eligible institutions of higher education. Thus, the Secretary
proposed to define a vocational program as an ``undergraduate educational program that prepares students for gainful
employment in a recognized occupation.'' (See, for example, section 481(b)(1) of the HEA for a ``proprietary institution
of higher education''; section 481(c)(1) for a ``postsecondary vocational institution''; and the second sentence
of section 1201(a) of the HEA for a ``public and private nonprofit institution of higher education.'') 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several negotiators believed this proposed definition was too vague and were concerned that it could be interpreted
to include all postsecondary undergraduate programs. Those negotiators contended that such a broad interpretation,
if applied to the review standards discussed above, would cause unnecessary burden on all institutions, and argued
for a more narrow definition of a vocational program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some negotiators proposed that the term ``vocational program'' encompass only those educational programs below
the baccalaureate degree level that are not classified as ``professional programs''. Other negotiators suggested
that the term ``vocational program'' be limited further to apply only to nondegree vocational educational programs
offered by institutions whose primary purpose is to prepare students for employment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary agrees that the proposed definition is too broad and thus, in &sect;667.2, proposes to define the term
``vocational program'' as ``an educational program below the baccalaureate degree level, that is not classified
as a professional program, that prepares students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary acknowledges that the definition of ``vocational program'' in these proposed regulations differs
from the definition of ``vocational education'' as that term is defined in the proposed regulations for the Secretary's
Procedures and Criteria for the Recognition or Accrediting Agencies (``education or training that prepares students
for gainful employment in a recognized occupation''). The Secretary requests specific comment on whether the same
definition should be used in both regulations and, if so, which definition should be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary particularly invites public comments on the definitions of professional and vocational programs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(B) ensuring that each institution of higher education in the State remains in compliance with the standards developed
pursuant to section 494C of the HEA (these provisions are discussed below in greater detail); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Assurances that the SPRE has the authority under State law to make agreements between the State and the Federal
Government; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Assurances that the SPRE will review institutions reported to the State by the Secretary under section 494C(a)
of the HEA (referred institutions) for the purpose of determining whether those institutions should participate
in the Title IV, HEA programs on a schedule to coincide with the dates set by the Secretary to certify or recertify those
institutions as provided in sections 481 and 498 of the HEA; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Assurances that the SPRE will perform the functions authorized under this part and keep such records and provide
such information as may be requested for financial and compliance audits and program evaluation, consistent with
the responsibilities of the Secretary; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) A description of the relationship between the SPRE and the State approving agency for Veterans Affairs, the State
guaranty agency under the FFEL programs, and the State agency responsible for administering the SSIG program; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Provisions for SPRE contracts. The agreement must provide for the contracts the SPRE enters into with nationally
recognized accrediting agencies or peer review systems as required under section 494C(d)(15) of the HEA, and the
contracts the SPRE enters into with private agencies, accrediting agencies, or peer review systems for assistance
in performing SPRE review activities as provided in section 494C(f) of the HEA; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) A plan for performing the functions described in section 494C of the HEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to element (1) paragraph (A), the SPRE must represent any State entity that provides a license to postsecondary
institutions to operate in the State or otherwise legally authorizes institutions to provide postsecondary education
in the State. The Secretary wishes to make clear that the statute does not provide the SPRE the authority under the SPRP
to provide licenses to or legally authorize institutions to operate in a State; the SPRE merely represents State entities
that perform those functions. Similarly, under element (1), paragraph (B), the SPRE must represent any State entity
that is responsible for ensuring that all institutions in the State remain in compliance with the State's review standards.
Again, the Secretary wishes to make clear that the statute does not provide the SPRE the authority under the SPRP to
ensure that all institutions in the State remain in compliance with the State's review standards; rather the SPRE
must merely represent any State entity that has that responsibility. Moreover, a State is not required, for the purposes
of this part, to create an entity responsible for ensuring that all institutions in the State remain in compliance
with the State's review standards if such an entity does not currently exist. These statutory provisions are repeated
in &sect;667.4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the entities listed in the statute under element (5), in &sect;667.3(b)(4), the Secretary proposes
to require the SPRE to describe its relationship with any State licensing body, any State-level entity that approves
service providers under the Job Training Partnership Act, and any State-level entity that certifies vocational
education. The Secretary proposes this requirement to ensure that all entities in the State involved with postsecondary
institutions or postsecondary educational programs coordinate with the SPRE actions taken regarding those institutions
or programs. The agreements the Secretary signed with States to implement the SPRP in fiscal year 1993 did not provide
for a description of the SPRE's relationship with these additional entities. Thus, if any changes are required to
be made to the agreement as a result of this proposal or other proposals in these regulations or as a result of public
comment, States will be provided sufficient opportunity to execute new agreements. Any new terms will have a prospective
effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Except for the proposed requirement under element (5), that the agreement describe additional relationships between
the SPRE and other State authorities, the requirements contained in section 494A(b) of the HEA described above are
repeated in &sect;667.3(a) and (b) and therefore cannot be changed by the Secretary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 494(c) of the HEA requires the Secretary to impose the following sanctions on a State if the State does not enter
into an agreement with the Secretary or fails to comply with the terms of the agreement_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Secretary may not designate as eligible for participation in a Title IV, HEA program any institution seeking
initial participation in that program, any branch campus for which an institution seeks an initial designation of
eligibility, or any institution that has undergone a change in ownership that results in a change in control, pursuant
to section 481 of the HEA and subpart 3 of part H of the HEA; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Secretary may grant only provisional certification to any institution in that State pursuant to subpart 3
of part H of the HEA; and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The State is ineligible to receive any funds appropriated to carry out the SPRP, its allotment under the SSIG Program,
and any funds appropriated to carry out the National Early Intervention Scholarship and Partnership Program (NEISP).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statutory sanctions described above are repeated in &sect;667.3(e). The Secretary, also, proposes to impose
the statutory sanctions on a State if the State ends its participation in the SPRP or fails to establish review standards
within two years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, in &sect;667.3(d)(3), the Secretary proposes to impose the sanctions on a State that ends its participation
in the SPRP by terminating its agreement with the Secretary. The only exception for not participating in the SPRP is
provided in section 494A(c) of the HEA. That section specifies that ``no State shall be required to enter into an agreement
with the Secretary under this subpart for performing review functions required by the agreement unless the Congress
appropriates funds for this subpart''. (The Congress made $5.3 million of fiscal year 1993 funds available to initiate
the SPRP and has appropriated $21.25 million for fiscal year 1994.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secondly, in &sect;667.3(d)(4), the Secretary proposes to impose the sanctions on a State that does not establish
review standards under &sect;667.21 that are not disapproved by the Secretary within two years from the time the State
received Federal funds under this part. The Secretary believes that two years is a reasonable time for a State to establish
review standards. Moreover, because a State must establish review standards before reviews of institutions can
take place, the Secretary believes strongly that a State should not unreasonably delay the conduct of reviews and
continue to receive Federal funds under this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, section 494(b) of the HEA provides that if a State declines to enter into an agreement with the Secretary to
carry out the purposes of this part, the provisions of this part that refer to the State refer instead to the Secretary
who may make appropriate arrangements with agencies or organizations of demonstrated competence in reviewing institutions
to carry out the provisions of this part. The Secretary proposes to implement this section of the statute in &sect;667.3(e)(2)(iii)(A)
and (B). Thus, in paragraph (A) the Secretary may establish review standards for any State that declines to enter into
an agreement with the Secretary, and in paragraph (B) the Secretary may carry out, or arrange to carry out, the State's
other responsibilities under this part.

494C(b) of the HEA. If an institution meets one or more of the review criteria, the Secretary must refer the institution

The Secretary anticipates making referrals at least annually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 494C(a) as amended by the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;208) further provides
that the Secretary may determine not to refer to a SPRE for review an institution that meets only criterion (10) described
above, if the SPRE previously reviewed that institution under this part and found no violations of the State's review
standards. This provision is repeated in &sect;667.5(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under a literal reading of review criteria (6) and (9), the Secretary would have to refer an institution to a SPRE in
perpetuity for an event that happened once. However, the Secretary believes that it is wasteful to require a SPRE to
continually review an institution for the same reason if the SPRE had previously reviewed that institution and found
no violations of its standards. Therefore, in &sect;667.5(c), the Secretary proposes to reserve whether to refer
an institution to a SPRE for review under these two criteria if on the basis of an earlier referral, the SPRE conducted
a review of the institution and found no significant violations of its standards as a result of that review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 494C(c) of the HEA provides that an institution may request confirmation of the data used by the Secretary
to determine that the institution met one or more of the statutory review criteria. In &sect;667.5(e), the Secretary
proposes to rescind a referral if the Secretary confirms that the data used to make the referral were inaccurate and
that a referral would not be made under accurate data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When confirming the accuracy of data, the Secretary will presume that records maintained in the ordinary course of
business by the U.S. Department of Education, a guaranty agency under the FFEL programs, the SPRE, the State licensing
agency, or another State agency are accurate unless the institution proves to the Secretary's satisfaction that
the records are not properly maintained or are inaccurate.

In addition to those institutions referred to a State by the Secretary for review as a result of meeting one or more of
the criteria set forth in section 494C(b), section 494C(a) of the HEA provides that a State may, subject to approval
by the Secretary, review additional institutions that_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Meet one or more of the statutory review criteria based on more recent data available to the State; or

(2) The State has reason to believe are engaged in fraudulent practices.

Section 494C(h)(2) of the HEA requires the Secretary to prescribe in regulations a time period within which the Secretary

of an action against an institution.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 667.8 deals with the situation when a referred institution has locations in more than one State. In proposing
procedures for dealing with that situation, the Secretary had to decide which State standards would apply, which
State would conduct the review, and, if more than one State had to conduct a review, how those reviews should be coordinated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;667.8, the Secretary proposes the following. If an institution is referred for review, the Secretary will
refer the institution to the SPRE in each State in which the institution is located. With the referral, the Secretary
informs each SPRE of the other States in which the institution is located. The main campus of the institution or any
branch campus or additional location of that institution is subject to the review standards of the State in which it
is located. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed procedures place the principal responsibility for reviewing the institution on the SPRE of the State
in which the main campus of the institution is located. The SPRE of a State in which a branch campus or additional location
of the institution is located may choose among three options to determine when to review that branch campus or additional
location or to determine if review of that branch or additional location is warranted. Under the first option, the
SPRE may review that branch campus or additional location before a review is conducted of the main campus of that institution.
The second option provides that the SPRE may delay its review of that branch campus or additional location until a review
is conducted of the main campus of that institution. Under the last option, if the State's allotment will not allow
the SPRE to review all referred institutions, the SPRE may choose not to review that branch campus or additional location
if the SPRE of the State in which the main campus of that institution is located reviews that institution and makes no
significant findings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Secretary proposes that SPREs may agree among themselves to alter these review requirements. Thus,
if the institution was located in a metropolitan area such as Washington, DC and had its main campus in Washington,
DC and branch campuses in Virginia and Maryland, the Washington, DC, Virginia, and Maryland SPREs could agree among
themselves that the Virginia SPRE would review all the institution's locations. However, the applicable review
standards would not change. Therefore, to the extent that the three jurisdictions had different standards, the Washington,
DC locations would be subject to the Washington, DC standards, the Maryland locations would be subject to the Maryland
standards and the Virginia locations would be subject to the Virginia standards.

Section 667.11&blank;Allotment Formula
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 494(a)(2) of the HEA authorizes the Secretary to provide Federal funds to a SPRE for performing the functions
contained in the State's agreement with the Secretary. Accordingly, in &sect;667.11, the Secretary proposes a funding
formula under which the Secretary allots annually to each SPRE its share of the Federal funds appropriated for the
SPRP. The following discusses the proposed funding formula. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For each fiscal year that Federal funds are appropriated for the SPRP, the Secretary proposes to allot $20,000 to Guam,
$20,000 to the Northern Mariana Islands, $20,000 to the Virgin Islands, $20,000 to the Trust Territory of the Pacific
Islands (Palau), and $20,000 to American Samoa. The Secretary believes this amount is sufficient for these States
to carry out SPRE activities because only three institutions are located in Guam, and only one institution is located
in each of the other jurisdictions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to allot the remaining fiscal year appropriation so that each remaining State receives the
greater of $50,000, or the amount determined under a formula that uses the following two variables_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The number of institutions located in a State that are certified to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs; and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The amount of Title IV, HEA program funds made available to students enrolled in those institutions during the
latest year for which complete data is available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of the formula, the Title IV, HEA programs only include the Federal Pell Grant, Federal Family Education
Loan (FFEL), Federal Direct Loan, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), Federal Work-Study
(FWS), and Federal Perkins Loan programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes the formula described in greater detail in &sect;667.11(a) because the Secretary believes
that each State needs at least $50,000 to carry out SPRE activities. In addition, at least in the initial years of the
program, the Secretary believes it equitable to allot Federal funds to States based on the relative exposure of Title
IV, HEA program funds in each State as represented by the two variables in the proposed funding formula. However, after
several years, when there is a history of referrals to States and SPRE reviews of institutions as a result of those referrals,
the Secretary plans to reexamine the funding formula to determine whether to base the formula on the percentage of
referrals each State receives, the number of reviews each State performs, or a combination of those two variables.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;667.11(b), the Secretary proposes to reallot Federal funds not expended by a State to other States in a manner
that best carries out the purposes of the program. The Secretary proposes to reallot those funds the Secretary determines
a State will not spend during the period for which those funds are available, and those funds a State does not spend by
the end of the period for which those funds are made available.

Section 667.12&blank;Application for Funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;667.12, the Secretary proposes procedures under which a State applies to receive its allotment for each
fiscal year in which Congress appropriates funds for the State Postsecondary Review Program. Under these procedures,
a State's application for funds consists of a plan to carry out specific activities and a budget that accounts for those
activities. The Secretary views these application procedures as satisfying the requirement in section 494A(b)(5)
of the HEA that a State include in its agreement with the Secretary its plan to carry out SPRE activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes a two-phased State application process. In the first phase, a State applies for funds to develop
review standards and to carry out other activities that are necessary before the SPRE conducts reviews of referred
institutions. In the second phase, a State applies for funds to conduct reviews of referred institutions and to perform
other allowable activities. A State may apply for funds in the second phase only after it has established review standards.
The Secretary considers a State to have established review standards if those standards were developed in accordance
with the requirements contained in &sect;667.21 and those standards were not disapproved by the Secretary under
&sect;667.22. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Application before standards are established. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For this phase of the application process, in &sect;667.12(b), the Secretary proposes that the State submit a plan
to_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Develop the State review standards described in section 494C(d) of the HEA and discussed further in &sect;&sect;667.21
and 667.22 of this preamble; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Develop procedures for receiving and responding to complaints from students, faculty, and others regarding
an institution, as required by section 494C(j) of the HEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both the standards and the complaint procedures must be developed in consultation with institutions in the State,
as required under sections 494C(d) and 494C(j) of the HEA, respectively. In addition, the State may submit a plan to
identify information systems maintained by institutions and State agencies that are relevant to developing State
review standards. Finally, the plan may contain estimates of the costs of coordinating those information systems
with an information system for the SPRE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes these allowable activities because the SPRE cannot carry out a review of an institution to
determine whether the institution is in compliance with State standards until the State has developed those standards
in required consultation with institutions in that State. Similarly, a State cannot process complaints until it
has developed procedures, in required consultation with institutions in the State, to respond to complaints. Finally,
a State cannot determine whether it will be cost-effective to coordinate existing data systems without first determining
the costs of coordinating those systems.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several negotiators suggested that the Secretary specify the manner in which States were to consult with institutions
in their State while developing State standards and complaint procedures. The Secretary believes that each State
is in a better position than the Secretary to determine the most appropriate consultation method for that State. Moreover,
the Secretary believes that States should be able to select from a variety of consultation formats when developing
its standards and complaint procedures with the institutions in its State. Therefore, the Secretary has not specified
the type of required consultation under this section. However, the Secretary expects a State's consultation process
to be thorough and inclusive of the range and types of institutions in the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With its plan, the State must submit a budget for carrying out the allowable activities. In &sect;667.12(b)(2), the
Secretary proposes that a State carry out the allowable activities in a priority order if the State anticipates that
the cost of carrying out all those activities will exceed its allotment. Specifically, the Secretary proposes that
a State first use its allotment to develop review standards. If a portion of the allotment remains after the State has
developed its review standards, the State may develop procedures for receiving and responding to complaints from
students, faculty, and others regarding institutions in the State. Finally, the State may use any remaining portion
of its allotment to provide costs estimates for the SPRE's information system after it has completed its review standards
and complaint procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Congress made $5.3 million of fiscal year 1993 funds available to initiate the State Postsecondary Review Program.
Under a notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
July 14, 1993, 58 FR 38022&hyph;38025, the Secretary has allotted those funds to States for the purposes set forth
in &sect;667.12(b). Therefore, except for the following provision, the Secretary acknowledges that most States
will have complied with the provisions contained in &sect;667.12(b) when these provisions are published as final
regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a State does not establish review standards with its fiscal year 1993 allotment, the Secretary proposes that the
funds it may receive in any future fiscal year for those activities may not exceed the amount it received or was scheduled
to receive in fiscal year 1993. The Secretary proposes this provision because the Secretary believes that the primary
purpose of the State Postsecondary Review Program is SPRE reviews of institutions and that the funds allotted to States
in fiscal year 1993 were adequate to develop review standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Application after standards are established. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the second phase of the application process, the Secretary proposes in &sect;667.12(c) that a State submit_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A plan to review referred institutions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A plan to carry out the activities described in &sect;667.14; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A budget for those reviews and activities that does not exceed the State's allotment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary acknowledges that a State's allotment of funds may be inadequate to review all the institutions that
must be reviewed under &sect;&sect;667.5 and 667.6. Therefore, in &sect;667.12(c)(2), the Secretary proposes
that a SPRE submit, as part of its plan, a priority system for selecting institutions for review from among the referred
institutions if the SPRE anticipates that the cost of reviewing all the referred institutions will exceed the State's
allotment. The Secretary proposes to provide maximum flexibility to States in selecting institutions to review,
except as limited by section 494A(b)(2) of the HEA. That section requires States to review referred institutions
on a schedule that coincides with the dates set by the Secretary to recertify those institutions to participate in
the Title IV, HEA programs. However, the Secretary expects States to establish review priorities that reflect the
objectives of protecting students, saving tax dollars, and promoting educational quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary requests public comment on the potential benefits of developing specific criteria for States to consider
in determining their review priorities and the nature of those criteria.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;667.13(a), the Secretary proposes to approve a State's plan and budget for the first phase of the SPRP, the
development of standards and complaint procedures in consultation with institutions in the State, if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The State's plan provides a reasonable basis, and adequate budget justification, for conducting those activities;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The State's plan provides for conducting those activities in the priority order proposed in &sect;667.12(b)(2);
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The State's budget includes only reasonable allowable costs within the State's fiscal year 1993 allotment. The
Secretary proposes allowable costs in &sect;667.14. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;667.13(b), the Secretary proposes to approve a State's plan and budget for the second phase of the SPRP, primarily
the review of referred institutions, if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The State's plan provides adequate budget justification for carrying out the activities proposed and described
in &sect;667.14 within its allotment, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The State's plan provides a reasonable scheme for reviewing referred institutions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The State's plan includes a priority system for reviewing referred institutions; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Any contract the State proposes to enter into with another agency to carry out SPRE functions, as provided in section
494C(f) of the HEA, is reasonable and appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a State that does not submit an application for funds under &sect;667.12 or does not submit an approvable application,
the Secretary proposes in &sect;667.13(c) to impose on that State the sanctions described in section 494(c) of the
HEA.

Section 667.14&blank;Allowable Costs and Activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by sections 494A(c) and 494B of the HEA, a State is not required to expend any funds under the SPRP to carry
out allowable activities unless the Secretary reimburses the State for the costs it incurs in carrying out those activities.
To the extent appropriations are available the Secretary proposes to reimburse a State for the direct and indirect
costs of carrying out allowable SPRE activities if those activities are included in a plan that is approved by the Secretary.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The terms ``direct costs'' and ``indirect costs'' are defined in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular
A&hyph;87. In addition, the Secretary proposes to rely on the cost principles described in OMB Circular A&hyph;87
for determining allowable costs under the State Postsecondary Review Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to consider as allowable activities those activities that are directly related to_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Establishing State review standards in consultation with institutions in the State; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Publicizing and providing initial and continuing training to State and other personnel in the State, including
personnel at the institution subject to review; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Establishing and implementing procedures for receiving and responding to complaints from students, faculty,
and others regarding institutions in the State; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Reviewing referred institutions; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Developing and maintaining an information system for SPRE review activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;667.14(d), the Secretary identifies a nonexhaustive list of direct costs associated with carrying out
the proposed allowable activities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;667.15, the Secretary proposes requirements regarding a State's use and accounting of the Federal funds
it receives under this part. To minimize burden on States, the Secretary proposes that a State account for funds it
receives under this part in accordance with the procedures it uses to account for its own funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Secretary proposes that a State keep fiscal and accounting records that support, on audit, its expenditure
of funds under this part and maintain those records for five years. Finally, the Secretary proposes that a State must
have an audit performed of the SPRE's activities under this part at least once every two years. An audit conducted under
the Single Agency Audit Act satisfies this audit requirement.

Section 494(B) of the HEA provides that the Secretary may reimburse a State for the costs of necessary SPRE activities
``which supplement, but do not supplant, existing licensing or review functions conducted by the State.'' This statutory
provision is repeated in &sect;667.16. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary requests comments on what standards and measures would most accurately determine whether a State has

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 494C(d) of the HEA requires a State to develop review standards, in consultation with the institutions in
the State, that are consistent with the laws and constitution of the State. A State's authority to develop review standards
is further clarified in section 494C(g) of the HEA. That section prohibits the Secretary from requiring a State to
establish review standards that are unrelated to ensuring institutional or program integrity or that violate the
provisions of the State's constitution or laws. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SPRE reviews referred institutions under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State-developed standards set forth in section 494C(d) of the HEA. In conducting its review, the SPRE must determine
whether a referred institution has complied with standards that address the following areas_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The availability to students and prospective students of catalogs, admissions requirements, course outlines,
schedules of tuition and fees, policies regarding course cancellations, and the rules and regulations of the institution
relating to students and the accuracy of such catalogs and course outlines in reflecting the courses and programs
offered by the institution; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Assurance that the institution has a method to assess a student's ability to successfully complete the course
of study for which he or she has applied; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Assurance that the institution maintains and enforces standards relating to academic progress and maintains
adequate student and other records; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Compliance by the institution with relevant safety and health standards, such as fire, building, and sanitation
codes; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The financial and administrative capacity of the institution as appropriate to a specified scale of operations
and the maintenance of adequate financial and other information necessary to determine the financial and administrative
capacity of the institution; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) For institutions financially at risk, the adequacy of provisions to provide for the instruction of students and
to provide for the retention and accessibility of academic and financial aid records of students in the event the institution
closes; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) If the stated objectives of the courses or programs of the institution are to prepare students for employment,
the relationship of the tuition and fees to the remuneration that can be reasonably expected by students who complete
the course or program and the relationship of the courses or programs (including the appropriateness of the length
of such courses) to providing the student with quality training and useful employment in recognized occupations
in the State; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(14) The success of the program at the institution, including_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The rates of the institution's students' program completion and graduation, taking into account the length of
the program at the institution and the selectivity of the institution's admissions policies; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The withdrawal rates of the institution's students; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) with respect to vocational and professional programs, the rates of placement of the institution's graduates
in occupations related to their course of study; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) where appropriate, the rate at which the institution's graduates pass licensure examinations; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) the variety of student completion goals, including transfer to another institution of higher education, full-time
employment in the field of study, and military service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Except for the following standard, the statutory provisions contained in section 494C(d) of the HEA are essentially
repeated in &sect;667.21(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;667.21(a)(4), the Secretary proposed to interpret the standard described in 494C(d)(2) of the HEA to require
that a judgement be made regarding the effectiveness of an institution's method to assess a student's ability to complete
successfully an educational program. The proposed standard would require a SPRE to measure the effectiveness of
its assessment method by the completion rate of the assessed students enrolled in the institution's program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several negotiators indicated that the proposed standard implies a highly predictive association between the institution's
assessment method and the students' completion of the program. According to those negotiators, such a predictive
association does not exist. Therefore, the negotiators suggested that the success of the institution's assessment
method be judged by using measures other than completion rates. The Secretary invites comments on this suggestion
and alternative approaches for evaluating the effectiveness of an institution's method to assess a student's ability
to complete successfully an educational program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the standard described in section 494C(d)(4) of the HEA and &sect;667.21(a)(7), the Secretary invites
public comments on whether the SPRE's review of an institution should include a review of the institution's compliance
with statutes and regulations governing access to disabled individuals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;667.21(b), the Secretary has proposed a framework under which a State develops review standards. Under
that framework the Secretary proposes_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) To permit States to develop different standards for different types or categories of institutions and educational
programs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) That States specify the records that referred institutions would need to maintain to satisfy State standards;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) That States determine whether a Title IV, HEA program standard would be an adequate State standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Negotiators disagreed among themselves with regard to the proposal in &sect;667.22(b)(1), to provide latitude
to States to develop different standards for different types or categories of institutions or educational programs.
While many negotiators agreed strongly with this approach, others disagreed vociferously, arguing that States
would use this latitude to establish unreasonably stringent standards for vocational and proprietary institutions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary believes the statute does not prohibit the establishment of different standards for different institutions
and therefore does not wish to preclude a State from establishing such standards, provided the State can adequately
justify that different standards are more appropriate than uniform standards for the institutions in its State.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;667.21(b)(2), the Secretary proposes that a State establish standards that specify the records and information
a referred institution would need to maintain to demonstrate to a SPRE the institution's compliance with those standards.
The Secretary wishes to make clear that technically, only a referred institution is subject to the recordkeeping
requirements specified in the State's standards unless, as discussed previously in &sect;667.3 of this preamble,
the State has or creates an entity that is responsible for ensuring that all institutions in the State remain in compliance
with those standards. Otherwise, a nonreferred institution may choose not to maintain the specified records. However,
that institution would risk losing its participation in the Title IV, HEA programs if as a result of some future event
it triggered a statutory review criterion, and was unable to produce the records required to demonstrate to the SPRE
its compliance with the State's standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, concern has been raised regarding a State's authority to collect information from all institutions
in the State for the purpose of establishing review standards. For example, a State may establish on an annual basis
a student graduation rate standard that is equal to the average graduation rate of students at all institutions in
the State. While the Secretary believes that this method of establishing review standards is reasonable and appropriate,
a State does not have the authority under the SPRP to require all institutions in the State to report standards-related
information to the SPRE. Notwithstanding this limitation, the Secretary encourages all institutions to comply
with a request from a SPRE for this information, particularly if the only alternative available to the SPRE is to establish
arbitrary standards. The Secretary wishes to make clear, however, that a SPRE has the authority under section 494C(d)
of the HEA to require standards-related information from all referred institutions in the State. The Secretary notes
that if a State standard is based upon an average, such as an average graduation rate, there must be a sufficient number
of institutions providing data to support that rate, and the reporting institutions should be representative of
the institutions located in the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;667.21(b)(4), the Secretary proposes that a State must quantify certain review standards. Thus, for the
standard described in section 494C(d)(7) of the HEA and repeated in &sect;667.21(a)(10), the Secretary proposes
that a State establish an acceptable percentage for the relationship between the tuition and fees charged by an institution
for an educational program and the amount of money that a student who successfully completes that program actually
earns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, for the standard described in section 494C(d)(14) of the HEA and repeated in &sect;667.21(a)(18), the
Secretary proposes that a State establish acceptable percentages for_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The completion and graduation rates of students enrolled in educational programs offered by an institution;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The withdrawal rate of students at an institution; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) With respect to an institution's vocational and professional programs, the placement rate of the institution's
graduates in occupations related to their educational program; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The rate or rates at which the institution's graduates pass licensure examinations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For each of these areas, the acceptable percentage sets the level above which a SPRE must consider an institution to
be in compliance with the review standard, and below which a SPRE makes either a finding of noncompliance or conducts
a further review of the institution to account for the reasons the institution failed to meet that percentage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary understands that developing such standards will be difficult and will therefore allow States great
flexibility in developing these quantifiable standards, both in terms of the methods used to determine an acceptable
percentage and the actual acceptable percentage. Moreover, the Secretary wishes to reiterate that the acceptable
percentage that a State establishes should reflect whether an institution is successfully providing its educational
programs to its students rather than whether the institution should automatically be terminated from participation
in the Title IV, HEA programs solely because it failed to satisfy that standard. The Secretary also reiterates that
a State need not recommend the termination of an institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs solely
because the institution failed to meet any particular State standard.

In &sect;667.21(b)(5) the Secretary proposes to require a State to determine the extent to which it is appropriate
to base a State review standard on a related Title IV, HEA program standard or requirement or to establish as the State's
review standard the comparable Title IV, HEA standard or requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes it is imperative that States take into consideration the standards and requirements institutions
must satisfy to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs before increasing the burden on those institutions by adopting
entirely new standards for this part. In this regard, the Secretary expects States to avoid establishing standards
that are weaker than similar Title IV, HEA program standards that an institution must otherwise satisfy to participate
in those programs. In addition, when the Secretary publishes regulations implementing the Student-Right-to-Know
provisions in section 485(a) of the HEA, the Secretary expects States to adopt the methodology contained in those
regulations for calculating student completion and graduation rates.

The Secretary recognizes that many of the referenced Title IV, HEA program standards will be revised or recodified
in the near future as additional regulations are published implementing changes made in the HEA by the Higher Education
Amendments of 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary invites public comment regarding the development of standards under the proposed framework and on
alternative approaches that would assure the development of meaningful and rigorous standards. Specifically,
the Secretary seeks comment on ways to establish common methodologies for computing quantitative standards, and
common recordkeeping requirements associated with those standards, among institutions in all States, and among
the three members of the Integrity triad in a manner that reduces the administrative burden on institutions and the
triad. In addition, the Secretary invites comments on approaches that would minimize extreme disparities in standards
between States.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 494C(d) of the HEA, State-developed standards are ``subject to disapproval by the Secretary.'' In
accordance with that section of the HEA, in &sect;667.22, the Secretary proposes procedures under which the Secretary
evaluates a State's review standards to determine whether to disapprove those standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, in &sect;667.22(a), a State must submit to the Secretary its review standards along with an explanation
of how each standard was established, including_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A description of the manner in which institutions in the State were consulted in the development of the standards;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An explanation of the relationship between each of the State's review standards and the related or comparable

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA program standards or requirements; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If applicable, an explanation of the reasons for establishing different review standards for different types
of institutions or educational programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;667.22(b), the Secretary proposes criteria to determine whether to disapprove a State's review standards.
Specifically, the Secretary proposes to disapprove a State's review standards if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The State does not assure the Secretary that the State's review standards are consistent with the laws and constitution
of that State, as required by section 494C(d) of the HEA; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The State does not submit evidence that the State's review standards were developed in consultation with institutions
in that State, as required in section 494C(d) of the HEA; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The State's review standards do not meet or exceed all of the requirements and cover all the areas described in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 494C(d) of the HEA and &sect;667.21; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The standards the State quantified under &sect;667.21(b)(4) do not meet certain procedural and statistical
requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, in &sect;667.22(c), if the Secretary disapproves a State's review standards, the Secretary proposes to
give the State the reasons for that disapproval and proposes to provide the State an opportunity to either demonstrate
why the Secretary's disapproval was incorrect or submit revised standards that address the reasons for the Secretary's
disapproval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary invites public comment regarding the proposed evaluation criteria and on additional criteria the
Secretary should use to evaluate a State's review standards.

Section 667.23&blank;SPRE Reviews of Institutions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;667.23, the Secretary proposes procedures regarding SPRE reviews of referred institutions. In general,
if the Secretary refers an institution to a SPRE for review under &sect;667.5, or the SPRE selects an institution for
review under &sect;667.6 and the Secretary approves that selection, the SPRE reviews, or arranges for the review
of, that institution to determine whether the institution is in compliance with the State review standards described
in &sect;667.21. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To implement the part of section 494C(d) of the HEA that requires a SPRE to review referred institutions in accordance
with published State standards, in &sect;667.23(b), the Secretary proposes that the SPRE provide written notice
of the State's established review standards to each institution in the State before the SPRE conducts reviews of referred
institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;667.23(c), the Secretary proposes that the SPRE issue a report of its findings and provide it to the institution
no later than 45 days after the SPRE completes its review. For each finding contained in the report, the SPRE must cite
the standard violated and cite the nature of the violation. The SPRE may prescribe, if necessary, a course of action
the institution must follow to correct the violation, or the SPRE may determine that the institution should no longer
participate in the Title IV, HEA programs. If the SPRE chooses to prescribe a corrective action, the Secretary proposes
to give the SPRE sole discretion to determine an appropriate period for the institution to correct the violation and
bring itself into compliance with the State's review standards. Alternatively, if the SPRE determines that the institution
should no longer participate in the Title IV, HEA programs, as provided in section 494C(h) of the HEA, the SPRE may initiate
the process described in &sect;667.25, under which the Secretary ultimately terminates the institution's participation
in those programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;667.23(d), the Secretary proposes that the SPRE give the institution an opportunity to respond to its findings
and required actions. If the institution chooses to respond within the time permitted by the SPRE, in &sect;667.23(e),
the Secretary proposes that the SPRE evaluate the institution's response and issue a final report to the institution
that includes its findings and required action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 494C(h)(1) provides that a SPRE must notify the Secretary of its findings and the actions the SPRE is taking,
or has taken, in response to those findings within a time period prescribed by the Secretary in regulations. Therefore,
in &sect;667.23(f), the Secretary proposes that the SPRE provide to the Secretary a copy of its final report to an institution
within 30 days of its issuance to the institution. A final report includes the report that the SPRE produces after the
institution responds to its initial findings. However, if the institution does not respond to the SPRE's initial
report in the time permitted by the SPRE, the SPRE's initial report becomes its final report on the day after the deadline
date provided to the institution for responding to that report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;667.23(g), the Secretary proposes that a SPRE may determine that an institution should no longer participate
in the Title IV, HEA programs for reasons other than the institution's failure to meet the State's review standards.
Specifically, a SPRE may initiate a proceeding to effect the termination of the institution's participation in the
Title IV, HEA programs under &sect;667.25, if that institution_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Does not respond to the SPRE's findings or required actions within the time permitted by the SPRE and the SPRE's
findings show serious violations of the State's standards; (2) Does not allow SPRE personnel at the institution;
or (3) Fails to provide SPRE officials with prompt access to its documents and records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary wishes to make clear that these proposed regulations do not require a SPRE to take specific actions against
an institution that fails to meet a State's review standards. The Secretary believes strongly that SPREs be afforded
the latitude to prescribe appropriate corrective actions, or, if the SPRE finds that an institution has continuously
or egregiously violated the State's standards, make the determination that the institution should no longer participate
in the Title IV, HEA programs. On the other hand, the Secretary would be concerned if a SPRE failed consistently to prescribe
appropriate and adequate corrective actions for institutions that did not satisfy the State's standards.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, the Secretary intends to add to this section a requirement that a SPRE establish performance standards that
would enable the Secretary to evaluate the conduct and quality of the SPRE's reviews. Public comment is invited regarding
the specific areas where SPRE performance standards should be established and how that performance should be evaluated.

Section 667.24&blank;Peer Reviews of Institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For each referred institution, section 494C(d)(15) of the HEA requires a SPRE to contract with a nationally recognized
accrediting agency or other peer review system with demonstrated competence in assessing educational programs
to carry out a review or provide information to the SPRE regarding that agency's or system's assessment of the quality
and content of the institution educational programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under a literal reading of this provision, a SPRE could contract with the accrediting agency that had previously accredited
the referred institution for the latter to conduct another, limited accreditation review. Under normal circumstances,
the Secretary believes that use of SPRP funds for that activity would not be a prudent use of those funds. Therefore,
under normal circumstances, the Secretary recommends that a SPRE satisfy the requirements of section 494C(d)(15)
of the HEA by contracting with the referred institution's accrediting agency for the latter to provide a copy of the
relevant information that was included in connection with its previous grant of accreditation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Except for the proposal that allows a SPRE to contract with a peer review system that it determines has competence in
assessing educational programs, the provisions in section 494C(d)(15) are repeated in &sect;667.24. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several negotiators argued that the Secretary should define the term ``peer review system'' or specify criteria
to determine the competence of a peer review system. Those negotiators believed strongly that a peer review system
selected by a SPRE would not be a credible authority in assessing postsecondary educational programs because that
peer review system would not be subject to the requirements and standards imposed on accrediting agencies in subpart
2 of Part H of the HEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One negotiator suggested specific criteria to determine the competence of a peer review system. In particular, that
negotiator suggested that the Secretary approve a peer review system if that system demonstrates that_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The geographical scope of the system's activities covers a State, region, or the United States; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The system has the administrative and fiscal capability to carry out its activities in light of the system's objectives
and scope; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The system has established standards and adequate experience to assess the quality and content of institutions'
programs of instruction, training, or study in relation to achieving the stated objectives for which the courses
or programs are offered;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) The system has effective mechanisms for evaluating compliance with its standards and applying its standards

 (5) The system's activities will meet the needs of the State and the Secretary in accomplishing the purposes of the
SPRP and not unnecessarily duplicate the capabilities of a nationally recognized accrediting agency available
to perform the assessment described in &sect;667.24(b) of these regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The Secretary believes that a peer review system for purposes of this program does not, in effect, have to qualify as
a recognized accrediting agency to be used under the SPRP. Nevertheless, the Secretary invites comment on these suggested
criteria and alternative approaches for determining the competence of a peer review system.

Section 667.25&blank;Termination of an Institution's Participation in the Title IV, HEA Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;667.25, the Secretary proposes the procedures a SPRE must follow to effect the termination of an institution's
participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. Under those procedures, if a SPRE determines, based upon its review,
that an institution is in violation of the State's review standards and should no longer continue to participate in
the Title IV, HEA programs or violates one of the provisions proposed in &sect;667.23(g), the SPRE provides the institution
with the opportunity to contest that determination in accordance with procedures the Secretary has approved for
that purpose under &sect;667.26. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the SPRE concludes after affording the institution the opportunity to challenge the SPRE's findings and determination,
that the institution should be terminated from participating in the Title IV, HEA Programs, the SPRE notifies the
Secretary of those findings and that determination. Upon notice by the SPRE that the institution should no longer
participate in the Title IV, HEA programs, the Secretary immediately terminates that institution's participation
in those programs and notifies the institution and the SPRE of the effective date of that termination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the Secretary proposes that an institution terminated under this part may not reapply to the Secretary to
participate in a Title IV, HEA program until 18 months have expired from the effective date of its termination. This
proposal is consistent with the provisions in 34 CFR 668.96. Under that section of the Title IV, HEA program regulations,
an institution whose participation in the Title IV, HEA programs has been terminated may not seek reinstatement in
those programs before the expiration of 18 months from the effective date of its termination. Moreover, section 494C(h)(1)
of the HEA does not authorize any appeal to the Secretary of a termination determination.

Section 494C(h)(3) of the HEA requires the Secretary to prescribe in regulations minimum procedural standards for
the disapproval of institutions by a SPRE. Thus, in &sect;667.26, the Secretary proposes due process criteria that
a State must satisfy when permitting an institution to challenge a SPRE's finding that the institution is in violation
of the State's review standards and should no longer continue to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the Secretary proposes to approve the State's procedures if those procedures satisfy basic due process
requirements. Therefore, the Secretary proposes procedures that require the SPRE to_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Notify an institution of any required action and the basis for that action; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Permit the institution the opportunity to challenge that adverse action in a hearing or in writing; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Notify the institution in writing of the result of its challenge, and the basis for that result; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Follow other applicable procedural requirements of State law.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Because these proposed regulations would affect only States and State agencies, the regulations
would not have an impact on small entities. State and State agencies are not defined as ``small entities'' in the Regulatory
Flexibility Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Sections 667.3, 667.4, 667.12, 667.15, 667.21, and 667.22 contain information collection requirements. As required
by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, the Department of Education will submit a copy of these sections to the Office
of Management and Budget for its review. (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed regulations contain information collection requirements for States that apply to the Secretary
to receive funds under this part and for States that develop review standards and submit those standards to the Secretary
for approval. The Department needs and uses the information collected to determine whether to approve a State's application
for funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Annual public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 1480 hours for each of the
57 States that prepare plans to perform SPRE activities, prepare budgets that account for those activities, develop
review standards, and submit those plans, budgets, and standards to the Secretary for approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection requirements should direct
them to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, Room 3002, New Executive Office Building, Washington,
DC 20503; Attention: Daniel J. Chenok.

(a)(1) This part establishes the rules and procedures that govern the State Postsecondary Review Program, which
is authorized under Title IV, Part H, Subpart 1 of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA). The purpose of

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Determine that the institution should no longer participate in a Title IV, HEA program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Appendix A to Preamble._Major Issues Discussed at the Regional Meetings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department convened four regional meetings in September 1992 to obtain public involvement in the development
of regulations to implement Title IV, part H, subpart 1 of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended by the Higher
Education Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;325. This subpart describes the rules and procedures that govern
the State Postsecondary Review Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department invited individuals and representatives of groups involved in student financial assistance programs
to the four regional meetings. At each meeting, the Department provided for a comprehensive discussion and exchange
of information regarding the implementation of subpart 1 by providing participants with an issue paper that raised
issues and questions with regard to the statutory provisions included in subpart 1. The following is a summary of the
information provided to the Department by participants at the regional meetings. The section of the proposed regulations
that is the subject of the information is provided as a reference. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Time requirement for development of State review standards_&sect;667.3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants in the regional meetings discussed whether the Secretary should require States to develop review standards
within a specified time. The participants agreed that the Secretary should specify a time period but disagreed on
what that time period should be. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Allotment formula_&sect;667.11. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants discussed how Federal funds should be divided among the States that have entered into an agreement with
the Secretary and suggested a funding scheme under which each participating State would receive (1) an allotment
sufficient to carry out minimum SPRE activities, and (2) a supplemental allotment based on the number of institutions
in the State, the total Title IV, HEA program funds made available to students attending institutions in the State,
or the number institutions referred to the State by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Allowable costs and activities_&sect;667.14. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants discussed the extent to which a State should be reimbursed for the costs of performing reviews and other
activities and suggested that the Secretary reimburse the State for the direct and indirect costs of SPRE review activities,
including salaries and fringe benefits, travel and other review costs, costs for developing State review standards
and complaint procedures, and litigation costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consultation with institutions_&sect;667.12. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants discussed whether the Secretary should establish procedures that a State must use to consult with institutions
in its State in the development of State review standards. They recommended that the Secretary suggest, but not establish,
consultation procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal minimum review standards_&sect;667.21. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants discussed whether the Secretary should establish Federal minimum standards and whether a State could
establish standards that are weaker than comparable standards that govern an institution's eligibility and participation
in the Title IV, HEA programs. The participants were divided on the first issue; the majority argued that Federal minimums
would not be appropriate because they could not be developed in a manner that would adequately account for the mission
and diversity of all postsecondary institutions. With respect to the second issue, some participants felt that a
State should have the flexibility to develop weaker standards, while others felt that no distinction should be made
between a ``weaker'' standard or a ``different'' standard. Those participants felt that a State should be able to
develop different standards for different types of institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Quantifiable standards_&sect;667.21. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants discussed whether a State should quantify review standards and suggested that, to the extent that standards
could be quantified, they should be quantified. However, most participants felt that the State should have the flexibility
to establish the level at which an institution would be considered to be in violation of the quantified standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SPRE review findings_&sect;667.23. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants discussed whether a SPRE should be required to determine that an institution should no longer participate
in the Title IV, HEA programs based on the institution's failure to satisfy a particular State standard. Most participants
felt that a SPRE could, but should not be required to, make that determination. The participants suggested that, based
on the nature and severity of an institution's violations, the SPRE should have the latitude to take an adverse action
against the institution or to require the institution to take actions to bring itself into compliance with the State's
standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Disapproval of State review standards_&sect;667.22. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants discussed the basis under which the Secretary should disapprove a State's review standards. Most participants
felt that the Secretary should disapprove a State's standards only if those standards did not adequately address
the statutory requirements.
