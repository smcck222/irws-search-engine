SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission's enhanced participatory approach for this rulemaking was described in the notice of workshops published
on December 11, 1992 (57 FR 58727). The Commission believes it is desirable to provide for early and comprehensive
input from affected interests on important public health and safety issues, such as the development of radiological
criteria for decommissioning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission obtained comments on the scope, issues and approaches that must be addressed in establishing the radiological
criteria for decommissioning through a series of workshops (57 FR 58727; December 11, 1992), generic environmental
impact statement (GEIS) scoping meetings (58 FR 33570; June 18, 1993), a dedicated electronic bulletin board system
(BBS) (58 FR 37760; July 13, 1993) and written submissions. A summary of these early comments received on this rulemaking,
NUREG/CR&hyph;6156, and a copy of the staff's draft rule have been provided to NRC Agreement States, workshop participants,
and other interested parties upon publication of this notice of availability. Interested parties may obtain single
copies of NUREG/CR&hyph;6156 and the staff's draft rule by any of the three following methods: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Downloading the files from the BBS; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Requesting a copy from Ms. Roberta Gordon, Mail Stop NLS/139, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington,
DC 20555, telephone (301) 492&hyph;3746; FAX (301) 492&hyph;3866; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Inspection and/or copying for a fee in the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW. (Lower Level), Washington,
DC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of NUREG/CR&hyph;6156 may be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office,
P.O. Box 37082, Washington, DC 20013&hyph;7082. Copies are also available from the National Technical Information
Service, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. A copy is also available for inspection and/or copying for a
fee in the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission will accept comments on the NUREG/CR&hyph;6156 and the staff's draft rule in electronic format through
the BBS or in written format. Comments may be submitted electronically, in either ASCII text or Wordperfect format,
by calling the NRC enhanced participatory rulemaking electronic bulletin board at (800) 880&hyph;6091. The bulletin
board can be accessed using generally available communications software, with communication protocol setting
of no parity, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit (N,8,1) and ANSI or VT&hyph;100 terminal emulation. Background documents on the
rulemakings are also available for downloading and viewing on the bulletin board. For more information call Ms. Christine
Daily, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, telephone
(301) 492&hyph;3999; FAX (301) 492&hyph;3866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff has considered the comments received in the development of the staff's draft rule. The availability
of the staff's draft rule provides yet another opportunity for public comment early in this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The normal process for conducting Commission rulemakings is the following sequence: NRC staff development of a draft
proposed rule for Commission review and approval; publication of the proposed rule for public comment; consideration
of the comments by the NRC staff; and preparation of a draft final rule for Commission approval. In this enhanced participatory
rulemaking, not only have comments been solicited before the NRC staff prepared the draft proposed rule and the NRC
staff discussed the issues with affected interests at public meetings, but an additional opportunity for public
comment is being solicited during the preparation of the draft proposed rule. The preliminary views expressed in
the staff's draft rule may change in light of comments received. In any case, there will be an opportunity for additional
public comment in connection with any proposed rule that may be developed by the Commission. After the Commission
review and approval of the draft proposed rule that is developed using the comments provided, the general process
of issuing the proposed rule for public comment, NRC staff evaluation of comments, and preparation of a draft final
rule for Commission approval, will occur.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Airbus
Industrie Model A320 series airplanes, that currently requires modification of the belly fairing structure. This
action would revise the compliance time for accomplishment of the modification. All other parts of the rule would
remain unchanged. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to ensure that the structural integrity of
the belly fairing structure is maintained.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 6, 1993, the FAA issued AD 93&hyph;24&hyph;11, Amendment 39&hyph;8760 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(58 FR 64875, December 10, 1993), applicable to certain Airbus Industrie Model A320 series airplanes, to require
modification of the belly fairing structure. That action was prompted by results of fatigue testing, which revealed
that rivet heads were sheared off and fatigue cracks were present in the angles at the angle attachment between the
keelbeam and the belly fairing support frames. The requirements of that AD are intended to prevent reduced structural
integrity of the belly fairing structure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has become aware that the compliance time specified in paragraph (a) of AD 93&hyph;24&hyph;11
for accomplishment of the modification could allow certain operators to accomplish the modification at a time considerably
later than that intended. Paragraph (a) of that AD currently requires that the modification be accomplished prior
to the accumulation of 12,000 total landings after January 10, 1994 (the effective date of AD 93&hyph;24&hyph;11,
Amendment 39&hyph;8760), or within 300 days after that date, whichever occurs later. However, the FAA's intent is
that the modification be accomplished prior to the accumulation of 12,000 total landings on the airplane, or within
300 days after the effective date of the AD, whichever occurs later. The FAA has determined that AD 93&hyph;24&hyph;11
must be superseded to revise the compliance time in order to ensure that the structural integrity of the belly fairing
structure is maintained in a timely manner. All other parts of the rule would remain as published originally. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement.
The FAA has determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated in the United
States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would supersede AD 93&hyph;24&hyph;11 to continue to require
modification of the belly fairing structure. This proposed AD would revise the compliance time to require accomplishment
of that modification prior to the accumulation of 12,000 total landings on the airplane, or within 300 days after January
10, 1994, whichever occurs later. The actions would continue to be required to be accomplished in accordance with
Airbus Industrie Service Bulletin A320&hyph;53&hyph;1014, dated June 25, 1992, or Revision 1, dated May 26, 1993.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 20 airplanes of U.S. registry were affected by AD 93&hyph;24&hyph;11, and would continue to
be affected by this proposed supersedure of that AD. It takes approximately 288 work hours per airplane to accomplish
the actions currently required by AD 93&hyph;24&hyph;11, and the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required
parts cost approximately $1,045 per airplane. Based on these figures, the current cost impact of AD 93&hyph;24&hyph;11
on U.S. operators is estimated to be $337,700, or $16,885 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost figure indicated above is presented as if no operator has yet accomplished the requirements of AD 93&hyph;24&hyph;11
(or this proposed supersedure of that AD). There are no foreseeable additional costs that would be imposed by this
proposed supersedure of AD 93&hyph;24&hyph;11. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Boeing
Model 767 series airplanes, that currently requires inspections, adjustments, and functional checks of the thrust
reverser system. This action would add a requirement for installation of an additional thrust reverser system locking
feature, periodic functional tests of that locking feature following its installation, and repair of any discrepancy
found. This proposal is prompted by the identification of a modification that ensures that the level of safety inherent
in the original type design of the thrust reverser system is further enhanced. The actions specified by the proposed
AD are intended to prevent possible discrepancies in the thrust reverser control system that can result in the inadvertent
deployment of a thrust reverser during flight.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 7, 1992, the FAA issued AD 92&hyph;03&hyph;03, Amendment 39&hyph;8157 (57 FR 3004, January 27, 1992),
applicable to certain Boeing Model 767 series airplanes, to require inspections, adjustments, and functional checks
of the thrust reverser system. That action was prompted by an ongoing design review, resulting from an accident investigation
from which it has been determined that, prior to the accident, the airplane apparently experienced an uncommanded
in-flight deployment of a thrust reverser. Deployment of a thrust reverser during flight could result in reduced
controllability of the airplane. The requirements of that AD are intended to ensure the integrity of the fail safe
features of the thrust reverser system by preventing the possible discrepancies in the thrust reverser control system
that can result in the inadvertent deployment of a thrust reverser during flight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of that AD, Boeing has developed a modification for Model 767 series airplanes equipped with Pratt
and Whitney JT9D&hyph;7R4 or General Electric CF6&hyph;80A series engines, which, when accomplished, will ensure
that the level of safety inherent in the original type design of the thrust reverser system is further enhanced. The
FAA has determined that the installation of these additional features will further reduce the likelihood of an in-flight
thrust reverser deployment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Service Bulletin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
767&hyph;78&hyph;0060, Revision 2, dated August 19, 1993 (for Model 767 series airplanes equipped with General
Electric CF6&hyph;80A series engines), and Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;78&hyph;0061, Revision 1, dated
August 5, 1993 (for Model 767 series airplanes equipped with Pratt and Whitney JT9D&hyph;7R4 series engines). These
service bulletins describe procedures for installation of an additional thrust reverser system locking feature
(denoted as a ``synch-lock''), which will reduce the possibility of an uncommanded in-flight deployment of the thrust
reversers. Accomplishment of that installation includes revising certain wiring, replacing selected circuit
breakers, changing the microswitch pack, and adding electrical components. The synch-lock is controlled independently
of the existing electro-mechanical safety features of the thrust reverser system. This additional locking feature
has been certified by the FAA. The FAA has determined that installation of the synch-lock in accordance with the applicable
service bulletin is necessary in order to positively address the identified unsafe condition with regard to these
airplanes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 92&hyph;03&hyph;03 to continue to require repetitive inspections, adjustments,
and functional checks of the thrust reverser system. This action would add a requirement for installation of an additional
thrust reverser system locking feature (synch-lock). Installation of the synch-lock would terminate the requirement
for repetitive inspections, adjustments, and functional checks of the thrust reverser system. The synch-lock installation
would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This AD would also add periodic functional tests of the synch-lock following its installation, and repair of any discrepancy
found. The FAA has determined that these tests are necessary to ensure the integrity of the synch-lock installation
and that it is effective in preventing the identified unsafe condition. This determination is based on the fact that
the synch-lock is a new design and its reliability has not been adequately proven through service experience. Boeing
has submitted to the FAA procedures for accomplishment of the synch-lock integrity test described in the airplane
maintenance manual. These procedures are accomplished independently of other thrust reverser system tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since only limited information is available currently to substantiate the in-service reliability of the synch-lock
device, the FAA has established an appropriate functional test interval of 1,000 hours time-in-service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 119 Model 767 series airplanes equipped with General Electric CF6&hyph;80A series engines
of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 69 of these airplanes of U.S. registry would be
affected by this proposed AD. The inspections, adjustments, and functional checks required currently by AD 92&hyph;03&hyph;03
require approximately 16 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based
on these figures, the total cost impact of that action on U.S. operators of Model 767 series airplanes equipped with
General Electric CF6&hyph;80A series engines is estimated to be $60,720, or $880 per airplane.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For U.S. operators of Model 767 series airplanes equipped with General Electric CF6&hyph;80A series engines, the
FAA estimates that it would take approximately 786 work hours per airplane to accomplish the modification proposed
by this AD, and 1 work hour to accomplish the proposed functional tests, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour.
Required parts would be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost
impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators of Model 767 series airplanes equipped with General Electric CF6&hyph;80A
series engines is estimated to be $2,986,665, or $43,285 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 95 Model 767 series airplanes equipped with Pratt and Whitney JT9D&hyph;7R4 series engines
of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 30 of these airplanes of U.S. registry would be
affected by this proposed AD. The inspections, adjustments, and functional checks required currently by AD 92&hyph;03&hyph;03
require approximately 16 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based
on these figures, the total cost impact of that action on U.S. operators of Model 767 series airplanes equipped with
Pratt and Whitney JT9D&hyph;7R4 series engines is estimated to be $26,400, or $880 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For U.S. operators of Model 767 series airplanes equipped with Pratt and Whitney JT9D&hyph;7R4 series engines, the
FAA estimates that it would take approximately 812 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed modification,
and 1 work hour to accomplish the proposed functional tests, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required
parts would be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of
the proposed AD on U.S. operators of Model 767 series airplanes equipped with Pratt and Whitney JT9D&hyph;7R4 series
engines is estimated to be $1,341,450, or $44,715 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These total cost figures assume that no operator has yet accomplished the proposed requirements of this AD action.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The number of required work hours for accomplishing the proposed functional tests, as indicated above, is presented
as if the accomplishment of those tests proposed in this AD were to be conducted as ``stand alone'' actions. However,
in actual practice, those tests for the most part would be accomplished coincidentally or in combination with normally
scheduled airplane inspections and other maintenance program tasks. Therefore, the actual number of necessary
additional work hours for accomplishment of the functional tests would be minimal in many instances. Additionally,
any costs associated with special airplane scheduling would be minimal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA recognizes that the proposed modification would require a large number of work hours to accomplish. However,
the 5-year compliance time specified in paragraph (d) of this proposed AD should allow ample time for the synch-lock
installation to be accomplished coincidentally with scheduled major airplane inspection and maintenance activities,
thereby minimizing the costs associated with special airplane scheduling.

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Transport Canada Aviation, which is the airworthiness authority for Canada, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe
condition may exist on certain de Havilland Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;301 airplanes. Transport Canada Aviation advises
that, during a post-certification review of the design for cabin venting between compartments, the manufacturer
discovered that the cabin and the compartments beneath the floor could be inadequately vented during rapid fuselage
decompression of these airplanes. This condition is the result of movement of the sidewall panels in the passenger
cabin, which may partially block the vents along the bottom edges of the panels. This condition, if not corrected,
could result in collapse of the floor and subsequent injury to passengers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
De Havilland has issued Service Bulletin No. 8&hyph;25&hyph;53, dated August 4, 1989, that describes procedures
for modification of the sidewall panels in the passenger cabin (Modification No. 8/1339). The modification entails
bonding spacers along the lower edge of the cabin sidewall panels to provide support. Installation of the spacers
will ensure that intercompartmental venting is maintained in the event of rapid fuselage decompression. Transport
Canada Aviation classified this service bulletin as mandatory and issued Canadian Airworthiness Directive No.
CF&hyph;90&hyph;26, dated November 29, 1990, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes
in Canada. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement.
Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada Aviation has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of Transport Canada Aviation, reviewed all available information,
and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in
the United States.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require modification of the sidewall panels in the passenger
cabin. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 23 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
32 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
Required parts would be provided by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost
impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $40,480, or $1,760 per airplane. This total cost figure
assumes that no operator has yet accomplished the proposed requirements of this AD action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Fokker Model
F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes. This proposal would require inspections to detect corrosion in the wheel axles of
the main landing gear (MLG) sliding members; and, if any corrosion is found, rework of corroded areas and an inspection
to detect cracks in the wheel axles; and, if any crack is found, replacement of the cracked sliding member. This proposal
is prompted by a report that a MLG wheel axle failed during push back of an in-service airplane from the terminal. The
actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of the MLG wheel axle due to the problems associated
with corrosion and cracking.

The Rijksluchtvaartdienst (RLD), which is the airworthiness authority for the Netherlands, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes. The RLD advises that
an operator of Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes reported the failure of a main landing gear (MLG) wheel axle during
push back of an in-service airplane from the terminal. Subsequent non-destructive testing (NDT) inspection of the
operator's fleet of Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes revealed that corrosion was present on most MLG wheel axles
examined. Although no cracks were found during this inspection, preliminary findings indicate that the crack which
led to the failed axle had initiated from a corrosion pit located on the radius of the brake abutment flange on the axle.
Corrosion and cracking in a MLG wheel axle, if not detected and corrected in a timely manner, could result in failure
of the MLG wheel axle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fokker has issued Service Bulletin SBF100&hyph;32&hyph;079, Revision 1, dated October 4, 1993, that describes
procedures for removal of the MLG wheels and brakes, inspections of the wheel axles, and reinstallation of MLG wheels
and brakes. The Fokker service bulletin references Dowty Aerospace Service Bulletin F100&hyph;32&hyph;63, Revision
2, dated September 23, 1993, as the appropriate source of service information for the wheel axle inspection. The Dowty
Aerospace service bulletin describes procedures for a visual inspection to detect corrosion in the wheel axles of
the MLG sliding members; and, if any corrosion is found, rework of corroded areas and an NDT inspection to detect cracks
in the wheel axles; and, if any crack is found, replacement of the cracked sliding member. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fokker Service Bulletin SBF100&hyph;32&hyph;080, dated October 4, 1993, and Dowty Aerospace Service Bulletin
F100&hyph;32&hyph;64, dated September 23, 1993, describe procedures for accomplishing the corresponding repetitive
actions described in the service bulletins discussed previously. The RLD classified these service bulletins as
mandatory and issued Netherlands Airworthiness Directive BLA 93&hyph;108/2 (A), dated November 1, 1993, in order
to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the Netherlands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in the Netherlands and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the RLD has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the RLD, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require repetitive visual inspections to detect corrosion
in the wheel axles of the MLG sliding members; and, if any corrosion is found, rework of corroded areas and an NDT inspection
to detect cracks in the wheel axles; and, if any crack is found, replacement of the cracked sliding member. The actions
would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 100 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
14 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
Based on these figures, the recurring cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators (for four inspections per year)
is estimated to be $308,000 per year, or $3,080 per airplane per year. This total cost figure assumes that no operator
has yet accomplished the proposed requirements of this AD action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The collection of information contained in this notice of proposed rulemaking has been submitted to the Office of
Management and Budget for review in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)). Comments on
the collection of information should be sent to the Office of Management and Budget, Attn: Desk Officer for the Department
of the Treasury, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503, with copies to the Internal
Revenue Service, Attn: IRS Reports Clearance Officer PC:FP, Washington, DC 20224. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The collection of information in this notice of proposed rulemaking is in &sect;&sect;1.6662&hyph;6T(d)(2)(iii)
and (d)(3)(iii). This information is required by the IRS to implement section 6662(e)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue
Code. This information will be used to determine whether the taxpayer reasonably concluded that the transfer prices
charged in related party transactions were consistent with the arm's length standard. The likely recordkeepers
are business or other for-profit institutions and small businesses or organizations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These estimates are an approximation of the average time expected to be necessary for a collection of information.
They are based on such information as is available to the IRS. Individual recordkeepers may require greater or less
time, depending on their particular circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The temporary regulations published in the Rules and Regulations section of this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contain amendments to the Income Tax Regulations under sections 6662(e) and (h) and section 6664(c) relating to the
imposition of accuracy-related penalties. The final regulations that will result from the regulations proposed
in this notice would be based on the text of the temporary regulations and would provide rules relating to the imposition
of accuracy-related penalties under those sections for transactions between persons described in section 482 and
net section 482 transfer price adjustments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The text of those temporary regulations also serves as the text of these proposed regulations. The preamble to the
temporary regulations explains these proposed regulations.

Special Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in
Executive Order 12866. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C.
chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and therefore,
a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, this
notice of proposed rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration
for comment on its impact on small business.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the rules and regulations section of this issue of

the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, the IRS is issuing a temporary regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that adds an anti-abuse rule to the final regulations relating to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the tax treatment of debt instruments with original issue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discount. The rule allows the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in certain circumstances, to apply or depart from the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations in a manner that ensures a reasonable result in light 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the purposes of the statutes governing original issue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discount. The text of the temporary regulation also serves as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the text of this proposed regulation. This document also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withdraws the proposed regulations relating to the tax treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of price level adjusted mortgages and the portion of the 1992 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations relating to the treatment of a debt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instrument that provides for contingent payments.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A temporary regulation in the Rules and Regulations portion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 amends the Income Tax 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations (26 CFR part 1) relating to section 1275 by adding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;1.1275&hyph;2T. The text of that temporary regulation also serves as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the text of this proposed regulation. The preamble to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temporary regulation explains the temporary regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This document also withdraws the portion of the 1992 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations relating to the treatment of a debt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instrument under section 1274 of the Internal Revenue Code if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
debt instrument provides for contingent payments. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this document withdraws the proposed regulations relating to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tax treatment of price level adjusted mortgages.

Special Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this notice of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12866. It also has been determined that section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, this notice of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small business.

Comments and Public Hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before the proposed regulation relating to the anti-abuse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule is adopted as a final regulation, consideration will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
given to any written comments that are submitted timely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(preferably a signed original and eight copies) to the IRS. All 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments will be available for public inspection and copying. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public hearing may be scheduled and held upon written request by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any person who submits written comments on the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation. Notice of the time and place for the hearing will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published in the

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Forest Service hereby gives notice of its intent to develop a proposed rule and related policy to address a number
of financial security provisions related to National Forest System (NFS) timber sale contracts. Specifically,
the proposals will address the following: Transfer or refund of the downpayment made pursuant to timber sale contract
special provision

DOWNPAYMENT
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
; criteria which the Chief will use for determining speculative bidding; and the need for reduction of the performance
bond amount before all volume is removed. The proposed policy is needed to ensure that the government has an adequate
level of financial security, to assure the timely completion of timber sale contracts by avoiding contract defaults
resulting from speculative bidding, and to maintain competition between qualified bidders by monitoring for speculative
bidding.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Accounting Office (GAO), in testimony before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior and
Related Agencies on April 24, 1991, testified that the Forest Service's key contracting measures such as downpayments,
periodic payments, performance bonds, and calculations of damages were similar to those of other timber sellers,
with the exception that the Forest Service returns or credits the downpayment before the contract is substantially
complete. GAO testified that, by crediting or returning the downpayment, the Forest Service has less security to
protect the government's financial interest, in terms of access to funds in the event of a default. GAO's testimony
included a recommendation that the Secretary of Agriculture direct the Chief of the Forest Service to retain the downpayment
until the contract is substantially complete.

The Department of Agriculture published a final rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 31, 1991 (56 FR 36099), that implemented the downpayment requirements of Section 2(d) of the Federal Timber
Contract Payment Modification Act of October 16, 1984 (98 Stat, 2213; 16 U.S.C. 618(d)). In the final rule, the Secretary
of Agriculture directed the Forest Service to develop and publish for comment a proposed rule that would eliminate
transfer or refund of the downpayment and that would respond to GAO's concern that the downpayment be retained until
the contract is substantially complete. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the Department, in responding to public comment in the July 31, 1991, final rule (56 FR 36100) agreed that
additional and specific criteria are needed for determining speculative bidding and indicated that the Forest Service
would develop proposed criteria and publish them in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for public comment prior to adoption of any criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The timber sale contract requires a performance bond equal to 10 percent of the total bid value of the timber sale. The
current timber sale contract language, in Standard Provision B9.11 Bond Reduction, prohibition reduction of the
performance bond until a purchaser has completed removal of timber, other than substandard timber form the sale area,
under Standard Provision B2.12. However, retaining the full amount of the performance bond until all volume has been
removed may result in the Government having an excessive amount of financial security. The agency is considering
a revision of this provision to avoid retention of excessive security. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Forest Service invites comments on how the agency can best address the concerns of GAO, establish criteria which
the Chief can use in determining speculative bidding, and avoid having an excessive amount of financial security
when the performance bond is retained until all volume is removed. Comments received will be considered in the development
of a proposed rule on downpayment and associated proposed policy related to performance bonds and speculative bidding
criteria. The proposed rule and policies will be published in the

 We are proposing to revise our rules concerning Medicaid agencies' actions where third party liability (TPL) may
exist for expenditures for medical assistance covered under the State plan. We propose to allow the Medicaid agencies
to request waivers from certain procedures in our regulations that are not expressly required by the Social Security
Act. We would consider waiving nonstatutorily required procedures relating to identifying possible TPL where the
agency finds that following a given required procedure is not cost-effective and is duplicative of another State
activity. A nonstatutorily required activity would be eligible for a waiver if the cost of the required activity exceeds
the TPL recoupment and the required activity accomplishes, at the same or at a higher cost, the same objective as another
activity that is being performed by the States. This change would give States greater flexibility in managing their
Medicaid programs.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1902(a)(25) of the Social Security Act (the Act) requires that State or local Medicaid agencies take all reasonable
measures to ascertain the legal liability of third parties to pay for care and services furnished to Medicaid recipients.
A third party is any individual, entity, or program that is or may be liable to pay all or part of the expenditures for
medical assistance furnished under a State plan. Medicaid is intended to be the payer of last resort; that is, other
available resources must be used before Medicaid pays for the care and services of a Medicaid-eligible individual.
These other resources are known as third party liability, or TPL.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, provisions under section 1902(a)(25)(A)(i) of the Act specify that the Medicaid State plan must provide
for the collection of sufficient information to enable the State to pursue claims against third parties. Examples
of liable third parties include commercial insurance companies through employment-related or privately purchased
health insurance; casualty coverage resulting from an accidental injury; payments received directly from an individual
who has either voluntarily accepted or been assigned legal responsibility for the health care of one or more Medicaid
recipients; and fraternal groups, union, or State workers' compensation commissions. TLP also includes medical
support provided by a parent under a court or administrative order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statutory provisions (sections 1137 and 1902(a)(25) of the Act) require States to obtain health insurance information
at eligibility intake and redetermination interviews, perform the State Wage Information Collection Agency (SWICA)
data match, safeguard recipient information, obtain recipient assignment of rights, and submit a TPL action plan
for HCFA approval. These statutory requirements would not be affected by the provisions of this proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nonstatutory requirements, specified in Section 433.138 (and subject to proposed waiver), include obtaining information
(via data matching) with the State Workers' Compensation or Industrial Accident Commission files and State Motor
Vehicle Accident report files. Another nonstatutory requirement is the requirement for agencies to identify all
paid claims with trauma/diagnosis codes found in the ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM 800&hyph;999, except 994.6. In Section
433.139 (and subject to proposed waiver), State agencies are required to bill the third party resource within 60 days
after the last day of the month the State learns of the available resource and use the cost-avoidance method of paying.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under our regulations at Section 433.138, pertinent health insurance information must be obtained (1) from Medicaid
applicants or recipients during the determination and redetermination process; (2) by securing data match agreements
with specific Federal and State agencies; (3) by conducting diagnosis and trauma code edits; and (4) by following
specified procedures regarding the frequency of these activities.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulations at section 433.139 govern State payment of claims where TPL is involved. There are two methods of paying
claims for recipients with known TPL: The cost-avoidance method and the pay-and-chase method. Under the cost-avoidance
method, the Medicaid agency does not initially pay the claim, but rather returns the claim to the provider with information
necessary for the provider to bill the third party. Under the pay-and-chase method, an agency may pay the total amount
allowed under its payment schedule and then seek recovery from the liable third parties. The agency must initiate
recovery within 60 days after the end of the month in which payment is made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most States that implement the requirements in our regulations at section 433.138 achieve significant Medicaid
savings. Whenever third party resources can be utilized instead of Medicaid, both Federal and State taxpayers save
money. In some instances, however, TPL requirements are not cost-effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some States have reported very poor results in terms of identifying new TPL leads through trauma and diagnosis code
edits. There are reports that some codes never yield TPL. Currently, States may obtain a partial waiver from HCFA of
the requirement in section 433.138(e) to take action to identify those paid claims for Medicaid recipients that contain
diagnosis codes 800 through 999 (except that no State has to pursue information concerning code 994.6, motion sickness).
Under section 433.138(e), the State may obtain a waiver from complying with the requirements for specific codes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In section 433.139(e), we also permit a State to request a waiver from HCFA of the cost-avoidance method of paying if
the State could document that the pay-and-chase method was at least as cost-effective as the cost-avoidance method.
The State is required to revalidate its cost-avoidance waiver request every 3 years and notify HCFA of any event that
may change the cost-effectiveness of the waiver. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When these requirements were established by HCFA, the Medicaid TPL program was in its infancy. Many States were not
pursuing TPL or only recovering TPL passively; that is, making recoveries when contacted by a provider or attorney
who was making a third party settlement. We believed there were tremendous untapped TPL resources that were not identified
by States. Therefore, the initial regulations were broad and did not allow States discretion to decide whether or
not to perform required TPL activities based upon their cost-effectiveness. For this reason, we issued TPL regulations
which we have now determined were too prescriptive and, at times, duplicative. On February 27, 1987, we published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (52 FR 5971) a response to State comments regarding cost-effectiveness of our discretionary regulations at sections
433.138 and 433.139. We stated that we would reevaluate these requirements if we received substantial complaints.
This rule is consistent with that statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the majority of the States have aggressive and comprehensive TPL programs and have reported substantial
savings from TPL activities. However, program experience has identified situations where some activities required
by our regulations duplicate some State agency requirements in identifying new TPL leads. Also, situations have
been identified where some of our requirements in regulations are not cost-effective; that is, States can reasonably
expect to spend more to perform a TPL activity than anticipated or realized savings in that activity. It is for these
reasons that we now propose to offer States the opportunity to request waivers from the unproductive activities that
are not mandated by statute, and for which States have superior methods for accomplishing the same objectives as our
regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Proposed Revisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provisions of this proposed rule would allow States to request a waiver from requirements in section 433.138(c),
(d)(4), (d)(5), (e), (f), (g)(1), (g)(2), (g)(3), and (g)(4) or section 433.139(b), (d)(1), and (d)(2) that are not
explicitly mandated by statute when it is found that performing the requirement is not cost-effective. A nonstatutorily
required activity would be eligible for a waiver if the cost of the required activity exceeds the TPL recoupment and
the required activity accomplishes, at the same or at a higher cost, the same objective as another activity that is
being performed by the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed provisions would allow States to perform TPL operations more efficiently and at a greater savings to
the Federal Government. Duplicative efforts (and higher costs) would be eliminated when States have already identified
third party resources through another more cost-effective means. It should be noted that HCFA's financial participation
in State Medicaid Management Information Systems costs, including costs related to data matches we require States
to perform, may be as much as 90 percent. Therefore, it is not in the interest of the Federal Government to have States
perform activities which are either duplicative or nonproductive.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For example, our regulations currently require State Medicaid agencies to perform a review of diagnosis and trauma
codes to identify injuries for which TPL exist. At the same time we require States to perform data matches with the State
Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to identify TPL injuries resulting from car accidents. These two matches replicate
some of the data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An example of this scenario was presented to HCFA by a midwestern State, which has performed the DMV data match while
also performing the required diagnosis and trauma code editing. The DMV match resulted in 9,000 case leads and, of
those, 107 cases had TPL. Of those 107 cases, the State had already identified 100 through trauma code editing. The
seven new cases yielded a return of $3,623 but the cost to Medicaid of the DMV match was $37,785. A large portion of those
costs were reimbursed by HCFA in matching administrative funding, and in retrospect, we recognize that Federal and
State funds could have been better spent. By allowing the State a waiver of the DMV data match, HCFA would allow the State
to operate its TPL program in a more efficient and cost-effective manner and thus save tax dollars. Under existing
regulations, there is no provision for waiver of this activity as long as a State is able to perform the match. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another example that involves a nonproductive effort has been presented by a southern State. The State has reported
on its attempt to identify TPL through a quarterly data match with Workers' Compensation. The State averages 96 leads
per match. Out of these leads, an average of 89 percent are denied by the carrier or Medicaid never receives a claim,
8 percent of the claims are under the threshold amount for pursuit of cost-effective recovery, and 1 percent are already
known to the State. This leaves 2 percent of leads that can be pursued, at an average recovery of $319.18 per claim. The
State has not realized any collections for this effort. The cost to the State is approximately 4 to 5 man-days per quarter,
plus significant systems expenses. Therefore, performing this data match does not seem to be cost-effective, and
it seems to exceed our statutory mandate of performing a ``reasonable effort'' to identify TPL. This State also performs
trauma code editing which serves to identify recipients injured on the job. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Relief from regulatory requirements would come in the form of a waiver. The State would submit a formal request to the
HCFA regional office (RO). The State would be required to provide documentation that demonstrates that the cost of
the required activity exceeds the TPL recoupment and the required activity accomplishes, at the same or at a higher
cost, the same objective as another activity which is being performed by the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Documentation to support the waiver request could include past claims recovery data that demonstrate the administrative
expenses involved in meeting that particular requirement, or a State analysis that documents a cost-effective alternative
that accomplishes the same task. HCFA's ROs would consider the individual merits of each waiver request and would
grant or deny the waiver request based on cost-effectiveness and State alternatives presented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We would issue separate guidelines for developing and evaluating waiver requests for the new waivers. We currently
have cost-effectiveness guidelines in place to govern our existing cost-avoidance waiver process. These guidelines
were developed by a national work group comprised of HCFA Central Office (CO) and RO staff, whose purpose was to make
the guidelines comprehensive and to ensure consistent application throughout the country. They are found in section
3904.2 of the State Medicaid Manual. We would issue similar guidelines to review waivers resulting from this proposed
rule. Sources of data would most likely include claims processing tabulations, State expenditure reports, and savings
data from the TPL recovery units and the HCFA Form 64.9a report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CO staff also would provide clarification to RO staff as needed through our regular teleconferences. Consultation
on specific waiver requests would be provided routinely, as is currently done in the State plan amendment process,
cost-avoidance waivers, trauma code edit waivers, and State TPL action plan submissions. As with our current waiver
provisions, ROs would be required to report approvals and disapprovals to CO on an ongoing basis. When changes in waiver
status occur, CO also would be notified.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Implementation of this regulation would allow States flexibility in managing their individual Medicaid programs
and would be consistent with Congressional concern for a Medicaid program to operate in a cost-effective manner,
while providing necessary medical care for the needy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, we propose to revise our rules to allow a State to request a waiver from any of the requirements specified
in section 433.138(c), (d)(4), (d)(5), (e), (f), (g)(1), (g)(2), (g)(3), and (g)(4), which concern obtaining health
insurance information, obtaining other information, exchange of data, and diagnosis and trauma code edits, and
follow-up activities for certain exchanges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also propose to revise section 433.139, which concerns payment of claims, to allow a State to request a waiver of
the requirements in paragraphs (b) and (d)(1) and (2) of this section. These paragraphs contain procedures concerning
payment when probable liability is known at time of payment (cost avoidance), and a requirement to bill third parties
within 60 days of the last day of the month the agency learns of the existence of TPL. However, new section 433.139(e)(4)
requires that if a State requests a waiver of the requirement specifically concerning the 60-day limit, the State
must submit documentation of written agreement between the State and the third party, including Medicare fiscal
intermediaries and carriers, that extension of the billing requirement is agreeable to all parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We would add a new section 433.138(l) and revise section 433.139(e) to permit the waivers. We would require the State
to submit a written request for a waiver of the specified nonstatutory requirement(s) to the HCFA RO and submit adequate
documentation to establish that the regulatory activity is not cost-effective. Where the agency wishes to substitute
another action for the TPL activity in section 433.138 or section 433.139, it must document that the cost of the substitute
activity does not exceed the cost of the activity to be waived. If HCFA approves the State's waiver request, these net
rules would relieve the State of its obligation to comply with the requirements. These procedures would parallel
those found in existing section 433.139(e) for States obtaining a waiver from using the cost-avoidance method. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We would revise section 433.138(e), which already allows a waiver for specific trauma codes, to allow waivers for
either the entire trauma code edit activity, or for waiver of editing specific codes, based on cost-effectiveness
and duplication of effort. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We would specify in section 433.138(j) an exception to the reporting requirement for data exchanges and trauma code
edits (section 433.138) when waivers are granted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We would revise section 433.138(a) to exclude from the basic requirements those waived under paragraph (l). We also
would delete the waiver provision in section 433.139(b)(2)(i), since it would be covered by the proposed revised
section 433.139(e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, we propose to make conforming changes to section 433.138(c), (d), (f), and (g) to reference the proposed
waiver provisions.

III. Regulatory Impact Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612), we prepare and publish an initial
regulatory flexibility analysis for proposed regulations unless the Secretary certifies that the regulations
would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the RFA, a small entity is a small business, a nonprofit enterprise, or a government jurisdiction (such as a county
or township) with a population of less than 50,000. These proposed regulations would affect only States and individuals,
which are not considered small entities.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Also, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis for any proposed rule
that may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an analysis
must conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small
rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule would require States to submit a formal waiver request to be relieved of compliance with certain
TPL requirements that are in our regulations when the cost of implementing the regulation's requirement is not cost-effective.
It is extremely difficult to give an exact estimate of the cost savings that would accrue with the implementation of
this regulation. This is largely because the cost of any single TPL data match or other procedure, as well as its relative
effectiveness, varies from State to State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In reviewing the need for this waiver, we recognized that some TPL claims reporting and payment regulations are expressly
required by statute and that these and additional regulatory requirements are a valuable mechanism by which the Medicaid
program has saved and recovered financial resources and that these regulations should be maintained. This waiver
gives credence to valid concerns raised by States regarding the cost-effectiveness of certain portions of the TPL
regulations in certain instances and allows States greater flexibility in managing their Medicaid programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An alternative to these regulatory enhancements would be to force States to comply with all regulations and not allow
for any waiver provisions. In this scenario, States would either comply and lose money or discontinue the inefficient
practice and risk HCFA sanctions through the systems performance review. Clearly, it was not the intent of the Congress
for HCFA to promulgate regulations designed to save the taxpayers money, and then penalize States when the regulations
are found by experience not to be cost-effective. HCFA should not be put in a position of forcing States to comply in
these situations. This is consistent with our response to comments published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 dated February 27, 1987 (52 FR 5971) stating that if HCFA received substantial complaints from State Medicaid agencies
regarding the cost-effectiveness of State workers' compensation or Motor Vehicle Accident File data matches and
diagnosis and trauma code edits, HCFA would reevaluate the data requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that implementation of this waiver would work towards a realistic and cost-effective TPL program. This
change would also provide States with increased control over their individual TPL programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this proposed rule would not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Also, this rule would not have a significant impact on the
operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Therefore, we have not prepared a small rural hospital
analysis, or an initial regulatory flexibility analysis.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 433.138(l) and 433.139(e) of this proposed rule contain information collection requirements that are
subject to OMB approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C 3504,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Reporting burden for the collection of information in sections 433.138(1) and 433.139(e) is estimated to be 8 hours

those paid claims for Medicaid recipients that contain diagnosis codes 800 through 999 International Classification
of Disease, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification, Volume 1 (ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM) inclusive, for the purpose of determining
the legal liability of third parties so that the agency may process claims under the third party liability payment
procedures specified in &sect;433.139(b) through (f). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The agency may exclude code 994.6, Motion Sickness, from the edits required under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

The agency must provide such reports with respect to the data exchanges and trauma code edits set forth in paragraphs
(d)(1) through (d)(4) and paragraph (e) of this section, respectively, as the Secretary prescribes for the purpose
of determining compliance under &sect;433.138 and evaluating the effectiveness of the third party liability identification
system. However, if the State is not meeting the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section because it has been granted
a waiver of those provisions under paragraph (1) of this section, it is not required to provide the reports required
in this paragraph.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Waiver of requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The agency may request initial and continuing waiver of the requirements to determine third party liability found
in paragraphs (c), (d)(4), (d)(5), (e), (f), (g)(1), (g)(2), (g)(3), and (g)(4) of this section if the State determines
the activity to be not cost-effective. An activity would not be cost-effective if the cost of the required activity
exceeds the third party liability recoupment and the required activity accomplishes, at the same or at a higher cost,
the same objective as another activity that is being performed by the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The agency must submit a request for waiver of the requirement in writing to the HCFA regional office. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The request must contain adequate documentation to establish that to meet a requirement specified by the agency
is not cost-effective. Examples of documentation are claims recovery data and a State analysis documenting a cost-effective
alternative that accomplished the same task. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The agency must agree, if a waiver is granted, to notify HCFA of any event that occurs that changes the conditions
upon which the waiver was approved.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) HCFA will review a State's request to have a requirement specified under paragraph (l)(1) of this section waived
and will request additional information from the State, if necessary. HCFA will notify the State of its approval or
disapproval determination within 30 days of receipt of a properly documented request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) HCFA may rescind a waiver at any time that it determines that the agency no longer meets the criteria for approving
the waiver. If the waiver is rescinded, the agency has 6 months from the date of the rescission notice to meet the requirement
that had been waived. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Section 433.139 is amended by revising paragraphs (b), (d)(1), (d)(2), and (e) to read as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;433.139
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Payment of claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 -->
* * * * * 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Probable liability is established at the time claim is filed. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, if: (1) The agency has established the probable existence of third
party liability at the time the claim is filed, the agency must reject the claim and return it to the provider for a determination
of the amount of liability. The establishment of third party liability takes place when the agency receives confirmation
from the provider or a third party resource indicating the extent of third party liability. When the amount of liability
is determined, the agency must then pay the claim to the extent that payment allowed under the agency's payment schedule
exceeds the amount of the third party's payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The agency may pay the full amount allowed under the agency's payment schedule for the claim and then seek reimbursement
from any liable third party to the limit of legal liability if the claim is for labor and delivery and postpartum care.
(Costs associated with the inpatient hospital stay for labor and delivery and postpartum care must be cost-avoided.)

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Recovery of reimbursement. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) If the agency has an approved waiver under paragraph (e) of this section to pay a claim in which the probable existence
of third party liability has been established and then seek reimbursement, the agency must seek recovery of reimbursement
from the third party to the limit of legal liability within 60 days after the end of the month in which payment is made
unless the agency has a waiver of the 60-day requirement under paragraph (e) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, if the agency learns of the existence of a liable third party
after a claim is paid, or benefits become available from a third party after a claim is paid, the agency must seek recovery
of reimbursement within 60 days after the end of the month it learns of the existence of the liable third party or benefits
become available.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Waiver of requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The agency may request initial and continuing waiver of the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1), (d)(1), and (d)(2)
of this section, if it determines that the requirement is not cost-effective. An activity would not be cost-effective
if the cost of the required activity exceeds the third party liability recoupment and the required activity accomplishes,
at the same or at a higher cost, the same objective as another activity that is being performed by the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The agency must submit a request for waiver of the requirement in writing to the HCFA regional office. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The request must contain adequate documentation to establish that to meet a requirement specified by the agency
is not cost-effective. Examples of documentation are costs associated with billing, claims recovery data, and a
State analysis documenting a cost-effective alternative that accomplishes the same task.

Medicare fiscal intermediaries and carriers, that extension of the billing requirement is agreeable to all parties.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Maritime Commission (``FMC'' or ``Commission'') initiated this proceeding by an Advance Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking (``ANPR''), published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 8, 1992, 57 FR 24220. Following comments on the ANPR, the Commission published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
(``Proposed Rule'' or ``NPR'') in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 3, 1992, 57 FR 49665. The NPR stated that the Commission was proposing to amend the definition of the term
``shippers' association,''
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 contained in its service contract and Automated Tariff Filing and Information System (``ATFI'') rules, to indicate
that a group of shippers would be considered a shippers' association if it met certain requirements. In addition,
the proposed definition further clarified the terms ``consolidates'' and ``nonprofit basis'' as used in the subject
definition.

<FOOTNAME>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 3(24) of the Shipping Act of 1984 (``1984 Act''), 46 U.S.C. app. 1702(24), defines a shippers' association
as:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;a group of shippers that consolidates or distributes freight on a nonprofit basis for
the members of the group in order to secure carload, truckload, or other volume rates or service contracts.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission's present service contract and ATFI regulations simply restate the statutory definition. 46 CFR
514.2, 581.1(r).

Cone supports the Proposed Rule because it believes it will enable Cone to move cargo to emerging countries where its
volume alone is not sufficient to justify a service contract. Conagra likewise believes that the Proposed Rule will
make it possible for shippers with complementary traffic to present a carrier with a more attractive traffic profile
than each could present separately. It contends that to the extent such traffic can be handled more efficiently, the
carrier's handling costs will be reduced. Conagra suggests that concerns about the lawfulness of the proposal are
without merit and that it raises no valid antitrust concerns.

HHGFAA notes that presently, non-vessel-operating common carriers (``NVOCCs'') can combine their cargo to achieve
containerload rates. It perceives no reason why these arrangements between NVOCCs should not serve as a basis for
negotiating service contracts without the administrative burden and expense of establishing a formal shippers'
association. Allegedly, an agreement containing terms set forth in the Proposed Rule would meet the 1984 Act's definition
of a shippers' association. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SPI notes that there is no requirement in the 1984 Act that shippers form a separate corporate entity to operate as a
shippers' association and that the Commission has not required shippers' associations to be structured in any particular
manner. It views the Proposed Rule as presenting shippers with a variety of options in forming shippers' associations,
which it argues would be consistent with the policies of the 1984 Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOJ contends that the Proposed Rule simply reflects past Commission policy, and that it is a reasonable interpretation
of legislative intent that is well within the Commission's rulemaking discretion. DOJ believes that the Proposed
Rule is likely to promote efficiency. It suggests that regulatory impediments may be discouraging the formation
of shippers' associations, noting that only one percent of service contracts are with shippers' associations. DOJ
advises that the Proposed Rule will not create substantial antitrust risks for either carriers or shippers. As for
carriers, DOJ notes that their statutory antitrust immunity is determined by compliance with the terms of the 1984
Act and it would not be diminished if shippers were in violation of the law. DOJ explains that the formation and operation
of a shippers' association ordinarily creates no antitrust concerns.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As it did in its comments on the ANPR, NITL favors permitting two or more shippers to enter into a joint service contract,
regardless of whether they are members of a shippers' association. It believes that the Proposed Rule will still inhibit
a large number of small and medium-sized shippers from accessing joint service contracts. NITL claims that two or
more shippers would be required to operate as a de facto shippers' association in order to access a service contract.
NITL further suggests that the standard for ``nonprofit basis'' is unclear and may also inhibit shippers. Lastly,
NITL recommends that the process for memorializing the provisions for apportioning liability and authorizing the
execution of a service contract should be left to the contracting parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AISA finds the Proposed Rule helpful in that it clarifies that ``rate negotiator'' shippers' associations are bona
fide shippers' associations under the 1984 Act, and that they do not require Government review. AISA contends, however,
that Proviso (2) of the Proposed Rule, which requires that shippers' association agreements indicate which parties
have the authority to execute a service contract on behalf of the combination, inadvertently limits the function
of a shippers' association to solely that of negotiating and executing contracts. AISA further claims that Proviso
(3), which requires the agreements to indicate whether liability is apportioned among the combination members,
should be eliminated. AISA is concerned that Proviso (3) will foreclose other valid options for addressing membership
liability and that carriers may use it to impose unilateral membership liability contract terms on shippers' associations.
Lastly, AISA suggests that the clarification of ``consolidates'' be modified to include both ``rate negotiator''
and ``full service'' shippers' associations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FASA contends that the rule should specify a written agreement, and that any such agreement should be signed prior
to negotiation or execution of a service contract. FASA notes that Proviso (3) of the Proposed Rule does not require
that the agreement include an apportionment method but rather indicate only whether liability is apportioned. It
suggests that this may result in simple ``yes'' or ``no'' answers. FASA also believes that the phrase ``profit-making
enterprise'' is misleading and should instead read ``*&blank;*&blank;* is not organized for the purpose of profit.''
Lastly, FASA asserts that NVOCCs should not be eligible to form or join shippers' associations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Import S.A. likewise believes that the requisite agreement forming a shippers' association should be in writing
and concluded prior to and independent of the execution of any service contract. Import S.A. suggests that the term
``nonprofit basis'' could use some clarification. It notes that an association organized on a nonprofit basis may
in fact earn a profit during a particular period. It suggests, therefore, that the words ``it simply requires that
an association itself not be a profit-making enterprise'' be deleted or be amended to state ``it simply requires that
the association be organized on a nonprofit basis.'' Like FASA, Import S.A. also maintains that NVOCCs should be prohibited
from forming or participating in shippers' associations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Nine Conferences contend that the Proposed Rule expands the meaning of ``shippers' association'' beyond the
plain meaning of the 1984 Act and the intent of Congress. They explain that Congress explored many ways to balance the
power of ocean carriers with the interests of small and medium shippers. One approach was antitrust immunity for shippers'
councils, but this was rejected by the House. Another alternative, which arose in the Senate, was the shipper joint
venture. As described by the None Conferences, this would have permitted loose affiliations of shippers, without
any central organization and operating on their own behalf, to obtain service contracts. The conferences suggest
that this concept is very similar to that advanced by the Proposed Rule. Congress is said to have specifically rejected
shipper joint ventures and replaced that proposal, in Conference Committee, with shippers' associations.

The Nine Conferences also point out that the definition of shippers' association refers to a ``group'' of shippers,
and concludes that this contemplates an organization or entity separate and apart from the members, which performs
functions on behalf of members. In contrast, they maintain that, under the proposed definition, there is no requirement
of a group or entity acting on behalf of the members, and consolidation of cargo would be in name only. The Nine Conferences
are of the opinion that under the Proposed Rule, any shipper could force negotiations with a carrier simply by joining
together with another shipper. Allegedly, section 10(b)(13) of the 1984 Act
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 was not intended to extend this far.

The Japan Conferences argue that there is no statutory authority for joint service contracts or for substituting
a mere shippers' agreement for a shippers' association. They contend that the Proposed Rule would weaken and undermine
existing shippers' associations. They submit that Congress, in approving shippers' associations, envisioned
ongoing, reliable shippers' associations subject to the internal discipline of an association. The Japan Conferences
believe that it is currently easy to join bona fide shippers' associations and consequently suggest that there is
no need for any liberalization. The South American/Caribbean Conferences likewise contend that it is not necessary
to clarify that multiple shippers may form or operate a shippers' association, as shippers of all sizes have been doing
so since enactment of the 1984 Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fritz opposes the Proposed Rule because it perceives it as allowing combinations of shippers or joint ventures to
be treated as shippers' associations although they are not. It notes that the definition of ``shipper'' refers to
a person for whose account transportation is provided and concludes therefore that a shippers' association must
act as a single entity. In addition, Fritz expresses concern about the possibility that a ``me-too'' shipper will
be able to access the rate and volume of only one of the combination shippers rather than the entire obligation of the
combination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hanjin suggests that the stated purpose of the Proposed Rule_to permit multiple shippers to enter into joint service
contracts_is beyond the Commission's authority. Hanjin contends that there would essentially be no requirements
for the formation of an association and that one could be formed by a one or two-sentence agreement. Hanjin contends
that the proposal would make enforcement of shipper contract obligations increasingly burdensome for carriers.
Hanjin notes that if the agreement among the members allows for the apportionment of liability, each shipper in effect
has its own minimum volume and the carrier has the burden of enforcing portions of a single contract against different
parties. On the other hand, if a carrier refuses to permit apportionment of liability, Hanjin suggests that it may
be subject to claims of refusing to negotiate.

TWRA contends that the word ``combination'' is vague and substantially more inclusive than ``association,'' a term,
it claims, has distinct legal meaning and consequences. It states that all associations are combinations, but not
all combinations are associations. TWRA advises that both incorporated and unincorporated associations have legal
status, obligations, and rights among the members and also in relation to third parties. A ``combination'' is said
to have no legal definition similar to an association and to create no definitive similar to an association and to create
no definitive rights or obligations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Noting that the Proposed Rule does not require a written document forming a shippers' association, only an ``agreement,''
TWRA takes the position that such an association would have no permanence, structure, or articles of association
to establish control of the association and its nonprofit status. In this regard, TWRA points out that the definition
of ``shippers' association'' is an almost verbatim restatement of a term used in the Interstate Commerce Act for many
years. TWRA advises that the ICC requirements for a shippers' association are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) That there be an association; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) That it consolidate or distribute freight on behalf of its members; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) That it have a formal, continuing structure that shows it is a nonprofit association controlled by its members.

Upon review of the comments in this proceeding and a reevaluation of the concerns that prompted this proposal, the
Commission has concluded that no final rule is warranted. The legal objections to the Proposed Rule have presented
close and difficult questions. These questions need not be resolved at this time, however, because there are practical
and policy concerns that counsel against additional regulations affecting service contract negotiations between
carriers and shippers' associations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated in the Report of Commissioner Ming C. Hsu, the investigative Officer in Fact Finding Investigation No.
20, Service Contract Negotiations with Shippers' Associations and Non-Vessel-Operating Common Carriers, issued
September 21, 1993, the service contract system appears to be working reasonably well as a general matter. In addition,
under the present regulations that merely restate the statutory definition of ``shippers' association,'' shippers
have been able to form shippers' associations without apparent undue difficulties. If such an association meets
the brief statutory definition, it is free to operate unimpeded by any additional regulatory requirements. By contrast,
it appears that the Proposed Rule could create confusion where none presently exists. We note, for example, that even
some of the supporting comments opposed specific provisions of the Proposed Rule on the ground that they might be counterproductive
or unnecessarily burdensome. Discontinuation of this proceeding without imposing regulations will maintain the
status quo in the area of service contract oversight, while allowing the Commission to address specific situations
as they arise on an ad hoc basis. We are, accordingly, discontinuing this proceeding without issuing a final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On August 22, 1991, the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) received a petition from the National Audubon Society,
The Humane Society of the United States, Defenders of Wildlife, Greater Ecosystem Alliance, Friends of the Loomis
Forest, Methrow Valley Forest Watch, Save Chelan Alliance, Lower Columbia Basin Audubon Society, Tonasker Forest
Watch, Pilchuck Audubon Society, North Cascades Audubon Society, and Sierra Club Cascade Chapter to list the North
American lynx of the North Cascades ecosystem of Washington as an endangered species under the emergency provisions
of the Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.), and to designate critical habitat. The Service made a 90-day finding on February 4, 1992, that substantial information
had not been presented to indicate that listing the lynx in the North Cascades may be warranted. Notice of the finding
was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on October 6, 1992 (57 FR 46007).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 10, 1992, the petitioners filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington
in Seattle challenging the not substantial finding made by the Service. The Service agreed to reevaluate its 90-day
finding. On July 1, 1993, the Service found pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(A) of the Act, 16 U.S.C. 1533(b)(3)(A), that
substantial scientific or commercial evidence was not available to indicate that the lynx population in the North
Cascades should be listed as endangered. The notice of that finding was published July 9, 1993 (58 FR 36924). The July
finding supersedes the February finding. The July notice expressed the Service's belief that a rangewide status
review should be conducted. Because of that statement, petitioners and the Service were able to come to an agreement
to settle the pending lawsuit based on a commitment to complete the review by November 15, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has been soliciting information on the status of the lynx since the species first appeared on the September
18, 1985, Animal Notice of Review as a category 2 candidate species. The Service acknowledges that evidence exists
indicating that an in-depth rangewide status review for the lynx, a category 2 candidate species, should be continued.
The Service solicits any information, data, comments, and suggestions from the public, other concerned government
agencies, the scientific community, industry, or other interested parties concerning the biological status of
this species. The Service will complete the status review and publish its finding no later than November 15, 1994.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes to determine the California red-legged frog (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Rana aurora draytonii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) as endangered pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The California red-legged frog is
found primarily in wetlands and streams in coastal drainages of central California. It has been extirpated from 75
percent of its former range. This subspecies is threatened throughout its remaining range by a wide variety of human
impacts, including urban encroachment, construction of reservoirs and water diversions, introduction of exotic
predators and competitors, and stochastic events. This proposed rule, if made final, would extend the Act's protection
to the California red-legged frog. The Service seeks data and comments from the public on this proposed rule.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The California red-legged frog (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Rana aurora draytonii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) is one of two subspecies of the red-legged frog (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Rana aurora
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) found on the Pacific coast. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
R. a. draytonii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 was first described by Baird and Girard in 1852 from specimens collected at or near the city of San Francisco (Storer
1925). The historical range of the California red-legged frog extended from the vicinity of Point Reyes National
Seashore, Marin County, California, coastally and from the vicinity of Redding, Shasta County, California, inland
southward to northwestern Baja California, Mexico (Jennings and Hayes 1985, Hayes and Krempels 1986). The northern
red- legged frog (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Rana aurora aurora
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) ranges from Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, south along the Pacific coast west of the Cascade ranges
to northern California (Del Norte County). Red-legged frogs found in the intervening area (Humboldt to northern
Marin County) between the two subspecies exhibit intergrade characteristics of both 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
R. a. aurora
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
R. a. draytonii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Hayes and Krempels 1986). Systematic relationships between the two subspecies are not completely understood (Hayes
and Miyamoto 1984, Green 1985a, Green 1986, Hayes and Krempels 1986). However, significant morphological and behavioral
differences between the two subspecies suggest that they may actually be two species in secondary contact (Hayes
and Krempels 1986). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Northern Marin County represents the approximate dividing line between 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Rana aurora draytonii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and intergrade populations along the coastal range (M. Jennings, pers. comm., 1993). California red-legged frogs
found in Nevada (Linsdale 1938, Green 1985b) were introduced. This rule would not extend the Act's protection to any

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Rana aurora
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The California red-legged frog is the largest native frog in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
western United States (Wright and Wright 1949), ranging from 4 to 13 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
centimeters (1.5 to 5.1 inches) in length (Stebbins 1985). The abdomen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and hind legs of adults are red; the back is characterized by small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
black flecks and larger irregular dark blotches with indistinct outlines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a brown, gray, olive, or reddish background color. Dorsal spots 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
usually have light centers (Stebbins 1985). Dorsolateral folds are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prominent on the back. Larvae range from 14 to 80 millimeters (mm) (0.6 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to 3.1 inches) in length, and the background color of the body is dark 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brown and yellow with darker spots (Storer 1925). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several morphological and behavioral characteristics differentiate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California red-legged frogs from northern red-legged frogs. Adult 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California red-legged frogs are significantly larger than northern red-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legged frogs by 35 to 40 mm (1.4 to 1.6 inches) (Hayes and Miyamoto 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1984). Dorsal spots of northern red-legged frogs usually lack light 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
centers common to California red-legged frogs (Stebbins 1985), but this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not a strong diagnostic character. California red-legged frogs have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paired vocal sacs and call in air (Hayes and Krempels 1986), whereas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
northern red-legged frogs lack vocal sacs (Hayes and Krempels 1986) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
call underwater (Licht 1969). Female California red-legged frogs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deposit egg masses on emergent vegetation so that the egg mass floats on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the surface of the water (Hayes and Miyamoto 1984). Northern red-legged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frogs also attach their egg masses to emergent vegetation, but the mass 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is submerged (Licht 1969). California red-legged frogs breed from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November to March with earlier breeding records occurring in southern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
localities (Storer 1925). California red-legged frogs found in coastal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drainages are rarely inactive (Jennings et al. 1992), whereas those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found in interior sites may hibernate (Storer 1925). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The California red-legged frog occupies a fairly distinct habitat, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combining both specific aquatic and riparian components (Hayes and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Jennings 1988, Jennings 1988b). The adults require a dense, shrubby or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emergent riparian vegetation closely associated with deep (>0.7 meters) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
still or slow moving water (Jennings et al. 1992). The largest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
densities of California red-legged frogs currently are associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deep-water pools with dense stands of overhanging willows (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Salix
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 spp.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and an intermixed fringe of cattails (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Typha latifolia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (Jennings 1988b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Well-vegetated terrestrial areas within the riparian corridor may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide important sheltering habitat during winter. California red-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legged frogs estivate in small mammal burrows and moist leaf litter up 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to 26 meters (85 feet) from water in dense riparian vegetation (Rathbun 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
et al. 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Egg masses that contain about 2,000 to 5,000 moderate-sized (2.0 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to 2.8 mm (0.08 to 0.11 inches) in diameter), dark reddish brown eggs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are typically attached to vertical emergent vegetation, such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bulrushes (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Scirpus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 spp.) or cattails (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Typha
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 spp.) (Jennings et al. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1992). Eggs hatch in 6 to 14 days (Jennings 1988b). The most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant mortality factor in the pre-hatching stage is water salinity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Jennings et al. 1992). One hundred percent mortality occurs in eggs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposed to salinity levels greater than 4.5 parts per thousand (Jennings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Hayes 1990). Larvae undergo metamorphosis 3.5 to 7 months after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hatching (Storer 1925, Wright and Wright 1949, Jennings and Hayes 1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the various life stages, larvae probably experience the highest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mortality rates, with less than 1 percent of eggs laid reaching 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
metamorphosis (Jennings et al. 1992). Sexual maturity is reached at 3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to 4 years of age (Storer 1925, Jennings and Hayes 1985). California 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
red-legged frogs may live 8 to 10 years (Jennings et al. 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The diet of California red-legged frogs is highly variable. Hayes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Tennant (1985) found invertebrates to be the most common food items. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Vertebrates, such as Pacific tree frogs (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Hyla regilla
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and California 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mice (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Peromyscus californicus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), represented over half of the prey mass 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eaten by larger frogs (Hayes and Tennant 1985). Hayes and Tennant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1985) found juvenile frogs to be active diurnally and nocturnally, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whereas adult frogs were largely nocturnal. Feeding activity probably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurs along the shoreline and on the surface of the water (Hayes and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tennant 1985). Larvae probably eat algae (Jennings et al. 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California red-legged frogs have sustained a 75 percent reduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in their geographic range in California as a result of several factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acting singly or in combination (Jennings et al. 1992). Habitat loss 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and alteration, combined with overexploitation and introduction of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exotic predators, were significant factors in the California red-legged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frog decline in the early to mid 1900s. California red-legged frogs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were extirpated from the Central Valley probably in the 1960s. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Remaining aggregations of California red-legged frogs in the Sierran 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foothills became fragmented and were later eliminated by reservoir 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction, continued expansion of exotic predators, grazing, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drought. The pattern of disappearance of California red-legged frogs in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
southern California is similar to that seen in the Central Valley, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
except that urbanization and its associated roadway, large reservoir 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(exotic predators), and stream channelization projects were the primary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors causing population declines.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At present, California red-legged frogs are known to occur in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about 190 streams or drainages from 15 counties in central and southern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California. Monterey, San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara Counties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support the greatest amount of currently occupied habitat. The most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
secure aggregations of California red-legged frogs are found in aquatic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sites that support substantial riparian and aquatic vegetation and lack 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exotic predators (e.g., bullfrogs, mosquitofish, largemouth and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smallmouth bass). The majority of aggregations are threatened, however, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by expansion of exotic predators, proposed residential development, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water storage projects, and other factors. For example, within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Central Valley hydrographic basin, only six drainages, all on the Coast 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
range slope of the San Joaquin Valley, are known or likely to support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California red-legged frogs, compared to over 60 historic locality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records for this basin. Two of these drainages, known to support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant numbers of California red-legged frogs, are sites of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed large reservoir projects. Also, in southern California, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California red-legged frogs are known from only 4 locations south of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tehachapi Mountains, compared to over 80 historic locality records for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this region. Only three areas currently support more than 350 adults.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 29, 1992, the Service received a petition from Drs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mark R. Jennings, Marc P. Hayes, and Dan C. Holland to list the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California red-legged frog (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Rana aurora draytonii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The petition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified endangered or threatened status by distinct drainages 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(watersheds) within the range of the species. On October 5, 1992, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service published a 90-day petition finding (57 FR 45761) that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial information had been presented indicating the requested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action may be warranted. Public comments were requested on the status 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this species. The California red-legged frog had been included as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Category 1 candidate species in the Service's November 21, 1991, Animal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice of Review (56 FR 58804). Category 1 candidates are species for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the Service has substantial information on biological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vulnerability and threat to support proposals to list them as endangered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or threatened. On July 19, 1993, the Service published a 12-month 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finding on the petitioned action (58 FR 38553). This finding indicated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that listing of the California red-legged frog was warranted and that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule would be published promptly.

These observations and data provided by the petitioners indicate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the California red-legged frog has sustained a 75 percent reduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in its geographic range in California. Large aggregations of greater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 350 adults currently are known from only three areas: Pescadero 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Marsh Natural Preserve in coastal San Mateo County, Point Reyes National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seashore in Marin County, and canals west of San Francisco International 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airport in the San Francisco Bay area (Jennings et al. 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Habitat loss and alteration are primary factors that have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negatively affected the California red-legged frog throughout its range. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Central Valley of California, over 90 percent of historic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wetlands have been diked, drained, or filled primarily for agricultural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development and secondarily for urban development (U.S. Fish and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wildlife Service 1978). Much of the wetland habitat lost, such as in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the San Joaquin Valley, was prime habitat for the California red-legged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frog (Jennings and Hayes 1984). Wetland alterations, including stream 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
channelization, clearing of vegetation, and water diversions that often 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accompanied agricultural development, rendered remaining aquatic sites 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unsuitable for California red-legged frogs. As a result, California 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
red-legged frogs on the floor of the Central Valley were eliminated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
probably sometime before 1960 (Jennings et al. 1992). Remaining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aggregations in drainages around the Central Valley became isolated and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fragmented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Historically, urbanization with its associated roadway, stream 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
channelization, and large reservoir construction projects also has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significantly altered or eliminated California red-legged frog habitat, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the greatest impact occurring in southern California. South of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tehachapi Mountains in southern California, the California red-legged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frog remains at only 4 of over 80 sites where it was found historically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Jennings et al. 1992). No California red-legged frogs were found 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during amphibian surveys in 1993 in Cleveland National Forest in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
southern California (J. Stephenson, pers. comm., 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Urbanization poses a significant threat to the California red-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legged frog. On the central California coast and south San Francisco 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bay area, the Service is aware of numerous proposed residential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developments that would degrade known California red-legged frog habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either directly through on-site degradation of the stream environment or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indirectly through instream flow reductions to accommodate new urban 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
growth (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service unpubl. data). These projects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include the East County Area Plan in Alameda County, which involves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development of up to 52,000 acres, and projects currently proposed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Ruby Hills/Arroyo Del Valle watershed and south Livermore Valley; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reservoir Canyon ponds in Santa Clara County; Alamo, Shadow, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Brookside Creeks in Contra Costa County; Potrero, San Clemente, and San 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Jose Creeks and the Carmel River in Monterey County; and the Santa Ynez 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
River in Santa Barbara County. In San Luis Obispo County, one of three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
counties with numerous drainages supporting California red-legged frogs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed residential and/or recreational development adjacent to San 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Simeon, Santa Rosa, San Juan, Chorro, and Cambria Meadows Creeks and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estrella and Salinas Rivers would degrade or eliminate California red- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legged frog habitat. Updates to area plans for the North Coast, San 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Luis Obispo, and Paso Robles/Atascadero areas in San Luis Obispo County 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
propose rezoning of over 240,000 acres primarily for urban development. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Between the cities of Ventura and San Luis Obispo, development already 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has eliminated California red-legged frogs from at least eight drainages 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
along the coast (Galen B. Rathbun and Mark R. Jennings, U.S. Fish and

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Historic water projects, which accompanied urban and agricultural growth, also had a negative effect on California
red-legged frogs. Construction of reservoirs, such as Lake Oroville, Whiskeytown Reservoir, Don Pedro Reservoir,
Lake Berryessa, San Luis Reservoir, Lake Silverwood, Lake Piru, Pyramid Lake, and Lower Otay Lake, directly eliminated
California red-legged frog habitat or fragmented remaining aggregations (Jennings et al. 1992). Reservoirs also
typically are stocked with exotic species of fish and the introduced bullfrog (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Rana catesbeiana
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). These species often expand into previously isolated California red-legged frog habitat. The timing and duration
of water releases from reservoirs, particularly on the central California coast, can render a stream unsuitable
for California red-legged frog production (M. Jennings, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., 1993) or maintain aggregations of exotic predators in downstream areas that would normally be dry in summer (S.
Sweet, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., 1993). Hayes and Jennings (1988) found that California red-legged frogs generally were extirpated from a drainage
1 to 5 years after filling of a reservoir. See Factor C below for further discussion of exotic predators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A variety of proposed water projects threaten remaining California red-legged frog populations. Construction
of major reservoirs is proposed on Los Banos Creek (Merced County), with Orestimba Creek (Stanislaus County) as an
alternative reservoir site (California Department of Water Resources and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation 1990),
and on Kellogg Creek (Contra Costa County) (Contra Costa Water District 1993). These sites represent three of six
sites remaining in the Central Valley hydrographic basin with known or potential aggregations of California red-legged
frogs. On the Salinas River on the central coast, raising the height of Salinas Dam (Santa Margarita Lake) is proposed
in San Luis Obispo County. Reservoir construction at this site may allow exotic predators access to formerly secure
aggregations of California red-legged frogs isolated in upper portions of the watershed (L. Hunt, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., 1993). Other large reservoir projects proposed in California red-legged frog habitat include the Upper Nacimiento
River Project and Arroyo Seco Dam Project in Monterey County. In Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties, proposed dams
on the Santa Ynez River, Sisquoc River, and Sespe Creek also would eliminate or degrade California red-legged frog
habitat (S. Sweet, pers. comm., 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed or existing water diversions, well development, or small reservoir construction projects to supply residential
uses on the central coast (e.g., San Simeon, Santa Rosa, Van Gordon, Villa, San Luis Obispo, Chorro, Pico, and Little
Pico Creeks, Arroyo del Puerta, and Arroyo Laguna in San Luis Obispo County; the Carmel and Salinas River drainage
basins in Monterey County; Canada de Refugio in Santa Barbara County) reduce instream flows and, when combined with
drought, degrade or eliminate riparian habitat and create stressful conditions for California red-legged frogs.
See Factor E below for additional discussion of the effects of drought. Small reservoirs also serve as a source of exotic
fishes and bullfrogs (G. Rathbun and M. Jennings, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1993). The proposed coastal branch of the State Water Project likely would result in a number of adverse effects to
California red-legged frogs in many of the 24 areas receiving State water, including (1) altered water regimes in
existing and any proposed delivery facilities of individual water districts, (2) spills, leaks, malfunctions,
and operational errors that lead to introduction of exotic predators into isolated stream segments currently occupied
by California red-legged frogs, and (3) indirect effects associated with expanded urbanization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Storm damage repair and flood control maintenance of streams is a widespread and ongoing threat to California red-legged
frogs. Routine flood control maintenance includes vegetation removal, herbicide spraying, shaping of banks to
control erosion, and desilting of the creek. All of these activities degrade California red-legged frog habitat.
In San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara Counties, maintenance work is planned for 14 and 11 drainages, respectively.
All 25 drainages are known to be inhabited by California red-legged frogs. In Santa Barbara County, a larger channel
maintenance project is proposed for a 4.5-mile stretch of the Santa Ynez River near Lompoc and a 10-mile segment of
San Antonio Creek, both of which support California red-legged frog habitat. Channel maintenance at San Francisco
International Airport threatens one of the three largest remaining aggregations of this subspecies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regular road maintenance activities involving grading in or adjacent to California red-legged frog habitat can
result in increased siltation in the stream. If this siltation occurs during the breeding season, asphyxiation of
eggs and small California red-legged frog larvae can result. On the upper Santa Ynez River and Sespe Creek in Los Padres
National Forest, Sweet (pers. comm., 1993) observed California red-legged frog egg masses smothered with silt.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Livestock grazing is another form of habitat alteration that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contributing to declines in the California red-legged frog. Jennings et 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
al. (1992) found livestock grazing to occur at all known historic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
locations of the California red-legged frog in the Central Valley 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hydrographic basin. Livestock grazing also has been implicated as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contributing factor in the decline and disappearance of California red-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legged frogs from the lower Salinas River (L. Hunt, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1993) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the San Francisco peninsula (S. Barry, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1992). Two remaining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aggregations of California red-legged frogs in the Central Valley 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hydrographic basin (Corral Hollow Ecological Reserve and Frank Raines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regional Park) are threatened by sedimentation of aquatic habitats 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either directly or indirectly caused by livestock grazing and off-road 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle use (Jennings et al. 1992). Rathbun (pers. comm., 1993) reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that grazing is adversely altering California red-legged frog habitat on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pico, Van Gordon, San Simeon, Santa Rosa, Cambria Meadows, and Cayucos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Creeks in San Luis Obispo County. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Numerous studies, summarized in Behnke and Raleigh (1978) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Kauffman and Krueger (1984), have shown that livestock grazing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negatively affects riparian habitat. Cattle have a disproportionately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater adverse affect on riparian and other wetland habitats because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they tend to concentrate in these areas, particularly during the dry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
season (Marlow and Pogacnik 1985). Cattle trample and eat emergent and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
riparian vegetation, often eliminating or severely reducing plant cover 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Gunderson 1968, Duff 1979). Loss of riparian vegetation results in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased water temperatures (Van Velson 1979), which encourage bullfrog 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reproduction (bullfrogs are a predator and competitor of California 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
red-legged frogs). Riparian vegetation loss due to cattle grazing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes the loss of willows (Duff 1979), which are associated with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
highest densities of California red-legged frogs (Jennings 1988b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cattle grazing also results in increased erosion in the watershed (Lusby 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1970, Winegar 1977), which results in the sedimentation of deep pools 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Gunderson 1968) used by California red-legged frogs and adversely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affects aquatic invertebrates (Cordone and Kelley 1961), which are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
common prey items of California red-legged frogs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Off-road vehicle use adversely affects California red-legged frogs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in ways similar to livestock grazing. Off-road vehicles damage riparian 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vegetation and increase siltation in pools. Off-road vehicles also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disturb the water in stream channels and may crush eggs, larvae, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
juveniles or adults. California red-legged frogs were eliminated either 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all or in part by off-road vehicle activities at the Mojave River above 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hesperia, at Rincon Station on the San Gabriel River, and at Piru Creek 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above Pyramid Lake (M. Jennings, pers. comm., 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Timber harvest threatens California red-legged frogs through loss 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of riparian vegetation, which is needed for cover and water temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation, and increased erosion in the watershed, which fills pools 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with sediment and smothers egg masses. In Santa Cruz County, timber 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harvest is proposed adjacent to Adams Creek (Celia Scott, private 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
citizen, pers. comm., 1993), 1 of 12 remaining streams in the county 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that support California red-legged frogs.

. Records of harvesting California red-legged frogs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for food date back to an account by Lockington (1879) of the commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harvest of this species for the San Francisco market. From 1890 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1900, the California red-legged frog supported a significant commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fishery (Smith 1895) with about 80,000 frogs harvested annually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Jennings and Hayes 1984). Counties surrounding San Francisco Bay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided the bulk of the frog harvest in the early to mid 1890s, with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys increasing in importance by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
end of the decade (Chamberlain 1898, Jennings and Hayes 1985). By 1900, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harvest figures for California red-legged frogs fell dramatically, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicating that overharvesting may have occurred. Jennings and Hayes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1985) hypothesized that this rapid decline in the California red-legged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frog population was the result of selective harvesting of the larger 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

probably in response to the dwindling California red-legged frog 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population (Jennings and Hayes 1985).

Prior to 1950, California red-legged frogs were used sporadically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for research in high schools and universities. At present, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California red-legged frog is sold commercially from suppliers located 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outside California in the pet trade. Because the State of California 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prohibits possession of wild California red-legged frogs, frogs sold in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the pet trade presumably are reared in captivity (M. Jennings, pers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comm., 1993). However, California red-legged frogs occur in isolated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and fragmented wetland habitat on private property and are at risk from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vandalism.

. There have been no documented instances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of disease adversely affecting the California red-legged frog. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Few data are available on the effect of native predators on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California red-legged frog. Bitterns (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Botaurus lentiginosus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
crowned night herons (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Nycticorax nycticorax
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) are likely predators of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adult frogs (Jennings and Hayes 1990). Juvenile California red-legged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frogs, which are more active diurnally and less wary than adults, may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more susceptible to predation by diurnal predators, such as the great 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
blue heron (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ardea herodias
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and several species of garter snakes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Thamnophis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 sp.) (Fitch 1940, Fox 1952), including the endangered San 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Francisco garter snake (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Thamnophis sirtalis tetrataenia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (Barry 1978, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wharton et al. 1986). Recent post-metamorphs also may be particularly vulnerable to predation by garter snakes,
as was found in other species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of ranid frogs by Arnold and Wassersug (1978). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Introduced predators of particular concern are the bullfrog, red 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
swamp crayfish (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Procambarus clarkii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and several species of fish, including bass (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Micropterus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ictalurus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lepomis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Gambusia affinis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (Moyle 1973; Hayes and Jennings 1986, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1988). All species were introduced into California in the late 1800s 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and early 1900s, and through range expansions, reintroductions, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transplants have become established throughout most of the state (Riegel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1959, Bury and Luckenbach 1976, Moyle 1976). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several researchers in central California have noted the decline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and eventual disappearance of California red-legged frogs once bullfrogs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
become established at the same site (L. Hunt, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., 1993). Moyle (1973) attributed the disappearance of California red-legged frogs from the San Joaquin Valley 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Sierran foothill region primarily to a combination of bullfrog 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
predation and competition. All sites in the Sierra Nevada mountains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that supported California red-legged frogs in the 1970s now are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inhabited by bullfrogs (M. Jennings, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., 1993). Over 65 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the streams or drainages currently known to support California red-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legged frogs also are inhabited by bullfrogs, either in association with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California red-legged frogs or in other portions of the drainage. Over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the last decade, Jennings (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., 1993) has observed bullfrogs moving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upstream and/or downstream into formerly isolated California red-legged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frog habitat in a number of drainages, including streams in Ventura, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Merced, Stanislaus, and San Mateo 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Counties. Game fish are introduced into drainages by stocking of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reservoirs and ponds, dispersal and colonization, conveyance of project 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water from other streams inhabited by these exotics, and releases by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals. At The Nature Conservancy Santa Rosa Plateau Reserve in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Riverside County (the only site south of the Santa Clara River 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supporting California red-legged frogs), a docent found a school teacher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attempting to introduce bullfrog tadpoles into the preserve in the 1980s 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(M. Jennings,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impossible to eliminate bullfrogs (M. Jennings,

Bullfrogs prey on California red-legged frogs (Twedt 1993; S.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Schwalbe and Rosen 1988). Twedt (1993) documented 4 juvenile red-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legged frogs in the contents of a total of 22 adult bullfrog stomachs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
He also found a subadult bullfrog in one of the adult bullfrog stomachs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this prey item was between the size of an adult male (approximately 55 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
millimeters (2 inches)) and adult female (approximately 70 millimeters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3 inches)) red-legged frog, indicating that bullfrogs also undoubtedly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prey on adult red-legged frogs. Bullfrogs may have a competitive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advantage over red-legged frogs because of their (1) larger size, (2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generalized food habits (Bury and Whelan 1984), (3) extended breeding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
season (Storer 1933), which allows for production of two clutches of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eggs during a breeding season (Emlen 1977), (4) apparent olfactory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rejection of larvae by predatory fish (Kruse and Francis 1977), and (5) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diminished activity periods (Woodward 1983), which also reduces their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure to predators. Bullfrogs also interfere with red-legged frog 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reproduction. Several researchers have noted red-legged frogs in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amplexus (mounted on) with bullfrogs (Jennings and Hayes 1990; Twedt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993; M. Jennings, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

., 1993). However, the extent to which bullfrog predation, competition, and reproductive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interference adversely affects red-legged frogs has not been studied in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the field (Hayes and Jennings 1986). Habitat alterations, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removal of riparian or aquatic vegetation, reduced stream flows, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sedimentation of pools, often provide conditions detrimental to red-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legged frogs but favorable to bullfrogs (Hayes and Jennings 1986; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Jennings, pers. comm., 1993).

Hayes and Jennings (1986, 1988) noted an inverse correlation between the abundance of introduced fish species and
red-legged frogs. Aquatic sites where introduced fishes were abundant rarely had native ranids, and when present,
ranid populations were small. A similar negative correlation was reported by Hunt (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1993) for red-legged frogs in the Salinas River drainage and by Moyle (1973) for the foothill yellow-legged frog (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Rana boylii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Stocking of warm water game fish is often included as a mitigation measure in proposed reservoir projects. Results
of a recent study indicate that, despite their small size, mosquitofish do prey on and incapacitate red-legged frog
tadpoles by eating their fins. This mosquitofish predation may be more significant than predation by bluegill (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lepomis macrochirus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) or bullfrogs (Michael Soul&eacute; and Randy Schmieder, University of California, Santa Cruz, pers. comm., 1993).
Mosquitofish have become established statewide and are stocked routinely by mosquito abatement districts as a control
measure (Moyle 1976). The demonstrated adverse effects and widespread distribution of alien fishes on red-legged
frogs indicate that fish introductions are one of the primary threats to the survival of the species.

The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In 1972, the California Fish and Game Commission amended its sport fishing regulations to prohibit take or possession
of California red-legged frogs (Bury and Stewart 1973). This law, however, provides no protection for habitat of
the California red-legged frog. The California red-legged frog also is classified as a ``Species of Special Concern''
in California (Steinhart 1990). This designation, however, provides no special, legally mandated protection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Clean Water Act (section 404) is the primary Federal law that could provide some protection for aquatic habitats
of the California red-legged frog if the habitats are determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) to be jurisdictional
areas (i.e., waters of the United States). Under section 404, nationwide permits, which undergo minimal public and
agency review, can be issued for projects involving less than 10 acres of wetlands above the headwaters (i.e., streams
with less than 5 cubic feet per second (cfs) mean annual flow) or for isolated waters, unless a listed species may be
adversely affected. Many aggregations of California red-legged frogs occur in isolated wetlands and coastal streams
that may have mean annual flows less than 5 cfs. Individual permits, which are subject to more extensive review, could
be required for projects that have more than minimal impacts to waters of the United States. The Clean Water Act does
not afford any special protection for candidate species. However, if the California red-legged frog is listed, the
Corps would be required by section 7 of the Act to consult and obtain the concurrence of the Service prior to the authorization
of any section 404 permit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal lands, including those of the Forest Service, National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, and Department
of Defense, encompass approximately 10 percent of the current known range of the California red-legged frog. Multiple
land use management, as currently practiced by the Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, and National Park Service,
does not provide long-term protection for the California red-legged frog.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Four consecutive years of drought in California (1986&hyph;1990) severely affected remaining California red-legged
frogs in the Sierra foothills. According to the petitioners, several thousand hours of field surveys have revealed
only one California red-legged frog since 1985 (Jennings et al. 1992). Many sites in intermittent streams that held
California red-legged frogs before the drought were completely dry during field surveys. Sites still holding pools
of water had water levels so low that access by predators was enhanced. Livestock grazing at many sites exacerbated
effects of the drought by limiting or preventing riparian habitat regeneration (Jennings et al. 1992). Jennings
et al. (1992) concluded that California red-legged frogs have been extirpated from the Sierra Nevada foothills or
are extremely rare and vulnerable. Amphibian surveys of Sierran National Forests in 1992 revealed no California
red-legged frogs (David Martin, University of California, Santa Barbara, pers. comm., 1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the central California coast, drought also may play a role in decreased California red-legged frog reproduction
where frogs occur in coastal lagoons. At Pescadero Marsh Natural Preserve, Jennings and Hayes (1990) found that many
dead egg masses in a portion of the marsh likely were killed by excessive (> 4.5 parts per thousand) salinity levels.
High salinities in the marsh were attributed to drought conditions in the watershed. Rathbun et al. (1991) attributed
the absence of California red-legged frogs in lower Santa Rosa Creek and lagoon in San Luis Obispo County to overallocation
of instream flows exacerbated by the drought. Increased salinities were recorded in several other coastal lagoons
during the drought years (C. Swift and K. Worcester, pers. comm. in Jennings et al. 1992). In 1993, Jennings (pers.
comm., 1993) reported the loss of California red-legged frog egg masses from increased salinity in Arroyo Laguna
in San Luis Obispo County. Because significant numbers of California red-legged frogs occur in coastal lagoons on
the central California coast, drought has the potential to severely reduce production of California red-legged
frogs over a significant portion of their remaining range.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reservoirs provide persistent habitat for bullfrogs during drought. Once rains return, bullfrogs recolonize former
habitat as reservoir levels rise. Reservoirs, however, with their steep sides and lack of critical riparian vegetation,
are structurally unsuitable for the California red-legged frog.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Periodic wildfires may adversely affect California red-legged frogs by causing direct mortality, destroying streamside
vegetation, or eliminating vegetation that protects the watershed. The 1991 Lions Fire on upper Sespe Creek in the
Los Padres National Forest destroyed known California red-legged frog habitat (S. Sweet, pers. comm., 1993). Following
the fire, extensive erosion in the watershed also negatively affected California red-legged frogs (S. Sweet, pers.
comm., 1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Extensive flooding has been implicated by Jennings and Hayes (in press) as a significant contributing factor in the
extirpation of the California red-legged frog from desert drainages of southern California. For example, in the
Mojave River drainage, no verifiable records or sightings exist of California red-legged frogs after 1968 (Jennings
and Hayes in press). The disappearance of this species from the drainage coincided with a catastrophic flood event
in the Mojave River in the winter of 1968&hyph;1969.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The high degree of fragmentation of remaining California red-legged frog habitat makes this subspecies especially
vulnerable to random extinction events and to loss of genetic variability. Small population size increases rates
of inbreeding and may allow expression of deleterious recessive genes occurring in the population (known as ``inbreeding
depression''). Loss of genetic variability, through random genetic drift, reduces the ability of small populations
to respond successfully to environmental stresses. In the remaining vestiges of its former habitat and with its potentially
reduced genetic variability, the California red-legged frog is vulnerable to random or stochastic events, such
as fluctuations or variations of annual weather patterns (as discussed above), availability of food, predation
and associated demographic uncertainty, or other environmental stresses. With only three areas currently supporting
over 350 adults, all remaining populations of the species are considered vulnerable to stochastic threats.

The Service carefully has assessed the best scientific and

commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future

threats faced by the California red-legged frog in determining to

propose this rule. Based on this evaluation, the preferred action is to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
list the California red-legged frog (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Rana aurora draytonii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
endangered. This subspecies has been extirpated from 75 percent of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
former range. Seventy-seven percent of remaining aggregations currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are threatened by one or more factors, including (1) introduction of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exotic predators and competitors, (2) urban encroachment, (3) construction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of large and small reservoirs, water diversions and well development, (4)

drainages, with the majority being in Monterey, Santa Barbara, and San

threats. Fragmentation of habitat, however, renders these populations

that designation of critical habitat is not presently prudent for the

would be required in proposing critical habitat, would reveal precise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
locality data and thereby make the species more vulnerable to collection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and acts of vandalism, and increase the difficulties of enforcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Protection of this species' habitat will be addressed in the recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process and through the section 7 consultation process. Therefore, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not now be prudent to determine critical habitat of the California 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
red-legged frog.

Available Conservation Measures

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threatened under the Endangered Species Act include recognition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against certain activities. Recognition through listing encourages and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
groups, and individuals. The Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the States and requires
that recovery actions be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carried out for all listed species. The protection required of Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies and the prohibitions against taking and harm are discussed, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part, below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations implementing this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
402. Section 7(a)(4) of the Act requires Federal agencies to confer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
informally with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the continued existence of a proposed species or result in destruction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat. If a species is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listed subsequently, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must enter into formal consultation with the Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal agencies that may be involved as a result of this proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule are the Bureau of Reclamation, Bureau of Land Management, National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Park Service, Forest Service, and the Departments of the Army, Navy and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Air Force. At several parks, the National Park Service has conducted or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is planning to conduct surveys of California red-legged frogs on park 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
property (Daphne A. Hatch, National Park Service, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1992; Gary Fellers, National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Park Service, pers. comm., 1993). The Forest Service has conducted and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has ongoing amphibian surveys in many National Forests within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
historic range of the California red-legged frog (J. Stephenson, pers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comm., 1993; D. Martin, pers. comm., 1993). The Bureau of Reclamation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is cosponsoring a proposed reservoir construction project (Los Vaqueros 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reservoir) on Kellogg Creek, Contra Costa County (Contra Costa Water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
District 1993). A mitigation and monitoring program is proposed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compensate for California red-legged frog habitat losses. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mitigation plan includes a bullfrog and exotic fish control program to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be carried out for the life of the reservoir project (Contra Costa Water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
District 1993). The potential for success of the mitigation plan is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unknown. The proposed Los Banos Grande reservoir project on Los Banos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Creek in Merced County, also cosponsored by the Bureau of Reclamation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not provide mitigation specifically for the California red-legged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frog (Cay Goude, Fish and Wildlife Service, pers. comm., 1993). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers would be involved through their permitting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority under section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Any of the above 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mentioned Federal agencies would be required to consult with the Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if any action they fund, authorize, or carry out is likely to jeopardize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the continued existence of the California red-legged frog.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 set 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
endangered wildlife. With respect to the California red-legged frog, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the jurisdiction of the United States to take (including harass, harm, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, collect, or attempt any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such conduct), import or export, transport in interstate or foreign 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commerce in the course of commercial activity, or sell or offer for sale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in interstate or foreign commerce any listed species. It also is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
illegal to possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, or ship any such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wildlife that has been taken illegally. Certain exceptions apply to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agents of the Service and State conservation agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involving endangered and threatened wildlife species under certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances. Regulations governing permits are at 50 CFR 17.22 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17.23. Such permits are available for scientific purposes, to enhance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the propagation or survival of the species, and/or for incidental take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in connection with otherwise lawful activities. Requests for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information on permits should be addressed to the Assistant Regional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Director, Ecological Services, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 911 NE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service intends that any final action resulting from this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal will be as accurate and as effective as possible. Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments or suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies, the scientific community, industry, or any other interested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
party concerning this proposed rule are hereby solicited. Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particularly are sought concerning: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning any threat (or lack thereof) to the California red-legged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frog; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The location of any additional populations of the California 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
red-legged frog and the reasons why any habitat should or should not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined to be critical habitat as provided by section 4 of the Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Additional information concerning the range, distribution, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and population size of the California red-legged frog; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Any examples of take or vandalism of California red-legged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frogs; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Current or planned activities in the subject area and their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible impacts on the California red-legged frog. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any final decision on this proposal will take into consideration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the comments and any additional information received by the Service, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such communications may lead to a final regulation that differs from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Endangered Species Act provides for a public hearing on this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal, if requested. Requests must be received within 45 days of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date of publication of this proposal in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) requests public comments on a proposed rule to implement Amendment 11 (amendment)
to the Fishery Management Plan for Commercial and Recreational Salmon Fisheries Off the Coasts of Washington, Oregon,
and California (FMP). Amendment 11 would modify the spawning escapement goal for Oregon coastal natural (OCN) coho
salmon and the criteria for establishing and managing subarea allocations for recreational coho salmon harvest
south of Cape Falcon, Oregon (45

&rsquo; N. lat.). The amendment is intended to: (1) Address persistent low OCN coho stock abundance and annual escapement
goals below maximum sustainable yield (MSY); (2) to prevent imbalances in recreational coho harvest allocation
at low allowable harvest levels; and (3) to prevent the frequent use of emergency rulemaking to implement annual management
measures.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The ocean salmon fisheries in the exclusive economic zone of the United States (3 to 200 miles offshore) in the Pacific
Ocean off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California are managed under the FMP. The FMP was developed by the Pacific
Fishery Management Council (Council) under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, 16 U.S.C. 1801

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
(Magnuson Act), and approved by the Secretary in 1978. Since then, the FMP has been amended 10 times, with implementing
regulations codified at 50 CFR part 661. From 1979 to 1983, the FMP was amended annually. In 1984, a framework amendment
was implemented that provided the mechanism for making preseason and inseason adjustments in the regulations without
annual amendments. Amendments to the framework FMP were implemented in 1987, 1988, 1989, and 1991.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council prepared Amendment 11 to the FMP and submitted it to the Secretary for approval under the provisions of
the Magnuson Act. On January 10, 1994, the Secretary began formal review of the amendment. A notice of availability
for Amendment 11 was filed with the Office of the Federal Register on January 14, 1994, announcing a public comment
period on the amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FMP amendment process for Amendment 11 was initiated at the April 6&hyph;9, 1993, Council meeting with the presentation
of several alternative proposals by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) to address OCN coho salmon management
concerns. Council discussions at its September 15&hyph;17, 1993, meeting identified three alternatives, in addition
to the status quo, requiring further analyses. A draft amendment was prepared and distributed to interested persons
for review in October 1993. Comments were invited, and public hearings were held November 8&hyph;10, 1993, in Tillamook
and Coos Bay, Oregon, and Eureka, California (58 FR 57978, October 28, 1993). During the public hearings, the ODFW
and the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) presented for Council consideration a joint recommendation
regarding recreational allocation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering the comments received on the draft amendment at the public hearing and Council meetings, and from
its Salmon Technical Team, Salmon Advisory Subpanel, and Scientific and Statistical Committee, the Council, at
its November 17&hyph;19, 1993, meeting, selected the preferred alternative, which is based on the joint recommendation
by the ODFW and CDFG. The Council's recommendation is a modification of the alternatives described in the draft amendment
for public review and falls within the scope of those alternatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of Amendment 11 is to modify the spawning escapement goal for OCN coho salmon, and the criteria for establishing
and managing, when harvest levels are low, subarea allocations for recreational coho salmon harvest south of Cape
Falcon, Oregon. The OCN coho stock is composed of naturally produced coho salmon from Oregon coastal streams. OCN
coho are important contributors to the ocean salmon harvest, as the stock aggregate constitutes the largest component
of naturally produced coho caught in ocean salmon fisheries off Oregon and California. In any given year, OCN coho
stock numbers are used to set the allowable coho harvest rate for combined natural and hatchery production for the
area south of Cape Falcon.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Spawning Escapement Goal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to 1987, the OCN coho spawning escapement goal was 200,000 adults, the MSY spawning escapement level determined
by the ODFW. The current method of determining the OCN coho spawning escapement goal and harvest rate was adopted by
the Council in 1986 and implemented by Amendment 7 to the FMP beginning in 1987. Amendment 7 established an OCN spawning
escapement goal floor of 135,000 coho for estimated ocean abundances of up to 270,000 coho. the spawning escapement
goal changes to 50 percent of the ocean abundance (50 percent harvest rate) for ocean abundances between 270,000 and
400,000 coho, and is capped at 200,000 coho for ocean abundances above 400,000 coho.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendment 7 was intended to allow some additional harvest in years when unusual conditions such as the 1983 El Ni&ntilde;o
might temporarily reduce stock abundance below 400,000 coho. The analysis supporting Amendment 7 indicated that
implementing the amendment would provide increased economic benefits with a low likelihood that occasionally allowing
the spawning escapement to drop to the floor level of 135,000 would jeopardize the continued productivity of the OCN
stock.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The analysis supporting deviations from the fixed 200,000 spawning escapement goal at low stock sizes assumed that
such deviations would occur infrequently. However, since 1985 the annual spawning escapement goal has been set below
the 200,000 MSY level 50 percent of the time, and since 1979 the actual spawning escapement has met or exceeded 200,000
coho in only a single year, 1984. During this same period, the post-season estimates of total OCN stock size have not
exceeded 360,000 coho salmon, compared to the 700,000 stock size that is believed to represent the MSY level. The reasons
for this extended stock depression are not completely understood. Factors contributing to the decline of OCN coho
include widespread and significant degradation of freshwater habitat, an extended period of poor ocean survival,
and overestimation of stock abundance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The methodology for predicting the ocean abundance of OCN coho south of Cape Falcon has had mixed results since 1984.
Despite a rigorous technical review of the OCN predictor by the Council in 1987, the predictor has consistently and
significantly overestimated preseason abundance since its adoption in 1988. As a result, the formula in the FMP for
calculating the spawning escapement goal and associated ocean harvest rate for OCN coho has resulted in overharvest
and spawning escapement falling short of its goal for the past 6 years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In April 1991, the Council established an overfishing work group to review the status of OCN coho. This assessment
was completed in February 1992 and included a review of the stock abundance predictor. While the current methodology
was under review, the Council was not able to implement a new methodology that was more reliable than the current predictor
for estimating ocean abundance. To compensate for the overestimation bias in the current predictor, the Council
relied on emergency regulations in 1991, 1992, and 1993 to reduce the ocean harvest rate on OCN coho from the levels
set in Amendment 7, thus allowing additional natural spawners to escape the ocean fisheries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendment 11 would modify the OCN coho spawning escapement goal so as to achieve an aggregate OCN adult spawning density
of 42 naturally spawning adults per mile in standard index survey areas each year. The standard index survey areas
are 48 different stream sections that have been surveyed by ODFW each year since 1950. Under the current methods used
by ODFW, the number of spawners in the standard index area is extrapolated for 4,764 miles of coastal spawning habitat.
This translates to a numerical spawning escapement goal of 200,000. The original FMP spawning escapement goal of
200,000 was based on this expansion. This number of adult spawners per mile was documented as the estimated MSY spawning
escapement level in an ODFW study of coastal stream spawning escapements and subsequent production from 1950 to 1980.
The ODFW is currently in the fourth year of a 5-year study to confirm the relationship between the number of natural
spawners counted in standard index survey areas and the total OCN coho salmon spawning populations. This study may
provide a better definition of the total OCN coho spawning population when it is completed, and the results may lead
to revisions in the estimated total number of spawners at the MSY level that is calculated by extrapolating from the
42 adults per mile in the standard index survey areas. This type of change would not necessitate any further changes
to the FMP or its implementing regulations. If further studies result in recommended changes to the optimum number
(42) of adult spawners per mile in the standard index survey areas, the FMP will need to be amended or, if the change is
purely technical, the spawning escapement goal may be revised through the framework provided in 50 CFR 661, Appendix
IV.B. At this time, however, Amendment 11 represents the best available science.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendment 11 also states that when OCN coho abundance is forecast to be less than 125 percent of the annual numerical
escapement goal, or below 250,000 fish at the present spawner escapement goal of 200,000 adults, an incidental exploitation
rate of up to 20 percent would be allowed for ocean and freshwater fisheries targeting on non-OCN coho salmon stocks.
Concern was expressed that, when OCN coho abundance forecasts are below 168,750, the proposal for up to a 20 percent
incidental harvest rate could allow OCN coho spawning escapements below the 135,000 fish floor currently contained
in the FMP. In response to this concern, the Council modified the proposal to emphasize that the 20 percent represented
a maximum harvest rate. The Council will evaluate the actual level of incidental harvest of OCN coho that might be expected
to occur in fisheries for chinook salmon and non-OCN coho salmon and will recommend only the minimum incidental harvest
rate necessary to prosecute other fisheries, provided the rate chosen will cause no irreparable harm to the OCN stock.

Recreational Harvest Allocation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Amendment 11 also proposes to modify the subarea allocations for the recreational fishery south of Cape Falcon when
the allowable recreational coho allocation for the entire area is equal to or less than 167,000 fish. This modification
is intended to maintain the historical catch distribution between Oregon and California when stock sizes are at low
levels, so that one geographical area is not disproportionately affected by the harvest reductions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to the northward migration pattern of the affected coho stocks, coho landings occur early in the season off California
and gradually move north into Oregon. Coho landings south of Humbug Mountain, Oregon (42
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; 40
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;30
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; N. lat.), taper off dramatically after July, whereas central Oregon fisheries tend to reach peak coho landings
in July and August with fish available into September. Currently, when the recreational coho quota south of Cape Falcon
is reached, the recreational fishery for coho remains open south of Humbug Mountain. In the past, the south of Cape
Falcon coho quota has generally been reached after mid-August; the impacts of allowing the California recreational
fishery to continue have been minor, as the season has been near the end and coho catches are generally very low south
of Humbug Mountain.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the reduction in the coho quotas and overall harvest rates caused by low coho abundance, it is possible that early
fisheries to the south could catch most of the available coho impacts before fish become readily available off central
Oregon, resulting in a shift of the harvest to southern Oregon and California fisheries. An example of such a redistribution
occurred during the 1993 season.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1993, 68,000 coho were available for the recreational fishery south of Cape Falcon. The recreational season off
central Oregon was closed on August 10 with 56 percent of the recreational harvest caught south of Humbug Mountain
and 25 percent occurring south of Horse Mountain, California (40
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; 05
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;00
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; N. lat.). From 1976 to 1992 for comparison, the recreational coho harvest south of Cape Falcon averaged over
200,000 coho and the harvest south of Humbug Mountain averaged 23 percent, with 2 percent occurring south of Horse
Mountain.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To maintain the historical catch distribution given the current low harvest levels, Amendment 11 establishes two
subareas with independent impact quotas to ensure that a large southward shift in the recreational harvest does not
occur. Of the total recreational allocation, the subarea from Cape Falcon to Humbug Mountain, Oregon, receives 70
percent and the subarea south of Humbug Mountain receives 30 percent, with the percentages being based on avoiding
large deviations from historical harvest shares. Except for the area south of Point Arena, California (38
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; 57
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;30
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; N. lat.), the two subareas will be managed for their respective impact quotas, and the recreational fisheries
for coho salmon in each area may be closed upon attainment of the quota. South of Humbug Mountain, there are 2 additional
conditions: (1) An impact guideline of 3 percent of the overall south of Cape Falcon recreational allocation will
be applied from Horse Mountain to Point Arena, California; and (2) the recreational fishery for coho salmon will not
be closed south of Point Arena, even if the fishery between Humbug Mountain and Point Arena is closed, upon projected
attainment of the south of Humbug Mountain impact quota, but the projected harvest through the end of the year will
be included in the south of Humbug Mountain impact quota. Quota transfers between subareas are allowed on a one-for-one
basis, but only if chinook constraints preclude access to coho.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Selection of 167,000 as the trigger for this allocation is based on 2 factors: (1) It represents a low harvest level
at which a southward shift is likely due to the migratory pattern of coho and the timing of normal fishing seasons, and
(2) it is the upper limit of the recreational allocation that is subject to reduction to meet hook-and-release mortality
in the commercial all-salmon-except-coho fishery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of Amendment 11 would require changes to the regulatory language in the appendix to 50 CFR part 661.

Section 304(a)(1)(D) of the Magnuson Act, as amended, requires the Secretary to publish regulations proposed by
a Council within 15 days of receipt of the amendment and regulations. At this time the Secretary has not determined
that the amendment these rules would implement is consistent with the national standards, other provisions of the
Magnuson Act, and other applicable law. The Secretary, in making that determination, will take into account the data,
views, and comments received during the comment period.

This proposed rule, if adopted, will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
for purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The Council prepared a regulatory impact review (RIR) and an initial
regulatory flexibility analysis (IRFA), which are incorporated in the Amendment 11 document and may be obtained
from the Council (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). A summary of the economic impacts evaluated apply to small business entities because this industry consists primarily
of small entities. Under the Council's recommended alternative that eliminates the sliding scale escapement goal,
allowable coho ocean harvests will be reduced in the short term, with the changes in net economic value (NEV) in the
millions of dollars (estimates of ^$1.5 million and ^$3.2 million were made based on landings data for 1990 and 1992,
respectively). Over the long term, some stock rebuilding is expected, resulting in an increase in allowable harvests
and a reduction in the negative effects in any one year. Expression of the spawning escapement goal in terms of a number
of fish per mile in standard index survey areas is expected to reduce administrative costs by allowing the Council
to use the best available information to achieve MSY escapement without emergency regulations or FMP amendments.
At reduced allowable harvest levels for the recreational fishery (under 167,000 coho), the Council's recommended
alternative will maintain harvest shares between central Oregon and areas south of Humbug Mountain close to historic
levels and minimize any controversy resulting from a geographic shift of harvest from northern to southern areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Council prepared an environmental assessment for this amendment that concludes there will be no significant
impact on the human environment as a result of this rule. The environmental assessment has been incorporated in the
Amendment 11 document and may be obtained from the Council (see

The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, has determined that this rule, if implemented, is not like to adversely
affect Snake River sockeye salmon, Snake River spring/summer chinook salmon, Snake River fall chinook salmon or
Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon, species listed under the Endangered Species Act. This rule will generally
apply a more conservative management standard for coho salmon off Oregon and California. Given the integrated management
structure of chinook and coho fisheries, the rule will generally reduce impacts and, therefore, have a beneficial
effect on the currently listed species. In addition, no fishing on these stocks will occur until a section 7 consultation
has been completed governing the annual harvest regime under the FMP.

NMFS has received petitions to list two coho stocks from central California (March 11, 1993), five Oregon stocks (July
21, 1993), and a coastwide petition for all coho salmon (October 20, 1993). In response to the first two petitions,
NMFS published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 announcing its intent to conduct a comprehensive status review to assess all coho stocks in Washington, Oregon, and
California (October 27, 1993, 58 FR 57770). This rule will affect many of the stocks petitioned for listing. However,
because the rule will implement more conservative standards for the management of coho fisheries, NMFS concludes
that it would have a generally beneficial effect on petitioned coho salmon species as well.

(v) When the recreational allocation is at 167,000 fish or less, the total recreational allowable ocean harvest of
coho will be divided between two major subareas with independent impact quotas. The initial allocation will be 70
percent from Cape Falcon to Humbug Mountain and 30 percent south of Humbug Mountain. Coho transfers between the two
impact quotas may be permitted on a one-for-one basis, if chinook constraints preclude access to coho. Horse Mountain
to Point Arena will be managed for an impact guideline of 3 percent of the south of Cape Falcon recreational allocation.
The recreational coho fishery between Humbug Mountain and Point Arena may be closed when it is projected that the harvest
impact between Humbug Mountain and Point Arena, combined with the projected harvest impact that will be taken south
of Point Arena to the end of the season, equals the impact quota for south of Humbug Mountain. The recreational fishery
for coho salmon south of Point Arena will not close upon attainment of the south of Humbug Mountain impact quota.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) (Magnuson Act) requires that a regional fishery management council submit any fishery management plan or plan amendment
it prepares to the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) for review and approval or disapproval. The Magnuson Act also
requires that the Secretary, upon receiving the plan or amendment, must immediately make a preliminary determination
whether the plan or amendment is sufficient to warrant continued review, and publish a notice that the plan or amendment
is available for public review and comment. The Secretary accepted Amendment 7 for formal Secretarial review which
began on January 26, 1994. The Secretary will consider all public comments received during the comment period in deciding
whether to approve the amendment for implementation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Amendment 7 to the FMP was prepared by the Council to address serious concerns about the impact of the expanded longline
fishery on the status of fish stocks, the impact of increased longline catches on other fisheries, and interactions
between longline fishing and protected species such as Hawaiian monk seals and sea turtles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among actions taken by the Council to address these concerns in the past was a request for an emergency rule and completion
and submission of an FMP amendment imposing a moratorium on new entry into the longline fishery based in Hawaii. This
moratorium was implemented in April 1991 and later extended to expire on April 22, 1994 as part of a final rule implementing
Amendment 4 (October 16, 1991, 56 FR 51849). Amendment 7 would replace the moratorium on new entry into the Hawaii-based
longline fishery with a new limited entry program for the Hawaii longline fishery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This amendment addresses a number of concerns that are associated with the prospect of uncontrolled expansion of
the longline fishery. The dramatically increased level of longline fishing harvest from the portion of the exclusive
economic zone (EEZ) around Hawaii and from adjacent high seas could result in overfishing of stocks of Pacific pelagic
management unit species throughout their range, most notably swordfish. Even if stocks are not affected on a stock-wide
basis, the increased catches by U.S. longline vessels could adversely affect other established commercial and recreational
handline and troll fisheries in the EEZ. Further, even if direct catch competition were not occurring, there would
be considerable potential for market competition, both between the longline fleet and the troll and handline fleets
and within the longline fishery itself. Unregulated expansion of the longline fishery could also increases the likelihood
of adverse impacts on threatened and endangered species such as sea turtles which are known to be taken in the longline
fishery.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On the other hand, the restrictions (e.g., limitations on permit transfers and on vessel upgrading) under the moratorium,
in combination with area closures around the Northwestern and main Hawaiian Islands, that were imposed after the
moratorium went into effect, have been adversely affecting a number of people who had qualified for longline permits
under the moratorium. More than a quarter of the eligible fleet was inactive in 1992. In the Council's view, this has
been an unintended negative effect of the management program. Further, restrictions on the longline fishery outside
of the FEZ could have mixed effects on the nation. The United States would benefit if the fishery can expand without
adverse effects on fish stocks, other fisheries, or protected resources and if similar controls are imposed on foreign
fleets. In the absence of similar controls on foreign fleets, restricting the U.S. fleet may disadvantage the United
States in any future negotiations leading to international regulation of longline fisheries and allocations of
fish from the high seas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, this Amendment is intended to improve the administration of the longline fishery. New framework procedures
are proposed to simplify and expedite the implementation of new regulations without a FMP amendment. This is intended
to allow quicker response to new information. There is great uncertainty in the longline fishery, as it is unclear
to what degree the fishery is affecting fish stocks, other fisheries, or protected resources. Of particular concern
is the effect on sea turtles, serveral indigenous species of which are listed as threatened or endangered under the
Endangered Species Act. There are limited framework procedures not in place to address problems concerning main
Hawaiian Island and northwestern Hawaiian Island longline fishing area closures, but other measures have had to
be implemented through plan amendments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Amendment 7, the following persons would be eligible for Hawaii longline limited entry permits: (1) The last
holder of record for any longline vessel limited entry permit under the moratorium_provided the vessel used to land
longline-caught management unit species at least once during the moratorium period; (2) the last holder of record
of a limited entry permit under the moratorium for a vessel less than 40 feet in length; or (3) the last holder of record
of a limited entry permit obtained during the moratorium because that person also held a limited entry permit for the
NWHI crustaceans (lobster) fishery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hawaii longline limited entry permits would be freely transferable between vessel owners. Vessel owners could also
transfer their permits to other vessels owned by them, provided the new vessel is not longer than the longest vessel
which had a longline permit, and made landings, during the moratorium period. The vessel's registered length as recorded
on Certificates of Documentation of the U.S. Coast Guard would be the measure of length used in making determinations
of compliance with this restriction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hawaii longline limited entry permits would be required for longline vessels used to: (i) Fish for pelagic species
in the EEZ around Hawaii; or (ii) land or transship pelagic species shoreward of the outer boundary of the EEZ around
Hawaii. The permits already required by existing regulations at 50 CFR 685.9 would be re-named ``longline general
permits'' and would be required for longline vessels around American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands or
other United States possessions in the Pacific Ocean, that are used to fish for, land, or transship pelagic species.
Holders or Hawaii longline limited entry permits would not need a separate general permit to longline, land, or transship
anywhere in the fishery management area (the waters off Hawaii and all the western pacific territories and possessions),
or adjacent state waters. Receiving vessel permits would be required for vessels shoreward of the outer boundary
of the fishery management area that do not have longline gear on board and that land pelagic species or receive pelagic
species from other vessels. For purposes of 50 CFR part 685, ``land'' means to begin to offload, to arrive in port with
the intention of offloading, or to cause to be offloaded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendment contains framework procedures to allow rapid responses to changing conditions, including biological
concerns for the stocks, economic problems in the fisheries, and potential harm to protected species such as sea turtles.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed regulations to implement this amendment are scheduled to be published within 15 days of this notice.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to amend the final monograph for over-the-counter (OTC) antacid
drug products to require specific indication, warning, and direction statements in the labeling of products containing
sodium bicarbonate as an active ingredient. The new labeling would be required only for oral dosage forms intended
to be dissolved in liquid prior to administration, such as powders and effervescent granules or tablets. As proposed,
no such oral dosage forms containing sodium bicarbonate as an active ingredient would be allowed to make a claim for
``relief of overindulgence in food and drink.'' The proposed warnings would alert consumers to avoid antacid drug
products containing sodium bicarbonate when the stomach is overly full from eating or drinking. The proposed directions
would inform consumers that sodium bicarbonate should be completely dissolved before drinking and that the recommended
dose should not be exceeded. FDA is issuing this notice of proposed rulemaking after receiving reports of gastric
(stomach) rupture following ingestion of sodium bicarbonate to relieve gastrointestinal distress. This proposal
is part of the ongoing review of OTC drug products conducted by FDA.

 of June 4, 1974 (39 FR 19862), FDA issued a final monograph for OTC antacid drug products that established conditions
in part 331 (21 CFR part 331) under which these drug products are generally recognized as safe and effective and not
misbranded. Sodium bicarbonate is listed as a permitted active ingredient in &sect;331.11. Permitted indications
for products containing sodium bicarbonate are in &sect;331.30 and include relief of the symptoms of ``heartburn,''
``sour stomach,'' and/or ``acid indigestion.'' In the

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of August 31, 1982 (47 FR 38481), permitted indications for OTC antacid drug products were changed to the following:
``For the relief of'' (optional, any or all of the following:) ``heartburn,'' ``sour stomach,'' and/or ``acid indigestion''
(which may be followed by the optional statement:) ``and upset stomach associated with'' (optional, as appropriate)
``this symptom'' or ``these symptoms.'' The agency recognized that ``upset stomach'' is a general term used by consumers
to describe symptoms associated with gastric hyperacidity such as acid indigestion, heartburn, or sour stomach
(47 FR 38481 at 38482).

 of November 16, 1988 (53 FR 46204), the agency published the tentative final monograph for OTC internal analgesic,
antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products (internal analgesic tentative final monograph). This proposal permitted
combinations of acetaminophen and any monograph antacid ingredient and combinations of aspirin and any monograph
antacid ingredient (see proposed &sect;343.20(b)(1) and (b)(3) (53 FR 46204 at 46255)). As proposed in &sect;343.60(b)(2)
and (b)(4), indications for these combination products included concurrent antacid and internal analgesic symptoms
(53 FR 46204 at 46258). In the same issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (53 FR 46190), the agency proposed amendments to the final monograph for OTC antacid drug products so that the antacid
and internal analgesic final monographs would be consistent. The agency proposed to revise &sect;331.15(b) to include
antacid/acetaminophen and antacid/aspirin combinations as generally recognized as safe and effective. The agency
also proposed to add a new &sect;331.60 (entitled ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Labeling of permitted combinations of active ingredients
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'') to reflect that the new combinations included in &sect;331.15(b) should use the indications that were proposed
in &sect;343.60(b)(2) and (b)(4) of the internal analgesic tentative final monograph.

 of October 1, 1982 (47 FR 43540), FDA published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC orally administered
drug products for relief of symptoms associated with overindulgence in alcohol and food. The notice included a report
prepared by the Advisory Review Panel on OTC Miscellaneous Internal Drug Products (the Panel). The Panel had reviewed
data on drug products containing antacid, analgesic, and stimulant ingredients in various combinations and recommended
conditions for their safe and effective use. The Panel concluded that the following combinations of Category I ingredients
were safe and effective for use in relief of the symptoms of hangover: (1) Antacids and analgesics, (2) antacids and
stimulants, (3) analgesics and stimulants, and (4) antacids, analgesics, and stimulants. The Panel also classified
two ingredients, bismuth subsalicylate and sodium citrate in solution, in Category I (generally recognized as safe
and effective) for relief of symptoms of upset stomach due to overindulgence in food and drink. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the tentative final monograph for OTC orally administered drug products for relief of symptoms associated with
overindulgence in food and drink, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of December 24, 1991 (56 FR 66742), the agency recognized that the overindulgence rulemaking significantly overlaps
other OTC drug monographs, including antacid (21 CFR part 331), stimulant (21 CFR part 340), and internal analgesic
(proposed 21 CFR part 343). To avoid unnecessary monograph duplication, the agency proposed to amend the final monographs
for OTC antacid and stimulant drug products and to amend the tentative final monograph for OTC internal analgesic
drug products to include conditions for relief of hangover symptoms. Similarly, the agency found that the Panel's
recommended claim for relief of symptoms of upset stomach due to overindulgence in food and drink overlaps claims
in the antacid monograph. Therefore, the agency proposed to amend the final monograph for OTC antacid drug products
to include appropriate conditions for relief of the symptoms of upset stomach due to overindulgence in food and drink.
In a proposed amendment of &sect;331.30 of the antacid final monograph (56 FR 66754 at 66756, December 24, 1991), the
agency proposed to add a claim for the relief of upset stomach due to overindulgence in food and drink for all antacid
ingredients, including sodium bicarbonate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Likewise, in a proposed amendment to the internal analgesic tentative final monograph (56 FR 66762 at 66764, December
24, 1991), the agency proposed to include a claim for relief of symptoms of hangover and a claim for relief of symptoms
of overindulgence in food and drink for internal analgesic/antacid combinations proposed in &sect;343.60(b)(2)
and (b)(4). At that time, the agency was not aware of the number of reports of adverse effects associated with the ingestion
of sodium bicarbonate for the relief of gastrointestinal distress. These adverse effects include the possibility
of stomach rupture and, in rare cases, death. (See discussion in section II of this document.) Based on a review of these
reports of adverse effects, the agency is proposing labeling changes for OTC antacid drug products containing sodium
bicarbonate as an active ingredient in dosage forms that are intended to be dissolved in liquid before administration.
The agency considers these labeling changes necessary for the safe use of these products.

, the agency is also proposing to amend &sect;343.60(b)(2) and (b)(4) of the internal analgesic tentative final monograph
to include labeling indications, warnings, and directions specifically for internal analgesic/antacid combination
products containing sodium bicarbonate as an active ingredient in a dosage form intended to be dissolved in liquid
before administration.

II. Stomach Rupture Associated With Sodium Bicarbonate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After reviewing the literature and the case reports, the agency concludes that the ingestion of sodium bicarbonate
may, under certain circumstances, induce acute gastric dilatation (stretching of the stomach beyond normal dimensions)
and rupture.Sodium bicarbonate reacts with gastric acid to form sodium chloride, water, and carbon dioxide. A rapid
accumulation of carbon dioxide in the stomach may occur if sodium bicarbonate is ingested before it is fully dissolved
(i.e., before all the gas has evolved) (Refs. 1 through 4). In this case, an individual may not have ingested a solution
of sodium bicarbonate, but rather a suspension of sodium bicarbonate, that is, partially dissolved material with
the complete dissolution likely to occur inside the stomach. As long as the effervescent reaction of sodium bicarbonate
continues in the stomach, carbon dioxide is produced. The increased amount of carbon dioxide may induce gastric dilatation.
If the stomach is overly full, such as after ingestion of a large meal, especially with large amounts of liquids, there
is limited space for expansion and a rupture can occur (Refs. 1 through 4).

A. Summary of Literature Case Reports
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1986, Lazebnik, Iellin, and Michowitz (Ref. 5) reviewed eight cases of rupture of the normal stomach following
ingestion of sodium bicarbonate. The cases had been reported from 1926 to 1986. Seven of these cases had previously
been reported individually in the literature (Refs. 6 through 12). Six cases involved overindulgence in food and/or
alcoholic beverages, while in two cases, no meal was ingested. However, in one case where no meal was ingested, the
subject drank an entire bottle of citrate of magnesia prior to ingestion of sodium bicarbonate. Although in most cases
the person took higher than recommended doses of the antacid, in some cases the person took smaller amounts. In some
cases, it is not clear whether the sodium bicarbonate was taken directly without mixing with liquid or was taken as
a solution or suspension. All of the people who experienced gastric rupture in 1963 or earlier died. In the more recent
cases, the people underwent repair of the ruptured stomach. Although serious complications, such as formation of
abscesses, atelectasis, and gastric fistula occurred, in all of the cases occurring after 1963, the people survived.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Brismar, Strandberg, and Wiklund (Ref. 13) reported a case of spontaneous stomach rupture after ingestion of sodium
bicarbonate that took place in Sweden in 1986. A 43-year-old male consumed a large meal consisting of new potatoes,
herring pickled in vinegar, and aerated water. At the end of this meal, the man ingested approximately 30 grams (g)
of sodium bicarbonate. (The report does not describe the method of administration.) Immediately afterwards he experienced
a rapidly increasing sensation of filling, with abdominal distention, very severe abdominal pain, and a sensation
that something had ``burst'' in his abdomen. He was transported to the hospital and was found to have a 5-centimeter
(cm)-long rupture on the posterior aspect of his stomach close to the lesser curvature. The authors state that at the
recommended dose of sodium bicarbonate, corresponding to approximately 1.8 g, only 20 milliliters (mL) of gas is
released within 3 minutes. However, if 8.4 g of sodium bicarbonate is added to the same volume of gastric juice (1,000
mL with a concentration of 100 milliequivalents (meq) per liter (L)), 470 mL of gas will be produced. The ingestion
of 30 g of sodium bicarbonate resulted in enormous gas development with resultant stomach rupture.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1989, Downs and Stonebridge (Ref. 14) reported a case of stomach rupture in Scotland in which a 70-year-old man took
2 teaspoons (12 g) of sodium bicarbonate in water following a large meal. His abdomen rapidly distended, becoming
tense and uncomfortable. He experienced increasing difficulty in breathing and could neither vomit nor belch. This
was followed by a severe, sudden epigastric pain, as though ``something had burst.'' A 6-cm tear on the anterior surface
of the lesser curvature of the stomach had occurred. The authors estimated that the approximate volume of gas produced
from the chemical reaction of 12 g of sodium bicarbonate is 3.4 L, approaching the 4 L estimate necessary to cause stomach
rupture.

B. Summary of Case Reports
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has identified a total of 29 cases of adverse effects associated with the ingestion of sodium bicarbonate
for the relief of gastrointestinal distress. These cases were obtained from a search of the FDA Spontaneous Reporting
System (SRS), a literature review, and voluntary submissions from a manufacturer covering the period from 1926 to
May 1993. Included in this total are 21 cases of stomach rupture. Death occurred in five of these cases. All of these
case reports are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Refs. 15 and 16). The agency's summary of these case reports
follows.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In August 1979 a 52-year-old male ate a large meal and consumed several alcoholic beverages. Shortly after going to
bed, he awakened with indigestion. He then mixed a teaspoon of baking soda with a small amount of water, drank the mixture,
and less than a minute later collapsed in agony because of sudden onset of severe abdominal pain. An exploratory laparotomy
revealed a 6-cm tear in the stomach extending from the gastroesophageal junction down the lesser curvature of the
stomach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the second case report (June 1981), a 31-year-old male ingested a large Mexican meal, felt uncomfortable, put one
dosage (amount unknown) of baking soda in a glass with water, and quickly drank the mixture. He immediately experienced
severe, intense abdominal pain, could neither vomit nor belch, and his abdomen became markedly distended. Exploratory
surgery revealed a 5-cm linear tear along the lesser curvature of the stomach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third case report (April 1982) involved a 56-year-old female who had been on a liquid protein diet for 1 month prior
to her hospitalization. She ate a large dinner accompanied by champagne and bicarbonate of soda. No information was
provided on the amount of the dose or how it was taken. She was admitted to the hospital with acute abdominal pain, and
exploratory laparotomy revealed a 12-cm tear extending from the distal esophagus onto the posterior aspect of the
lesser curvature of the stomach. The size of the gastric tear was so big that it allowed the extrusion of gastric contents
into the peritoneal cavity. It is conceivable that in this case the patient's stomach had been modified and even became
atrophic because of the liquid diet and, thereby, sustained more damage as a consequence of the sodium bicarbonate-induced
distention. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fourth case report (December 1983) involved a 37-year-old male who developed progressive abdominal pain after
dinner. He drank soda with some sodium bicarbonate and then experienced severe chest and back pain, and shock. At laparotomy,
a tear of the stomach just below the gastroesophageal juncture was found. In this case, the ingestion of soda and sodium
bicarbonate may have aggravated the situation because soda is very acidic and produces carbon dioxide in addition
to that produced by the sodium bicarbonate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fifth case report (October 1984) involved a 42-year-old male with a history of slight burning epigastric pain
an hour following heavy meals and exacerbated by strong foods such as onions, cabbages, and spicy foods. On the night
of his admission to the hospital, he had eaten a large meal of hot, spiced chili and then promptly ingested two beers.
He then ingested bicarbonate of soda and experienced a spontaneous onset of abdominal pain. An exploratory laparotomy
revealed a perforation along the lesser curvature of the stomach. Initially, this case appeared to be one of a perforated
gastric or duodenal ulcer, but during the ensuing operation and under subsequent microscopic examination, no ulcer
was found. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The sixth case report (December 1988) describes a 23-year-old male who had increasingly severe abdominal pain with
subsequent vomiting after eating a spaghetti dinner. At some time the subject took sodium bicarbonate, but there
was no information on how much was ingested, whether it was completely dissolved, how much water was taken with it,
or exactly when it was taken. However, on exploratory laparotomy, a 6- to 7-cm linear tear in the lesser curvature of
the stomach was found. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The seventh report (June 1989) involved a 37-year-old male who experienced heartburn, for which he took a bismuth
subsalicylate-containing product. He then developed severe diffuse abdominal pain. On the trip to the emergency
room, he stated that he had eaten a lot of food and had taken some baking soda when the pain became very severe. However,
that statement is the only indication in the medical records that the subject ingested sodium bicarbonate prior to
his injury. Thus, there is some question whether sodium bicarbonate ingestion actually occurred in this case.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The eighth case report (July 1991) involved a 39-year-old male with no previous history of gastrointestinal disease.
He had a large Mexican meal and developed epigastric distress for which he took some sodium bicarbonate. When his sleep
was interrupted by continuing epigastric distress, he arose and took at least 2 tablespoons of sodium bicarbonate.
(This amount is higher than the recommended dose.) Within 2 minutes, he experienced an acute onset of severe epigastric
pain. An exploratory laparotomy revealed a 4-cm perforation on the lesser curvature of the stomach. Neither the surgeon
nor the pathologist could definitely document the presence of an ulcer. However, the patient did have a moderate narrowing
of the pylorus due to mucosal scarring. Because this condition interfered with gastric emptying, it may have contributed
to the reported problem.

C. Additional Data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In December 1990, a probability sample survey was conducted to determine the number of doses of sodium bicarbonate
taken by American adults annually to settle an upset stomach (Ref. 17). In this survey, 20 percent of the U.S. adult
population 18 years of age and older answered affirmatively when asked if they ever use baking soda or bicarbonate
of soda to help settle an upset stomach. Based on an estimated adult population of 186.4 million, the survey indicated
that 37.3 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=8 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 6.5 million adults used sodium bicarbonate for an upset stomach. The average (mean) frequency with which these people
use bicarbonate is 19.7 times during a 1-year period, which indicates that 734.8 million doses of sodium bicarbonate
are taken by American adults annually (S.D. 235.8 million). Further statistical analysis revealed that the median
dose frequency was five times per year per user. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An independent estimate of doses of sodium bicarbonate ingested per year calculated from the weight of consumer baking
soda sold each year and the amount used by consumers for indigestion, as gauged by consumer surveys, was also provided
to the agency (Ref. 18). Although not identical, the number of doses estimated, based on this information, is within
the range of the survey discussed above. Regardless of the method of calculation used, the agency concludes that the
number of doses-per-year of sodium bicarbonate is very large. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency also considers the 21 identified cases of gastric rupture that have occurred in association with sodium
bicarbonate to be a very serious but uncommon event. The agency is proposing changes in the labeling of OTC drug products
containing sodium bicarbonate so that such products can be used safely and the incidence of untoward effects reduced
to the lowest possible levels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Additional Agency Concerns
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the serious adverse reactions described above, the agency has identified several other problems that
could occur when sodium bicarbonate is used as an OTC antacid. These include systemic metabolic alkalosis, occurrence
of milk-alkali syndrome, increased sodium load for certain susceptible individuals, and the overall risk-to-benefit
ratio of sodium bicarbonate as an OTC antacid drug product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sodium bicarbonate is readily absorbed and may produce systemic metabolic alkalosis and/or sodium overload, particularly
if taken in large doses or for a prolonged period of time. Rapid alkalization may precipitate tetany in people having
hypocalcemia and cause cardiotoxicity and paralysis in people having hypokalemia (Refs. 1, 2, 3, and 19 through 24).
These occurrences can be life-threatening medical emergencies. The agency is aware of one death attributed to complications
resulting from severe metabolic alkalosis caused by ingestion of sodium bicarbonate (Ref. 19). In this case, a 45-year-old
man was admitted to an emergency room in alert and stable condition but complaining of burning pain in his arms and legs.
He admitted taking baking soda for epigastric pain over the past several days. Although the total amount consumed
was not ascertained, the man had a half empty 8-ounce box of baking soda in his pocket. Shortly after admission, the
man had a sudden, unexpected cardiopulmonary arrest. During this period, no medications were given (including sodium
bicarbonate). A diagnosis of severe metabolic alkalosis was made after laboratory results revealed a primary elevation
in serum bicarbonate concentration. The man remained comatose and died (due to infectious complications) 14 days
after admission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Large doses or chronic administration of sodium bicarbonate with milk or calcium may lead to an increase in calcium
absorption and may precipitate the milk-alkali syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by hypercalcemia, reduced
secretion of parathyroid hormone, retention of phosphate, precipitation of calcium salts in the kidney, alkalosis,
and renal insufficiency or failure. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, headache, mental confusion, and anorexia.
This may be particularly important in pregnancy where milk or calcium intake is emphasized (Refs. 1, 2, 3, and 25).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each g of sodium bicarbonate contains 12 meq of sodium. This large quantity may cause problems for people who are pregnant,
on low-salt diets, receiving diuretics, or have a tendency toward fluid overload (Ref. 2). Even moderate amounts
of sodium bicarbonate may expand plasma volume, increase blood pressure, and lead to edema (Ref. 1). The final monograph
for OTC antacid drug products limits the daily dosage for sodium to 200 meq for persons up to 60 years old and to 100 meq
for persons 60 years or older. Limitations for bicarbonate ion are also 200 meq for persons up to 60 years old and 100
meq for persons 60 years or older. (See &sect;331.11(b) and (k)(1).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the potential severity of the adverse effects of sodium bicarbonate, the agency is concerned that the risk
to consumers from ingestion of sodium bicarbonate in antacid doses may outweigh the benefit. There are many other
OTC antacid ingredients currently available that do not pose the possibility of such serious side effects. Based
on the concerns discussed above, the agency is considering the need for additional changes and/or additions to the
indications and/or warnings provided for sodium bicarbonate in the antacid monograph (21 CFR part 331). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, the agency has concerns how the presently allowed portion of the indications in &sect;331.30(b) that
mentions ``upset stomach'' may be confusing to consumers in light of the new warning being proposed in this document.
The agency questions whether consumers will be able to recognize that sodium bicarbonate should not be used to relieve
an ``upset stomach'' caused by excessive eating or drinking. The agency invites specific comment on how the indications
for sodium bicarbonate antacid products might be changed and on any of the other issues discussed above or any additional
issues that relate to the safe and effective use of sodium bicarbonate as an OTC antacid drug product. For example,
the agency notes that a major manufacturer of baking soda currently voluntarily labels its product with warnings
similar to those proposed in this document (Ref. 26).

IV. The Agency's Proposal for Revised Labeling for Sodium 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bicarbonate in OTC Antacid Drug Products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The case reports have shown that the ingestion of sodium bicarbonate may cause gastric dilatation and rupture of the
stomach, particularly if the stomach is overly full from food or drink. The reports indicate that this problem occurs
with dosage forms intended to be dissolved in liquid before administration, e.g., powders or effervescent granules
or tablets. In some cases, the person drank a solution or suspension of sodium bicarbonate, while in other cases the
person ingested the sodium bicarbonate in a dry form. The agency is aware of OTC antacid drug products in chewable tablet
dosage form, in which sodium bicarbonate is an inactive ingredient. However, the agency is not aware of any reports
of gastric dilatation and stomach rupture resulting from ingestion of these products. Accordingly, the agency is
proposing to amend &sect;331.30 to include specific indication, warning, and direction statements for all OTC antacid
drug products containing sodium bicarbonate as an active ingredient in dosage forms intended to be dissolved in liquid
before administration. Separate indications are proposed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;331.30(b) for products that either do or do not contain sodium bicarbonate as an active ingredient intended
to be dissolved in liquid before administration. Antacid products containing sodium bicarbonate as an active ingredient
will not be allowed to include a claim for relief of overindulgence in food and drink. In addition, the agency is proposing
that these sodium bicarbonate products bear new warnings and directions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the potential serious health risk involved, the agency is proposing that the new warnings appear after
the header ``STOMACH WARNING.'' Portions of the new warnings must appear in bold print and in capital letters. The
proposed warnings read as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
``To avoid serious injury, do not take until'' (insert product dosage form, e.g., ``tablet,'' ``powder'') ``is completely
dissolved. It is very important not to take this product when overly full from food or drink. [first two sentences in
boldface type and all capital letters] Consult a doctor if severe stomach pain occurs after taking this product.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Additional directions, proposed to appear after the header ``DIRECTIONS,'' read as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
``Dissolve completely in water'' [
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
For effervescent dosage forms add
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
: ``and be sure all bubbling has stopped''] ``before drinking. Do not exceed recommended dose. [second sentence in
boldface type and all capital letters] See Warnings.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has examined the economic consequences of this proposed rulemaking and has determined that it does not
require either a regulatory impact analysis, as specified in Executive Order 12866, or a regulatory flexibility
analysis, as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354). This rulemaking for OTC antacid drug products
containing sodium bicarbonate as an active ingredient is not expected to have an impact on small businesses. The final
rule will impose direct one-time costs associated with changing product labels, but that cost is estimated to be less
than $1 million. Also, there appears to be a limited number of products involved. Further, a major manufacturer of
baking soda currently voluntarily labels its product with statements similar to those proposed in this amendment.
Manufacturers will have 6 months after the date of publication of the final rule in which to implement this relabeling.
However, manufacturers of OTC antacid drug products are encouraged to voluntarily implement this labeling as of
the date of publication of this proposal, subject to the possibility that FDA may change the wording as a result of comments
filed in response to this proposal. Because FDA is encouraging the proposed labeling changes to be used on a voluntary
basis at this time, the agency advises that manufacturers will be given ample time after publication of a final rule
to use up any labeling implemented in conformance with this proposal. The impact of the proposed rule, if implemented,
appears to be minimal. Therefore, the agency concludes that the proposed rule is not a major rule as defined in Executive
Order 12866. Further, the agency certifies that this proposed rule, if implemented, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency invites public comment regarding any substantial or significant economic impact that this rulemaking
would have on OTC antacid drug products. Types of impact may include, but are not limited to, costs associated with
relabeling or repackaging. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments regarding the impact of this rulemaking on OTC antacid drug products should be accompanied by appropriate
documentation. The agency will evaluate any comments and supporting data that are received and will reassess the
economic impact of this rulemaking in the preamble to the final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons may, on or before April 4, 1994, submit written comments on the proposed regulation and the agency's
economic impact determination to the Dockets Management Branch (address above). Three copies of all comments are
to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments should be identified with the docket number
found in brackets in the heading of this document and may be accompanied by a supporting memorandum or brief. Received
comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking amending the tentative final monograph
for over-the-counter (OTC) internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products. This proposal affects
combinations of internal analgesic and antacid ingredients, specifically sodium bicarbonate used as an antacid
active ingredient. As proposed, combination drug products intended to be dissolved in liquid prior to administration,
such as powders and effervescent granules or tablets, would not be allowed to make a claim for ``relief of overindulgence
in food and drink'' or a claim for ``relief of hangover.'' FDA is issuing this notice of proposed rulemaking after receiving
reports of gastric (stomach) rupture following ingestion of sodium bicarbonate to relieve gastrointestinal distress.
This proposal is part of the ongoing review of OTC drug products conducted by FDA.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 16, 1988 (53 FR 46204), the agency published the tentative final monograph for OTC internal analgesic,
antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products (internal analgesic tentative final monograph). This proposal permitted
combinations of acetaminophen and any monograph antacid ingredient and combinations of aspirin and any monograph
antacid ingredient (see proposed &sect;343.20(b)(1) and (b)(3) (53 FR 46204 at 46255)). As proposed in &sect;343.60(b)(2)
and (b)(4), indications for these combination products included concurrent antacid and internal analgesic symptoms
(53 FR 46258). In the same issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (53 FR 46190), the agency proposed amendments to the final monograph for OTC antacid drug products so that the antacid
and internal analgesic final monographs would be consistent. The agency proposed to revise &sect;331.15(b) (21
CFR 331.15(b)) to include antacid/acetaminophen and antacid/aspirin combinations as generally recognized as
safe and effective. The agency also proposed to add a new &sect;331.60 (entitled ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Labeling of permitted combinations of active ingredients
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'') to reflect that the new combinations included in &sect;331.15(b) should use the indications that were proposed
in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;343.60(b)(2) and (b)(4) of the internal analgesic tentative final monograph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of October 1, 1982 (47 FR 43540), FDA published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC orally administered
drug products for relief of symptoms associated with overindulgence in alcohol and food. The notice included a report
prepared by the Advisory Review Panel on OTC Miscellaneous Internal Drug Products (the Panel). The Panel had reviewed
data on drug products containing antacid, analgesic, and stimulant ingredients in various combinations and recommended
conditions for their safe and effective use. The Panel concluded that the following combinations of Category I ingredients
were safe and effective for use in relief of the symptoms of hangover: (1) Antacids and analgesics, (2) antacids and
stimulants, (3) analgesics and stimulants, and (4) antacids, analgesics, and stimulants. The Panel also classified
two ingredients, bismuth subsalicylate and sodium citrate in solution, in Category I (generally recognized as safe
and effective) for relief of symptoms of upset stomach due to overindulgence in food and drink. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the tentative final monograph for OTC orally administered drug products for relief of symptoms associated with
overindulgence in food and drink, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of December 24, 1991 (56 FR 66742), the agency recognized that the overindulgence rulemaking significantly overlaps
other OTC drug monographs, including antacid (21 CFR part 331), stimulant (21 CFR part 340), and internal analgesic
(proposed 21 CFR part 343). To avoid unnecessary monograph duplication, the agency proposed to amend the final monographs
for OTC antacid and stimulant drug products and to amend the tentative final monograph for OTC internal analgesic
drug products to include conditions for relief of hangover symptoms. Similarly, the agency found that the Panel's
recommended claim for relief of symptoms of upset stomach due to overindulgence in food and drink overlaps claims
in the antacid monograph. Therefore, the agency proposed to amend the final monograph for OTC antacid drug products
to include appropriate conditions for relief of the symptoms of upset stomach due to overindulgence in food and drink.
In a proposed amendment of &sect;331.30 of the antacid final monograph (56 FR 66754 at 66756, December 24, 1991), the
agency proposed to add a claim for the relief of upset stomach due to overindulgence in food and drink for all antacid
ingredients, including sodium bicarbonate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Likewise, in a proposed amendment to the internal analgesic tentative final monograph (56 FR 66762 at 66764, December
24, 1991), the agency proposed to include a claim for relief of symptoms of hangover and a claim for relief of symptoms
of overindulgence in food and drink for internal analgesic/antacid combinations proposed in &sect;343.60(b)(2)
and (b)(4). At that time, the agency was not aware of the number of reports of adverse effects associated with ingestion
of sodium bicarbonate for the relief of gastrointestinal distress. These adverse effects include the possibility
of stomach rupture and, in rare cases, death. The agency has identified several other problems that could occur when
sodium bicarbonate is used as an OTC antacid. These include systemic metabolic alkalosis, occurrence of milk-alkali
syndrome, increased sodium load for certain susceptible individuals, and the overall risk-to-benefit ratio of
sodium bicarbonate as an OTC antacid drug product. Stomach rupture and additional agency concerns associated with
sodium bicarbonate, the literature review, and the case reports that demonstrate these adverse effects are discussed
elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in the proposed amendment to the antacid final monograph (part 331). Based on a review of these reports of adverse effects,
the agency is amending the tentative final monograph for OTC internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic
drug products so that it is consistent with proposed changes in the antacid final monograph.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. The Agency's Proposal for Revised Labeling for Sodium 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bicarbonate in OTC Internal Analgesic, Antipyretic, and Antirheumatic Combination Drug Products
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The case reports have shown that the ingestion of sodium bicarbonate may cause gastric dilatation and rupture of the
stomach, particularly if the stomach is overly full from food or drink. The reports indicate that this problem occurs
with dosage forms intended to be dissolved in liquid before administration, such as powders or effervescent granules
or tablets. Accordingly, the agency is proposing separate indications in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;343.60(b) for OTC internal analgesic/antacid combination drug products that either do or do not contain sodium
bicarbonate as an active ingredient intended to be dissolved in liquid before administration. Products containing
sodium bicarbonate intended to be dissolved in liquid before administration will not be allowed to include a claim
for relief of overindulgence in food and drink or relief of hangover. Proposed labeling that specifically addresses
warnings and directions for sodium bicarbonate appears in the amendment to the antacid final monograph, elsewhere
in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A cross-reference to that labeling is proposed in the internal analgesic monograph.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has examined the economic consequences of this proposed rulemaking and has determined that it does not
require either a regulatory impact analysis, as specified in Executive Order 12866, or a regulatory flexibility
analysis, as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354). This rulemaking for OTC internal analgesic/antacid
combination drug products containing sodium bicarbonate as an antacid active ingredient is not expected to have
an impact on small businesses. The final rule will impose direct one-time costs associated with changing product
labels, but that cost is estimated to be less than $1 million. Also, there appears to be a limited number of products
involved. Manufacturers will have 6 months after publication of the final rule in which to implement this relabeling.
However, manufacturers of OTC internal analgesic/antacid combination drug products are encouraged to voluntarily
implement this labeling as of the date of publication of this proposal, subject to the possibility that FDA may change
the wording as a result of comments filed in response to this proposal. Because FDA is encouraging the proposed labeling
changes to be used on a voluntary basis at this time, the agency advises that manufacturers will be given ample time
after publication of the final rule to use up any labeling implemented in conformance with this proposal. The impact
of the proposed rule, if implemented, appears to be minimal. Therefore, the agency concludes that the proposed rule
is not a major rule as defined in Executive Order 12866. Further, the agency certifies that this proposed rule, if implemented,
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined in the Regulatory
Flexibility Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency invites public comment regarding any substantial or significant economic impact that this rulemaking
would have on OTC internal analgesic/antacid combination drug products containing sodium bicarbonate as an antacid
active ingredient. Types of impact may include, but are not limited to, costs associated with relabeling or repackaging.
Comments regarding the impact of this rulemaking on OTC internal analgesic/antacid combination drug products should
be accompanied by appropriate documentation. The agency will evaluate any comments and supporting data that are
received and will reassess the economic impact of this rulemaking in the preamble to the final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons may, on or before April 4, 1994, submit written comments on the proposed regulation and the agency's
economic impact determination to the Dockets Management Branch (address above). Three copies of all comments are
to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document and may be accompanied
by a supporting memorandum or brief. Received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday
through Friday.
