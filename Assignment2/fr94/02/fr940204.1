SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to amend its Electric Vehicle Research and Development Program to provide
new factors for calculating the equivalent petroleum-based fuel economy of electric vehicles. The equivalent petroleum-based
fuel economy value is intended to be used in calculating the corporate average fuel economy pursuant to regulations
prescribed by the Environmental Protection Agency. DOE is required to develop the procedure pursuant to section
503(a)(3) of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act, as amended.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In an effort to conserve energy through improvements in the energy efficiency of motor vehicles, Congress in 1975
passed the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (Pub. L. 94&hyph;163). Title III of the Energy Policy and Conservation
Act amended the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act (15 U.S.C. 1901, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) by mandating fuel economy standards for automobiles produced in, or imported into, the United States. This legislation,
as amended, requires that every manufacturer or importer meet a specified corporate average fuel economy standard
for the fleet of vehicles which the manufacturer produces or imports in any model year. Although electric vehicles
are included under the definition of the term ``automobile'' in the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act,
they do not consume ``fuel'' as defined in the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act. Therefore, calculation
of an electric vehicle manufacturer's corporate average fuel economy is impossible without a petroleum equivalency
factor term. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 7, 1980, the President signed the Chrysler Corporation Loan Guarantee Act of 1979 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;185).
Section 18 of the Chrysler Corporation Loan Guarantee Act of 1979 added a new paragraph (2) to section 13(c) of the Electric
and Hybrid Vehicle Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1976 (Pub. L. 94&hyph;413). Part of the new section
13(c) added subsection (a)(3) to section 503 of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act. That subsection
directs the Secretary of Energy to determine equivalent petroleum-based fuel economy values for various classes
of electric vehicles. The intent of the legislation is to provide an incentive for vehicle manufacturers to produce
electric vehicles by including the expected high equivalent fuel economy of these vehicles in the corporate average
fuel economy calculation and thereby to accelerate the early commercialization of electric vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 18 of the Chrysler Corporation Loan Guarantee Act of 1979 further amended the Electric and Hybrid Vehicle
Research, Development and Demonstration Act of 1976 by adding a new paragraph (3) to section 13(c) which directed
the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation and the Administrator of the Environmental
Protection Agency, to conduct a seven-year evaluation program of the inclusion of electric vehicles in the calculation
of average fuel economy. In May 1980, pursuant to the requirements of section 503(a)(3) of the Motor Vehicle Information
and Cost Savings Act, DOE proposed a method of calculating the equivalent petroleum-based fuel economy of electric
vehicles. The rule was finalized in April 1981. The seven-year evaluation program was completed and the calculation
of the annual petroleum equivalency factors was not extended past 1987. The equivalent petroleum-based fuel economy
equation terms in this rulemaking change the way the electricity generation output, input and relative value factor
terms are calculated. The updated equation incorporates off-peak electric vehicle charging and the relative scarcity
of electricity generation fuel sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrative responsibilities for the corporate average fuel economy program are assigned to the Department
of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency under the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings
Act. The Secretary of Transportation is responsible for prescribing the corporate average fuel economy standard
and enforcing the penalties for failure to meet these standards. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection
Agency is responsible for calculating a manufacturer's corporate average fuel economy value. The Department of
Energy is responsible for developing and promulgating the petroleum equivalency factor, the key component in the
calculation of equivalent petroleum-based fuel economy for electric vehicles.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 503(a)(3) of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act (15 U.S.C. 2003(a)(3)) requires DOE to determine
the equivalent petroleum-based fuel economy values for various classes of electric vehicles, taking into account
the following parameters: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The approximate electric energy efficiency of the vehicles considering the vehicle type, mission, and weight;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The national average electricity generation and transmission efficiencies;

(iii) The need of the Nation to conserve all forms of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
energy, and the relative scarcity and value to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nation of all fuel used to generate electricity; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The specific driving patterns of electric vehicles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as compared with those of petroleum-fueled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 503(a)(3) also provides for revision of such values 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to continued technology development and a strong 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest in the corporate average fuel economy of electric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles from industry, DOE is proposing an updated method 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of calculating the petroleum equivalency factor. Unlike the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current version of 10 CFR part 474 which required annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
updating of the petroleum equivalency factor, the updated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methodology yields a fixed value valid through the year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2004.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE is proposing to revise &sect;474.3 to provide that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test procedure to be used in determining equivalent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petroleum-based fuel economy shall be based on the Society 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Automotive Engineers Electric Vehicle Energy Consumption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Range Test Procedure J1634, effective May 1993. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with 1 CFR part 51, the DOE will incorporate by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference this test procedure for the final rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of the material to be incorporated by reference are

``ADDRESSES''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section of this notice. The Society of Automotive Engineers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Test Procedure J1634 provides standard tests for determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the energy consumption and range of electric vehicles based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the same highway and urban cycles used for gasoline-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
powered vehicles. The tests address electric vehicles only, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and judge performance on the total vehicle system and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
battery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current version of 10 CFR part 474 attempted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
duplicate the Environmental Protection Agency urban driving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cycle. The Environmental Protection Agency urban driving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cycle was based heavily on stop-and-go as opposed to highway 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle usage. Roughly 91 percent of this cycle was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dedicated to stop-and-go testing and nine percent to freeway 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing. The Society of Automotive Engineers J227a driving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pattern closely duplicated the Environmental Protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency urban driving cycle and was used for electric vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing in both the stop-and-go and freeway driving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patterns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE is today proposing that Society of Automotive Engineers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Test Procedure J1634 replace Society of Automotive Engineers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Test Procedure J227a to determine equivalent petroleum-based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel economy. The current version of 10 CFR part 474 was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on the premise that electric vehicles would only be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate for urban use, and therefore excluded use of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate highway test cycle when testing the electric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle. The resultant measurements were typical of stop-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and-go driving with minimal freeway vehicle usage. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, the Society of Automotive Engineers Test Procedure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
J227a has a shorter, repetitive test cycle compared to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Society of Automotive Engineers Test Procedure J1634. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shorter, repetitive test cycle of Test Procedure J227a does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not represent driving conditions for a gasoline-powered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle as well as the test cycle proposed in Society of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Automotive Engineers Test Procedure J1634.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 474.4 describes the steps necessary to calculate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent petroleum-based fuel economy of an electric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle. The rule itself specifies a series of arithmetic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
steps one of which requires the inclusion of a Petroleum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Equivalency Factor. The Petroleum Equivalency Factor is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
single value incorporating the factors ii&hyph;iv specified by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress in the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the determination of the energy efficiency of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electric vehicle as specified in section 503(a)(3)(A)(i) is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a straightforward task based on physical testing, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurement of the remaining parameters listed in section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
503(a)(3)(A) of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Savings Act is subject to less precise quantification. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussion of DOE's consideration of these parameters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
follows and is further documented in ``Electric Vehicles and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Corporate Average Fuel Economy'' and ``Proposed Electric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Vehicle Petroleum Equivalency Factor Equation'' which are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained in Docket No. EE&hyph;RM&hyph;93&hyph;301. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At this time DOE is proposing the Petroleum Equivalency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Factor value to be used through the year 2004. The actual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires that DOE take into account ``the specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
driving patterns of electric vehicles as compared with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those of petroleum-fueled vehicles.'' The driving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pattern factor is the ratio of annual vehicle miles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
travelled for an electric vehicle to that of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petroleum-fueled vehicle. Since there is an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insufficient number of electric vehicles in service for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use as a sample, a factor of 100 percent (1.00) will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used until such time DOE has collected sufficient data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to show otherwise.

2. Electric Transmission Efficiency
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 503(c)(3)(A)(ii) of the Motor Vehicle Information and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cost Savings Act requires DOE to take account of ``the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
national average electrical generation and transmission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiencies.'' Since energy is lost in transmitting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electricity, this factor has a negative effect on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent petroleum-based fuel economy. The national 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average electrical transmission efficiency is 91.5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent and is not expected to change significantly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over the next several years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 503(a)(3) (iii) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) direct DOE to include ``the need *&blank;*&blank;* to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conserve all forms of energy'' and ``specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
driving patterns of electric vehicles as compared 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to petroleum-fueled vehicles'' in equivalent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petroleum-based fuel economy. Accordingly, DOE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered the use of petroleum fueled accessories 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Petroleum Equivalency Factor calculations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This factor is directed exclusively at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heater/defroster installations that are powered by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petroleum fuels and has been assigned a usage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factor (reduction) of approximately ten percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per accessory. This results in three possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accessory factor values_1.00, .900, or .810_corresponding to whether the electric vehicle is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipped with none, one, or two petroleum-powered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accessories respectively.

Factor
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The last term in the Petroleum Equivalency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Factor formula takes account of the remaining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters listed in the Motor Vehicle Information and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cost Savings Act: The national average electricity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generation efficiency and the relative scarcity and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value to the Nation of all fuel used to generate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electricity. The term is the ratio of total output 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electricity generation mix to input electricity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generation, weighed by a relative scarcity factor. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
derivation of values for this term, and therefore, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Petroleum Equivalency Factor, depends on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
availability of data for (1) total electricity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generation, (2) energy sources used in electricity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generation, (3) electricity generation mix, (4) fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source reserves, and (5) consumption of electricity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generation fuel sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 503(a)(3)(A)(ii) of the Motor Vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information and Cost Savings Act requires DOE to take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into account average electricity generation efficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Electricity generation efficiency is defined as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total output electricity generation mix (E
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
total
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
divided by the sum of the input electricity generation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mix (I
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2i
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) values. The updated Petroleum Equivalency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Factor equation includes the effects of off-peak 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electric vehicle charging in its calculation of average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electricity generation efficiency. The input 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electricity generation mix values, based on off-peak 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electric vehicle charging, were multiplied by the ratio 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of electricity generation fuel source (quadrillion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BTUs) output (E
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) to input (I
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
qi
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) values (Table I), to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtain output electricity generation mix values (Table 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Section 503(a)(3)(A)(iii) of the Motor Vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information and Cost Savings Act also requires in part

that ``the relative scarcity and value to the Nation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all fuel used to generate electricity'' be taken into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
account. The Petroleum Equivalency Factor accomplishes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this by multiplying each of the individual input energy

i
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The relative scarcity factor is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
derived by determining the U.S. percent and numeric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
share of the world reserve market (Table III), and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculating the rate at which the U.S. is depleting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each fuel source's reserves. These values are then 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normalized to obtain the relative scarcity value for

6. Alternative Measure of Relative Scarcity and Value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Inherent in the calculation of the petroleum equivalency is a measure of the relative scarcity and value to the Nation
of all electric generation fuels. This proposed rule uses a resource based measure of scarcity and value. It utilizes
the estimated reserves of electric generation fuels and their rate of consumption as an estimate of each fuel's scarcity
and value. Though we are confident of the soundness of this approach, we recognize that there is some support for a measure
of resource scarcity and value based on its market price. The previous rule utilized this approach. It has been suggested
that a BTU adjusted market price of fuel might be a more realistic and measurable reflection of the scarcity and value
of electric generation fuels. Under this approach, long term price projections such as those made by the Energy Information
Administration could be used instead of marginal prices to address the problems associated with frequent updating
of the petroleum equivalency factor to reflect market prices. We seek comments on this alternative market price based
approach as well. Comments are sought on the merits of the market price based approach and its impact on the users of
the petroleum equivalency factor.

A. Environmental Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 7(a) of the Federal Energy Administration Act of 1974 (15 U.S.C. 766(a)), a copy of this notice
was submitted to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency for the Administrator's comments concerning
the impacts of this proposal on the quality of the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rulemaking has been reviewed in accordance with the requirements of the DOE_National Environmental Policy
Act Final Rule as published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 24, 1992. Based on that review, this rulemaking was found to qualify for a categorical exclusion under Appendix
A to subpart D, Item A5 of the Final Rule: Rulemaking (interpreting/amending), no change in environmental effect.
The rulemaking does not change the environmental effect of the current version of 10 CFR part 474.

B. Regulatory Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the January 22, 1993, memorandum on the subject of regulatory review from the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget (58 FR 6074, January 25, 1993), DOE submitted this notice to the Director for appropriate review.
The Director has completed his review. Separately, DOE has determined that there is no need for a regulatory impact
analysis because the rule is not a major rule as that term is defined in section 1(b) of Executive Order 12291.

C. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;345) (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) requires that an agency prepare an
initial regulatory flexibility analysis to be published at the time the proposed rule is published. This requirement
(which appears in section 603) does not apply if the agency certifies that the rule will not, if promulgated, have a
``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE certifies that this action will have little, if any, effect on small business. It is directed at vehicle manufacturers
that will be concerned with a mix of petroleum and electric fueled vehicles in their annual production.

D. Federalism Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685, October 30, 1987) requires that regulations or rules be reviewed for any substantial
direct effects on States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution
of power and responsibilities among various levels of government. If there are sufficient substantial direct effects,
then Executive Order 12612 requires preparation of a federalism assessment to be used in all decisions involved in
promulgating such a regulation or rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE's responsibility with this action and 10 CFR part 474 serve only to provide a method of interpreting 40 CFR part
600 (Fuel Economy of Motor Vehicles) for electric vehicles. The action does not involve any substantial direct effects
on States of other considerations stated in Executive Order 12612. Hence, no federalism assessment is required.

E. ``Takings'' Assessment Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that pursuant to Executive Order 12630 (52 FR 8859, March 18, 1988), this proposed regulation,
if adopted, would not result in any takings which might require compensation under the Fifth Amendment to the United
States Constitution.

F. Review Under Section 32 of the Federal Energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administration Authorization Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 32 of the Federal Energy Administration Act of 1974 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(15 U.S.C. 788) imposes certain requirements when a proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule contains commercial standards or authorizes or requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the use of such standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commercial standards proposed today incorporate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial standards to measure the energy consumption and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
range of electric vehicles. The commercial standards are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Society of Automotive Engineers Electric Vehicle Energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consumption and Range Test Procedure J1634. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE has evaluated the promulgation of these standards in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
light of the public participation criteria of section 32(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is unable to conclude whether development of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these standards fully complied with section 32(b) regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the manner of public participation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, as required by section 32(c), DOE will consult with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Attorney General and the Chairman of the Federal Trade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commission concerning the impact of these standards on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
competition, prior to prescribing final test procedures.

G. Review Under Executive Order 12778 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 2 of Executive Order 12778 instructs each agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to Executive Order 12291 to adhere to certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements in promulgating new regulations and reviewing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing regulations. These requirements, set forth in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections 2(a) and (b)(2), include eliminating drafting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
errors and needless ambiguity, drafting the regulations to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimize litigation, providing clear and certain legal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards for affected conduct, and promoting simplification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and burden reduction. Agencies are also instructed to make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
every reasonable effort to ensure that the regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifies clearly any preemptive effect, effect on existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal law or regulation, and retroactive effect; describes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any administrative proceedings to be available prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
judicial review and any provisions for the exhaustion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such administrative proceedings; and defines key terms. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE certifies that today's proposed rule meets the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of sections 2(a) and (b)(2) of Executive Order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12778.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Farm Credit Administration (FCA), by the FCA Board (Board), publishes for comment proposed regulations that
would require each bank of the Farm Credit System (FCS or System), the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation
(Funding Corporation), and the Farm Credit System Financial Assistance Corporation (Financial Assistance Corporation)
to jointly publish annual and quarterly reports to investors and potential investors in Systemwide debt obligations
and consolidated bank debt obligations of the Farm Credit System (FCS debt obligations). The report to investors
required by the proposed rule would contain Systemwide financial statements, supplemental financial statement
information, and related analyses pertaining to System institutions presented on a combined basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would ensure that timely and accurate Systemwide financial information continues to be disclosed
to investors and the public to assist them in making informed decisions regarding FCS debt obligations and System
institutions. The proposed rule would integrate individual System institutions' disclosure to shareholders with
the Systemwide disclosure to investors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Though not required by existing FCA regulations, System institutions have developed the Farm Credit System Disclosure
Program (System Disclosure Program) and currently publish a ``Report to Investors of the Farm Credit System'' (FCS
Report). Included in the FCS Report are an Information Statement that contains financial data and a general report.
The content of the report to investors that would be required by this proposed rule is similar to that of the Information
Statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations generally parallel the System Disclosure Program, and thus should not impose significant
additional regulatory burdens on System institutions. Further, the proposed rule would not impose any new responsibilities
for financial disclosure on FCS associations. However, it contains one provision that would affect the associations'
engagements with external auditors; i.e., it would provide for direct communication between association external
auditors and System banks regarding questions about associations' financial information that arise in the preparation
of the report to investors.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Farm Credit System institutions jointly publish the FCS Report on an annual basis. The FCS Report includes an Information
Statement and a general report. The Information Statement contains combined financial statements and related analyses
pertaining to all System institutions. The general report contains other information about the System, debt obligations
issued by the System, and the external environments in which the System operates. Except for the quarter that coincides
with the end of the fiscal year, System institutions also jointly publish quarterly Information Statements. In connection
with the sale of debt securities, the Funding Corporation routinely distributes the FCS Report and quarterly Information
Statements to the investment dealers and dealer banks (selling group) that sell FCS debt securities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCA currently has no regulations that specifically govern disclosure of the System financial information contained
in the Information Statement. To prevent any inconsistency with the FCA regulations regarding System institutions'
disclosure to shareholders and accounting and reporting requirements and to delineate the disclosure responsibilities
of System institutions in this area, the FCA proposes regulations for a new part 630, Disclosure to Investors in Systemwide
and Consolidated Bank Debt Obligations of the Farm Credit System. The proposed rule would govern the System's preparation
and reporting of financial information to investors. The authority for the proposed regulations is section 5.17(a)(8)
of the Farm Credit Act of 1971, as amended (1971 Act), 12 U.S.C. 2252(a)(8), which authorizes the FCA to ``Regulate
the preparation by System institutions and the dissemination to stockholders and investors of information on the
financial condition and operations of such institutions.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations generally parallel the System Disclosure Program. They reflect the division of responsibilities
among the institutions participating in the System Disclosure Program, and the disclosures that would be required
are similar to those contained in the Information Statements currently published by the System. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed regulations, the institutions participating in the System Disclosure Program, including each
of the System banks, the Funding Corporation, and the Financial Assistance Corporation,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would continue to share the responsibility for disclosure of Systemwide financial information to investors and
the public. These institutions would be designated as the ``disclosure entities'' under the proposed regulations.
In addition, the Funding Corporation would be responsible for filing the report to investors with the FCA. Although
associations' financial statements are required by 12 CFR part 620, Disclosure to Shareholders, to be combined with
their related banks' financial statements and such combined statements are included in the Information Statement,
associations have no direct role in the System Disclosure Program. Consistent with the existing System Disclosure
Program, the proposed regulations do not affect the current reporting relationship between a bank and its related
associations, and imposes no additional reporting responsibilities on associations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the board of the Funding Corporation is also the board of the Farm Credit System Financial Assistance Corporation
(FAC), FAC's participation in the System Disclosure Program is implied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCA has added requirements designed to improve the disclosure entities' internal controls over Systemwide financial
reporting. Because these proposed requirements are generally compatible with the System Disclosure Program, the
FCA does not believe they will result in significant additional regulatory burden. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, the proposed regulations would (1) require the System to publish a report to investors; (2) delineate
the responsibilities relating to the preparation of the report; (3) reinforce internal controls over the Systemwide
financial disclosure; and (4) establish reporting standards for the report to ensure that relevant information
concerning the combined financial condition and results of operations of the System is disclosed to investors and
potential investors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed regulations, the Funding Corporation would be required to maintain a Farm Credit System Audit
Committee (System Audit Committee) to oversee the Systemwide financial disclosure to investors. Each bank would
also be required to establish or utilize any existing bank audit committee to oversee the bank's financial reporting
to shareholders and the Funding Corporation for disclosure to investors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule also would implement section 514 of the Farm Credit Banks and Associations Safety and Soundness
Act of 1992 (1992 Act) regarding disclosures to investors. Section 514(c)(2) and (d) of the 1992 Act requires the FCA
to review and, if necessary, amend its financial disclosure regulations to ensure that the disclosure of financial
and conflict-of-interest information by System personnel provides investors and potential investors with information
necessary to assist them in making investment decisions regarding FCS debt obligations or System institutions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;630.1 articulates the purpose of the regulations_to require the System to publish annual and quarterly
reports that will provide combined financial information on a Systemwide basis to investors and potential investors
in Systemwide and consolidated bank debt obligations of the System, as well as to other users of the reports. The reports
would contain combined financial statements, supplemental financial statement information, and related information
pertaining to all System institutions as a whole.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 630.2 defines significant terms used in the proposed regulations. The term ``disclosure entities,'' as
defined in proposed &sect;630.2(b), means all banks, the Funding Corporation, and the Financial Assistance Corporation.
Because the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (Farmer Mac) is not liable for any debt or obligation of any
other institutions of the System, for purposes of the proposed regulations, the term ``Farm Credit System'' defined
in proposed &sect;630.2(d) does not include Farmer Mac. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each bank may individually issue notes, bonds, debentures, or other similar obligations under authority of section
4.2(a), (b), and (e) of the 1971 Act. Also, each bank may join with other banks of the System to issue consolidated bank
debt obligations under section 4.2(c) of the 1971 Act or Systemwide debt obligations under section 4.2(d) of the 1971
Act. Under section 4.4 of the 1971 Act, all banks are jointly and severally liable for debt obligations issued under
section 4.2(c) or (d) of the 1971 Act. The proposed regulations use the term ``FCS debt obligations'' (defined in &sect;630.2(e))
to encompass both consolidated bank debt obligations and Systemwide debt obligations.

B. Publishing and Filing the Report to Investors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;630.3 contains general requirements and instructions for publishing and filing annual and quarterly
reports to investors by the disclosure entities. For purposes of subpart A of the proposed regulations, the term ``report
to investors'' or ``report'' refers to both the annual and quarterly reports required by this part unless otherwise
specified. Under proposed &sect;630.3(a), the disclosure entities would be required to jointly publish the report.
Proposed &sect;630.3(b) provides that each report must present combined financial statements and accompanying
footnotes to provide investors with the most meaningful presentation of the combined financial condition and results
of operations pertaining to all System institutions. The proposed regulations define the required combined financial
statements in proposed &sect;630.2(g) as the ``Systemwide combined financial statements.'' Pursuant to proposed
&sect;&sect;630.3(c) and 630.20(l), the Funding Corporation must determine the ``reporting entity''
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 of the Systemwide combined financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

Proposed &sect;630.3(c) through (g) contains general requirements similar to those followed by individual institutions
in preparing and filing disclosures to shareholders under &sect;620.2 of this chapter. Pursuant to proposed &sect;630.3(c),
the disclosure entities would be required to prepare their Systemwide combined financial information for disclosure
to investors in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards prescribed in part 621 of this chapter. This
would ensure comparability between the report to investors prepared pursuant to this proposed rule and the disclosure
to shareholders prepared by individual System institutions pursuant to part 620 of this chapter.

Proposed &sect;630.3(e) would permit the Funding Corporation to present the information required by this part in
any order it deems suitable in the report. Under proposed &sect;630.3(f), the Funding Corporation must disclose
in the report that additional financial information regarding individual banks is contained in the banks' periodic
reports and state where the reports can be obtained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Funding Corporation would be required to file the report to investors with the FCA in the same manner as
individual banks or associations file their periodic reports with the FCA. Proposed &sect;630.3(g) provides that
at least one of the three copies of the report filed with the FCA must be dated and manually signed on behalf of the Funding
Corporation by: (1) The officer(s) designated by the Funding Corporation board to certify the report; (2) the chief
executive officer of the Funding Corporation; and (3) at least one of the members of the Funding Corporation board.
The signers of the report must certify that the report has been prepared in accordance with all applicable statutory
or regulatory requirements and that the information it contains is true, accurate, and complete to the best of his
or her knowledge and belief.

C. Responsibilities for Preparing the Report to Investors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;630.4 delineates responsibilities of the disclosure entities and associations for preparing the
report to investors. All disclosure entities have a role in the preparation of the report to investors, either by supplying
essential financial information or by compiling and combining it into a meaningful Systemwide report. The disclosure
entities thus bear the responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the published report. The associations,
which are not disclosure entities under this part, would be required by proposed &sect;630.4(d) to provide for direct
communication between disclosure entities and association external auditors regarding questions pertinent to
association financial information that arise in the preparation of the report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Responsibilities of the Funding Corporation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;630.4(a) sets forth the responsibilities of the Funding Corporation. The proposed regulations
formalize the Funding Corporation's function in the existing System Disclosure Program by assigning the Funding
Corporation the lead role among disclosure entities in preparing the report to investors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;630.4(a)(1), the Funding Corporation would be required to publish the reports required by
&sect;630.3(a). The annual report to investors must be published within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year.
With the exception of the quarter coinciding with the fiscal yearend, the Funding Corporation would be required to
publish a report covering each quarter within 60 days after quarterend. Within the same time period, pursuant to &sect;630.4(a)(4),
the Funding Corporation must file these reports with the FCA in accordance with &sect;630.3(g). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;630.4(a)(2) would require the Funding Corporation to establish a system of internal controls over
Systemwide financial disclosure to investors. The internal control policies and procedures must be approved by
the System Audit Committee. Under this system of internal controls, the Funding Corporation must: (1) Maintain written
policies and procedures to be carried out by the disclosure entities for preparation of the report to investors; (2)
provide instructions to the disclosure entities regarding the information needed for preparing the report to investors;
(3) provide for the review and verification of information submitted by all other disclosure entities to the Funding
Corporation; and (4) specify procedures for the monitoring of interim disclosures of System institutions and timely
disclosure of any material changes to the most recently published report to investors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As defined in proposed &sect;630.2(f), the ``materiality'' of an event must be determined at each reporting level
in light of the surrounding circumstances under which the reporting is made. Therefore, each bank must submit to the
Funding Corporation all information the bank believes to be material either to the financial statements of the bank
or to the combined financial statements of the bank and its related associations. On receipt of information from all
disclosure entities, the Funding Corporation must in turn make a materiality judgment based on the aggregate effect
of all information received to determine the extent of discussion and analysis to be presented in the report to investors.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;630.4(a)(3), the Funding Corporation would be responsible for collecting the component financial
data and related analysis needed from each disclosure entity to prepare the report to investors. This provision would
authorize the Funding Corporation to collect the information and any supporting data needed from each disclosure
entity to comply with the requirements of proposed subparts B and C. Under the proposed regulations, the Funding Corporation
would obtain associations' financial information through the banks rather than from the associations. This proposed
rule integrates the requirement of part 620 of this chapter that banks prepare combined financial statements with
their related associations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under proposed &sect;630.4(a)(5) and (6), the Funding Corporation would be responsible for supplying copies of
the report to selling group dealers for distribution to investors and potential investors in FCS debt obligations
and also for making the report available for public inspection. The FCA does not intend to impose a complex delivery
system for the report to investors analogous to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act of 1933.
Rather, the proposed regulations recognize that the Funding Corporation and other System institutions currently
use the Information Statement to provide information to the public in connection with the sale of FCS debt securities.
The FCA believes that the information contained in the report is useful to investors and seeks to ensure that the report
is reasonably available to them through selling group dealers and the Funding Corporation and otherwise to the public
upon request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;630.4(a)(7), the Funding Corporation would be required to notify the FCA immediately when
the Funding Corporation believes that it will be unable to publish and file the report within the regulatory deadline
because of the failure of one or more banks to comply with their responsibilities prescribed in proposed &sect;630.4(c).
This provision is designed to allow the FCA, if necessary, to enforce the requirement that the banks provide the information
needed by the Funding Corporation to prepare the report to investors in a timely fashion.

No provision is made for notice as a result of failure of the Financial Assistance Corporation to comply with proposed
&sect;630.5(b) because the board of the Funding Corporation is statutorily designated as the board of the Financial
Assistance Corporation. The board is responsible for providing information about the Financial Assistance Corporation
needed by the Funding Corporation to prepare the report to investors in a timely manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to proposed &sect;630.4(a)(8), the Funding Corporation must prepare a statement to briefly explain the
respective responsibilities of the disclosure entities in Systemwide financial reporting and state that the Funding
Corporation has policies and procedures in place to ensure, to the best of the knowledge and belief of its management
and board, that the information contained in the report is true, accurate, and complete. The statement must be signed
by the Funding Corporation's chief executive officer and chairman of the board. This obligation acknowledges the
Funding Corporation's shared accountability with the banks for the reports as well as its lead role among the disclosure
entities for preparation of the report. For the purpose of preparing the report, if the Funding Corporation needs
specific information contained in the Report of Examination of a bank or an association, proposed &sect;630.4(a)(9)
would authorize the Funding Corporation to request such information from the Chief Examiner of the FCA. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Responsibilities of the Financial Assistance Corporation 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;630.4(b) sets forth the obligation of the Financial Assistance Corporation to provide the Funding
Corporation with the information it requires to prepare the Systemwide combined financial statements. As noted,
because the board of the Funding Corporation is the board of the Financial Assistance Corporation and has the capacity
to control financial reporting of both entities, it is unnecessary to specify the Financial Assistance Corporation's
responsibilities for reporting to the Funding Corporation in the proposed regulations.

3. Responsibilities of Banks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;630.4(c) sets forth the banks' responsibilities for furnishing and updating information to be used
by the Funding Corporation for preparation of the report to investors and would require each bank to provide annual,
quarterly, and other interim financial information to the Funding Corporation in accordance with Funding Corporation
instructions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;630.4(c)(5) would require several certifications from bank management relating to the information
submitted to the Funding Corporation for inclusion in the report to investors. Banks must certify to the Funding Corporation
that all information has been submitted in accordance with the Funding Corporation's instructions; that the information
submitted is prepared in accordance with all applicable statutory and regulatory requirements; and that the information
is true, accurate, and complete. Certifications to the Funding Corporation are to be signed on behalf of the board
of a bank by an officer(s) designated by the bank board and by the chief executive officer. It would be the Funding Corporation's
responsibility to determine the form of the certification to be made by each bank for compliance with the requirements
of proposed &sect;630.4(c)(5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Responsibilities of Associations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed regulations, associations have no direct responsibility for preparation of the report to investors.
The associations' responsibilities for preparing combined financial statements with related banks are governed
by part 620 of this chapter. However, banks must be able to follow up on issues that may arise in connection with association
financial information that banks will be using to prepare their information for submission to the Funding Corporation.
Therefore, proposed &sect;630.4(d) would require each association to provide in the engagement letter with its
external auditor that the external auditor shall notify the association and respond to inquiries of the related bank
pertaining to the preparation of the combined financial data of the association and its related bank. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Prohibition Against Incomplete, Inaccurate, or Misleading Disclosure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;630.5 prohibits incomplete, inaccurate, or misleading disclosure by any of the parties involved
in the preparation of the report to investors. If, in the judgment of the FCA, an incomplete, inaccurate, or misleading
disclosure has been made, the party responsible is obligated under this section to provide correct information to
allow the Funding Corporation to rectify the erroneous disclosure. If a party discovers, prior to publication, that
incomplete, inaccurate, or misleading disclosure has been made, the erroneous disclosure must be corrected before
it is incorporated into the report. If a report containing erroneous disclosure has been published, the Funding Corporation
would be required to take corrective actions as soon as possible to ensure that the reported information presents
a fair and accurate picture of the System's results of operations and financial condition. Other disclosure entities
would be required to furnish the information needed by the Funding Corporation to make the correction. In addition
to corrective actions by System institutions, where appropriate, the FCA may use its enforcement powers under title
V, part C of the 1971 Act to enforce proposed &sect;630.5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Audit Committees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Audit committees are a key component of an institution's corporate governance. Section 630.6(a) is proposed to formalize
the existing System Audit Committee function and should have minimal effect on current operations of the System Audit
Committee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;630.6(a) (1) through (3) would require a System Audit Committee consisting of no fewer than three
members. The System Audit Committee would report to the board of the Funding Corporation. Members selected to serve
on the committee must be independent of management of any disclosure entity and association and must have financial
management expertise sufficient to carry out their oversight role. A person who is an officer or employee of a disclosure
entity or an association would not be considered independent of management. The committee must be given adequate
resources and authorities to discharge its responsibilities, including the ability to consult with the Funding
Corporation's general counsel and outside counsel to discuss legal matters that may have a significant impact on
the Systemwide combined financial statements and related analyses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;630.6(a)(4) prescribes the minimum responsibilities of the System Audit Committee. These responsibilities
would include: (1) Making recommendations on the selection of an independent auditor for audits of Systemwide combined
financial statements; (2) overseeing the Funding Corporation management's preparation of the report to investors;
(3) reviewing the impact of significant accounting and auditing developments and approving accounting policy changes
for the Systemwide combined financial statements; (4) reviewing each report and interim disclosure to investors
prior to its release; and (5) overseeing the internal control system over Systemwide financial reporting for preparation
of reports to investors. Lastly, the names of the System Audit Committee members must be disclosed pursuant to proposed
&sect;630.20(n).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To prepare the Systemwide combined financial statements and related discussions and analyses, the Funding Corporation
relies on financial data and narratives furnished by the banks. To provide further assurance that the banks' submissions
to the Funding Corporation are accurate and complete, proposed &sect;630.6(b) would require that each bank establish
and maintain a bank audit committee to oversee the internal controls over the bank's accounting and financial reporting.
The proposed requirements of composition, membership qualifications, and responsibilities of the bank audit committee
are similar to those of the System Audit Committee described above. A System bank whose audit committee is comprised
of members of the entire board would meet the composition requirement of proposed &sect;630.6(b)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since most System banks have performed this oversight function either through a subcommittee of the board or through
the full board acting as an audit committee, the FCA does not view proposed &sect;630.6(b) as a burdensome requirement.
The audit committee requirement is consistent with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of
1991 (FDICIA), which imposes a similar requirement on insured depository institutions with total assets of $500
million or more.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Subpart B_Annual Report to Investors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;630.20 prescribes the contents of the annual report to investors. Each disclosure entity would be
required to provide the information called for by this subpart, along with any supporting information, to the Funding
Corporation. Information required by the proposed regulation is generally consistent with the information currently
presented in the Information Statement, which should minimize any burden that may be imposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed content requirements resemble those of the annual report to shareholders under &sect;620.5 of this
chapter. Under proposed &sect;630.20(a), the report would be required to provide a description of: (1) The System's
business, including the System's organizational structure, geographical area, and customers; (2) the types of
lending activities engaged in and financial activities offered by System institutions; (3) significant developments
affecting the System's organizational structure and the manner of conducting business; (4) acquisition or disposition
of material assets; and (5) concentrations of total assets (10 percent or more) in particular types of agricultural
activity or business. The report must also include the address of the headquarters of each disclosure entity and service
organization of the System. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;630.20(b) would require that the report provide a description of the regulatory and enforcement
authority of the FCA, and the role and authority of the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation (FCSIC) and the Financial
Assistance Corporation. With respect to the FCSIC, proposed &sect;630.20(b)(2) would require that the report provide
a description of the FCSIC's status as a Government corporation and its role in ensuring the timely payment of principal
and interest on FCS debt obligations and providing assistance to System institutions. In addition, a statement that
System institutions have no control over the management of the FCSIC or expenditures from the Insurance Fund would
be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;630.20(c) would require a description of System institutions' material pending legal proceedings
and a summary of the types of and reasons for enforcement actions in effect during the year. Similar information is
currently disclosed to shareholders by banks and their related associations under &sect;620.5(c) of this chapter.
Therefore, the banks would be required to submit such information regarding their related associations to the Funding
Corporation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;630.20(d) would require that the report describe the System's funding mechanism, including System
banks' authority to issue debt obligations, and the types and characteristics of debt securities issued. Proposed
&sect;630.20(d)(1) would require that the report provide a disclosure regarding debt obligations that may be issued
by each bank. Accordingly, the disclosure would include a description of banks' authority to issue notes, bonds,
debentures, or other obligations individually under section 4.2 (a), (b), or (e) of the 1971 Act and the fact that such
debt obligations are not entitled to the benefits of insurance provided by the FCSIC.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;630.20(d) would also require the report to contain a description of applicable statutory and regulatory
restrictions that affect a bank's ability to incur debt. In addition, any agreements among banks and the Funding Corporation
that affect a bank's ability to incur debt and any agreements among System institutions on matters relating to financial
assistance or loss sharing must be disclosed pursuant to proposed paragraphs (d) (2) and (3) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;630.20(e) sets forth the requirement for a description of the System's capital structure. With respect
to permanent capital compliance and statutory or regulatory prohibitions for stock retirement or earnings distribution
by System institutions, proposed paragraph (e) of this section would require that the report provide the number of
institutions, categorized by banks and associations, that do not comply with permanent capital standards or are
under prohibitions, as well as a summary of the causes of such noncompliance or prohibitions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 5-year selected financial data required by proposed &sect;630.20(f) generally track the current System disclosure
to investors and are also very similar to the requirements of &sect;620.5(f) of this chapter. However, the list provided
under the caption ``selected financial data'' in proposed &sect;630.20(f) excludes ``protected borrower capital''
and related capital ratios. System institutions can no longer issue protected borrower stock. Because the outstanding
balance of protected borrower capital is immaterial to the financial position of the System on a Systemwide basis
and is being retired at a steady rate, the regulations would not require presentation of ``protected borrower capital''
and related capital ratios as an element of ``selected financial data.'' However, ``protected borrower capital''
must be reported separately from at-risk capital stock in the comparative financial statements or elsewhere in the
report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;630.20(g) would require a discussion and analysis (D&amp;A) on material financial aspects of the
System. Generally, the D&amp;A must cover 3 comparative years. Overall, the D&amp;A requirements under proposed
&sect;630.20(g) are less extensive than those required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its Industry
Guide 3 for bank holding companies. To help determine the extent of the D&amp;A needed, proposed &sect;630.20(g)(6)
includes general guidance for preparation of the D&amp;A and clarifies that the purpose of the D&amp;A is to provide
useful information to investors for making business decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;630.20(g)(1) would require that the D&amp;A include a description of the System loan portfolio by
major category, the risk exposure of the loan portfolio, and secondary market activities. It would also require that
the amount of loans outstanding that were used to finance the purchases of stock and other equities of System institutions
be disclosed. With respect to discussions of results of operations, proposed &sect;630.20(g)(2)(vi) would require
that the report explain how changes to Insurance Fund assets and related restricted capital affected reported income.
The discussion must describe major components of the changes on a comparative basis. All other requirements regarding
results of operations of proposed &sect;630.20(g)(2) are similar to those required by &sect;620.5(g)(2) of this
chapter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;630.20(g)(3) would require a list of outstanding debt securities by type and a discussion of other
sources of System funding. Proposed paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section specifies that insured obligations must
be reported separately from uninsured obligations and prescribes the minimum reporting requirement for each type
of security listed. The D&amp;A must also address a number of liquidity-related matters, such as any FCA regulations
or System policies regarding liquidity and liquidity reserves; material changes in liquidity and management thereof;
any regulatory limitations or System policies or objectives regarding investments; System investment portfolio;
and asset/liability management practices and related measurements of interest rate risk of the System, including
the use of derivatives and other off-balance-sheet transactions. The FCA notes the heightened interest of other
bank regulators and the Congress in the institutional and systemic risk of the rapidly growing and relatively unregulated
market for derivative financial products. It is likely that derivative product transactions by the banking industry
and others will receive increased regulatory scrutiny in the future. Accordingly, while proposed &sect;630.20(g)(3)(iv)
would require a brief discussion of derivative transactions, the FCA requests specific comment on whether disclosure
requirements regarding derivative transactions should be more detailed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;630.20(g)(4) would require a discussion of capital resources similar to that required under &sect;620.5(g)(4)
of this chapter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;630.20(g)(5) specifies the requirements for disclosure regarding the Insurance Fund. It would
require that the report provide: (1) A description of the purposes for which expenditures from the Insurance Fund
may be made and the statutory requirements for making such expenditures; (2) a schedule itemizing the amount of Insurance
Fund assets that have been specifically identified by the FCSIC for payment of estimated obligations of the FCSIC
and the amount of the fund assets for which no specific use has been identified or designated by the FCSIC; and (3) an
explanation of how FCSIC expenditures or designations of Insurance Fund assets for payment of future obligations
affect the combined assets and capital of the System.

Proposed &sect;630.20(g)(6) contains general guidance for preparation of the D&amp;A. Because the purpose of the
D&amp;A is to enhance a reader's understanding of the combined financial statements, information presented should
be relevant to an assessment of the combined financial statements. The D&amp;A should focus on material events and
uncertainties known at the time of reporting. The information provided should be material to System institutions,
clarify any ambiguities in the combined financial statements, and highlight significant aspects of the financial
statements. As preparer, the Funding Corporation would be responsible for ensuring that the D&amp;A in the report
to investors is relevant and useful to investors and the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 630.20 (h), (i), and (j) are proposed to implement the requirements of section 514 of the 1992 Act regarding
disclosure of financial and conflict-of-interest information by System personnel. The proposed regulations would
require the report to provide information to investors on System institutions' related-party transactions on an
aggregate basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;630.20(k), ``Relationship with independent public accountant,'' a change in the independent
public accountant who audits the Systemwide combined financial statements or a disagreement with the public accountant
would require disclosure if disclosure to the FCA is also required under &sect;621.4 of this chapter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;630.20(l) would require that the report present Systemwide combined financial statements that
have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for the comparative periods specified. The financial statements presented
must be audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS) by a qualified public accountant
and the accountant's opinion on the statements must be presented in the annual report to investors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;630.20(m) would require that the annual report present supplemental information regarding the
components of Systemwide combined financial statements. Such supplemental information must be presented in accordance
with the requirements and instructions of the FCA, either as separate schedules or in accompanying notes to the Systemwide
combined financial statements. The supplemental information must be examined by an independent public accountant
for compliance with the FCA regulations and guidelines and the accountant's opinion must accompany the supplemental
information in the report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;630.20 (m)(2) and (m)(3) specify that, at a minimum, the report must include current year supplemental
balance sheet and income statement data for the following components: combined financial data of all banks (without
associations); combined financial data of all associations; financial data of the Financial Assistance Corporation;
financial data of the Insurance Fund; and combined financial data pertaining to the System with and without the Insurance
Fund. Following recent correspondence and discussions with the Funding Corporation on how financial information
regarding the Insurance Fund is to be presented in the 1993 FCS Report, the FCA has developed guidelines for compliance
with proposed &sect;630.20(m). The guidelines appear in the appendix to this proposed rule and contain two schedules
to illustrate the format and selected financial data to be presented in the schedules. The supplemental disclosure
must include any additional information and disclosure sufficient to enable readers to understand the basis of presentation
of the supplemental information, the adjustments contained therein, and the effect of each component on the Systemwide
combined financial statements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, proposed &sect;630.20(o) would require the report to include a cross-reference sheet indicating the location
of the required information.

IV. Subpart C_Quarterly Reports to Investors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;630.40, ``Content of the quarterly report to investors,'' contains provisions similar to those
contained in subpart C of part 620 of this chapter. Supplemental financial statement information required to be disclosed
in the annual report must also be presented in quarterly reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations would require a quarterly report to be presented in an easily understandable format and
in a manner that is not misleading. Quarterly reports may be prepared on the presumption that readers of the report
have read or have access to the most recently published annual report. The adequacy of additional disclosure needed
in the quarterly report may be determined in that context. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rules for condensation applicable to individual institutions for preparing their quarterly financial statements
prescribed in part 620 of this chapter have been incorporated in proposed part 630 to apply to the preparation of the
Systemwide quarterly financial statements. In addition, proposed &sect;630.40(b)(4) would require that quarterly
reports to investors update material contingencies that exist at the time of the interim reporting even though a significant
change since yearend may not have occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;630.40(d) sets forth the requirements of the interim financial statements of the quarterly report
and the respective comparative periods of the interim statements presented. Proposed &sect;630.40(e) specifies
the reporting periods for which quarterly supplemental information would be required. The proposed regulations
do not require that interim financial statements or supplemental information be audited. However, the FCA may require
the Systemwide combined financial statements of an interim period to be audited should the need arise for supervisory
actions.

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The quarterly report to investors shall contain the information specified in this section along with any other material
information necessary to make the required disclosures, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. The quarterly report must be presented in a format that is easily understandable and not misleading.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Rules for condensation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of this subpart, major captions to be provided in interim financial statements are the same as those provided
in the financial statements contained in the annual report to investors, except that the financial statements included
in the quarterly report may be condensed into major captions in accordance with the rules prescribed under this paragraph.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Interim balance sheets. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When any major balance sheet caption is less than 10 percent of total assets and the amount in the caption has not increased
or decreased by more than 25 percent since the end of the preceding fiscal year, the caption may be combined with others.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Interim statements of income. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When any major income statement caption is less than 15 percent of average net income for the 3 most recent fiscal years
and the amount in the caption has not increased or decreased by more than 20 percent since the corresponding interim
period of the preceding fiscal year, the caption may be combined with others. In calculating average net income, loss
years should be excluded. If losses were incurred in each of the 3 most recent fiscal years, the average loss shall be
used for purposes of this test.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) The interim financial information shall include disclosure either on the face of the financial statements or
in accompanying footnotes sufficient to make the interim information presented not misleading. It may be presumed
that users of the interim financial information have read or have access to the audited financial statements for the
preceding fiscal year and the adequacy of additional disclosure needed for a fair presentation may be determined
in that context. Accordingly, footnote disclosure that would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained
in the most recent audited financial statements (such as a statement of significant accounting policies and practices)
and details of accounts that have not changed significantly in amount or composition since the end of the most recently
completed fiscal year may be omitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Interim reports shall disclose events that have occurred subsequent to the end of the most recently completed
fiscal year that have a material impact on the System. Disclosures should encompass, for example, significant changes
since the end of the most recently completed fiscal year in such items as accounting principles and practices, estimates
used in the preparation of financial statements, status of long-term contracts, capitalization, significant new
indebtedness or modification of existing financing agreements, financial assistance received, significant business
combinations and liquidations of System institutions, and terminations of System institution status. Notwithstanding
the above, where material contingencies exist, disclosure of such matters shall be provided even though a significant
change since yearend may not have occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) In addition to meeting the reporting requirements specified by existing accounting pronouncements for accounting
changes, state the date of any material accounting change and the reasons for making it. A letter from the persons who
verify the System's financial statements shall be included as an exhibit to the reports filed with the FCA, indicating
whether or not the change is to an alternative principle that in their judgment is preferable under the circumstances,
except that no such letter need be filed when the change is made in response to a standard adopted by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board or other authoritative body that requires such change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Any material prior period adjustment made during any period covered by the interim financial statements shall
be disclosed, together with its effect upon net income and upon the balance of surplus for any prior period included.
If results of operations for any period presented have been adjusted retroactively by such an item subsequent to the
initial reporting of such period, similar disclosure of the effect of the change shall be made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Interim financial statements furnished shall reflect all adjustments that are necessary to a fair statement
of the results for the interim periods presented. A statement to that effect shall be included. Furnish any material
information necessary to make the information called for not misleading, such as a statement that the results for
interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) If any amount that would otherwise be required to be shown by this section with respect to any item is not material,
it need not be separately shown. The combination of insignificant items is permitted.

Discuss any material changes in the combined results of operations of the System with respect to the most recent fiscal
year-to-date period for which an income statement is provided and the corresponding year-to-date period of the preceding
fiscal year. Such discussion also shall cover material changes with respect to that fiscal quarter and the corresponding
fiscal quarter in the preceding fiscal year.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice proposes special conditions for the Soloy Dual Pac engine. This engine will have a novel design feature
associated with its configuration. The Dual Pac engine is a propulsion system in which two Pratt &amp; Whitney (P&amp;W)
PT6 gas turbine engines are combined through a common gearbox to drive a single output propeller shaft. The Dual Pac
engine is intended to provide a degree of continuous operation following the failure of one of the P&amp;W PT6 engines.
The applicable regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for such a configuration. This
notice proposes the additional safety standards which the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level
of safety equivalent to that established by the airworthiness standards of part 33 of the Federal Aviation Regulations
(FAR).

General
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 9, 1990, Soloy Dual Pac, Inc., applied for a supplemental type certificate for the Dual Pac engine. The
Dual Pac engine is a propulsion concept in which two Pratt &amp; Whitney PT6 engines, currently approved under Type
Certificate No. E4EA, drive a single propeller shaft through a combining gearbox. The Dual Pac engine incorporates
redundant freewheeling, drive, governing, and lubricating systems. A system of one-way clutches both prevents
the propeller shaft from driving the engine input shafts and allows either engine to drive the propeller should the
other engine fail. The supplemental type certificate for the Dual Pac engine is to be based on the type certificate
of the Pratt &amp; Whitney PT6 engine.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Safety Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The certification basis of the P&amp;W PT6 engine was established before the introduction of FAR &sect;33.75 (Safety
Analysis). Section 33.75 addresses four types of engine failure conditions which are particularly hazardous to
the safety of the aircraft. The objective of &sect;33.75 is to require an analysis to be performed at the engine level
which establishes that any probable single or multiple failure, or any probable improper operation will not cause
the engine to catch fire, burst, generate loads greater than the ultimate loads for the engine mount, or lose the capability
to shut down. Consequently, it is considered appropriate to add a safety analysis requirement to the Dual Pac engine
program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, one objective of the Dual Pac engine is to provide continued operation after the failure of one P&amp;W PT6 engine.
While the safety analysis regulations of &sect;33.75 are more extensive than those of the P&amp;W PT6 engine certification
basis, they still do not address this special ``continue to run'' objective.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Therefore, in light of the above, it is proposed that a safety analysis requirement, modelled after &sect;33.75 and
expanded to address continued operation after a single engine failure, be included in the Dual Pac engine certification
basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Uncontained Engine Failure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is assumed that the Dual Pac engine is intended for use in an aircraft and will be part of an aircraft certification
program in the future. Minimizing the hazards to the aircraft from uncontained engine debris will be a very important
requirement in any such certification program. In addition, for a design such as the Dual Pac, many design features
intended to minimize such hazards would be determined at the engine design stage. Therefore, this issue should be
addressed initially during the Dual Pac engine certification program, and possibly readdressed during the aircraft
installation certification program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated above, one objective of a Dual Pac engine-equipped aircraft could be continued safe flight and landing after
the failure of one P&amp;W PT6 engine. In order for the Dual Pac engine to achieve this objective, it must continue to
produce adequate and controllable torque after such a failure. Service experience, however, shows that uncontained
engine failures can result in high velocity fragment penetration of, among other things, other engines. This could
render the other engine inoperative as well. In the case of the Dual Pac engine, such an event could end all torque production.
Therefore, the Dual Pac engine must demonstrate that the two P&amp;W PT6 engines should be protected from each other
in order to minimize the hazards associated with this event.

Gearbox Design, Functioning, and Endurance Testing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Power transmission systems, such as gearboxes, have not been specifically addressed by engine certification regulations.
Previously, engines incorporating gearboxes, such as fan reduction gearing or accessor gearboxes, have been evaluated
during the course of engine block tests and other engine certification activities. Transmissions such as those used
in rotorcraft, however, have been addressed in rotor drive criteria contained in rotorcraft certification regulations.
Since the Dual Pac engine propulsion drive system is part of the engine, it is proposed that the changes to FAR part 23,
which were published as a Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), ``Small Airplane Airworthiness Review Program Notice
No. 3,'' in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on October 3, 1990, (55 FR 40598); and FAR &sect;33.87 (amended through Amendment 33&hyph;3), be used as a basis for
special conditions intended to establish standards to address the design, function, and endurance testing of the
gearbox. Section 33.87 regulations have been included in order to establish a comprehensive standard to address
the turbine interface with the gearbox.

Type Certification Basis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the provisions of &sect;21.101 of the FAR, Soloy Dual Pace Dual Pac, Inc., must show that the Dual Pac engine meets
the applicable provisions of the regulations incorporated by reference in Type Certificate No. E4EA, or the requirements
of the applicable regulations in effect on the date of the application. The regulations incorporated by reference
in the type certificate are commonly referred to as the ``original type certification basis.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations incorporated by reference in Type Certificate No. E4EA are as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) FAR &sect;21.29, Issue of type certificate: import products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Civil Air Regulations (CAR) Part 10, Certification and Approval of Import Aircraft and Related Products, March
28, 1955.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) FAR Part 33, Airworthiness Standards: Aircraft Engines, February 1, 1965, as amended through Amendment 33&hyph;5.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the regulations incorporated by reference do not provide adequate standards with respect to the change, the applicant
must comply with the regulations in effect on the date of application for the change that the FAA finds necessary to
provide a level of safety equal to that established by the regulations incorporated by reference. Due to the potential
applications of the Soloy Dual Pac engine, the FAA has determined that it must also be shown to comply with FAR part 33,
dated February 1, 1965, as amended, plus the following sections:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Section 33.7, Amendment 33&hyph;12, Engine ratings and operating limitations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Section 33.67, Amendment 33&hyph;10, Fuel system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Section 33.68, Amendment 33&hyph;10, Induction system icing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Section 33.96, Amendment 33&hyph;11, Engine test in auxiliary power unit mode.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Section 21.115(a), Applicable requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, compliance must be shown with FAR part 34 (Fuel Venting and Exhaust Emission Requirements for Turbine
Engine Powered Airplanes); these special conditions contained herein on Safety analysis, Gearbox design, functioning,
and endurance testing, and Uncontained engine failure; as well as any applicable equivalent safety findings and
any applicable exemptions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations in part 33, as amended, do not contain adequate
or appropriate safety standards for the Soloy Dual Pac engine because of its novel or unsual design feature. Therefore,
the Administrator proposes special conditions under the provisions of &sect;21.16 to establish a level of safety
equivalent to that established in the regulations.

Propulsion Drive System Design. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Propulsion drive systems, as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(i), must meet the requirements as set forth in paragraphs
(c) (1) through (6). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The propulsion drive system includes all parts necessary to transmit power from the engines to the propeller shaft.
This includes couplings, universal joints, drive shafts, supporting hearings for shafts, brake assemblies, clutches,
gearboxes, transmissions, any attached accessory pad or drives, and any cooling fans that are attached to, or mounted
on, the propulsion drive system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Each propulsion drive system, powered by more than one engine, must be arranged so that the propeller shaft and
its control will continue to be powered by the remaining engine(s) if any engine fails. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Each multiengined propulsion drive system must incorporate a device to automatically disengage any engine
from the propeller shaft, it that engine fails. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The oil for components of the propulsion drive system that require continuous lubrication must be sufficiently
independent of the lubrication systems of the engine(s) to ensure operation with any engine inoperative. The propulsion
drive system must be able to operate at zero oil pressure and 100 percent output speed for at least 15 seconds without
damage to the components and without seizure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Torque limiting means must be provided on all accessory drives that are located on the propulsion drive system,

(vii) In addition to the propulsion drive system complying with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(iii), the propulsion
drive system, powered by more than one engine, must be designed so that torque to the propeller shaft is not interrupted
after failure of any engine or element in the propeller shaft drive system; and examined in detail to determine all
components and their failure modes that would be vital to continued control and operation of the propulsion drive
system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) For each component and its failure modes identified by this examination, it must be shown by appropriate test
that such a failure is not likely to occur in the system component's service life established by these tests; or that
the system is designed so continued control and operation can be accomplished after occurrence of the failure.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The propulsion drive system, as defined in paragraph (c)(1) must be tested as prescribed in paragraphs (c)(4)(ii)
through (c)(4)(ix), for at least 200 hours plus the time required to meet paragraph (c)(4)(ix). For the 200-hour portion,
these tests must be conducted as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) twenty each, ten-hour test cycles consisting of the test times and procedures in paragraphs (c)(4)(ii) through

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Endurance tests; takeoff torque run.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The takeoff torque run endurance test must be conducted as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The takeoff torque run must consist of a one-hour run on the engine(s) at the torque corresponding to takeoff power,
but with the engine power setting alternately cycled every five minutes to as low an engine idle speed as practicable.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Deceleration and acceleration of the engines and/or of individual engines and drive systems must be performed
at the maximum rate. (This corresponds to a one-second power setting change from idle to takeoff setting, and one second
from takeoff setting to idle.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The time duration of all engines at takeoff power setting must total one hour and does not include the time required
to go from takeoff to idle and back to takeoff speed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Endurance tests; maximum continuous run. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

at maximum continuous rotational propeller shaft speed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One hour of continuous operation, at the torque corresponding to 80 percent of maximum power, must be conducted at
the minimum rotational propeller shaft speed intended for this power.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Endurance tests; 60 percent of maximum continuous run
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It must be determined whether malfunctioning of components, such as the engine fuel or ignition systems, or unequal
engine power can cause dynamic conditions detrimental to the drive system. If so, a suitable number of hours of operation
must be accomplished under those conditions, one hour of which must be included in each cycle, and the remaining hours
of which must be accomplished at the end of 20 cycles. This testing is to be equally divided between the following four
conditions: (1) Engine

Endurance tests; one-engine-out application.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A total of 160 full differential power applications must be made at takeoff torque and RPM. If, during these tests,
it is found that a critical dynamic condition exists, an investigative assessment to determine the cause shall be
performed throughout the torque/speed range. In each of the 160 engine power setting cycles (160 per engine drive
branch) a full differential power application must be performed. In each cycle, the transition from clutch engagement
to disengagement must occur at the critical condition for clutch and shaft wear.

Additional Propulsion Drive System Tests. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Additional dynamic, endurance, and operational test and vibratory investigations must be performed to determine
that the drive mechanism is safe. The following additional tests and conditions apply:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the torque output of all engines to the transmission can exceed the highest engine or transmission torque limit,
the following tests must be conducted. Under conditions associated with all engines operating, apply 200 cycles
to the drive system for 10 seconds each of a torque that is at least equal to the lesser of_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The maximum torque used in complying with paragraph (4)(ii) plus 10 percent; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The maximum torque attainable under normal operating conditions, assuming that any torque limiting devices
function properly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) With each engine alternately inoperative, apply to the remaining transmission inputs the maximum transient
torque attainable under normal operating condition, assuming that any torque limiting devices function properly.
Each transmission input must be tested at this maximum torque for at least 15 minutes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) After completion of the 200 hour endurance test and without intervening major disassembly, the drive system
must be subjected to 50 overspeed runs, each 30 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 3 seconds in duration, at a speed of at least 120 percent of maximum continuous speed, or other maximum overspeed that
is likely to occur, plus a margin of speed approved by the Administrator for that overspeed condition. These runs must
be conducted as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Overspeed runs must be alternated with stabilizing runs from 1 to 5 minutes duration, each 60 to 80 percent of maximum
continuous speed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Acceleration and deceleration must be accomplished in a period no longer than 10 seconds, and the time for changing
speeds may not be deducted from the specified time for the overspeed runs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Each part tested, as prescribed in this section, must be in serviceable condition at the end of the tests. No intervening
disassembly that might affect test results may be conducted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) If drive shaft couplings are used and shaft misalignment or deflections are probable, loads must be determined
in establishing the installation limits affecting misalignment. These loads must be combined to show adequate fatigue
life.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) The vibration test specified in 33.83 must be applied to engine-furnished components of the propulsion drive
system. The test must include the gear case and each component in the combining gear box whose failure due to vibration
could cause unsafe operation of the engine.

Propulsion Drive System Shafting Critical Speed.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The critical speeds of any shafting must be determined by test, except that analytical methods may be used if reliable
methods of analysis are available for the particular design.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If any critical speed lies within, or close to, the operating ranges for idling and power on conditions, the stresses
occurring at that speed must be within design limits. This must be shown by tests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If analytical methods are used and show that no critical speed lies within the permissible operating ranges,
the margins between the calculated critical speeds and the limits of the allowable operating ranges must be adequate
to allow for possible variations between the computed and actual values.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Jetstream
Model 4101 airplanes. This proposal would require modification of the aileron drive quadrant support structure.
This proposal is prompted by results of a stress analysis check, which revealed that the factor of safety of the aileron
drive quadrant support structure on Model 4101 airplanes does not meet the tail-to-wind gust load design case strength
requirements specified in the Federal Aviation Regulations. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended
to prevent cracking of the support structure, which could result in reduced controllability of the airplane.

on Model 4101 airplanes does not meet the tail-to-wind gust load design case strength requirements specified in the
Federal Aviation Regulations. This condition, if not corrected, could lead to cracking of the support structure
of the aileron drive quadrant, and subsequent reduced controllability of the airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Jetstream has issued Series 4100 Service Bulletin J41&hyph;53&hyph;011, dated October 15, 1993, that describes
procedures for modification of the aileron drive quadrant support structure below the flight compartment floor.
This modification involves reinforcing the upper and lower support diaphragms of the aileron drive quadrant support
structure by installing a new lower support bracket on the lower diaphragm and a new doubler plate on the upper diaphragm.
The modification also includes performing functional tests of the aileron and elevator controls, and an operational
test of the autopilot system. Accomplishment of the modification will increase the factor of safety of the aileron
drive quadrant support structure for the tail-to-wind gust load design case and will ensure the structure meets the
strength requirements specified in the Federal Aviation Regulations. The CAA classified this service bulletin
as mandatory.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require modification of the aileron drive quadrant
support structure below the flight compartment floor. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance
with the service bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 4 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
20 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
Required parts would be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost
impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $4,400, or $1,100 per airplane. This total cost figure
assumes that no operator has yet accomplished the proposed requirements of this AD action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Saab Model
SAAB SF340A and SAAB 340B series airplanes. This proposal would require an inspection of the elevator and aileron
coves, and further inspections and repair, if necessary. This proposal is prompted by a report of delamination between
the composite structure and the aluminum foil on the elevator cove on a Model SAAB SF340B series airplane. The design
of the aileron cove is similar to that of the elevator cove on Model SAAB SF340A and SAAB 340B series airplanes. The actions
specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent jamming of the aileron or elevator.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Luftfartsverket (LFV), which is the airworthiness authority for Sweden, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe
condition may exist on certain Saab Aircraft AB Model SAAB SF340A and SAAB 340B series airplanes. The LFV advises that,
when the pilot of a Model SAAB SF340B series airplane disengaged the autopilot during approach for landing, the elevators
required additional force in order to be operated correctly. Investigation revealed that delamination had occurred
between the composite structure and the aluminum foil on the elevator cove. When water entered the delaminated area
and froze, the aluminum foil was raised further, causing contact with the elevator. The design of the aileron cove
is similar to that of the elevator cove on Model SAAB SF340A and SAAB 340B series airplanes. The design consists of a
composite structure with a conductive layer, which is composed of aluminum foil, conductive paint, or expanded aluminum
foil (stretched metal_aluminum net). Delamination and freezing of trapped water in the aileron or elevator could
lead to jamming of these parts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Saab has issued Service Bulletin 340&hyph;51&hyph;012, dated November 10, 1993, that describes procedures for
an inspection of the elevator and aileron coves to verify the type of antistatic protection (black conductive paint
or expanded aluminum foil (an aluminum net)) applied to the coves. For coves that are found without conductive paint
or expanded aluminum foil, the service bulletin describes procedures for a detailed visual inspection and delamination
tap test to detect aluminum foil delamination on the coves; and either a temporary repair and repetitive detailed
visual inspections and delamination tap tests of the coves, or a permanent repair of the coves. The temporary repair
involves applying aluminum tape or conductive paint to the delaminated area, and accomplishing repetitive detailed
visual inspections and delamination tap tests of the cove. The permanent repair entails either applying conductive
paint or expanded aluminum foil (stretched metal_aluminum net) to the cove. Accomplishment of the permanent repair
would terminate the repetitive detailed visual inspections and delamination tap tests. The LFV classified this
service bulletin as mandatory and issued Swedish Airworthiness Directive No. 1&hyph;060, dated November 15, 1993,
in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in Sweden. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in Sweden and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement.
Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the LFV has kept the FAA informed of the situation described
above. The FAA has examined the findings of the LFV, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action
is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require an inspection of the elevator and aileron coves
to verify the type of antistatic protection applied to the coves. For coves that are found without conductive paint
or expanded aluminum foil, the proposed AD would require a detailed visual inspection and delamination tap test to
detect aluminum foil delamination on the coves; and either a temporary repair and repetitive detailed visual inspections
and delamination tap tests of the coves, or a permanent repair of the coves. Accomplishment of the permanent repair
would terminate the repetitive detailed visual inspections and delamination tap tests. The actions would be required
to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 152 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
20 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed inspection, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $167,200, or $1,100
per airplane. This total cost figure assumes that no operator has yet accomplished the proposed requirements of this
AD action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,

Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To prevent jamming of the aileron or elevator, accomplish the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Within 500 hours time-in-service or 90 days after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs first, perform
an inspection of the elevator and aileron coves to verify the type of antistatic protection applied to the coves, in
accordance with SAAB Service Bulletin 340&hyph;51&hyph;012, dated November 10, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If a cove has conductive paint or expanded aluminum foil (stretched metal_aluminum net), no further action is
required by this AD for that cove. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If a cove does not have conductive paint or expanded aluminum foil (stretched metal_aluminum net), prior to further
flight, perform a detailed visual inspection and delamination tap test to detect aluminum foil delamination on the
elevator or aileron cove, in accordance with the service bulletin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If no delamination is found, repeat the detailed visual inspection and delamination tap test thereafter at intervals
not to exceed 800 hours time-in-service in accordance with the service bulletin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If any delamination is found, prior to further flight, accomplish either paragraph (c)(2)(i) or (c)(2(ii) of
this AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Perform a temporary repair of the cove in accordance with the service bulletin. Thereafter, repeat the detailed
visual inspection and delamination tap test required by paragraph (c) of this AD at intervals not to exceed 800 hours
time-in-service. Or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Perform a permanent repair of the cove in accordance with the service bulletin. Accomplishment of this permanent
repair constitutes terminating action for the repetitive inspection required by this AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of
safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate.
Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments
and then send it to the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On August 14, 1991, Customs published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (56 FR 40283) proposing to change its position 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with respect to the definition of ``passenger'' for purposes of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coastwise passenger statute (46 U.S.C. App. 289). Customs stated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it was considering the revocation of its position that: (a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons transported free of charge as an inducement for patronage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or good will are not passengers; and (b) persons transported free 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of charge who are less than substantially connected with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation, navigation, ownership, or business of a vessel are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passengers. The effect of these proposed changes of position 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have been that persons considered to be passengers as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result of the changes could not have been transported between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coastwise points or in the coastwise trade unless they were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transported in United States coastwise-qualified vessels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes of position would not have effected any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actual change to the specific wording of the definition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passenger contained in 19 CFR 4.50(b). Customs will consider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing an amendment to the definition of passenger in 19 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.50(b) as part of a proposed revision to its vessel regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which Customs expects will occur as a result of the recent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enactment of title VI of the North American Free Trade Agreement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation Act (Public Law 103&hyph;182; the ``Customs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Modernization Act''). In view of the enactment of the Customs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Modernization Act, and the many regulatory changes which will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occur as a result, Customs believes that it is not appropriate to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
go forward with the proposed changes of position at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the proposal is withdrawn.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing that it intends to take several related actions to reduce the
amount of lead in food from the use of food and color additives and food ingredients whose use is generally recognized
as safe (GRAS). This action is part of its ongoing efforts to reduce the levels of lead in food. In this document, the
agency is identifying the lead levels that it intends to propose as new, lower lead specifications for the most heavily
used food and color additives and GRAS ingredients. Before proposing these specifications, however, the agency
is requesting information on whether these levels are feasible, and, if they are not, information on why higher levels
will not endanger the public health, and on what levels are feasible. The agency is requesting specific data and information
on the lead levels and the methods for detecting lead in these substances. Additionally, the agency is requesting
information on the economic and environmental effects of lowering the lead levels.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In this advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM), the agency is announcing its intention to decrease the amount
of lead derived from food and color additives and GRAS food ingredients in the diet through several actions. These
actions are prompted by the results of recent studies showing that deleterious health effects are caused by much lower
levels of lead than previous results indicated, especially in fetuses, infants, and young children. Also, the development
of more sensitive analytical methods has made it possible to detect lower lead levels in food ingredients.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This ANPRM has four purposes: (1) To discuss the toxic effects of lead and to describe the multiple sources of lead in
the human environment; (2) to summarize actions that FDA and other Federal agencies have taken to reduce lead exposures;
(3) to discuss available data and potential exposures to lead from the consumption of food, including food and color
additives and GRAS ingredients used in food; and (4) to describe the need for new petitions for moderate and high consumption
food and color additives and GRAS ingredients to include specific information on the levels of lead in these substances.
This information is necessary to assess the substance's contribution of lead to the diet, and, therefore, whether
it is safe for its intended use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency intends to propose new, lower lead specifications for moderate and high consumption food ingredients
that either are the subject of premarket review or are currently in use, to ensure that the amount of lead contributed
to the diet from the use of these food and color additives and GRAS ingredients is as low as feasible. The agency intends
to propose adopting specifications of 0.5 part per million (ppm) for moderate consumption food ingredients and 0.1
ppm for high consumption food ingredients, unless information is submitted to show that such levels are not feasible
and that higher specifications will not endanger the public health. Finally, the ANPRM requests specific information
on the lead levels and the methods used to detect lead in the moderate and high consumption substances identified and
on the economic and environmental effects of lowering the lead levels in these food and color additives and GRAS ingredients.
FDA will review the information provided in response to this ANPRM before it proposes modifications to the current
specifications for lead in these food and color additives and GRAS ingredients.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Lead Toxicity
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Lead affects numerous essential body functions and has no known physiological value. The primary targets of lead
are the central and peripheral nervous systems, the kidneys, and red blood cells. Recent scientific evidence indicates
that lead has deleterious effects on human health at levels that were once thought to be innocuous. In fact, there is
no known level of lead intake that does not produce adverse health effects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA discussed the well-documented adverse health effects of lead in an ANPRM on lead in food published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of June 21, 1993 (58 FR 33860). Also, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP) discuss lead's effects
in their 1991 document entitled ``Preventing Lead Poisoning in Young Children'' (Ref. 1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this ANPRM, FDA's primary concern is the effects of low levels of lead on fetuses, infants, and children from consumption
of food and color additives and GRAS ingredients used in food. The adverse health effects of lead exposure in fetuses,
infants, and children occur at lower blood lead levels than in adults. In particular, lead is harmful to the developing
major organs, such as the brain and nervous system, of these sensitive population groups. Fetuses are sensitive to
maternal dietary lead intake, especially during the development of their nervous systems. Further, infants and
children ingest and absorb a larger amount of lead per unit of body weight than adults, and they also retain a larger
fraction of absorbed lead.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Blood lead levels of a large number of children in the United States remain above the toxicity standards recommended
by the CDCP (Ref. 1). Additionally, recent studies show a correlation between impaired childhood development and
lead exposure at levels as low as 10 micrograms/deciliter (&mu;g/dL) of lead in blood and below. Decreased stature
or growth, decreased hearing acuity, impaired neurobehavioral development, and decreased intelligence have all
been linked to these low levels of lead exposure in children (Ref. 1). Lead also interferes with the synthesis of vitamin
D and heme, the iron containing component of hemoglobin, at blood lead levels of 10 to 15 &mu;g/dL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The symptoms of lead exposure at these low levels are not pronounced and are therefore difficult to assess. A technique
of grouping data from different studies (meta-analysis), which enhances the ability to detect a true effect, has
been used to retrospectively analyze 12 studies reported since 1981 on the relationship between childhood lead exposures
and neurobehavioral development (Ref. 2). The results of this analysis strongly support the hypothesis that there
is an inverse relationship between lead exposure and childhood intelligence quotient (IQ), even at very low doses.
Similarly, a coordinated study by eight countries showed a significant relationship between increases in blood-lead
concentration and decreases in behavioral test performance for blood-lead levels ranging from 5 to 60 &mu;g/dL (Ref.
3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Long-lasting adverse effects from low level childhood lead exposures have also been observed. Early postnatal exposure
results in decreased cognitive performance in the preschool and early school years (Refs. 4 and 5). Academic success
and the fine motor skills of young adults were also shown to be inversely related to the amount of lead in the teeth shed
by children in the first and second grades (Ref. 6).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fetuses are also at risk to low levels of lead. The available data show that the placenta is not a significant barrier
to fetal lead uptake. Maternal and umbilical cord blood-lead levels of 10 to 15 &mu;g/dL are associated with reduced
gestational age and reduced weight at birth (Ref. 4). Additionally, there are several studies in which prenatal blood-lead
levels were monitored, followed by monitoring of the blood-lead level and childhood development for several years
after birth. In most of these studies, prenatal exposures were associated with slower sensory motor development
and delayed early cognitive development (Ref. 1). Some of these associations may decrease as the child ages, if postnatal
exposures are low, and subsequent socioeconomic conditions are favorable (Ref. 7). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adult exposure to lead has been associated with higher occurrences of cardiovascular disease when blood lead levels
are as low as 25 to 30 &mu;g/dL (Ref. 8). In particular, there is an increased incidence of high blood pressure, which
may lead to an increase in hypertension-related diseases. Red blood cell protoporphyrin elevation and peripheral
nerve dysfunction have also been observed at these same blood lead levels (Ref. 8).

As the amount and duration of lead exposure increases, lead's effects on the body become more severe. Blood-lead levels
above 40 &mu;g/dL in all population groups can result in permanent kidney damage, acute anemia, peripheral nerve
dysfunction, and severe gastrointestinal symptoms. Higher levels of lead affect the central nervous system. Blood
levels greater than 80 &mu;g/dL in children and greater than 100 &mu;g/dL in adults can lead to acute encephalopathy,
characterized by massive accumulation of fluid in the brain, gross mental retardation in children, convulsions,
coma, and even death (Ref. 8).

B. Sources of Lead
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Lead is ubiquitous in industrial societies. Known sources of lead include paint containing lead-based pigments,
leaded gasoline, and lead solder. Lead exposure occurs through pathways such as food, air, dust, soil, and water.
For children under 5 years of age, lead-based paint remains the primary source of high level lead poisoning, with ingestion
of dust and soils contaminated with this paint being the primary exposure pathway. In contrast, low level lead exposure
in all population groups is often caused by contributions through a variety of pathways, with no single source or pathway
predominating. Because the effects of lead from all sources are additive, contributions from any single source should
be well below the amount known to cause deleterious health effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1990, FDA estimated that, on average, 16 percent of a 2-year-old child's lead intake was derived from food (Ref.
9). Most of the rest of the lead was ingested from dust (75 percent). FDA has also estimated that women of childbearing
age ingest 43 percent of their lead from food and 53 percent from dust and water. Children, through play and normal hand-to-mouth
activities, ingest larger amounts of lead from dust and soil than adults.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lead is introduced into food through a variety of pathways. It can enter the food chain through water, dust, soil, or
air. Naturally occurring levels of lead in the environment are generally negligible compared to those caused by humans
(Ref. 10). Lead in water comes primarily from the plumbing systems used for water distribution. Airborne lead, from
the exhaust of cars and machinery that use leaded gasoline and from industrial activities that emit lead, can be deposited
directly on plants. Lead is also deposited on soil from these sources. In addition, lead in soils is in part the result
of the historical use of lead-based pesticides. Lead deposited on soil remains a long-term source of lead exposure
because it does not biodegrade or decay, and it is immobilized by the organic component of soil (Ref. 10).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Food processing also contributes lead to food. Lead can be introduced through the machinery and water used in food
processing, from food and color additives and GRAS ingredients used in food, and from food packaging. Cans with lead-soldered
seams have been a predominant source of lead contamination in food in the recent past. If lead-based paint is present
in a food manufacturing or processing facility, paint dust containing significant quantities of lead may also contaminate
the food.

A. FDA Actions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has been involved in reducing the amount of lead in the diet since the 1930's. Initial efforts were aimed at controlling
the use of lead-containing pesticides on fruits and vegetables. Subsequent attention has been directed at lead contributions
from a variety of sources including ceramicware, lead-soldered food cans, and tin-lead capsules for wine bottles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of August 31, 1979 (44 FR 51233), the FDA published an ANPRM (the 1979 ANPRM) that described the sources of lead in foods,
the health concerns arising from the presence of lead in foods, and the agency's plan to reduce the level of dietary
lead intake derived from the use of lead solder in food cans. The 1979 ANPRM identified the maximum tolerable level
of total lead intake from all sources. The notice also announced the agency's tentative plan to reduce contributions
of lead from other sources in foods and requested information on existing lead levels in foods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency also published a proposed rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of June 1, 1989 (54 FR 23485) that proposed limitations on the amount of lead that could leach from ceramic pitchers
(excluding creamers) that are intended for food contact. This document also proposed that decorative ceramicware
that leaches high lead levels must be permanently labeled or modified in such a way as to preclude its use for holding
foods. The agency recently revised its Compliance Policy Guide to include lower enforcement level guidelines for
ceramic foodware (July 6, 1992, 57 FR 29734).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beginning in 1992, FDA has accelerated its actions to reduce the level of lead in food. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 25, 1992 (57 FR 55485), the agency published a proposed rule to prohibit the use of tin-coated lead foil
capsules as coverings on wine bottles. This action was based on evidence that under ordinary conditions of use, lead
in these capsules can become a component of wine. In that document, the agency discussed the relationship between
lead exposure and lead in blood and tentatively defined a provisional tolerable total intake level (PTTIL) for lead
from all food and non-food sources. The agency calculated the PTTIL based on the most up-to-date knowledge of lead's
lowest toxic effect levels. The agency tentatively set the PTTIL at 25 micrograms per day (&mu;g/day) for pregnant
women, who are surrogates for fetal exposure, and 75 &mu;g/day for other adults. These values are provisional because
they are based on the current lowest observed effect level (LOEL) of lead in the blood (30 &mu;g/dL for adults and 10
&mu;g/dL for infants, children, and pregnant women), which may need to be reduced further if additional research
shows that even lower blood-lead levels cause adverse health effects.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 5, 1993 (58 FR 389), the agency proposed to establish a maximum level of 0.005 milligram per liter (mg/L)
as the quality standard for lead in bottled water.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of June 21, 1993 (58 FR 33860), the agency proposed to ban the use of lead solder for domestic and imported food cans.
In that document, the agency tentatively defined the PTTIL for infants and children. The agency used the LOEL of 10
&mu;g/dL to arrive at a PTTIL of 6 &mu;g/day for infants and children (Ref. 8). This lower PTTIL is based on the fact that
children absorb lead more efficiently than do adults. In a notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 1, 1993 (58 FR 17233), the agency also announced emergency action levels for lead in foods packed in lead-soldered
cans. These action levels are an interim measure to protect infants and young children from adverse effects that could
result from daily consumption of foods packaged in lead-soldered cans, pending completion of the rulemaking to prohibit
the use of lead solder in food cans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a final rule published in the

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 12, 1994 (59 FR 1638), the agency amended its regulations to require that decorative ceramicware, which
may leach hazardous amounts of lead into food, bear adequate indications to distinguish it from ceramic foodware
(i.e., ceramicware intended for holding, storing, or serving food). This rule requires a statement and a stick-on
label on the exterior surface of the decorative ceramicware that the piece is not for food use, and that it may poison
food. Alternatively, the rule provides that a hole may be bored through the possible food-contact surface of the piece.

B. Other Federal Agency Actions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The elimination of lead poisoning is a coordinated effort by several Federal agencies. In 1988, the Agency for Toxic
Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) published a report to Congress summarizing the nature and extent of lead
poisoning in children. The report found that in 1984, 17 percent of metropolitan preschool children had blood lead
levels that exceeded 15 &mu;g/dL (Ref. 11). In February 1991, the Department of Health and Human Services announced
a ``Strategic Plan for the Elimination of Childhood Lead Poisoning.'' This document called for a concerted, society-wide
elimination effort and described the need for a more comprehensive evaluation of blood lead levels and environmental
lead contamination (Ref. 1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CDCP also addressed the issues of lead toxicity and poison prevention in children in their October 1991 document entitled
``Preventing Lead Poisoning in Young Children'' (Ref. 1). This document included multitiered program, based on
blood lead levels, that CDCP devised to replace the previous single definition of lead poisoning. The CDCP threshold
for initiating action to reduce lead exposure was lowered from 25 &mu;g/dL to 10 &mu;g/dL in children because of the
large amount of data showing lead's deleterious effects on development at blood lead levels of 10 &mu;g/dL and above.
The CDCP are also helping laboratories to improve the reliability of blood lead measurements and are developing improved
instrumentation for analysis of blood lead levels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1978, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) banned both paint containing more than 0.06 percent lead by
weight and the deliberate addition of lead to paint for use on residential surfaces, toys, and furniture. In addition,
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 30, 1992 (57 FR 18418), the CPSC announced that it was investigating the further reduction of this maximum
allowable limit to 0.01 percent. Lead-based paint is still available for industrial, marine, and military use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a plan for the abatement of lead-based paint published in 1990, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) found that approximately 74 percent of occupied, privately-owned houses built before 1980 still contained
lead-based paint. The CDCP report (Ref. 1) summarizes the results of this report and discusses methods for decreasing
lead exposure in houses painted with lead-based paint.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been working for many years on the removal of lead in gasoline, pesticides,
and, more recently, drinking water (June 7, 1991, 56 FR 26460). EPA has also recently released a report to Congress
outlining a strategy to reduce human lead exposures from the environment, as summarized in the CDCP report (Ref. 1).
As part of this strategy, EPA published a final rule on June 30, 1993 (58 FR 35314), that decreased the minimum quantity
of several lead compounds, as emissions from manufacturing facilities, that must be reported to the agency.

A. Exposure to Lead from Food and Food Ingredients
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon the results of FDA's Total Diet Study (the agency's annual market-basket survey of foods (Ref. 12)), from
1988 through 1990, FDA estimates that 2-year-old children consume about 4.5 &mu;g of lead each day from food alone,
while women of childbearing age consume about 9 &mu;g/day (Ref. 9). For a 2-year-old child, lead intake from food is
nearly equal to the PTTIL of 6 &mu;g/day for lead from all sources, even though food is estimated to account for only
16 percent of the child's total daily intake of lead (Ref. 9). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its 1988 report to Congress, ATSDR estimated that, in 1987, approximately 1 million young children in this country
consumed sufficient lead in food to cause blood lead levels of 10 &mu;g/dL and greater (Ref. 11). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The relation between dietary lead and lead uptake in the body is complex. Absorption of lead from the gastrointestinal
(GI) tract in adults is normally about 10 to 15 percent, but it can be as high as 45 percent under fasting conditions (Ref.
8). This difference may be important, for example, when foods containing lead are consumed between meals. It has been
empirically estimated that for low exposures, resulting in blood lead levels of up to 30 &mu;g/dL, the ingestion of
1 &mu;g of lead per day in the diet results in an increase of 0.04 &mu;g/dL of lead in the blood of adults (Ref. 13). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Children are even more efficient at absorbing lead through the GI tract than are adults, with a rate of absorption of
approximately 50 percent (Ref. 8). In children, for exposures resulting in blood lead levels up to 10 &mu;g/dL, every
microgram of lead ingested per day from the diet increases the blood lead level by 0.16 &mu;g/dL. This level is approximately
four times as much lead in the blood per equivalent dose as in adults.

B. Need for Action to Lower Lead Specifications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since FDA began to regulate food additives in 1958, the agency has generally considered that the public health was
adequately protected by specifications of 3 ppm for arsenic, 10 ppm for lead, and 40 ppm for total heavy metals (as lead)
(Ref. 14). The agency believed that these specifications could readily be met in food additives produced under current
good manufacturing practice (CGMP) conditions, and that these specifications would ensure that food additives
would not contribute significant amounts of heavy metals to the diet. The agency also believed that the actual heavy-metal
levels achieved through adherence to CGMP's would be significantly lower than these limits (Ref. 15). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the Food Chemicals Codex was established by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) in 1961, the Food Chemicals
Codex committee adopted these specifications for nearly all food additives. These levels have remained until recently
as the levels used as guidance in establishing specifications in Food Chemicals Codex monographs for food ingredients.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, with today's increased knowledge of lead's deleterious effects at low ingestion levels, it is necessary
to decrease lead specifications for food and color additives and GRAS ingredients to protect the public health. Specifications
must be set at the lowest lead levels attainable through the diligent application of CGMP's to ensure that lead is reduced
to its lowest possible levels in food.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential exists, with the high current levels of lead specifications, that food and color additives and GRAS
ingredients will contribute significant amounts of lead to the diet. Even if most food ingredients do not contain
the maximum amount of lead permitted by the specifications, lead ingested from the use of food and color additives
and GRAS ingredients will comprise a small, although not readily quantifiable, percentage of a person's total dietary
lead intake. Because low level lead exposure is often the result of contributions from multiple small sources, significant
reductions in a person's overall lead exposure can result from reductions in the levels of lead in many of those sources.
Although some sources may be difficult to control, the agency believes that industry has the ability to reduce lead
levels in food and color additives and GRAS ingredients, either through tighter control of starting material purities
or improvements in manufacturing processes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To illustrate the potential lead exposure from food and color additives and GRAS ingredients, FDA has calculated
the possible per capita lead intake from the use of those additives and GRAS ingredients that are added to the U.S. food
supply in amounts greater than 25 million pounds per year1. These high consumption substances (currently 38) constitute
over 80 percent by weight of all substances in the 1987 NAS survey. The agency recognizes that the absolute poundages
of these substances may not be accurately portrayed in the survey because the information is voluntarily reported.
However, the agency believes that the data accurately reflect the relative ranking of the substances. Therefore,
the data are useful for illustrative purposes and can serve as a means of prioritizing actions on food ingredients
based on relative usage levels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 38 substances are listed in Table 1 in decreasing order of reported use, along with their maximum lead specifications.
When possible, the lead specifications that are either listed or referenced in FDA regulations for lead or heavy metals
(as lead) are shown. If no lead specification is referenced in FDA regulations, the most recent specification in the
Food Chemicals Codex (Refs. 16 through 18) is listed. For the few food substances that have no lead specification,
FDA used a lead level of 1 ppm to calculate the potential lead exposure.

Based upon the lead levels listed and the per capita intake of these substances, FDA calculates that the theoretical
maximum per capita intake of lead from the food use of these 38 widely used substances could reach 164 &mu;g/day if all
lead levels were at their maximum specification limits. Although it is clear from FDA's total diet study (Ref. 9) that
the amount of lead consumed (4.5 &mu;g/day for a 2-year-old child and 9 &mu;g/day for women of childbearing age) is
not nearly as high as the sum of these specifications would permit, the calculation illustrates the potential lead
exposure if food and color additives and GRAS ingredients were consistently produced with lead levels near the specification
limits. It also demonstrates that these specification levels are collectively well in excess of the levels of lead
in the ingredients actually being added to food.

This calculation is based upon disappearance data from a 1987 survey by the NAS on the quantities of food substances
added by the U.S. industry to food (Ref. 19). FDA recognizes that disappearance data identify the amounts of substances
available for use in food and food processing, but do not necessarily mean that all of these amounts are consumed in
food. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has also calculated the potential effect on the ingestion of lead if all of the lead specifications for these
38 substances were reduced. If the agency were to replace the current lead specifications with lower lead levels of
0.1 ppm for high volume substances (those with disappearance poundages greater than 100 million pounds/year) and
0.5 ppm for those of moderate volume (between 25 million and 100 million pounds per year), FDA has estimated that the
theoretical per capita intake of lead from these 38 most widely used food ingredients could be reduced from 164 &mu;g/day
to 13 &mu;g/day (Refs. 19 and 20). Although lead levels are generally not as high as current lead specifications allow,
lowering these specifications is likely to have the effect of lowering lead exposure. Manufacturers will be more
concerned about monitoring and controlling the lead content of their products to ensure that the lead levels are substantially
below the new specification levels, and that the normal variations in lead content that occur from batch to batch do
not produce a violative product. Also, lower lead specifications will protect subsets of the population that might
eat food that has been produced with food ingredients containing unusually high lead levels, if, for example, a particular
manufacturer uses a process that results in the food ingredient having a higher level of lead than average.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a further illustration, the agency has calculated the potential decrease in lead intake from reduction of lead
specifications in a specific color additive, caramel. Caramel currently has a 10 ppm lead limit specification in
FDA regulations (21 CFR 73.85). However, the food industry usually controls for contaminants at levels that are significantly
lower than the established specification levels to ensure that all production batches will be in compliance. From
informal conversations with industry, the agency believes that a reasonable control level might be one-fifth the
specification level. Using the data from the 1987 NAS poundage survey (Ref. 19), and assuming that all caramel is produced
with lead levels at one-fifth the specification, or 2 ppm, the agency calculates that the potential per capita lead
exposure from caramel could still be as high as 1.6 &mu;g/day. Reducing the specification to 0.1 ppm could result in
a potential 100-fold reduction in lead levels in caramel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
High fructose corn syrup (HFCS), one of the most heavily used food ingredients in the United States according to the
NAS poundage survey, illustrates the efforts industry has made to aid FDA and a Food Chemicals Codex committee in setting
lower lead specifications that more accurately reflect actual lead levels. HFCS has been commercially produced
since 1967, and FDA listed HFCS containing 43 percent fructose as GRAS in 1983 (21 CFR 182.1866). The listing, however,
does not include any specifications for impurities such as lead. In the absence of lead specifications, industry
was guided by the Food Chemicals Codex committee's general impurities policy that included a 10 ppm lead specification
(Ref. 16). It was not until 1986 that a Food Chemicals Codex monograph was developed for HFCS, which set a lead specification
of 1 ppm (Food Chemicals Codex, 3d ed., 2d supp. (Ref. 17)). The Food Chemicals Codex lead specification was further
reduced in 1992 to 0.5 ppm as a result of cooperative interactions between FDA, the Food Chemicals Codex, and industry.
In response to a request by the agency in 1990, industry provided preliminary data on lead levels in a small sampling
of HFCS measured by methods that are more sensitive than routine quality control methods. Actual lead levels ranged
between 0.002 and 0.073 ppm in the samples analyzed (Refs. 21 and 22). Although measurements with this level of sensitivity
are not yet done on a routine basis, these results suggest the actual amounts of lead in HFCS. Using these measurements,
a 12-ounce (oz) can of soda that contains 10 percent HFCS probably contains lead in the range of 0.07 to 2.6 &mu;g, whereas
existing lead specifications would allow 18 &mu;g of lead. Lowering the specification for lead in HFCS to 0.1 ppm would
reduce the maximum allowable lead from HFCS in a 12 oz can of soda to 3.6 &mu;g.

C. Changes in Food Chemicals Codex Lead Specifications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As part of FDA's initiative to reduce lead in food, the agency has been working with the Food Chemicals Codex committee
of the NAS to review lead specifications for selected food ingredients. The 3d edition of the Food Chemicals Codex
and its four supplements contain specifications and analytical methodologies for over 900 food ingredients. The
specifications are used by food processors and manufacturers of food ingredients in the United States and in other
countries as guidelines for their products' purity. The specifications are also often incorporated by reference
into FDA's regulations for food and color additives and GRAS ingredients.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency's concerns regarding lead levels in food ingredients were presented to the Food Chemicals Codex committee
during a workshop on May 2, 1991. For many substances, the Food Chemicals Codex currently specifies a 10-ppm lead limitation
(see section III.B. of this document). Following the workshop, the Food Chemicals Codex committee updated its policy
for establishing lead specifications for food ingredients. Previously, lead specifications were set at the lowest
practicable levels based on CGMP and the capability of analytical methodology to determine the lead level in individual
food ingredients. The Food Chemicals Codex committee's policy, announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of July 15, 1993 (58 FR 38129), now provides that the Food Chemicals Codex will set lead specifications by also considering
the estimated lead intake from use of the food ingredient and the potential health hazard of these intake levels, in
a fashion similar to that which the agency is considering.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As an outgrowth of the Food Chemicals Codex committee workshop, new and revised lower lead specifications have been
published for several food ingredients in the Food Chemicals Codex (3d ed., 3d supp. (Ref. 18)). For example, included
are lead specifications of 0.1 ppm for dextrose and fructose and 0.5 ppm for less refined products, such as glucose
syrups, maltodextrin, and polydextrose. The Food Chemicals Codex committee has been reviewing and revising the
lead specifications for other food and color additives and GRAS ingredients as well (Ref. 23). The Food Chemicals
Codex committee is expected to continue reducing lead specifications in future monograph revisions for inclusion
in the fourth edition of the Food Chemicals Codex. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Changes in FDA Lead Specifications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of the possibility that significant amounts of lead might be introduced into food from regulated food and
color additives and GRAS ingredients, and because of the increased knowledge of the deleterious health effects of
low level lead exposure, FDA has started to take action to limit the potential dietary intake of lead from these sources.
Based on the considerations discussed in section III. of this document, the agency is focusing on high and moderate
consumption substances, such as those listed in Table 1 of this document.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has begun requesting that information on lead levels be included in certain food and color additive and
GRAS affirmation petitions. FDA is asking that petitions for either new uses of regulated high and moderate consumption
substances, or new substances that are expected to be consumed in significant quantities, show that lead levels in
the petitioned products are as low as CGMP's allow. Given the toxicity of lead, such evidence is necessary if the agency
is to make a determination on the safety of the additive for its proposed use. The agency will evaluate the data that
it receives on lead levels during the petition review process and set lead specifications at levels that are necessary
to ensure that there is a reasonable certainty of no harm from use of the additive.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lower specifications, to be meaningful, will need to be supported by analytical methods that allow quantification
of lead at the reduced levels. Recent advances in instrumentation should allow for reliable, quantitative detection
of lead in food ingredients at much lower levels than possible with previous analytical methods. For example, in the
Food Chemicals Codex (3d ed., 3d supp. (Ref. 18)), a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometric method
is described that detects lead in substances such as edible oils at levels less than 1 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
&mu;g/g (1 ppm) of lead. A similar method has been developed for nutritive sweeteners (Ref. 24). Development of more
sensitive routine analytical procedures or expertise in more sophisticated methods will facilitate routine testing
for lead below 0.1 ppm and will enable industry to further control and eliminate lead from food ingredients. Thus,
the agency is asking petitioners to provide analytical methodologies that are capable of detecting lead at sub-ppm
levels and to show that these methodologies have been validated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recognizes the need to lower its lead specifications for high and moderately high consumption food and color additives
and GRAS ingredients to ensure that their use is safe. Thus, in the absence of persuasive comments to the contrary,
the agency intends to propose setting specifications at 0.1 ppm lead for high-poundage ingredients (greater than
100 million pounds per year, such as substances in the left column of Table 1) and 0.5 ppm lead for moderately high-poundage
ingredients (between 25 and 100 million pounds per year, such as substances in the right column of Table 1). FDA plans
to propose establishing these specifications for new ingredients, new uses of previously regulated ingredients,
and currently regulated ingredients. Also, FDA is considering only adopting Food Chemicals Codex lead specifications
for individual ingredients when it finds that the levels are low enough to protect the public health.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments on these approaches to setting specifications for lead, and suggestions for alternative approaches for
developing consistent lead specifications for all current and future uses of food and color additives and GRAS ingredients
that still protect the public health, are requested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Request for Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although FDA has extensive information concerning lead in its files, additional information on the following topics
will greatly assist the agency both in setting specifications for lead in food and color additives and GRAS ingredients
and in minimizing the exposure to lead in a consistent manner:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Current data on actual lead levels in: (a) Food and color additives and GRAS ingredients, the variation in these
levels, and suggested lead specifications for each substance. Of particular interest are the high consumption substances
in the left column of Table 1 of this document and the moderate consumption substances in the right column of Table 1.
Also of interest are other substances that, although consumed at a lower rate, contain sufficiently high levels of
lead to be of concern; (b) agricultural commodities that are raw materials for many food ingredients; and (c) nutrient
supplements (e.g., calcium, iron).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Analytical methods for detecting sub-ppm levels of lead in food components, including detection limits, reliability
of the methods for different food and color additives and GRAS ingredients, and validation data. Of particular interest
are improvements in graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry and studies of its applicability to the
38 substances listed in Table 1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Information on the potential economic impact, if any, associated with the manufacture of the 38 food and color additives
and GRAS ingredients listed in Table 1 if the lower lead levels are adopted. FDA is required to assess the economic consequences
of any regulation it proposes, but it does not possess data that would permit detailed assessment of the economic impact
of adopting lower lead specifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Information on the potential environmental impact that may be associated with the manufacture of the 38 food and
color additives and GRAS ingredients if lower lead specifications are adopted. Under the National Environmental
Policy Act, FDA must consider the environmental impact of its actions. However, the agency does not now possess the
data that would permit detailed analysis of the environmental impact of adopting lower lead levels. Therefore, the
agency is requesting environmental information that includes, but is not limited to, the following: (a) A description
of the additional steps, if any, required to produce these food and color additives and GRAS ingredients with the reduced
lead specifications and of the environmental impact of these steps; (b) the environmental impact of additional testing,
if any, performed to ensure compliance with the lower lead specifications; and (c) a description of measures that
could be taken to avoid or mitigate adverse environmental impacts, if such impacts are predicted to result from this
action.

VI. Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has had a longstanding goal of reducing lead exposure from all dietary sources. Because lead is ubiquitous, and
exposure to lead is from a multitude of different sources, lead levels from each source must be sufficiently low to
ensure that a person's total lead exposure is not harmful. The agency believes that lead specifications in food and
color additives and GRAS ingredients can be lowered to help achieve this goal and protect the public health. Therefore,
the agency intends to lower lead specifications in food and color additives and GRAS ingredients that are consumed
in large amounts by the general population to levels that will offer adequate protection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA plans to propose lead specifications of 0.5 ppm for moderate consumption food ingredients and 0.1 ppm for high
consumption food ingredients. The agency is requesting information on current lead levels in food ingredients and
analytical methods for determining these lead levels, and on the economic and environmental effects of complying
with these specifications. The information received in response to this ANPRM will be used to determine the feasibility
of adopting these target specifications. The agency intends to propose these specifications unless information
is submitted to show that such levels are not feasible and higher specifications will not endanger the public health.

 The purpose of this revision to the Missouri State Implementation Plan (SIP) is to incorporate the lead nonattainment
areas into the existing new source review (NSR) program. This revision changes the applicability requirements by
changing the definition of nonattainment area in the state regulations to include lead nonattainment areas, and
to delete the Kansas City area as a nonattainment area in light of its attainment of the ozone standards.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The objective of this proposed rulemaking is to approve the three Missouri lead nonattainment areas into the existing
NSR program in Missouri. This SIP revision contains the amendments to the SIP defining three areas in Missouri as nonattainment
for lead. In 1978, when EPA promulgated the lead National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), it was not authorized
to designate areas nonattainment, attainment, or unclassifiable for lead. Under the Clean Air Act Amendments of
1990 (CAAA)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=1 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA was authorized to require states to designate areas as nonattainment, attainment, or unclassifiable for lead.
On November 6, 1991, at 56 FR 56694, EPA designated the following areas as nonattainment for lead: the city of Herculaneum
in Jefferson County; and the Dent, Liberty, and Arcadia townships in Iron County. The designations were effective
January 6, 1992.

 The 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act made significant changes to the Act. See Pub. L. No. 101-549, 104 Stat. 2399.

1. Lead NSR
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CAAA made numerous changes to the NSR requirements in the Clean Air Act (CAA). Once an area has been designated nonattainment
for lead, a state is required to adopt a permit program for the construction and operation of new or modified major stationary
sources anywhere in the nonattainment area. For areas designated nonattainment for the primary lead NAAQS subsequent
to enactment of the 1990 Amendments, section 191(a) requires that within 18 months of designation, states submit
SIPs which, among other nonattainment planning requirements, have a nonattainment program consistent with the
provisions of part D of the Act, including sections 172 and 173 of the Act as amended. Section 172(c)(5) requires that
states submit provisions requiring permits for the construction and operation of new or modified major stationary
sources anywhere in the nonattainment area in accordance with the provisions of section 173.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Limited Approval/Disapproval Status
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to grant this SIP submittal limited approval because it does not meet all of the applicable requirements
of the Act
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. However, this proposed limited approval strengthens the existing SIP as representing an improvement over what
is currently in the SIP, and as meeting some of the applicable requirements of the Act. In particular, the amendment
means that Missouri's NSR requirements, which meet all of the provisions of the preamended Act, apply to new and modified
sources of lead in the nonattainment areas.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA may grant such a limited approval under section 110(k)(3) of the Act, in light of the general authority delegated
to EPA under section 301(a) of the Act to take actions necessary to carryout the purposes of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, the Missouri rule does not meet all the specific requirements of part D. These include, among others, requirements
for alternate site analyses as part of NSR for all sources in nonattainment areas. Therefore, EPA is proposing only
a ``limited'' approval of this SIP. If the state fails to submit the additional revisions, EPA will be required to issue
a limited disapproval at a later date.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Impact of this Rule Revision on Kansas City Attainment Status
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Missouri's rule change also eliminates the Kansas City metropolitan area from the definition of nonattainment area,
reflecting the redesignation of Kansas City to attainment for ozone on June 23, 1992 (57 FR 27939). Once an area is redesignated
to attainment, nonattainment NSR requirements are no longer required. The attainment area is then subject to prevention
of significant deterioration requirements instead of the NSR program. Missouri has amended its rules consistent
with these requirements.

EPA Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is soliciting public comments on all aspects of this notice and on issues relevant to EPA's proposed action. Comments
will be considered before taking final action. Interested parties may participate in the Federal rulemaking procedure
by submitting timely written comments to the address above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5. U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities
(5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under sections 110 and 301, and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but
simply approve requirements that the state is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does
not impose any new requirements, EPA certifies that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected.
Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility
analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA
to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds (

2 and 3 SIP revisions from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. EPA has submitted
a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time
as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12886 which superseded Executive
Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA proposes to conditionally approve revisions to the State implementation plan (SIP) for ozone submitted by the
state of Missouri. This portion of the implementation plan was submitted by the state to satisfy Clean Air Act (CAA)
requirements for adoption of rules for application of reasonably available control technology (RACT) for oxides
of nitrogen (NO

a notice, ``State Implementation Plans; Nitrogen Oxides Supplement to the General Preamble; Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990 Implementation of Title I; Proposed Rule,'' published November 25, 1992 (57 FR 55620). The November 25, 1992,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Analysis of State Submission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, section 110(k)(4) of the CAA allows EPA to accept a commitment from states to adopt portions of SIPs
rather than the SIP itself. For example, EPA may, in certain cases, accept a commitment from states to adopt NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 RACT rules rather than the NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 RACT rule itself. The NO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Supplement to the General Preamble (57 FR 55623) and the aforementioned memorandums of July 22, 1992, and September
16, 1992, outline EPA's criteria for acceptability of committal SIPs for the NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 RACT rules. The following is a statement of the criteria and an analysis of how Missouri's submittal meets these criteria.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The State must provide a description of the reason for the committal SIP versus a full SIP submittal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A discussion of the reasoning behind the State's submission of an NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 RACT committal SIP is provided on page 2 of the SIP submission. Missouri's decision to submit an NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 RACT committal SIP instead of a full SIP submittal was twofold. First, urban airshed modeling (UAM) will identify
the role of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions in ozone formation but the modeling exercise will not be completed until 1994, consistent with the UAM submission
date. Since it was not clear to the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) on November 15, 1992, that NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emission reductions would be effective in reducing ozone concentrations, it was not practical for Missouri to submit
NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 RACT regulations at that time. Secondly, EPA failed to provide states with NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 RACT guidance by November 15, 1992, making the development of a full NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 RACT SIP by that date an ambiguous target for Missouri. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, in the committal SIP, Missouri has committed to submit NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 RACT regulations by October 31, 1994, unless St. Louis qualifies for an exemption pursuant to section 182(f) of the
Act. Missouri is also aware that the Act requires NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 RACT to be implemented by May 1995. The committal SIP schedule is consistent with this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The State must provide documentation that credible photochemical grid modeling is not available or that such modeling
did not consider the effects of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reductions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This documentation is provided on page 2 of the committal SIP. According to MDNR, UAM was previously conducted in St.
Louis in 1985; however, at that time the UAM was not used to focus on the effect of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control strategies in St. Louis. The only UAM exercise available to examine NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions will be the current exercise which is being conducted pursuant to the requirements of section 182(j) of
the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. The State must identify the resources which are available to complete UAM modeling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pages 10 through 13 describe the resources being utilized to complete the enormous task of UAM-based modeling demonstration.
There are ten separate organizations and agencies that MDNR and the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency have
organized into two committees to provide input to the UAM. The committees are the ``UAM Policy and Oversight Committee''
and the ``Ozone Technical Subcommittee.'' Additionally, MDNR provided a list of the individuals responsible for
conducting certain portions of the UAM demonstration and a list of the equipment which has been made available to execute
the model and the post processing analysis. EPA believes that the State has provided an adequate demonstration of
resources available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The State must provide a schedule outlining the milestones that have been and will be achieved towards the completion
of the NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 RACT rules. The schedule must include a date for final submittal of rules to EPA. The date for submitting the final rules
to EPA must be no later than 12 months after EPA's final approval of the committal SIP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Page 6 of the SIP submission contains an enforceable schedule. Critical dates included in this schedule are the UAM
final submission date (November 15, 1993) and submittal of final NO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 RACT regulations to EPA (October 31, 1994). Missouri failed to submit the final UAM modeling exercise by November
15, 1993. However, EPA Region VII is working closely with the state on this submission. We are encouraged by Missouri's
progress and we believe that the submission of the final NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 RACT regulations (if necessary) will not be delayed beyond October 31, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

B. Procedural Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act requires states to observe certain procedural requirements in developing implementation plans and plan
revisions for submission to EPA. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each implementation plan submitted by
a state must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing. Section 172(c)(7) of the Act requires that plan
provisions for nonattainment areas meet the applicable provisions of section 110(a)(2). Section 110(l) of the Act
similarly provides that each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a state under the Act must be adopted
by such state after reasonable notice and public hearing. The state of Missouri held a public hearing on April 29, 1993,
on the commitment to adopt NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 RACT rules for St. Louis. Following the public hearing, the commitment was adopted by the state and signed by the Director
of MDNR on May 27, 1993, and submitted to EPA on June 14, 1993, as a revision to the SIP.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 RACT rule(s) as an SIP revision submitted to EPA for the St. Louis area June 14, 1993. Section 110(k)(4) of the Act provides
that where EPA takes final action to approve a commitment to submit an SIP or portion of an SIP, the state must fulfill
that commitment (i.e., submit the required SIP or portion thereof) within one year following EPA approval. If the
state does not fulfill its commitment by submitting the SIP or revision to EPA within that year, the Act requires that
the SIP be disapproved. If EPA disapproves the SIP for failing to meet the commitment, there are several additional
consequences. As provided under section 179 of the Act, the state of Missouri would have up to 18 months after a final
SIP disapproval to correct the deficiencies that are the subject of the disapproval, before EPA is required to impose
either the highway funding restriction or the requirement for two-to-one new source review offsets. If the state
has not corrected its deficiencies within six months after imposing the first sanction, EPA must impose the second
sanction. Any sanction EPA imposes must remain in place until EPA determines that the state has come into compliance.
If EPA ultimately disapproves all or part of the SIP submittal for the St. Louis nonattainment area and the state of
Missouri fails to correct the deficiency within 18 months of such disapproval, EPA anticipates that the first sanction
it would impose would be the two-to-one offset requirement. Note also that any final disapproval would trigger the

VI. Regulatory Flexibility
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing
the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, EPA may certify that
the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small
businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of
less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conditional approvals of SIP submittals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements,
but simply approve requirements that the state is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP approval
does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on affected small entities.
Moreover, due to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility
analysis would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA
to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Union Electric Co.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 v.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
U.S. E.P.A.,

 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the conditional approval is converted to a disapproval under section 110(k), based on the state's failure to meet
the commitment, it will not affect any existing state requirements applicable to small entities. Federal disapproval
of the state submittal does not affect its state enforceability. Moreover, EPA's disapproval of the submittal does
not impose a new federal requirement. Therefore, EPA certifies that this disapproval action does not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small entities, because it does not remove existing state requirements or substitute
a new federal requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking action to propose approval of Title 120&hyph;01 of the Commonwealth
of Virginia's Regulations for the Control and Abatement of Air Pollution, Part IV, Rule 4&hyph;37 (Petroleum Liquid
Storage and Transfer Operations), &sect;&sect;120&hyph;04&hyph;3701 to 120&hyph;04&hyph;3715 and Appendices
P and S, as a revision to the Virginia State Implementation Plan (SIP) for ozone. The effective date for Virginia's
State regulation is January 1, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 5, 1992, the Commonwealth of Virginia submitted a SIP revision request to EPA to satisfy the Clean Air Act
as amended in 1990 (the Act), which requires all ozone nonattainment areas classified as moderate or worse to require
owners and operators of gasoline dispensing facilities to install and operate Stage II vapor recovery equipment.
This revision applies to the Virginia portion of the Washington, DC ozone nonattainment area and the Richmond ozone
nonattainment area. This revision also contains several other minor amendments to Virginia's Rule 4&hyph;37. Although
these changes do not necessarily pertain to the Stage II program, they will affect the non-Stage II requirements previously
established by this proposed rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under section 182(b)(3) of the Act, EPA was required to issue guidance as to the effectiveness of Stage II systems.
In November 1991, EPA issued technical and enforcement guidance to meet this requirement.

 In addition, on April 16, 1992, EPA published the ``General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990'' (General Preamble) (57 FR 13498). The guidance documents and the General Preamble interpret
the Stage II statutory requirement and indicate what EPA believes a State submittal needs to include to meet that requirement.

The Virginia portion of the Washington, DC metropolitan statistical area (MSA) is designated nonattainment for
ozone and classified as serious. The Richmond MSA is also designated nonattainment for ozone, and is classified as
moderate. See 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991) and 57 FR 56762 (Nov. 30, 1992), codified at 40 CFR 81.347. Under section
182(b)(3) of the Act, Virginia was required to submit Stage II vapor recovery rules for these areas by November 15,
1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 5, 1992, the Virginia Department of Air Pollution Control, now known as the Department of Environmental
Quality (DEQ), submitted to EPA Stage II vapor recovery rules for the Northern Virginia and Richmond areas that were
adopted by the Commonwealth on October 5, 1992. By today's action, EPA is proposing to approve this submittal as meeting
the requirements of section 182(b)(3) of the Act. EPA has reviewed the Commonwealth's submittal against the statutory
requirements and for consistency with EPA guidance. A summary of EPA's analysis is provided below; in addition, a
more detailed analysis of the State submittal is contained in a technical support document for this action, dated
September 15, 1993, which is available from the Region III Office, at the address listed in the

I. Applicability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 182(b)(3) of the Act, states were required by November 15, 1992 to adopt regulations requiring owners
or operators of gasoline dispensing systems to install and operate vapor recovery equipment at their facilities.
Virginia has adopted Stage II measures for the Northern Virginia (Virginia portion of the Washington DC MSA) and the
Richmond areas, as required by the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 182(b)(3)(A) of the Act specifies that Stage II controls must apply to any facility that dispenses more than
10,000 gallons of gasoline per month or, in the case of an independent small business marketer (ISBM), any facility
that dispenses more than 50,000 gallons of gasoline per month. The Commonwealth has adopted a general applicability
requirement for those gasoline dispensing facilities having an average monthly throughput (as described below)
of over 10,000 gallons per month and those independent small business marketers dispensing over 50,000 gallons per
month.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with EPA's Enforcement Guidance and the General Preamble (57 FR 13514), the Commonwealth has provided
that the gallons of gasoline dispensed per month will be the ``average monthly throughput''. The Commonwealth has
defined this term in &sect;120&hyph;04&hyph;3702 of Rule 4&hyph;37 as the volume dispensed per month for the two
most recent consecutive calendar years, or some other two year period that is more representative of normal operations.
Downtime shall not be included when determining average monthly throughput. The board of the DEQ may allow the use
of an alternative time period for calculation of average monthly throughput if it determines that such a period is
more representative of normal operations at that facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commonwealth has specified that the Stage II requirements set forth in Rule 4&hyph;37 apply to all gasoline dispensing
facilities with an average monthly throughput of over 10,000 gallons (and ISBMs with average monthly throughput
of 50,000 gallons or more), including retail outlets and fleet fueling facilities. Gasoline dispensing devices
that exclusively refuel marine vessels, aircraft, farm equipment, and emergency vehicles are exempted under Virginia's
Stage II regulation. The Commonwealth has determined that these exempted facilities will generally fall below the
applicability threshold of 10,000 gallons per month. Additionally, many of the facilities that otherwise fall within
these exempted categories are ineligible for exemption because they do not exclusively refuel vehicles within these
categories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 324(c) of the Act establishes a statutory definition of an ISBM, which is fully set forth in the technical support
document for this action. The Commonwealth has adopted the statutory definition of an ISBM in &sect;120&hyph;04&hyph;3702
of its regulations. For clarity on the definition of an ISBM, the public may refer to the technical support document
for this action or the Clean Air Act.

II. Implementation of Stage II 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Virginia adopted its regulations on October 5, 1992, and submitted them to EPA as a SIP revision on November 5, 1992.
The Act specifies the times by which certain facilities must comply with a State's Stage II regulation, calculated
from the time of State adoption of the regulation. For facilities that are not owned or operated by an ISBM, the statutory
deadlines are: (1) 6 months from the time of State adoption (i.e. April 5, 1993 for Virginia) of the regulation for facilities
for which construction began after November 15, 1990, (2) 1 year from the time of State adoption of the regulation (i.e.
October 5, 1993 for Virginia) for facilities that dispense over 100,000 gallons of gasoline per month; and (3) 2 years
from the time of State adoption (i.e. October 5, 1994 for Virginia) for all other facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commonwealth's regulation provides that subject facilities must install and operate Stage II: (1) Upon start-up,
for facilities that began construction after January 1, 1993; (2) by May 15, 1993, for existing facilities that began
construction after November 15, 1990 and before January 1, 1993; (3) by November 15, 1993, for existing facilities
that began construction before November 15, 1990 and have an average monthly throughput of over 100,000 gallons per
month; and (4) by November 15, 1994, for all other subject existing facilities which began actual construction before
November 15, 1990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 182(b)(3) of the Act provides that a State's timetable for implementation must begin with the date of adoption
of the Stage II rules, and then defines adoption to mean the date the State adopts the requirements for installation
and operation of Stage II equipment. Although Virginia adopted its Stage II regulations on October 5, 1992, EPA believes
that it can approve Virginia's treatment of the adoption date as being November 15, 1992 under the limited circumstances
presented in this submittal, as explained below.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to approve Virginia's implementation schedule which began on November 15, 1992 for several reasons.
First, EPA recognizes that the date by which the Commonwealth was required to adopt Stage II regulations matches the
date by which the Commonwealth was required to submit the regulations to EPA. Thus, Virginia could have waited to adopt
the Stage II regulations on November 15, 1992 and still have met the required submittal date. Second, the implementation
date established by the Commonwealth, November 15, 1992, began shortly after the adoption date of the regulation.
Third, the Commonwealth would have a limited ability to remedy this deficiency. If Virginia chose to withdraw it SIP
revision and readopt this Stage II requirement, the time table could be based upon a date that is later than November
15, 1992. Finally, EPA believes the Virginia rule otherwise fulfills the Stage II requirements and will provide substantial
air quality benefits to the regulated areas. Therefore, EPA believes it is in the public interest to approve and make
federally enforceable Virginia's Stage II regulation at the earliest time feasible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Additional Program Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with EPA's guidance, the Commonwealth requires that Stage II systems be tested and certified to meet a
95 percent emission reduction efficiency by using a system certified by the California Air Resources Board. Additionally,
Virginia requires that Stage II systems employed to comply with this program utilize coaxial vapor recovery hose
check valves that do not impede the performance of Stage II functional tests. The Commonwealth requires subject facilities
to verify proper installation and function of Stage II equipment through use of a liquid blockage test, a vapor space
tie test and a pressure decay/leak test prior to system operation. Additionally, every five years, or upon major modification
of a facility (i.e. 75 percent or more equipment change), or if requested after an inspection by the Commonwealth that
shows evidence of a system malfunction, the source must conduct a liquid blockage test and a pressure decay/leak test.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to recordkeeping, the Commonwealth has adopted those items recommended in EPA's guidance and specifies
that sources subject to Stage II must make the following documents available upon request: (1) A license or permit
to install and operate a Stage II system; (2) results of verification tests; (3) equipment maintenance and compliance
file logs indicating compliance with manufacturer's specifications and requirements; and (4) training certification
files. In addition, Virginia requires facilities that are not subject to Stage II to maintain files containing the
gasoline throughput of the facility and make them available upon request by the DEQ. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Virginia has indicated that it plans to conduct a compliance inspection for each subject facility at least one time
per year with follow-up inspections at noncomplying facilities. These inspections will include both visual and
functional equipment inspections. For a detailed listing of the tests to be conducted at the annual inspections,
see the technical support document for this action. The Commonwealth has authority to enforce violations of the Stage
II requirements, as set forth in Rule 4&hyph;37 and Virginia's policies and procedures document entitled, ``Procedures
for Implementation of Regulations Covering Stage II Vapor Recovery Systems for Gasoline Dispensing Facilities''
(AQP&hyph;9). This enforcement authority is found in &sect;10.1&hyph;1307.3 of the Code of Virginia. For further
information on Virginia's enforcement authority and penalty limits for this program, please refer to the technical
support document for this action.

IV. Regulatory Changes Affecting Other Petroleum Storage and Transfer Operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

On October 5, 1992, Virginia's State Air Pollution Control Board adopted an amended version of its regulations entitled
``Regulations for the Control and Abatement of Air Pollution''; VR 120&hyph;01, Rule 4 37, &sect;&sect;120&hyph;04&hyph;3701
to 120&hyph;04&hyph;3715 (effective date_January 1, 1993). Virginia submitted this revised rule to EPA on November
5, 1992 for the purposes of satisfying the Stage II requirements set forth in the Act. However, Virginia's Rule 4&hyph;37
consolidates Stage II vapor recovery requirements for gasoline dispensing facilities with existing regulations
that establish Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) related to petroleum liquid storage and transfer
categories, including: Stage I vapor recovery, floating and fixed roof petroleum storage tanks, and gasoline bulk
plants.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several changes made to Rule 4&hyph;37 for the purposes of incorporating Stage II requirements directly affect the
other petroleum transfer and storage requirements covered by Rule 4&hyph;37. Section 120&hyph;04&hyph;3701(D)
of Rule 4&hyph;37 places, for the first time, the burden of proof for eligibility for exemption from any portion of
the rule on the owner. Facilities seeking compliance exemptions (based upon throughput thresholds) for any petroleum
storage and transfer operation covered by Rule 4&hyph;37 are now required to retain records to prove their exempt
status. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 120&hyph;04&hyph;3703(D)(3) of Rule 4&hyph;37 has been revised to change the applicability requirement
for vapor recovery controls at gasoline loading bulk plants. The applicability exemption for facilities with average
daily throughput of less than 4,000 gallons is now based upon a thirty day rolling average, instead of total average
throughput. Average daily throughput must now be calculated for the two most recent years, for which time if this value
exceeds 4,000 gallons per day, the facility is subject to the vapor recovery requirements for bulk plants.

V. Regulatory Changes Affecting VOC Control Areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commonwealth has revised Appendix P of Rule 4&hyph;37 to separately list nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions control
areas, in addition to listing VOC emissions control areas. The list of VOC emissions control areas submitted in this
November 5, 1992 revision is unchanged from that of the May 10, 1991 SIP revision submitted to satisfy the requirements
of section 182(a)(2)(A) of the Act_otherwise known as ``RACT fix-ups''. Additionally, a list of NOx emission control
areas identical to the VOC emission control areas list has been added. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because EPA believes that the State has adopted a Stage II regulation in accordance with section 182(b)(3) of the Act,
as interpreted in EPA's guidance, EPA is proposing to approve Title 120&hyph;01 of the Commonwealth of Virginia's
Regulations for the Control and Abatement of Air Pollution, part IV, Rule 4&hyph;37 (Petroleum Liquid Storage and
Transfer Operations), &sect;&sect;120&hyph;04&hyph;3701 to 120&hyph;04&hyph;3715 and Appendices P and S, as
a revision to the Virginia State Implementation Plan (SIP) for ozone as meeting the requirements of sections 182(b)(3).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to a SIP shall be considered in light of specific technical, economic,
and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The Act forbids EPA to base its
actions concerning SIP's on such grounds.

This proposed approval action for Stage II gasoline vapor recovery for Virginia has been classified as a Table 2 action
by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table
2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of 2 years (54 FR 2222).
The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue
the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request is still applicable under Executive Order 12866
which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administrator's decision to approve or disapprove Virginia's Stage II gasoline vapor recovery SIP revision
will be based on whether it meets the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(A)&hyph;(K), 110(a)(3), and part D of the
Clean Air Act, as amended, and EPA regulations in 40 CFR part 51.

The FHWA has established a special telephone number, 1&hyph;800&hyph;832&hyph;5660, for inquiries about this
notice, the hearing deficiencies advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM), and the hearing deficiencies study.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On December 15, 1993, the FHWA published an ANPRM (Docket MC&hyph;93&hyph;30) that requested comments on whether
there is a need to amend the Agency's driver qualification requirements relating to hearing. 58 FR 65634. The current
Federal hearing standard is at 49 CFR 391.41(b)(11). The FHWA believes that a review of the hearing standard is necessary
to assess its continued relevance and the effect advances in medical science and technology may have on it. Such advances
may lead to amending the current standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA simultaneously published a notice of its intent to initiate a study examining the relationship between hearing
deficiencies and safe operation of commercial motor vehicles, and sought comments on that notice (Docket MC&hyph;93&hyph;25).
58 FR 65638. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public was notified that the FHWA would accept comments on both notices for the periods listed above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety (AHAS), an organization with an expressed interest in highway safety issues,
subsequently requested that the FHWA extend each comment period by 60 days. The AHAS stated it needed additional time
to gather information about the history of the hearing standard and the effect that hearing deficiencies may have
on safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA is mindful of the need for all interested parties to have enough time to prepare thoughtful comments. The FHWA
therefore is extending the deadline for comments to Docket MC&hyph;93&hyph;30 an additional 60 days and is reopening
Docket MC&hyph;93&hyph;25 for 60 days. As indicated in the Rulemaking Analyses and Notices section of the ANPRM,
all comments received before the close of business on the comment closing dates indicated above will be considered
and will be available for examination in the dockets at the above address. Comments received after the closing dates
will be filed in the dockets and will be considered to the extent practicable. In addition to late comments, the FHWA
will continue to file relevant information in the dockets as it becomes available after the comment closing dates,
and interested persons should continue to examine the dockets for new material.

Masticophis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lateralis euryxanthus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) as endangered pursuant to the Endangered Species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The three species are found in northern

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These animals and the foodplants of the larval butterflies occur on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
private, county, and State land, and are imperiled by one or more of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following: overcollecting, commercial and residential development, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
competition from alien plants, inappropriate levels of livestock 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grazing, off-road vehicle use, trampling by hikers and livestock, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perhaps stochastic (i.e., random) extinction by virtue of the small, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
isolated nature of the remaining populations. This proposal, if made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final, would implement protection provided by the Act for these animals.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Speyeria callippe callippe
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
member of the Nymphalidae family. The animal was described by J.A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Boisduval (1852) from specimens collected during the month of June by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pierre Lorquin in San Francisco, California (dos Passos and Grey 1947). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Arnold (1983, 1985) conducted taxonomic studies on the subspecies of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Speyeria callippe
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 using wing characters. His investigation concluded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the species consisted of 3 subspecies rather than the widely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognized and accepted 16 subspecies. Based on his study, the range of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Speyeria callippe callippe
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would extend from Oregon to southern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California and east into the Great Basin (Arnold 1985). A comprehensive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis of this species found that the original classification remains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more appropriate and that subspecies 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
callippe 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is restricted to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
northern San Francisco Bay region (Hammond 1986, Murphy undated). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hammond determined that the analysis by Arnold used invalid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
morphological characteristics. The Service recognizes the conclusions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Hammond (1986) and the distribution of the callippe silverspot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
butterfly as described by Sterling Mattoon (Sterling Mattoon, amateur 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lepidopterist,

1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The callippe silverspot butterfly is a medium-sized butterfly with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a wingspan of approximately 55 millimeters (2.17 inches). The upper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wings are brown with extensive black spots and lines, and the basal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas are extremely melanic (dark-colored). The undersides are brown, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
orange-brown, and tan with black lines and distinctive black and bright 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
silver spots. The basal areas of the wings and body are densely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pubescent (hairy). The discal area on the upper wings of the callippe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
silverspot butterfly is darker and more extensively yellow on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hindwings than the related Lilian's silverspot butterfly (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Speyeria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
callippe liliana
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The callippe silverspot butterfly is larger and has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a darker ground color with more melanic areas on the basal areas of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wings than Comstock's silverspot butterfly (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Speyeria callippe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comstocki
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The callippe silverspot butterfly is found in native grassland and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjacent habitats (Steiner 1990; Mattoon, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1991; Thomas Reid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Associates 1982). The females lay their eggs on the dry remains of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
larval foodplant, Johnny jump-up (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Viola pedunculata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surrounding debris (Arnold 1981, Thomas Reid Associates 1982). Upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hatching after about a week, the larvae eat their egg shells. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
caterpillars wander a short distance and spin a silk pad upon which they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spend the summer and winter. The larvae are dark-colored with many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
branching sharp spines on the back. Upon termination of diapause in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spring, the caterpillars immediately seek out the foodplant. In May, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after having gone through five instars (i.e., skin sheddings), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
larvae form pupa within a chamber of leaves that they have drawn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
together with silk. The adults emerge in about 2 weeks and live for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 3 weeks. Depending upon environmental conditions, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flight period of this single-brooded butterfly ranges from mid-May to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
late July. The adults exhibit hilltopping behavior, a phenomenon in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which males and females seek a topographic summit to mate (Shields 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1967). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The callippe silverspot butterfly was known historically to occur 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in seven populations in the San Francisco Bay region. This animal does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not occur north of the Golden Gate or Carquinez Straits (Mattoon, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1991; Paul Opler, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, pers. comm., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1992). The historic range of the callippe silverspot butterfly includes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the inner coast range on the eastern shore of San Francisco Bay from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
northwestern Contra Costa County south to the Castro Valley area in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alameda County. On the west side of the Bay, it ranged from San 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Francisco south to the vicinity of La Honda in San Mateo County. Five 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
colonies, including the one located at Twin Peaks in San Francisco, were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extirpated. The remaining colonies exist on mostly privately owned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
land, but also on city, county, and State owned land. Currently, extant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
colonies are known only from San Bruno Mountain in San Mateo County and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a city park (Mattoon, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Behren's silverspot butterfly (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Speyeria zerene behrensii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
member of the Nymphalidae family. William H. Edwards described this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxon in 1869 based on an adult male collected by an unknown 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lepidopterist in Mendocino, California (dos Passos and Grey 1947, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Edwards 1869). It is a medium-sized butterfly with a wingspan of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 55 millimeters (2.17 inches). The upper surfaces are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
golden brown with numerous black spots and lines. The undersides are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brown, orange-brown, and tan with black lines and distinctive silver and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
black spots. The basal areas of the wings and body are densely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pubescent.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Behren's silverspot butterfly is similar in appearance to two other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subspecies of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Speyeria zerene
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Hammond 1980, Howe 1975, McCorkle and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hammond 1988). The threatened Oregon silverspot butterfly (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Speyeria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
zerene hippolyta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) has lighter basal suffusion on the upper sides of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wings than Behren's silverspot butterfly. Another related taxon, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
endangered Myrtle's silverspot butterfly (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Speyeria zerene myrtleae
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
larger in size and also lighter in color than 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Speyeria zerene behrensii.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Behren's silverspot butterfly inhabits coastal terrace prairie 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat. The life history of Behren's silverspot butterfly is similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the callippe silverspot butterfly. The females lay their eggs in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
debris and dried stems of the larval foodplant, violet (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Viola adunca
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(McCorkle 1980, McCorkle and Hammond 1988). Upon hatching, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
caterpillars wander a short distance and spin a silk pad upon which they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pass the fall and winter. The larvae are dark-colored with many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
branching sharp spines on the back. The caterpillars immediately seek 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
out the foodplant upon termination of diapause in the spring. Each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
larva then forms a pupa within a chamber of leaves that they have drawn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
together with silk. The adults emerge in about 2 weeks and live for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 3 weeks. Depending upon environmental conditions, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flight period of this single brooded butterfly ranges from July to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
August. Adult males patrol open areas in search of newly emerged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
females. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The historic range of Behren's silverspot butterfly extends from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the mouth of the Russian River in Sonoma County northward along the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediate coast to southern Mendocino County in the vicinity of Point 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Arena (Mattoon, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., 1989). The six historic populations were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
known to occur in coastal terrace prairie and adjacent habitats. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
single extant population, which was recently discovered, occurs on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
privately owned land near Point Arena in Mendocino County. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Alameda whipsnake (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Masticophis lateralis euryxanthus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
member of the Colubridae family (Morey and Bioassay 1988). It was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described by William Reimer (1954) from a specimen collected in Berkeley 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hills, Alameda County, California. The common name ``Alameda whipsnake'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is utilized in this proposed rule instead of ``Alameda striped racer'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that was used in the November 21, 1991, Animal Notice of Review (56 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
58804). ``Whipsnake'' is a widely recognized common name for other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
members of the genus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Masticophis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Stebbins 1985). The Alameda whipsnake 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is a slender, fast moving diurnal snake with a narrow neck and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relatively broad head with large eyes. The dorsal surface is colored 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sooty black or dark brown with a distinct yellow-orange stripe down each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
side. The anterior portions of the ventral surface are orange-rufous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
colored, the midsection is cream colored, and the posterior and tail are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pinkish. The adults reach a length of 91 to 122 centimeters (3 to 4 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feet). This subspecies is distinguished from the more common California 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whipsnake (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. l. lateralis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) by its comparatively wide orange stripes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which run laterally down each side. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Alameda whipsnake inhabits the inner coast range in western and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
central Contra Costa and Alameda Counties (McGinnis 1992). One of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two major populations extends from approximately El Sorbante south to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about Hayward. The second is found from Clayton/Mount Diablo southeast 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Vasco Road area. It occurs mostly on privately owned land, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also occurs on State and county land. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Alameda whipsnake usually is found in northern coastal scrub or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chaparral, but it also may occur in adjacent habitats. This extremely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fast-moving, lizard-eating specialist holds its head high off the ground 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a cobra-like manner to peer over grass or rocks at potential prey. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Alameda whipsnake has been found to exhibit territorial behavior, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possessing home ranges varying in size from 2 to 8.7 hectares (5.0 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21.5 acres). Some animals have been recorded to have moved over 1 mile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while traversing their areas (McGinnis 1992). The life history of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alameda whipsnake is not well understood (Goldberg 1975, Hammerson 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1978). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A proposed rule to list the callippe silverspot butterfly as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
endangered with critical habitat was published on July 3, 1978 (43 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
28938). The critical habitat portion of that proposal was withdrawn by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Service on March 6, 1979 (44 FR 12382), because of procedural and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other substantive changes in the Endangered Species Act by the 1978 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendments. The Service again published a proposed rule to designate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat for the callippe silverspot butterfly on March 28, 1980 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(45 FR 20503). The proposed rule to list the callippe silverspot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
butterfly was withdrawn on September 30, 1980 (45 FR 64607), because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1978 Endangered Species Act amendments required that the final rule for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the species be completed within 2 years after the date of publication 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing to list it as endangered or threatened. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The callippe silverspot butterfly was listed as a category 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
candidate species in the May 22, 1984 (49 FR 21664), and January 6, 1989 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(54 FR 554), Animal Notices of Review. This category includes species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that may be appropriate to list as endangered or threatened, but for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which conclusive data on their biological vulnerability is not currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to support proposed rules. The species was listed as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
category 1 candidate species in the November 21, 1991 (56 FR 58804), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Animal Notice of Review because of increased threats from overcollecting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(see Factor B in the ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section). This category includes taxa for which the Service has on file 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enough substantial information on biological vulnerability and threats 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to propose listing them as endangered or threatened.

Ms. Dee Warenycia petitioned the Service to list the callippe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
silverspot butterfly as an endangered species in a letter dated January 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14, 1991, which was received on January 22, 1991. The Service completed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a status review and determined that enough information exists to propose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the species for listing. This proposal constitutes the final finding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the petitioned action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 20, 1975, Behren's silverspot butterfly was listed as 1 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
42 insects whose status was being reviewed for listing as either 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
endangered or threatened by the Service (40 FR 12691). This insect was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listed as a category 2 species in the May 22, 1984 (49 FR 21664), and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 6, 1989 (54 FR 554), Animal Notices of Review. Dr. Dennis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Murphy of Stanford University petitioned the Service to list Behren's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
silverspot butterfly as an endangered species in a letter dated June 28, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1989, which was received on June 29, 1989. The Service determined that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the petition contained substantial information indicating that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested action may be warranted and published notice of the 90-day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finding on November 1, 1990 (55 FR 46080). The Service did not receive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any new information in response to the November 1, 1990, notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the species was listed as a category 1 species in the November 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21, 1991 (56 FR 58804), Animal Notice of Review on the basis of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant increases in habitat loss and threats occurring throughout 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its range. This proposal constitutes the final finding for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petitioned action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Alameda whipsnake (as the Alameda striped racer) was listed as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a category 2 candidate species in the September 18, 1985 (50 FR 37958), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Vertebrate Wildlife Notice of Review. In the January 6, 1989 (54 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
554), Animal Notice of Review, the Service again included the Alameda 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whipsnake as a category 2 candidate species and solicited additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information on its status. The November 21, 1991 (56 FR 58804), Animal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice of Review included the Alameda whipsnake as a category 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
candidate species on the basis of significant increases in habitat loss 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and threats occurring throughout its range. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal to list the callippe silverspot butterfly, Behren's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
silverspot butterfly, and Alameda whipsnake is based on the best 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available scientific and commercial information, various scientific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
papers and unpublished reports available to the Service, and information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gathered from various scientists specializing in these taxa, especially

. The primary cause of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
declines of the callippe silverspot butterfly, Behren's silverspot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
butterfly, and Alameda whipsnake is the loss of habitat from human 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities. These species are imperiled by the current and potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
future destruction and alteration of their habitats due to off-road 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle use, trampling by hikers and equestrians, unsuitable levels of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
livestock grazing, and invasive exotic vegetation. The Alameda 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whipsnake and Behren's silverspot butterfly also are imperiled by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residential and commercial development. Off-road vehicles and human or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
horse trampling pose threats to the colonies of the two butterfly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species as these activities could crush the foodplants of the larvae or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the adult nectar sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The callippe silverspot butterfly was once more widespread in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
San Francisco Bay Area. At least five populations of this species have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been eliminated by urban development and other causes. The species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently is known only from two sites in San Mateo and Alameda 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Counties. One of the known extant populations of the callippe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
silverspot butterfly is located in a city park. This colony is small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and may be imperiled by human-induced and natural causes (Mattoon, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
litt
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., 1991). The other known extant population of the callippe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
silverspot butterfly is found on San Bruno Mountain in San Mateo County 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Mattoon, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., 1991; Thomas Reid Associates 1982). Although the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
majority of the natural areas on San Bruno Mountain have been preserved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and will remain undeveloped in perpetuity, collection of specimens by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amateur lepidopterists poses a threat, as discussed under Factor B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Behren's silverspot butterfly has been extirpated from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant portion of its former range, which extended from the mouth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Russian River in Sonoma County north to southern Mendocino 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
County. One of the six known historic colonies was eliminated by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing development (Mattoon, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., 1989). No specimens have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
observed at the other historic colonies since 1987. Currently, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
animal is known only from a recently discovered locality northwest of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the town of Point Arena in Mendocino County (Sally DeBecker, Pacific Gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Electric, pers. comm., 1990). The site is subject to grazing by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
livestock. Although no plans have been proposed for the site, urban 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development is occurring in the area.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The central and western portions of Alameda and Contra Costa 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Counties are highly urbanized. Housing, commercial, and road 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction have greatly reduced the amount of suitable habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available for the Alameda whipsnake. McGinnis (1992) listed 60 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
localities for this species; 25 of them are considered to represent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extant populations. A proposed reservoir northeast of Lake Chabot in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alameda County would result in the elimination of suitable habitat at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the site (McGinnis 1992). Flooding at the proposed Los Vaqueros 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reservoir in eastern Contra Costa County would not impact the reptile; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, proposed quarrying operations for the production of material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the dam and the inducement of development would result in habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
destruction (McGinnis 1990, 1992). Numerous housing developments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently threaten other populations. Within the City of Oakland, 6 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residential projects have been built and 10 more are proposed in Alameda 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whipsnake habitat (Charles Bryant, Oakland Planning Department,

., 1992). A 1,600-acre site that contains suitable habitat for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alameda whipsnake in the City of Clayton is under review to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential commercial uses (Randall Hatch, Clayton Planning Department,

, 1991). McGinnis (1992) documented nine other colonies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scattered throughout the range of the snake that are likely to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adversely impacted by several planned residential developments.

. Both the callippe silverspot butterfly and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Behren's silverspot butterfly are highly prized by insect collectors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although there are no studies of the impact of the removal of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals on natural populations of either of the butterfly species, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies of another endangered nymphalid butterfly (Gall 1984a, 1984b) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and a lycaenid butterfly (Duffey 1968) indicate it is likely that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
callippe and Behren's silverspot butterflies could be adversely affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due to their isolated, possibly small populations. The Service is aware 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of preserved specimens of the callippe silverspot butterfly that have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been recently collected on San Bruno Mountain. Some of these specimens 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are traded for other butterfly taxa or held by the collectors in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anticipation of their greater value if the species is listed. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service also is aware of reports that Behren's silverspot butterfly is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actively sought after by amateur lepidopterists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is an extensive commercial trade for the two butterfly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species proposed herein for listing, as well as other imperiled or rare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
butterflies (Chris Nagano and John Mendoza, U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service, pers. obs., 1992). Collecting from small colonies or repeated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handling and marking (particularly of females and in years of low 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
abundance) could seriously damage the populations through loss of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals and genetic variability (Gall 1984b, Murphy 1988, Singer and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wedlake 1981). Collection of females dispersing from a colony also can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduce the probability that new colonies will be established. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Collectors pose a threat because they may deplete butterfly colonies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below the thresholds of survival or recovery (Collins and Morris 1985). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Alameda whipsnake does not appear to be particularly popular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
among reptile collectors; however, Federal listing could raise the value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the animals within reptilian trade markets and increase the threat of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unauthorized collection above current levels (Ken McCloud, U.S. Fish and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wildlife Service, pers. comm., 1992). Even limited interest in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species among reptile collectors could pose a serious threat to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
populations that contain few individuals.

Disease or predation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. There are no indications that disease or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
predation pose a significant threat to the callippe silverspot butterfly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or Behren's silverspot butterfly. The real or potential occurrence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disease in the Alameda whipsnake is unknown. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of native mammals and birds are known or likely to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
predators of the Alameda whipsnake, including kingsnakes (

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Buteo
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Vulpes vulpes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), a species not native to this region of the State, in the 19th century poses an additional threat to the Alameda whipsnake.
The snakes seem to protect themselves both physically and behaviorally from this predator, perhaps due to their adaptions
to native predators, and the snake populations seem to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withstand predation from these animals. However, in situations where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alameda whipsnake habitat has become fragmented, isolated, and otherwise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degraded by human activities, increased predatory pressure may become 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excessive, especially where alien species, such as rats (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Rattus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 sp.), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and feral and domestic cats and dogs are introduced. These additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threats become particularly acute where urban development is immediately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjacent to Alameda whipsnake habitat. Although the actual impact of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
predation under such situations has not been studied, the likelihood for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
serious impact exists.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The callippe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
silverspot butterfly and Behren's silverspot butterfly are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically protected under any Federal, State or local law. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California Department of Fish and Game has indicated that it is unable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to protect insects under its current regulations (Pete Bontadelli,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
San Bruno Mountain Habitat Conservation Plan provides protection from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat destruction caused by habitat loss, the unauthorized collection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The California Environmental Quality Act and California Endangered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Species Act are the primary environmental legislation passed at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State level that potentially benefits the conservation of the Alameda 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whipsnake. The animal was listed as a threatened species by the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of California in 1971 (California Department of Fish and Game 1987). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although these State laws provide a measure of protection to the species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and have resulted in the formulation of mitigation measures to reduce or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offset impacts for projects proposed in certain Alameda whipsnake 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitats, these laws are not adequate to protect the species in all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases. Numerous activities do not fall under the purview of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legislation, such as certain projects proposed by the Federal government 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and projects falling under State statutory exemptions. Where overriding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
social and economic considerations can be demonstrated, these laws allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
project proposals to go forward, even in cases where the continued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existence of the species may be jeopardized or where adverse impacts are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not mitigated to the point of insignificance.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Use of insecticides could be a threat to the two butterfly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species. Silverspot butterfly larvae are extremely sensitive to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pesticides and even the accumulation of runoff in the soil after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spraying has proven lethal to the larvae of members of the genus

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1971). There is the potential that species in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the food chain of the snake would be impacted as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
High levels of grazing by livestock may pose a threat to the extant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
populations of the two butterfly species. Overgrazing could cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trampling and the ingestion of the larval foodplants and the adult 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nectar sources. Low levels of grazing could allow other plants to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outcompete the species required by the callippe and Behren's silverspot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
butterflies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grazing has adversely affected the habitat of the Alameda whipsnake 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in many areas east of the coast range (McGinnis 1992). Livestock 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grazing that significantly reduces or eliminates shrub and grass cover 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is detrimental to this animal. Most snake species, including the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alameda whipsnake, avoid open barren areas because of the increased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
danger from predators and the lack of prey (McGinnis 1992). Overgrazing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has eliminated otherwise suitable Alameda whipsnake habitat in the area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between Black Diamond Mines Regional Park and Marsh Creek Road in Contra 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Costa County and along the west facing slopes of the Altamont Pass 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
region between Vasco Road and Altamont Pass Road in Alameda County. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Off-road vehicles and human or horse foot traffic may pose a threat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the colonies of the two butterfly species. These activities could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in harassment, injury, or death of individuals of these two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species by trampling or crushing the eggs, larvae, or pupae. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adequate levels of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Viola
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 are critical for the long-term survival of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
populations of the two butterfly species (Mattoon, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., 1989, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1991). However, California's native grassland and coastal prairie have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been adversely affected by the introduction and invasion of numerous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-native plants (Heady 1988, Heady et al. 1988). Often these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
introduced and alien plants, such as iceplant (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Carprobrotus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trees (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Eucalyptus

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ulex europaeus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), outcompete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and largely supplant the native vegetation. Without control and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eradication programs, the introduced and alien taxa will continue to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invade and eliminate the remaining native plant communities, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the host plants of the callippe and Behren's silverspot butterflies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Non-native vegetative communities also may eliminate habitat for the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Periodic fires are an important factor in maintaining the grassland and coastal prairie habitat of the silverspot
butterflies (Hammond and McCorkle 1984, Orsak 1980). Without fire, succession eliminates the foodplants of the
larvae of the callippe and Behren's silverspot butterflies. Periodic ``cool,'' fast-moving fires seem important
for the maintenance of the habitat of the two butterflies. Without fire, dead grass and other vegetation from previous
years may not decay quickly enough and gradually accumulate to form a thick layer of thatch that smothers and crowds
out the violets. The larvae of the silverspot butterflies may survive fires that move rapidly through grassland habitats,
in contrast to hotter, slower-moving brush and woodland fires that may kill them (McCorkle and Hammond 1988, Orsak
1980). Under windy conditions, grassland fires also burn in patches, which leave ``islands'' of unburned habitat
that may contain butterflies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In small populations, the breeding of closely related individuals can cause genetic problems, particularly the
expression of deleterious genes (known as inbreeding depression). Individuals and populations possessing deleterious
genetic material are less able to cope with environmental conditions and adapt to environmental changes, even those
that are relatively minor. Further, small populations are subject to the effects of genetic drift (the loss of random
genetic variability). This phenomenon also reduces the ability of individuals and populations to successfully
respond to environmental stresses. Overall, these genetic factors could influence the survivability of the smaller,
genetically isolated populations of each of the three species that are the subject of this proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The callippe silverspot butterfly, Behren's silverspot butterfly, and the Alameda whipsnake also may suffer from
associated effects of habitat fragmentation. Subdivision of land into smaller blocks of habitat often is the result
of human-related activities, such as livestock grazing, road construction, and urban development, and serves to
exacerbate the isolation of extant populations. Most of the populations of the three species proposed for listing
herein are isolated from other conspecific populations. Since recolonization from neighboring populations is
unlikely or impossible, this isolation could have negative demographic effects, such as low reproductive success.
Also, by further reducing population size and genetic interchange among populations, habitat fragmentation increases
the probability of genetic drift and inbreeding depression. This may result in less vigorous and adaptable populations
of the three species proposed for listing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to the existence of only small and fragmented populations, the three species proposed for listing also may be vulnerable
to random fluctuations or variations (stochasticity), such as changes in annual weather patterns, availability
of food, and other natural or human-induced environmental factors. For example, when the populations of the callippe
and Behren's silverspot butterflies were large, the effects of a drought or a low abundance of foodplants would not
cause the extinction of these species. However, given the current population status, events such as drought or low
foodplant abundance could cause their extinction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information regarding past, present, and
future threats faced by these species to propose this rule. As described in more detail above under Factors A, B, C,
D, and E, the available information indicates that the callippe silverspot butterfly, Behren's silverspot butterfly,
and the Alameda whipsnake should be listed pursuant to section 4 of the Act. The limited range of these species makes
them vulnerable to overcollecting, rapid urbanization, off-road vehicle use, inappropriate levels of grazing,
and loss of habitat due to invasive exotic vegetation. Stochastic events, which commonly affect small isolated populations,
also may result in extirpation of some populations of these species. Ongoing and proposed development projects pose
an imminent threat to Behren's silverspot butterfly and the Alameda whipsnake throughout their ranges. Extraordinary
increases in human populations and associated pressures for urban development have rendered existing mechanisms
inadequate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other alternatives to this action were considered but not preferred because not listing these species at all or listing
them as threatened would not provide adequate protection and not be in keeping with the purposes of the Act. Based on
this evaluation, the preferred action is to list the callippe silverspot butterfly (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Speyeria callippe callippe
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), Behren's silverspot butterfly (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Speyeria zerene behrensii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and Alameda whipsnake (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Masticophis lateralis euryxanthus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) as endangered. For reasons discussed below, the Service is not proposing to designate critical habitat for these
animal species at this time.

Critical Habitat
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary
propose critical habitat at the time the species is proposed to be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that
designation of critical habitat is not prudent at this time for the callippe silverspot butterfly, Behren's silverspot
butterfly, and Alameda whipsnake. The Service's regulations (50 CFR 424.12(a)(1)) state that designation of critical
habitat is not prudent when one or both of the following situations exist: (1) The species is threatened by taking or
other human activity, and identification of critical habitat can be expected to increase the degree of such threat
to the species; or (2) such designation of critical habitat would not be beneficial to the species.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed under ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species,'' the three animals and their habitats are vulnerable
to several activities. The Service is concerned about the impacts of the illicit commercial trade of the Alameda whipsnake,
callippe silverspot butterfly, and Behren's silverspot butterfly. Unauthorized collecting is an activity that
can be difficult to control because it can be done in a fairly discrete manner. The precise pinpointing of localities
that would result from publication of critical habitat descriptions and maps in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would increase enforcement problems because the species proposed herein for listing would be more vulnerable to
collecting, as well as vandalism to their habitat. The potential for declines due to the collection of these species
is so great that any benefit from the designation of critical habitat is outweighed by the risk of increased taking.
Therefore, the Service finds that designation of critical habitat for these animals is not prudent. Protection of
the habitat of these species will be addressed through the section 4 recovery process and through the section 7 consultation
process.

Available Conservation Measures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act include
recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain activities.
Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies,
groups, and individuals. The Endangered Species Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with
the States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. Such actions are initiated by
the Service following listing. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against taking
are discussed, in part, below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species
that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation
provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requires Federal agencies to confer with the Service
on any action that is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a proposed species. If a species is subsequently
listed, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to insure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are
not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat.
If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter
into formal consultation with the Service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No populations of the callippe silverspot butterfly, Behren's silverspot butterfly, and the Alameda whipsnake
are known to occur on property owned by the Federal government. However, several Federal agencies would be affected
by the listing of these animals. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) may insure housing loans
in areas that presently support the species proposed for listing herein. Therefore, HUD actions regarding these
loans would be subject to review by the Service under section 7 of the Act. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation would be affected
by the listing of these animals as this is the lead agency in administering the permits for the proposed Los Vaqueros
Reservoir. The Army Corps of Engineers' activities or issuances of permits subject to section 404 of the Clean Water
Act would be subject to the Endangered Species Act section 7 requirements. The Department of Transportation (Federal
Highways Administration) may be involved with the construction and maintenance of roads and highways in areas where
some or all of these species may be affected, hence this agency would also be subject to section 7 of the Endangered Species
Act. Any Federal actions that are subject to environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act may
be subject to the requirements of section 7 of the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1982, a habitat conservation plan (HCP) was completed and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 10(a) incidental take permit was issued to the cities of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Brisbane, Daly City, and South San Francisco and the county of San Mateo 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the endangered mission blue butterfly (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Icaricia icarioides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
missionensis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), San Bruno elfin butterfly (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Incisalia mossii bayensis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and San Francisco garter snake (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Thamnophis sirtiralis tetrataenia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCP, entitled ``San Bruno Mountain Habitat Conservation Plan'' (U.S. Fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Wildlife Service permit number PRT 2&hyph;9818), permanently protects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about 1,115 hectares (2,752 acres) of natural habitat at this site. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conference report on the 1982 amendments to the Endangered Species Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 1973 indicates that Congress intended HCPs to encompass both listed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and unlisted species, especially unlisted species that might later be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protected. Although the callippe silverspot butterfly was not included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the section 10(a) permit, the San Bruno Mountain HCP included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific considerations and provisions in the event it did become listed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the Service. Habitat of one of the two known extant populations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the callippe silverspot butterfly is protected under this HCP. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit allows for the loss of animals and habitat through urban 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development containing approximately 8 percent of the San Bruno Mountain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population of the callippe silverspot butterfly. Although habitat is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protected, the Service is aware of numerous preserved specimens of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
callippe silverspot butterfly that have been collected recently on San 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bruno Mountain on lands where the animal is not protected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
endangered species set forth a series of prohibitions and exceptions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that apply to all endangered wildlife. These prohibitions, in part, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States to take (including harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kill, trap, capture, collect, or attempt any such activity), import or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
export, transport in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial activity, or sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commerce any such species. It also is illegal to possess, sell, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deliver, carry, transport, or ship any such wildlife that was taken 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
illegally. Certain exceptions can apply to agents of the Service and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State conservation agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involving endangered animal species under certain circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations governing permits are at 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.23. Such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permits are available for scientific purposes, to enhance the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
propagation or survival of the species, and/or for incidental take in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
connection with otherwise lawful activities. Further information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding regulations and requirements for permits may be obtained from

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) (Magnuson Act) requires that each regional fishery management council submit any fishery management plan or plan
amendment it prepares to the Secretary for review and approval, disapproval, or partial disapproval. The Magnuson
Act also requires that the Secretary, upon receiving the plan or amendment, must immediately publish a notice that
it is available for public review and comment. The Secretary will consider the public comments in determining whether
to approve, disapprove, or partially disapprove the FMP amendment.

Current regulations prohibit otter trawl vessels retaining 100 pounds or more of summer flounder between May 1 and
October 31, or 200 pounds or more of summer flounder between November 1 and April 30, and having any net, or any piece
of net not meeting the minimum mesh size requirements on board. Amendment 6 would allow nets not meeting the minimum
mesh size to be on board a vessel even if the above thresholds are exceeded, provided the nets are appropriately stowed.
Once the threshold amounts of summer flounder are retained, nets that do not meet the minimum mesh size requirements
could not be used for the remainder of the fishing trip.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment would also modify the schedule for establishing the annual management measures for the recreational
fishery for summer flounder. The regulations setting the recreational possession limit would be revised to allow
the measure to be set later in the year to provide an opportunity to review data from the previous year. The timing provisions
would be revised to require the Regional Director to publish the proposed commercial quota and other measures by October
15 and the proposed recreational measures by February 15 of the year for which the specifications are being proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendment 6 would also clarify the language prohibiting twisted mesh, authorize an experimental fishery under certain
conditions, and make the definition of a fish box consistent with that in the Fishery Management Plan for the Northeast
Multispecies Fishery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations proposed by the Council and based on this amendment are scheduled to be published within 15 days.
