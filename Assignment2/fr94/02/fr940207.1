summary: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This document proposes to amend the regulations of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (``Service'') relating
to employment authorization for certain dependents of principal aliens classified as NATO&hyph;1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
and 7 nonimmigrants. This action is being taken to expand and secure employment opportunities on the basis of reciprocity
for dependents of United States military personnel and certain Department of Defense civilian personnel stationed
in NATO member countries. Because of the diplomatic and international affairs considerations involved in NATO matters,
this rule parallels, to the extent possible, the regulations governing employment authorization for certain dependents
of foreign government diplomats, officials, and employees assigned to official duty in the United States and classified
as A&hyph;1 and A&hyph;2 nonimmigrants and their A&hyph;3 servants.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interagency Collaboration in Drafting This Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Department of State, the Department of Defense, and the Office of NATO's Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic (SACLANT)
have collaborated closely with the Service in developing this rule, which balances diplomatic and international
affairs considerations, administrative requirements, and proper enforcement concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Scope
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The rule applies to certain dependents of NATO military personnel, who typically serve a three-year tour of duty with
SACLANT, the major NATO command headquarters in Norfolk, VA. It also applies to certain dependents of NATO civilian
employees and officials, who typically work at SACLANT for extended periods. Additionally, the rule applies to certain
dependents of the small number of NATO personnel who may be stationed in other locations in the United States and to
the servants of NATO military and civilian personnel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This rule is being published in order to expand and secure employment opportunities on the basis of reciprocity for
dependents of United States military personnel and certain Department of Defense civilian personnel stationed
in NATO member countries. All parties which collaborated in the drafting of this rule agree that expanding employment
opportunities in the United States for NATO&hyph;1 through NATO&hyph;6 dependents will further this goal.

Backgound
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under current regulations, a NATO dependent can apply for employment authorization in the United States only if he
or she is covered under the terms of a bilateral agreement. A bilateral agreement is a written, signed agreement between
the United States and a foreign country. It provides for employment authorization for certain dependents of United
States government personnel assigned to official duty in the foreign country whose government entered into the agreement.
In turn, it provides for employment authorization for certain dependents of personnel of the foreign government
who are assigned to official duty in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule expands the eligibility to apply for employment authorization to certain NATO&hyph;1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 dependents
covered by the terms of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 arrangements and to certain dependents of SACLANT employees. A 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 arrangement is in effect when it is determined that a foreign country allows appropriate employment ``on the local
economy'' for certain dependents of United States government personnel assigned to official duty in that foreign
country. Based on that determination, certain dependents of foreign government personnel assigned to official
duty in the United States may apply for employment authorization.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reciprocity has become an issue in the context of renegotiation of the rights and privileges of United States dependents
within the NATO area. NATO member host countries are increasingly unwilling to continue dependent employment privileges
absent similar treatment for their dependents in the United States. This rule is intended to provide for such treatment
to the extent that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 privileges are continued or established for dependents of United States military personnel and certain Department
of Defense civilian personnel in NATO member states.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the high cost of living in some countries where U.S. personnel are stationed, and the limited number of jobs available
on United States bases abroad, the freedom to work ``on the economy'' abroad can be extremely important to United States
families.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, one of the real stresses on military family life is the constant disruption of the spouse's career that is
occasioned by household moves every few years. When the spouse is barred from employment overseas the stress on the
family can be considerable.

Rule Parallels Regulations Governing Diplomatic Dependents
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of the diplomatic and international affairs considerations involved in NATO matters, this rule parallels,
to the extent possible, the regulations governing employment authorization for dependents of foreign government
diplomats, officials, and employees assigned to official duty in the United States and classified as A&hyph;1 and
A&hyph;2 nonimmigrants.

Changes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to expanding the eligibility to apply for employment authorization to NATO&hyph;1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 dependents
covered by the terms of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 arrangements, this rule incorporates the following changes:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8 CFR 214.2(s)(1) defines the various NATO nonimmigrant classifications. Additionally, since this rule parallels
the regulations governing ``A'' nonimmigrants, and since A&hyph;3 and NATO&hyph;7 classifications are comparable,
this rule makes the NATO&hyph;7 periods of admission and extension of stay parallel the periods for A&hyph;3 nonimmigrants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8 CFR 214.2(s)(2) defines the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
dependent
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of a NATO&hyph;1 through NATO&hyph;6 for purposes of employment in the United States. This definition parallels
the definition of dependent used in the regulation governing employment authorization of dependents of foreign
government diplomats, officials, and employees assigned to official duty in the United States and classified as
A&hyph;1 and A&hyph;2 nonimmigrants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8 CFR 214.2(s)(3) defines dependent employment requirements based on formal bilateral employment agreements and
informal 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reciprocal arrangements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8 CFR 214.2(s)(4) specifies that the applicability of the bilateral agreement or the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 arrangement is based on the NATO member state which employs the principal alien. Additionally, under a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 arrangement, the principal must be a national of the employing NATO member state. Dependents of SACLANT employees
are also eligible to apply for employment authorization under terms of applicable bilateral agreements or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 arrangements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8 CFR 214.2(s)(5) details dependent employment application procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8 CFR 214.2(s)(6) extends the period for dependent employment authorization up to three years.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
8 CFR 214.2(s)(7) requires that NATO dependents must pay taxes and Social Security on their earnings, and clarifies
that they have no criminal, civil, or administrative immunities regarding matters arising from their employment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8 CFR 214.2(s)(8) clarifies that there is no appeal from a denial of employment authorization.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8 CFR 214.2(s)(9) discusses unauthorized employment and resultant penalties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8 CFR 214.2(s)(10) discusses NATO&hyph;7 dependents. Since this rule parallels the regulations governing ``A''
nonimmigrants which preclude employment by A&hyph;3 dependents, and since A&hyph;3 and NATO&hyph;7 classifications
are comparable, this rule eliminates future grants of employment authorization for NATA&hyph;7 dependents, but
allows those NATA&hyph;7 dependents currently with employment authorization to continue until the expiration
of such authorization.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, this rule amends 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(7) by eliminating future grants of employment authorization for NATA&hyph;7
dependents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service certifies that
this rule will not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule
is not a major rule within the meaning of section 1(b) of E.O. 12291, nor does this rule have Federalism implications
warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment in accordance with E.O. 12612.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Nonimmigrant aliens classified as NATO&hyph;1 through NATO&hyph;5 are officials of NATO, the members of the armed
forces of a country signatory to the Agreement Between the Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty Regarding the Status
of Their Forces signed in London, June 1951 (NATO Status of Forces Agreement), who are entering in accordance with
that agreement or the Protocol on the Status of International Military Headquarters set up pursuant to the North Atlantic
Treaty (Paris Protocol), and members of their immediate families. Aliens classified as NATO&hyph;6 are civilian
employees either of a force entering in accordance with the NATO Status of Forces Agreement or of an allied headquarters
(Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic, SACLANT) set up pursuant to the Paris Protocol and members of their immediate
families. Servants or attendants of aliens classified as NATO&hyph;1 through NATO&hyph;6 are classified as NATO&hyph;7,
as are members of the immediate families of such servants or attendants.

 NATO&hyph;1 through NATO&hyph;5 aliens are normally exempt from inspection under 8 CFR 235.1(c). NATO&hyph;6 aliens
may be authorized admission for duration of status. Aliens classified as NATO&hyph;7 may be admitted for not more
than three years and may be granted extensions of temporary stay in increments of not more than two years. In addition,
an application for extension of temporary stay for a NATO&hyph;7 alien must be accompanied by a statement signed by
the employing official stating that he or she intends to continue to employ the NATO&hyph;7 applicant and describing
the work the applicant will perform.

(iv) Unmarried sons or daughters under the age of 25 who are in full-time attendance as students at post-secondary
educational institutions if a formal bilateral employment agreement permitting their employment in the United
States was signed prior to November 21, 1988, and such bilateral employment agreement does not specify age 23 as the
maximum age for employment of such sons and daughters. The Department of State advises that bilateral agreements
with Canada, Denmark, Norway, and France fit this classification with respect to dependents of members of the force
and members of the civilian component thereof;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reciprocal arrangement exists when the Department of Defense [the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Foreign Military
Rights Affairs (OSD/FMRA)] certifies, with the Department of State concurrence, that a NATO member state allows
appropriate employment in the local economy for dependents of members of the force and members of the civilian component
of the United States assigned to duty in the NATO member state. OSD/FMRA and the Department of State's Family Liaison
Office shall maintain a listing of countries with which such reciprocity exists. Dependents of a NATO&hyph;1, 2,

(C) Employment of a similar nature for dependents of members of the force and members of the civilian component of the
United States assigned to official duty in the NATO member state employing the principal alien is not prohibited by
that NATO member state's government;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) The proposed employment is not in an occupation listed in the Department of Labor's Schedule B (20 CFR part 656),
or otherwise determined by the Department of Labor to be one for which there is an oversupply of qualified United States
workers in the area of proposed employment. This Schedule B restriction does not apply to a dependent son or daughter
who is a full-time student if the employment is part-time, consisting of not more than 20 hours per week, and/or if it
is temporary employment of not more than 12 weeks during school holiday periods; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) The proposed employment is not contrary to the interest of the United States. Employment contrary to the interest

 (1) Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the Truth in Savings Act (12 U.S.C. 4301 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) is to assist consumers in comparing deposit accounts offered by depository institutions. The act requires institutions
to disclose fees, the interest rate, the annual percentage yield, and other account terms whenever a consumer requests
the information and before an account is opened. Fees and other information also must be provided on any periodic statement
the institution sends to the consumer. Rules are set forth for deposit account advertisements and advance notices
to account holders of adverse changes in terms. The act restricts how institutions must determine the account balance
on which interest is calculated. The act is implemented by the Board's Regulation DD (12 CFR part 230), which became
effective on June 21, 1993. The regulation authorizes the issuance of official staff interpretations of the regulation.
(See Appendix D to Regulation DD.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board is publishing a proposed commentary to Regulation DD. The proposal is designed to provide guidance to depository
institutions in applying the regulation to specific transactions and is a substitute for individual staff interpretations.
The Board contemplates updating the commentary periodically to address significant questions that arise. It is
expected that this commentary will be adopted in final form in June 1994 with a six-month time period for optional compliance
until the effective date, estimated in December 1994.

The

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 documents containing the regulation that implemented the act and documents for subsequent amendments set forth
a large amount of supplementary material interpreting the new regulation. (See final rule published on September
21, 1992 (57 FR 43337), correction notice published on October 5, 1992 (57 FR 46480), and amendments published on March
19, 1993 (58 FR 15077).) In large measure, the proposed commentary incorporates the supplementary material from
those rulemakings, and reflects the views expressed therein without substantive change. A number of issues that
have arisen since the publication of the regulation have also been addressed. Proposed interpretations of new issues
are noted below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 6, 1993, the Board published a proposal to amend the regulation's rules for calculating the annual percentage
yield for accounts that pay interest prior to maturity (58 FR 64190). (See also the notice extending the comment period
published on January 13, 1994, 59 FR 1921.) The Board has deferred proposing commentary on provisions of the regulation
affected by the proposal, pending final action by the Board.

The scope of the discussion that follows is limited so that, for instance, examples listed in the commentary are not
repeated below.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comment 1(c)&hyph;1 clarifies that the scope of the regulation is all depository institutions (except credit unions)
that offer accounts to residents of a ``state,'' such as accounts held in the United States, even though funds may be
transferred periodically into an account held at a location outside the United States. An account located outside
the United States is not covered, even if the funds are held by a U.S. resident.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comment 2(a)&hyph;1 provides examples of accounts subject to the regulation, including the example of a deposit
account required as a condition of obtaining a credit card account (often referred to as a ``secured'' credit card
account). The Board believes it is important for consumers to receive disclosures about the terms, monthly fees,
or other charges that may apply to such accounts, since such information may not appear on disclosures given to card
holders under the Truth in Lending Act and its implementing Regulation Z (12 CFR part 226). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed comment also includes examples of accounts not subject to the regulation. The Board's proposed comment
narrows the scope of trust accounts covered by the regulation, a difference from guidance provided in supplementary
material to the September 1992 rulemaking. The comment provides that trust accounts are not subject to the regulation
with the exception of individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and simplified employee pension (SEP) accounts. (See
proposed commentary to paragraph 2(h) of this section.) The ``trust'' for which the account is established is not
a natural person, even though the trustee and beneficiary might be. In addition, the law of trusts imposes duties and
responsibilities upon all trustees that the Board believes distinguish trust accounts from other accounts held
by one individual for another solely for personal, family or household purposes. Finally, the Board believes that
requiring an institution to identify both the purpose of the trust and whether the account has been established by
someone in a professional capacity would present an undue compliance burden, with minimal benefits. The Board requests
comment on whether any accounts established for trusts (other than IRAs and SEP accounts) should be subject to the
regulation, particularly when both the beneficiary and the trustee are natural persons.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comment 2(b)&hyph;1 provides examples of commercial messages considered to be advertisements, such as messages
on computer screens in bank lobbies and accompanying printouts. The Board believes these messages are similar to
messages in traditional advertising media such as televisions and newspapers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment also provides examples of messages not considered to be advertisements, including direct oral discussions
conducted in person_but not telephone conversations_regarding the negotiation of a specific account. The Board
believes that the purpose of advertising disclosures_ensuring that prospective customers of consumer accounts
know basic terms about the account_is adequately served by face-to-face discussions between employees of the institution
and consumers seeking information about accounts. Also, this interpretation is similar to the approach taken in
the Official Staff Commentary to the Board's Regulation Z (12 CFR part 226, Supp. I, 2(a)(2)&hyph;1).

(f) Bonus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comment 2(f)&hyph;1 provides examples of bonuses. The comment also provides an example of an item that is not considered
a bonus for purposes of the regulation_discount coupons offered by institutions for use at restaurants and stores.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment 2(f)&hyph;2 clarifies the application of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 rule ($10 value or less) by defining the calendar year as the time frame for determining whether the bonus requirements
are triggered, to ease compliance. The comment also provides that institutions must aggregate per account the value
of items contemplated to be given during the calendar year, even though an item's individual value is less than $10.
Thus, if an institution offers in January to give a consumer an item valued at $7.00 each calendar quarter during the
year if account balances in a NOW account exceed $10,000 for each calendar quarter, the bonus rules would be triggered.
On the other hand, if the items are given for opening separate accounts_such as a $7.00 item for renewing a time account
and another for opening a savings account_the value given for each account remains within the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 exception, and the bonus rules would not be triggered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment 2(f)&hyph;3 clarifies that the waiver or reduction of a fee or absorption of expenses is not a bonus. The Board
solicits comment on this approach.

(h) Consumer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comment 2(h)&hyph;3 clarifies coverage issues for retirement plans. For example, the proposed comment states that
SEP accounts and IRAs are considered consumer accounts for purposes of the regulation. The Board believes that although
institutions are named as trustees, SEP accounts and IRAs are equivalent to other accounts opened for consumer purposes.
On the other hand, the proposed comment would exclude from coverage accounts held in a Keogh plan, which is established
by a self-employed individual. The Board believes Keogh accounts are similar to accounts held by a sole proprietor,
which Congress intended not to cover. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment 2(h)&hyph;4 provides factors to consider in determining whether an account is held by an unincorporated
nonbusiness association of natural persons. Associations with paid staff are likely to be more sophisticated in
their investment decisions and are not as likely to need disclosures. The Board solicits comment on whether the use
of factors is appropriate for providing guidance in this area. In addition, the Board solicits comment on the proposed
factors and on what additional factors might indicate an account is held by or offered to an unincorporated association
of natural persons.

(p) Passbook Savings Account 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comment 2(p)&hyph;1 clarifies that institutions may consider accounts as ``passbook savings,'' even if direct
deposits such as social security payments are made to the account without the use of the passbook. The proposed comment
is consistent with the requirements of Regulation E (12 CFR 205.9). Accounts that permit other electronic fund transfers_whether
or not called ``passbook''_and thus trigger Regulation E's requirement to send statements at least quarterly are
not passbook savings accounts, and institutions must comply with the periodic statement disclosures in &sect;230.6
of this part.

(t) Tiered-rate Account 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comment 2(t)&hyph;1 clarifies that time accounts that pay different rates based solely on the amount of the initial
deposit are not considered tiered-rate accounts. In this case, advertisements and account disclosures would not
reflect tiered-rate disclosures for the account. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(b) General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comment 3(b)&hyph;1 provides guidance on the specificity required for the disclosures of the compounding and crediting
frequencies. The Board believes slight variations in cycles are consistent with the notion of ``monthly'' cycles,
which are often not based on an actual calendar month. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) Relation to Regulation E 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comment 3(c)&hyph;1 provides examples of disclosures under Regulation E that also comply with this regulation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment clarifies that an institution may rely on Regulation E's disclosure rules regarding fees imposed at ATMs
and limitations on the frequency and amount of electronic fund transfers, including security-related exceptions.
But any fees assessed for_or any limitations placed on the number or amount of_``intra-institutional transfers''
from other accounts at the institution must be disclosed under this regulation, even though those transactions are
exempt from Regulation E. (See &sect;230.4(b) of this part.)

(a) Delivery of Account Disclosures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a)(1) Account Opening 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulation requires institutions to provide account disclosures before an account is opened. Comment 4(a)(1)&hyph;1
provides examples of events that do and do not trigger the delivery of new account disclosures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment 4(a)(1)&hyph;1 provides guidance to institutions that deem an account to be closed, then receive a deposit
from the consumer. The circumstances under which an institution may deem an account closed is governed by state or
other law. However, the Board believes that if an institution accepts a deposit from a consumer on an account the institution
has deemed to be ``closed'' (such as with a balance of $0) opening account disclosures are required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed comment also provides that an account acquired in a merger or acquisition is not a new account. Comment
is solicited on whether the rules for acquisitions involving the Resolution Trust Corporation and the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation should be distinguished from the rules for other acquisitions, since they may involve the
acquisition of deposits, not accounts.

Comment 4(a)(2)(i)&hyph;3 clarifies that ten business days

for example) is a reasonable time for responding to requests for disclosures.

Comment 4(b)(1)(i)&hyph;1 provides that no rate or yield other than the interest rate and annual percentage yield
may be stated in account disclosures, with the exception of a periodic rate corresponding to the interest rate (since
it is easily understood by consumers).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed comment 4(b)(2)(ii)&hyph;1 explains that institutions may include in their contract specific consumer
actions that will be considered by the institution to be a request to close the account, and that may result in the nonpayment
of accrued but uncredited interest. (See &sect;230.7(b) of this part.) The Board solicits comment on this approach.

Comments 4(b)(4)&hyph;1 through &hyph;3 provide guidance for disclosing the amount of fees that may be assessed
in connection with the account and the conditions under which they may be imposed. The Board believes that attempting
to list in the commentary all fees imposed by institutions would produce a list that would become both lengthy and outdated.

notice for withdrawals from an account. (See 12 CFR part 204.)

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comment 4(b)(6)(i)&hyph;1 provides that institutions offering ``callable'' time accounts must state the date
or the circumstances under which the account may be redeemed, in addition to the maturity date. The Board believes
the disclosure is a component of the maturity date_informing the consumer when the funds in the account may become
available for reinvestment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comment 4(b)(6)(ii)&hyph;2 provides examples of early withdrawal penalties, and clarifies that early withdrawal
penalties include bonuses that may be reclaimed if funds are withdrawn prior to maturity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment 4(b)(6)(ii)&hyph;3 clarifies that institutions are not required to disclose as early withdrawal penalties
potential income taxation consequences for consumers who withdraw funds held in IRAs or similar plans.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comment 5(a)(1)&hyph;3 provides guidance on an institution's responsibilities to provide change in terms notices
when account disclosures reflect that a term may change upon the occurrence of an event, such as a fee waiver for employees
during their employment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Board believes that a change in terms notice does not extend to changes in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
type
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of account held. (See proposed commentary to &sect;230.4(a)(1) of this part, which clarifies that transferring
funds held in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulation's exception to providing a change in terms notice for increases to check printing charges is based
on the consumer's control over the style and quantity of checks ordered. The Board solicits comment on other products,
if any, that should be similarly treated.

(b) Notice Before Maturity for Time Accounts Longer Than One Month That Renew Automatically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments 5(b)&hyph;1 through &hyph;5 address questions about notices that must be sent for automatically renewing
time accounts. Comment 5(b)&hyph;1 provides guidance regarding a time account that may, in fact, have a term longer
than the stated maturity date because the maturity date falls on a weekend or holiday. The Board has received questions
asking whether this delay on a one-year time deposit would make the term longer than one year (thus requiring the full
account disclosures under paragraph 5(b)(1) of this section prior to renewal rather than the abbreviated disclosures
permitted by paragraph 5(b)(2)). The same issue arises for time accounts with a stated term of one month that may be
extended beyond 31 days. The Board believes these short extensions due to the maturity date's falling on a weekend
or holiday do not affect the classification of the account for purposes of the type of disclosures institutions are
required to provide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment 5(b)&hyph;2 clarifies that when disclosing the date when the interest rate and annual percentage yield can
be determined, institutions may use general disclosures of that date if the date is easily discerned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board has received many questions about ``club accounts.'' Comment 5(b)&hyph;4 makes clear that club accounts
that otherwise meet the definition of a time account (&sect;230.2(u)) must follow the requirements of this section,
even if the consumer withdraws funds at maturity rather than ``rolling over'' the principal amount for another term.
The proposed comment also clarifies that if the consumer has previously agreed to make payments into the account for
the next club cycle (for example, by direct deposit or by transfers from another account), the club account should
be treated as an automatically renewable time account. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment 5(b)&hyph;5 clarifies disclosure requirements for a changed term for the subsequent renewal of a rollover
time account. If the notice required by this paragraph has been provided to the consumer about the renewing time account,
institutions may provide new account disclosures or a disclosure that reflects the consumer's request and the new
term. The regulation states that if disclosures have previously been given and the terms remain the same, institutions
need not provide the disclosures a second time. (See &sect;230.4(a) of this part.) Since consumers receive disclosures
about their renewing time account, this approach provides consumers with essential information and eases compliance
for institutions. The Board requests comment on this approach.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Institutions have limited disclosure responsibilities for rollover time accounts with maturities of one month
or less. If a term previously disclosed (other than the interest rate and annual percentage yield) is changed at renewal,
institutions must send a brief notice describing the change ``within a reasonable time'' after the renewal of the
account. Comment 5(c)&hyph;1 provides that 10 calendar days after the renewal is a reasonable time except for accounts
shorter than 10 days, which should receive disclosures before any subsequent renewal.

Comment 5(d)&hyph;1 clarifies that institutions need not provide new account disclosures when funds are subsequently
transferred following the maturity of a nonrollover time account, unless a new account is established. The Board
solicits comments on how institutions treat funds held in a nonrollover time account following maturity, and whether
new account disclosures are appropriate in cases where funds remain with institutions. For example, is a check sent
to the consumer automatically, or within a certain number of days of maturity? Are funds transferred to an account,
and if so, how long are the funds typically held in that account?

(a) General Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comment 6(a)&hyph;2 provides guidance to institutions when quarterly periodic statements are normally sent for
the account but a consumer's electronic fund transfer triggers the institution's duty under Regulation E to send
a statement that month. Institutions need not treat interim monthly statements as periodic statements subject to
the requirements of this regulation; if they choose not to do so, they must provide the disclosures (such as the interest
earned and annual percentage yield earned) on subsequent quarterly statements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment 6(a)&hyph;3 clarifies that institutions may include limited account information for one account (an MMDA,
for example) on the periodic statement of another account. However, disclosing interest or rate information would
trigger the duty to state the annual percentage yield and other disclosure requirements on that statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comment 6(a)(4)&hyph;2 provides that if a consumer opens or closes an account during a period, the annual percentage
yield earned and the other disclosures for the consumer's account must reflect only those days the account was open,
such as when a consumer changes from an interest-bearing account to a noninterest-bearing account in the middle of
a period.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When an institution uses the average daily balance method for monthly periods and provides a quarterly statement,
the literal language of the regulation suggests that institutions should provide three interest figures with three
corresponding annual percentage yield earned figures. Comment 6(b)&hyph;3 would permit institutions to show either
separate figures for each month or a figure for the whole quarter. The Board believes consumers may receive more useful
information if institutions provide one interest figure and one corresponding annual percentage yield earned figure
for the period.

Comment 7(a)&hyph;6 addresses ``dormant'' accounts. The Board solicits comment on whether an institution should
or should not be permitted to withhold the payment of interest for dormant accounts. (See comment 7(b)&hyph;4, regarding
the forfeiture of accrued but uncredited interest for dormant accounts.) The Board also solicits comment on whether
providing further guidance on the definition of a dormant account would be preferable to reliance on state or other
law. And, if a uniform time period were to be adopted, what period of time would be appropriate to consider an account
dormant?

Paragraph (a)(2) Determination of Minimum Balance to Earn Interest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comment 7(a)(2)&hyph;5 clarifies that when a consumer's account has a negative balance, institutions must use zero,
and not a negative number, to determine the balance on which the institution pays interest and whether any minimum
balance requirement has been met. The Board believes that the regulation prohibits institutions from using negative
balance amounts for these purposes, regardless of whether a daily balance or an average daily balance requirement
method is used. (See commentary to Appendix A, Part II, which prohibits the use of negative balances for calculating
the interest figure for the annual percentage yield earned.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment 7(a)(2)&hyph;6 clarifies that for club accounts, such as ``holiday'' and ``vacation'' clubs, institutions
cannot impose a minimum balance that could result in the nonpayment of interest for the entire club period. The Board
believes a minimum balance that requires consumers to make the total number of payments or dollar amounts required
under the club plan at the maturity of the account is tantamount to the ending balance method of calculating interest_a
balance calculation method not permitted under the regulation.

(b) Compounding and Crediting Policies

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Comment 7(b)&hyph;3 clarifies that institutions may, by agreement with the consumer, specify circumstances in
which the institution deems an account to be closed by the consumer. If an account is closed by the consumer, Regulation
DD does not require an institution to pay accrued but uncredited interest, as long as this fact is disclosed. (See &sect;230.4(b)(2)(ii).)
For example, institutions may provide in a checking account agreement that by writing a check which reduces the account
balance to $0, a consumer is deemed to have closed an account, or that the account will be deemed closed if no activity
occurs within 60 days of that transaction. (See proposed comment 230.4(a)(1)&hyph;1, which requires institutions
to treat the acceptance of a deposit subsequently made by the consumer to that account as the opening of a new account.)

(a) Misleading or Inaccurate Advertisements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to concerns expressed about the potential for misleading or inaccurate advertising on indoor signs,
comment 8(a)&hyph;2 provides guidance regarding time accounts and tiered-rate accounts. The Board solicits comment
on the approach taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulation prohibits institutions from using the terms ``free'' or ``no cost'' (or terms of similar meaning)
to advertise accounts or account services if ``maintenance and activity fees'' can be imposed. The Board has received
many questions about which fees trigger the prohibition. The Board believes that it is not possible to identify by
name all fees that trigger this limitation. (See discussion for proposed comment 4(b)(4)&hyph;1.) Instead, comments
8(a)&hyph;3 through &hyph;7 provide general principles institutions may use, regardless of what a fee may be named.
The Board solicits comment on the proposed approach to provide guidance in this area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In defining the scope of ``maintenance and activity'' fees, comment 8(a)&hyph;3 addresses advertisements for ``free''
accounts with optional electronic services such as home banking. The Board believes many consumers consider electronic
services such as ATM access to be an integral part of their accounts. Therefore, in its September 1992 rulemaking,
the Board stated that institutions could not advertise an account as ``free'' if a fee is imposed for transactions
at ATMs owned by the institution. Some institutions have questioned this approach arguing that ATM access is provided
only upon a consumer's request and that consumers will receive information_including the cost of ATM access_before
obtaining the service. The Board solicits comment on this approach.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board believes consumers are not mislead by advertisements for ``free'' accounts, if certain electronic services,
such as home banking services, are available for a fee. The Board believes that (unlike ATM access) consumers do not
have a reasonable expectation that services such as home banking would be included as part of an account advertised
as free. Of course, if optional features that impose fees are advertised with a free account, the advertisement must
make clear that charges are assessed for the optional feature. The Board solicits comment on this approach, and requests
comment on whether ATM services should be distinguished from other optional electronic services, and whether consumers
would be mislead by an advertisement for an account that is described as ``free'' even though the institution may charge
for ATM activity at ATMs owned by the institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment 8(a)&hyph;4 specifies that the term ``fees waived'' is similar to the terms ``free'' or ``no cost'' for the
purposes of this section.

(b) Permissible Rates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board has received many questions about advertising accounts for which institutions offer a number of versions
(certificates of deposits, for example). Comment 8(b)&hyph;3 clarifies that institutions may state an annual percentage
yield for each version of an account. Alternatively, the proposed comment would permit institutions to state a representative
example as long as the advertisement makes clear that, for instance, the advertised yield is for a time account with
a 30-day maturity and does not apply to all time accounts. Similarly, the comment illustrates that institutions could
advertise selected versions of time accounts. The Board solicits comment on this approach, which the Board believes
would effectively minimize compliance burdens for institutions while still providing meaningful information
to consumers.

(c) When Additional Disclosures are Required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulation requires institutions to disclose additional information when the annual percentage yield is advertised.
Comment 8(c)&hyph;1 provides examples of information that does and does not trigger the additional disclosures.
In response to questions about the effect of advertising a ``bonus'' rate, the proposed comment illustrates that
stating ``bonus rates are available'' does not trigger additional disclosures. However, stating a ``bonus rate
of 1%'' over an institution's current interest rate for one-year certificates of deposit is equivalent to stating
an interest rate.

Paragraph (c)(2) Time Annual Percentage Yield Is Offered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comment 8(c)(2)&hyph;1 clarifies the regulation's disclosure requirements for advertisements that state an annual
percentage yield as of a specified ``recent'' date. The proposed comment provides that when an advertisement is published,
the specified ``recent date'' must be recent in relation to the publication frequency of the media used for the advertisement
(taking into account established production deadlines for the media involved). For example, annual percentage
yields as of the printing date of a brochure printed once for a deposit account promotion that will run for six months
would be considered ``recent,'' even though rates may be expected to change during the six-month period. Annual percentage
yields published in a daily newspaper or broadcast on television must be ``recent'' as of the daily publishing or broadcasting
deadline date, even though the advertisements may appear less frequently (such as once a month). The Board solicits
comment on this approach.

may vary.

With one exception, the interpretation of Appendix A, Part 1 is deferred pending the Board's final action on proposed

figure and is in accordance with industry practices. The Board requests comment on whether further guidance on rounding

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comment app. A.II.A&hyph;1 clarifies when institutions should or should not include accrued but uncredited interest
in the balances used to calculate the annual percentage yield earned. The Board believes that it would be misleading
to include accrued interest in the balance figure when statements are sent less frequently than interest is credited.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When periodic statements are issued more frequently than interest is credited, accrued interest would be included
in the balance figure in succeeding statements. This is necessary so that the beginning balance can properly reflect
the principal on which interest will accrue for the succeeding statement period. The Board solicits comment on these
calculation principles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment app. A.II.A.&hyph;2 clarifies rounding rules for calculating interest earned and the annual percentage
yield earned. The Board believes flexibility in rounding is appropriate when statements are sent more frequently
than interest is compounded and credited, since the interest earned figure does not reflect the amount which will
actually be paid by an institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Special Formula for Use Where Periodic Statements Are Sent More Often Than the Period for Which Interest Is Compounded

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comment app. A.II.B.&hyph;1 provides guidance to institutions that issue quarterly periodic statements but are
required by Regulation E to send a monthly statement during the quarter. (See proposed comment 230.6(a)&hyph;2,
which discusses an institution's option to comply with the disclosure requirements for such monthly statements.)
The comment clarifies that institutions complying with &sect;230.6 for monthly statements triggered by Regulation
E must use the special formula in part II.B. of this appendix. Institutions could use this formula for a quarterly statement
whether or not a monthly statement is triggered by Regulation E during the quarter. The Board believes such a rule would
significantly reduce compliance burdens for institutions. However, in some cases, the use of the special formula
may result in an understated annual percentage yield earned. The Board solicits comment on whether the purposes of
the act are best served by this approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment app. A.II.B.&hyph;2 clarifies that the special formula requires institutions to use the actual number of
days in the compounding period in calculating the annual percentage yield earned. In the supplementary material
that accompanied the March 19, 1993 amendments to the regulation (58 FR 15077), the calculation used average numbers
of days in the compounding period to calculate the annual percentage yield earned for a statement period. The Board
believes that using actual days in a compounding period is more appropriate and corresponds to the annual percentage
yield earned for a specific consumer's account. The Board solicits comment on the proposed comment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. (See 26 CFR &sect;1.6049&hyph;5(a)(2), which discusses the fair market value of property received.) Items required
to be reported by the institution under IRS rules are bonuses under this regulation. Examples of items that are not
bonuses are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Disability insurance premiums paid by the institution in an amount less than $10 per year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Coffee mugs, T-shirts or other merchandise with a market value of less than $10 per year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Institutions must aggregate per account per calendar year any items given to a consumer that are individually valued
at less than $10 and must consider them to be a bonus if their aggregate value exceeds $10. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Waiver or reduction of a fee or absorption of expenses. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Bonuses do not include value received by consumers through the waiver or reduction of fees for banking-related services
(even if the fees waived exceed $10), such as the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Waiving a safe deposit box rental fee for one year for consumers who open a new account 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. An account held by or offered to an unincorporated association of natural persons is a consumer account if the account
is primarily for a nonbusiness purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following factors may be considered: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The institution may rely on the declaration of the person representing the association as to whether the account
is held for a business or nonbusiness purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Whether the association has paid employees, which would indicate a business purpose for the account. For example,
an account held by a religious organization that has payroll obligations is not covered by the regulation.

Relation to Regulation Q
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. While bonuses are not interest for purposes of this regulation, other regulations may require that bonuses be treated
as the equivalent of interest. For example, Regulation Q identifies payments of cash or merchandise that violate
the prohibition against paying interest on demand accounts. (See 12 CFR &sect;217.2(d).)

. Regulation D permits in limited circumstances the withdrawal of funds without penalty during the first six days
after a ``time deposit'' is opened. (See 12 CFR &sect;204.2(c)(1)(i).) Withdrawals without penalty from a time account
made in accordance with Regulation D do not disqualify the account from being a time account for purposes of this regulation.

Design requirements
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. Disclosures must be presented in a format that allows consumers to readily understand the terms of their account.
Disclosures may be made: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In any order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In combination with other disclosures or account terms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Multiple account disclosures
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. Institutions may prepare combined disclosures for all accounts offered, or prepare different documents for different
types of accounts. If an institution provides one document for several types of accounts, consumers must be able to
understand clearly which disclosures apply to their account. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Consistent terminology
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. An institution must use the same terminology to describe terms or features that are required to be disclosed. For
example, if an institution describes a monthly fee (regardless of account activity) as a ``monthly service fee''
in account-opening disclosures, the same terminology must be used in its periodic statements and change-in-term
notices.

Specificity of legal obligation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. An institution may use the term ``monthly'' to describe its compounding or crediting policy when interest is compounded
or paid at the end of each calendar month or for twelve periods during the year even if the actual days in each period vary
between 28 and 33 days.

General rule
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. Compliance with Regulation E (12 CFR part 205) is deemed to satisfy the disclosure requirements of this regulation,
such as when: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An institution changes a term that triggers a notice under Regulation E, and the timing and disclosure rules
of Regulation E are used for sending change-in-term notices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A consumer adds an ATM access feature to an account, and the institution provides disclosures pursuant to Regulation
E, including disclosure of fees before the consumer receives ATM access. (See 12 CFR &sect;205.7.) If the institution
complies with the timing rules of Regulation E, fees related to electronic services (such as balance inquiry fees
imposed if the inquiry is made at an ATM) that are required to be disclosed by this regulation but not by Regulation E
may also be provided at that time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An institution relies on Regulation E's disclosure rules regarding limitations on the frequency and amount
of electronic fund transfers, including security-related exceptions. But any limitation on the number of ``intra-institutional
transfers'' from other accounts at the institution during a given time period must be disclosed, even though those
transfers are exempt from Regulation E.

Inquiries versus requests. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A response to an oral inquiry (by telephone or in person) about rates and yields or fees does not trigger the duty to provide
account disclosures. However, when a consumer asks for written information about an account (whether by telephone,
in person, or by other means), the institution must provide disclosures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
General requests. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
When a consumer generally asks for information about a type of account (a NOW account, for example), an institution
that offers several variations may provide disclosures for any one of them.

Rate disclosures. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the interest rate and annual percentage yield, a periodic rate corresponding to the interest rate may
be disclosed. No other rate or yield (such as ``tax effective yield'') is permitted. If the annual percentage yield
is the same as the interest rate, institutions may disclose a single figure but must use both terms.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Fixed-rate accounts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
To disclose the period of time the interest rate will be in effect, institutions may state the maturity date for fixed-rate
time accounts that pay the opening rate until maturity. (See Appendix B, B&hyph;7_Sample Form.) For other fixed-rate
accounts, institutions may disclose a date (such as ``This rate will be in effect through June 30, 1994'') or a period
(such as ``This rate will be in effect for at least 30 days'').

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Tiered-rate accounts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Each interest rate, along with the corresponding annual percentage yield for each specified balance level (or range
of annual percentage yields, if appropriate), must be disclosed for tiered-rate accounts. (See Appendix A, Part
I, Paragraph D.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Stepped-rate accounts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A single annual percentage yield must be disclosed for stepped-rate accounts. (See Appendix A, Part I, Paragraph
B.) However, the interest rates and the period of time each will be in effect also must be provided. When the initial
rate offered on a variable-rate account is higher or lower than the rate that would otherwise be paid on the account,
the calculation of the annual percentage yield must be made as if for a stepped-rate account. (See Appendix A, Part
I, Paragraph C.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Deeming an account closed. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Institutions may provide in their deposit contract the actions by consumers that the institution will treat as closing
the account and that will result in the forfeiture of accrued but uncredited interest, such as when a consumer withdraws
all funds from the account prior to the date interest is credited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Methods and periods. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Institutions may use different methods or periods to calculate minimum balances for purposes of imposing a fee (daily
balance for a calendar month, for example) and accruing interest (average daily balance for a statement period, for
example). Each method and period must be disclosed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Additional information. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Institutions may disclose additional information such as the time of day after which deposits are treated as having
been received the following business day, and may use additional descriptive terms such as ``ledger'' or ``collected''
balances to disclose when interest begins to accrue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(b)(4) Fees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Types of fees. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The following are types of fees that must be disclosed in connection with an account: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Maintenance fees, such as monthly service fees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Fees related to deposits or withdrawals, such as fees for use of the institution's ATMs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Fees for special services, such as stop payment fees, fees for balance inquiries or verification of deposits,
and fees associated with checks returned unpaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Fees to open or to close accounts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Institutions need not disclose fees such as the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Fees assessed for services offered to account and nonaccount holders alike, such as fees for travelers checks
and wire transfers (even if different for nonaccount holders) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Incidental fees, such as fees associated with state escheat laws, garnishment or attorneys fees, and fees
for photocopying forms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Amount of fees. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Institutions must state the amount and conditions under which a fee may be imposed. Naming and describing the fee typically
satisfies this requirement. Some examples are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;``$4.00 monthly service fee'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;``$7.00 and up'' or ``fee depend on style of checks ordered'' for check printing fees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Tied-accounts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Institutions must state if fees that may be assessed against an account are tied to other accounts at the institution.
For example, if an institution ties the fees payable on a NOW account to balances held in the NOW account and in a savings
account, the NOW account disclosures must state that fact and explain how the fee is determined.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Limits on withdrawals or deposits during the term of a time account 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Limitations required by Regulation D, such as the number of withdrawals permitted from money market deposit
accounts by check to third parties each month (but they need not disclose that the institution reserves the right to
require a seven-day notice for a withdrawal from an account).

General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The term ``penalty'' need not be used to describe the loss that may be incurred by consumers for early withdrawal of
funds from time accounts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Examples. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Rollover time accounts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Institutions offering a grace period on rollover time accounts that automatically renew need not state whether interest
will be paid if the funds are withdrawn during the grace period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Nonrollover time accounts.

(a) Change in Terms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Form of notice. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Institutions may provide a change-in-term notice on or with a regular periodic statement or in another mailing. If
an institution provides notice through revised account disclosures, the changed term must be highlighted in some
manner. For example, institutions may state that a particular fee has been changed (also specifying the new amount)
or use an accompanying letter that refers to the changed term. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Terms that change upon the occurrence of an event. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Institutions that offer terms such as a fee waiver for employee account holders during their employment or for students
enrolled at a local university need not send advance notice of a change resulting from termination of employment or
enrollment if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The account-opening disclosures given (to the employee, for example) describe the term and the event that
would cause the term to change (such as the consumer's leaving the institution's employment), and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Notices are sent when the term is changed for other account holders, even though the term remains unchanged
for the consumer while employment or enrollment continues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->

Increase in fees. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A notice is not required even if an increase in check printing fees includes an amount added by the institution to the
price charged by a vendor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) Notice Before Maturity for Time Accounts Longer Than One Month That Renew Automatically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Maturity dates on nonbusiness days. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
For determining the term, institutions may ignore the fact that the disclosed maturity falls on a nonbusiness day
and the term is extended beyond the disclosed number of days. For example, a holiday or weekend may cause a ``one-year''
time account to extend beyond 365 days (or 366, in a leap year), or a ``one-month'' time account to extend beyond 31 days.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Disclosing when rates will be determined. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Disclosures that illustrate when the annual percentage yield will be available include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A specific date, such as ``October 28'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A date that is easily discernable, such as ``the Tuesday prior to the maturity date stated on the notice'' or
``as of the maturity date stated on this notice'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Institutions must indicate when the rate will be available if the date falls on a nonbusiness day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Alternative timing rule. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
To illustrate the alternative timing rule: An institution that offers a 10-day grace period must provide the disclosures
at least 10 days prior to the scheduled maturity date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Club accounts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Club accounts that are time accounts are covered by this paragraph, even though funds may be withdrawn at the end of
the current club period. For example, if the consumer has agreed to the transfer of payments from another account to
the time account for the next club period, the institution must comply with the requirements for automatically renewable
time accounts.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Renewal of a time account. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The following applies to a change in a term that becomes effective if a rollover time account is subsequently renewed:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If the change is initiated by the institution, the disclosure requirements of this paragraph. (Paragraph
5(a) applies if the change becomes effective prior to the maturity of the existing time account.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If initiated by the consumer, the account-opening disclosure requirements of &sect;230.4(b). (If the notice
required by this paragraph has been provided, institutions may give new account disclosures or disclosures that
reflect the new term.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, if a consumer who receives a prematurity notice on a one-year time account requests a rollover to a six-month
account, the institution must provide either account-opening disclosures that reflect the new maturity date or,
if all other terms previously disclosed in the prematurity notice remain the same, only the new maturity date.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

General Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
1. General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Institutions are not required to provide periodic statements. If they provide periodic statements, disclosures
need only be furnished to the extent applicable. For example, if no interest is earned for a statement period, institutions
need not disclose ``$0'' interest earned and ``0%'' annual percentage yield earned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Regulation E interim statements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
When an institution provides regular quarterly statements, and in addition provides a monthly interim statement
to comply with Regulation E, the interim statement need not comply with this section unless it states interest or rate
information. (See 12 CFR 205.9.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Institutions may provide certain information about an account (such as an MMDA) on the periodic statement for another
account (such as a NOW account) without triggering the disclosures required by this section, as long as: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The information is limited to the account number, the type of account, or balance information, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The institution also provides consumers a periodic statement that complies with this section for the account
(the MMDA, in the example).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
General.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Periodic statements must state fees debited to the account during the statement period even if assessed for an earlier
period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Itemizing fees by type.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 In itemizing fees by type, institutions may group together fees of the same type that are imposed more than once in the
period. If fees are grouped, the description must make clear that the dollar figure represents more than a single fee,
for example, ``total fees for checks written this period.'' Examples of fees that may not be grouped together are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Monthly maintenance and excess activity fees
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;``Transfer'' fees, if different dollar amounts are imposed_such as $.50 for deposits and $1.00 for withdrawals
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Fees for electronic fund transfers and fees for other services, such as balance inquiry or maintenance fees
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Identifying fees.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Statement details must enable the consumer to identify the specific fee. For example:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Institutions may use a code to identify a particular fee if the code is explained on the periodic statement or
in documents accompanying the statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Institutions using debit slips may disclose the date the fee was debited on the periodic statement and show
the amount and type of fee on the dated debit slip.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Relation to Regulation E.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Compliance with Regulation E complies with this section for the disclosure of fees related to electronic fund transfers
on periodic statements (for example, totaling all electronic funds transfer fees in a single figure).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
General.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Institutions that provide the beginning and ending dates of the period must make clear whether both dates are included
in the period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Opening or closing an account mid-cycle.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 If an account is opened or closed during the period for which a statement is sent, institutions must calculate the annual
percentage yield earned based on account balances for each day the account was open.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) Special Rule for Average Daily Balance Method
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
General.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 To illustrate, this rule applies when an institution calculates interest on a quarterly average daily balance and
sends monthly statements. The first two monthly statements may not state annual percentage yield earned and interest
earned figures; the third ``monthly'' statement will reflect the interest earned and the annual percentage yield
earned for the entire quarter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Length of the period.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Institutions must disclose the length of both the interest calculation period and the statement period. For example,
a statement could disclose a statement period of April 16 through May 15 and further state that ``the interest earned
and the annual percentage yield earned are based on your average daily balance for the period April 1 through April
30.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Quarterly statements and monthly compounding.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Institutions that use the average daily balance method to calculate interest on a monthly basis, but send statements
on a quarterly basis, may disclose a single interest (and annual percentage yield earned) figure. Alternatively,
an institution may disclose three interest earned and three annual percentage earned figures, one for each month
in the quarter, as long as the institution states the number of days (or beginning and ending date) in the interest period
if it is different from the statement period.

 Calculation methods that do not comply with the requirement to pay interest on the full amount of principal in the account
each day include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The ``ending balance'' method, where institutions pay interest on the balance in the account at the end of the
period

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Use of 365-day basis.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Institutions may apply a daily periodic rate that is greater than 1/365 of the interest rate_such as 1/360 of the interest
rate_as long as it is applied 365 days a year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Periodic interest payments.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 An institution can pay interest each day on the account and still make uniform interest payments. For example, for
a one-year certificate of deposit an institution could make monthly interest payments that are equal to 1/12 of the
amount of interest that will be earned for a 365-day period, or 11 uniform monthly payments and a final payment that
accounts for the total interest earned for the period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Leap year.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Institutions may apply a daily rate of 1/366 or 1/365 of the interest rate for 366 days in a leap year, if the account will
earn interest for February 29.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Maturity of time accounts.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Institutions are not required to pay interest after time accounts mature, such as:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;During any grace period offered by an institution for an automatically renewable time account, if the consumer
decides during that period not to renew the account
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Following the maturity of nonrollover time accounts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;When the maturity date falls on a holiday, and the consumer must wait until the next business day to obtain the
funds (See 12 CFR part 217, the Board's Regulation Q, for limitations on duration of interest payments.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Dormant accounts.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Institutions may contract with a consumer not to pay interest if the account becomes ``dormant,'' as defined by applicable
state or other law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(a)(2) Determination of Minimum Balance To Earn Interest
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Daily balance accounts.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Institutions that use the daily balance method to calculate interest and require a minimum balance to earn interest
may choose not to pay interest for days when the balance drops below the required daily minimum balance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Average daily balance accounts.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Institutions that use the average daily balance method to calculate interest and require a minimum balance to earn
interest may choose not to pay interest for the period in which the average daily balance does not meet the required
minimum.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Beneficial method.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Institutions may not require consumers to maintain both a minimum daily balance and a minimum average daily balance
to earn interest, such as by requiring the consumer to maintain a $500 daily balance and an average daily balance that
is higher or lower. But an institution could determine the minimum balance to earn interest by using a method that is
``unequivocally beneficial'' to the consumer such as the following: An institution using the daily balance method
to calculate interest and requiring a $500 minimum daily balance could choose to pay interest on the account (for those
days the minimum balance is not met) as long as the consumer maintained an average daily balance throughout the month
of $400.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Paying on full balance.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Institutions must pay interest on the full balance in the account once a consumer has met the required minimum balance.
For example, if an institution sets $300 as its minimum daily balance requirement to earn interest, and a consumer
deposits $500, the institution must pay the stated interest rate on the full $500 and not just on $200.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Negative balances prohibited.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Institutions must treat a negative account balance as zero to determine:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The daily or average daily balance on which interest will be paid
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Whether any minimum balance to earn interest is met (See commentary to Appendix A, Part II, which prohibits
institutions from using negative balances in calculating the interest figure for the annual percentage yield earned.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Club accounts.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Institutions offering club accounts (such as a ``holiday'' or ``vacation'' club) cannot impose a minimum balance
that is based on the total number or dollar amount of payments required under the club plan. For example, if a plan calls
for $10 weekly payments for 50 weeks, the institution cannot set a $500 minimum balance and then pay only if the consumer
makes all 50 payments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Minimum balances not affecting interest.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Institutions may use the daily balance, average daily balance, or other computation method to calculate minimum
balance requirements not involving the payment of interest_such as to compute minimum balances for assessing fees.

(b) Compounding and Crediting Policies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
General.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Institutions that choose to compound interest may compound or credit interest annually, semi-annually, quarterly,
monthly, daily, continuously, or on any other basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Withdrawals prior to crediting date.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 If consumers withdraw funds, without closing the account, prior to a scheduled crediting date, institutions may
delay paying the accrued interest on the withdrawn amount until the scheduled crediting date, but may not avoid paying
interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Closed accounts.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 If consumers close accounts prior to the date accrued interest is credited, institutions may choose not to pay accrued
interest as long as they have disclosed that fact to the consumer. Whether (and the conditions under which) institutions
are permitted to deem an account closed by a consumer is determined by state or other law, if any. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Dormant accounts.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Subject to state or other law defining when an account becomes dormant, an institution may contract with a consumer
not to pay accrued but uncredited interest if the account becomes dormant prior to the regular interest crediting
date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Relation to Regulation CC.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Institutions may rely on the Expedited Funds Availability Act (EFAA) and Regulation CC (12 CFR part 229) to determine,
for example, when a deposit is considered made for purposes of interest accrual, or when interest need not be paid on
funds because a deposited check is later returned unpaid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Ledger and collected balances.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Institutions may calculate interest by using a ``ledger'' balance or ``collected'' balance method, as long as the
crediting requirements of the EFAA are met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Withdrawal of principal.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Institutions must accrue interest on funds until the funds are withdrawn from the account. For example, if a check
is debited to an account on a Tuesday, the institution must accrue interest on those funds through Monday. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Indoor signs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 An indoor sign advertising an annual percentage yield is not misleading or inaccurate if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;For a tiered-rate account, it also provides the upper and lower dollar amounts of the advertised tier corresponding
to the annual percentage yield 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;For a time account, it also provides the term required to obtain the advertised yield
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
``Free'' or ``no cost'' accounts.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 For purposes of determining whether an account can be advertised as ``free'' or ``no cost,'' maintenance and activity
fees include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Any fee imposed if a minimum balance requirement is not met, or if the consumer exceeds a specified number of
transactions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Transaction and service fees that consumers reasonably expect to be regularly imposed on an account

&bull;Fees imposed to deposit, withdraw or transfer funds, including per-check or per-transaction charges (for
example, $.25 for each withdrawal, whether by check, in person or at an ATM owned by the institution) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Examples of fees that are not maintenance or activity fees include:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Similar terms.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 An advertisement may not use a term such as ``fees waived'' if a maintenance or activity fee may be imposed because it
is similar to the terms ``free'' or ``no cost.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Specific account services.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Institutions may advertise a specific account service or feature as free as long as no fee is imposed for that service
or feature. For example, institutions that provide free access to their ATMs could advertise that fact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Free for limited time.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 If an account or a specific account service is free only for a limited period of time_for example, for one year following
the account opening_the account or service may be advertised as free as long as the time period is stated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Conditions not related to deposit accounts.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Institutions may advertise accounts as ``free'' for consumers that meet conditions not related to deposit accounts
such as age. For example, institutions may advertise a NOW account as ``free for persons over 65 years old,'' even though
a maintenance or activity fee may be assessed on accounts held by consumers that are 65 or younger.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Tiered-rate accounts.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 An advertisement for a tiered-rate account that states an annual percentage yield must also state the annual percentage
yield for each tier, along with corresponding minimum balance requirements. Any interest rates stated must appear
in conjunction with the annual percentage yields for the applicable tier. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Stepped-rate accounts.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 An advertisement that states an interest rate for a stepped-rate account must state each interest rate and the time
period each rate is in effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Representative examples.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 An advertisement that states an annual percentage yield for a type of account (such as a time account) need not state
the annual percentage yield applicable to every variation offered by the institution. For example, if rates vary
depending on the amount of the initial deposit and term of a time account, institutions need not list each balance level
and term offered. Instead, the advertisement may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Provide a representative example of the annual percentage yields offered, clearly described as such. For
example, if an institution offers a $25 bonus on all time accounts and the annual percentage yield will vary depending
on the term selected, the institution may provide a disclosure of the annual percentage yield as follows: ``For example,
our 6-month certificate of deposit currently pays a 3.15% annual percentage yield.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Indicate that various rates are available, such as by stating short-term and longer-term maturities along
with the applicable annual percentage yields: ``We offer certificates of deposit with annual percentage yields
that depend on the maturity you choose. For example, our one-month CD earns a 2.75% APY. Or, earn a 5.25% APY for a three-year
CD.''

(c) When Additional Disclosures Are Required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Trigger terms.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Disclosures are triggered by statements such as ``We will pay a bonus of 1% over our current rate for one-year certificates
of deposit opened before April 15, 1995.'' The following are examples of information stated in advertisements that
are not ``trigger'' terms: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;``One, three, and five year CDs available'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;``Bonus rates available'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Specified recent date.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 If an advertisement discloses an annual percentage yield as of a specified date, that date must be recent in relation
to the publication or broadcast frequency of the media used. For example, the printing date of a brochure printed once
for a deposit account promotion that will be in effect for six months would be considered ``recent,'' even though rates
change during the six-month period. Rates published in a daily newspaper or on television must be a rate offered shortly
before (or on) the date the rates are published or broadcast.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the maturity date of a club account is set but the term may vary depending on when the account is opened, institutions
may use a phrase such as: ``The term of the account varies depending on when the account is opened. However, the maturity
date is November 15.''

Discretionary penalties.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Institutions that impose early withdrawal penalties on a case-by-case basis may disclose that they ``may'' (rather
than ``will'') impose a penalty if that accurately describes the account terms.

General reference to ``bonus.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 General statements such as ``bonus checking'' or ``get a bonus when you open a checking account'' do not trigger the
bonus disclosures.

General.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Indoor signs include advertisements displayed on computer screens, banners, preprinted posters, and chalk or peg
boards. Any advertisement inside the premises that can be retained by a consumer (such as a brochure or a printout from
a computer) is not an indoor sign.

Consumers outside the premises
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. Advertisements may be ``indoor signs'' even though they may be viewed by consumers from outside. An example is a banner
in an institution's glass-enclosed branch office, that is located behind a teller facing customers but also may be
seen by passersby.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Evidence of required actions
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. Institutions comply with the regulation by demonstrating they have done the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Established and maintained procedures for paying interest and providing timely disclosures as required
by the regulation, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Retained sample disclosures for each type account offered to consumers, such as account-opening disclosures,
copies of advertisements, and change-in-term notices; and information regarding the interest rates and annual
percentage yields offered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Methods of retaining evidence
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. Institutions must retain information needed to reconstruct the required disclosures or other actions. They need
not keep disclosures or other business records in hard copy. Records evidencing compliance may be retained on microfilm,
microfiche, or by other methods that reproduce records accurately (including computer files). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Payment of interest
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. Sufficient rate and balance information must be retained to permit the verification of interest paid on an account,
including the payment of interest on the full principal balance.

Appendix A to Part 230_Annual Percentage Yield Calculation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Part I. Annual Percentage Yield for Account Disclosures and Advertising Purposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Rounding for calculations
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. The following are examples of permissible rounding rules for calculating interest and the annual percentage yield:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The daily rate applied to a balance rounded to five or more decimals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The daily interest earned rounded to five or more decimals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Part II. Annual Percentage Yield Earned for Periodic Statements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Balance method
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. The interest figure used in the calculation of the annual percentage yield earned may be derived from the daily balance
method or the average daily balance method. The balance used in the annual percentage yield earned formula is the sum
of the balances for each day in the period divided by the number of days in the period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Negative balances prohibited
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. Institutions must treat a negative account balance as zero to determine the balance on which the annual percentage
yield earned is calculated. (See commentary to &sect;230.7(a)(2).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
A. General Formula 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Accrued but uncredited interest
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. To calculate the annual percentage yield earned, accrued but uncredited interest:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Shall not be included in the balance for statements that are issued at the same time or less frequently than the
account's compounding and crediting frequency. For example, if monthly statements are sent for an account that compounds
interest daily and credits interest monthly, the balance may not be increased each day to reflect the effect of daily
compounding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Shall be included in the balance for succeeding statements if a statement is issued more frequently than compounded
interest is credited on an account. For example, if monthly statements are sent for an account that compounds interest
daily and credits interest quarterly, the balance for the second monthly statement would include interest that had
accrued for the prior month. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Rounding
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. The interest earned figure used to calculate the annual percentage yield earned must be rounded to two decimals to
reflect the amount actually paid. For example, if the interest earned for a statement period is $20.074 and the institution
pays the consumer $20.07, the institution must use $20.07 (not $20.074) to calculate the annual percentage yield
earned. For accounts that pay interest based on the daily balance method, compound and credit interest quarterly,
and send monthly statements, the institution may, but need not, round accrued interest to two decimals for calculating
the annual percentage yield earned on the first two monthly statements issued during the quarter. However, on the
quarterly statement the interest earned figure must reflect the amount actually paid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Special Formula for Use Where Periodic Statement Is Sent More Often Than the Period for Which Interest Is Compounded

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Statements triggered by Regulation E
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. Institutions may, but need not, use this formula to calculate the annual percentage yield earned for accounts that
receive quarterly statements and that are subject to Regulation E's rule calling for monthly statements when an electronic
fund transfer has occurred. They may do so even though no monthly statement was issued during a specific quarter. This
formula must be used for accounts that compound and credit interest quarterly and that receive monthly statements,
triggered by Regulation E, which comply with the provisions of &sect;230.6.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Days in compounding period
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Appendix B to Part 230_Model Clauses and Sample Forms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Modifications
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. Institutions that modify the model clauses will be deemed in compliance as long as they do not delete information
required by the act or regulation or rearrange the format so as to affect the substance or clarity of the disclosures.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Format
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. Institutions may use inserts to a document (see Sample Form B&hyph;4) or fill-in blanks (see Sample Forms B&hyph;5,
B&hyph;6 and B&hyph;7, which use double underlining to indicate terms that have been filled in) to show current rates,
fees or other terms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Disclosures for opening accounts
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. The sample forms illustrate the information that must be provided to a consumer when an account is opened, as required
by &sect;230.4(a)(1). (See &sect;230.4(a)(2), which states the requirements for disclosing the annual percentage
yield, the interest rate, and the maturity of a time account in responding to a consumer's request.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Compliance with Regulation E
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. Institutions may satisfy certain requirements under Regulation DD with disclosures that meet the requirements
of Regulation E. (See &sect;230.3(c).) The model clauses and sample forms do not give examples of disclosures that
would be covered by both this regulation and Regulation E (such as disclosing the amount of a fee for ATM usage). Institutions
should consult appendix A to Regulation E for appropriate model clauses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Duplicate disclosures
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. If a requirement such as a minimum balance applies to more than one account term (to obtain a bonus and determine the
annual percentage yield, for example), institutions need not repeat the requirement for each term, as long as it is
clear which terms the requirement applies to. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Guide to model clauses
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. In the model clauses, italicized words indicate the type of disclosure an institution should insert in the space
provided (for example, an institution might insert ``March 25, 1993'' in the blank for ``(date)'' disclosure). Brackets
and diagonals (``/'') indicate an institution must choose the alternative that describes its practice (for example,
[daily balance/average daily balance]). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Sample forms
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. The sample forms (B&hyph;4 through B&hyph;8) serve a purpose different from the model clauses. They illustrate
various ways of adapting the model clauses to specific accounts. The clauses shown relate only to the specific transactions
described.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Format
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. The sample form has been marked with an ``X'' to indicate it is for a NOW account and provides for both a fee schedule
insert and a rate sheet insert. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Rate sheet insert
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. In the rate sheet insert, the calculations of the annual percentage yield for the three-month and six-month certificates
are based on 92 days and 181 days respectively.

1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
General
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. Sample Form B&hyph;6 uses Tiering Method A (discussed in Appendix A and Clause (a)(iv)) to calculate interest. It
gives a narrative description of a tiered-rate account; institutions may use a different format (for example, a chart
similar to the one in Sample Form B&hyph;4), as long as all required information for each tier is clearly presented.
The form does not contain a separate disclosure of the minimum balance required to obtain the annual percentage yield;
the tiered-rate disclosure provides that information.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Board's Access Rules implement the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a). This proposed revision of the Board's Access
Rules is a part of the Board's ongoing program to review and update its existing regulations. There have been no substantive
changes to the Privacy Act recently, accordingly, there is no need for substantive changes to the Board's Privacy
Act Rules. The most significant change proposed to the Board's Privacy Act Rules is the establishment of special procedures
for requesting access or amendment to records maintained by the Board's Office of the Inspector General, which was
established in 1989.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most other proposed changes are procedural or administrative in nature. The proposed regulation clarifies that
the Secretary of the Board is the official custodian of records with the delegated authority to respond to requests
for access or amendment, except for requests for records maintained by the Office of the Inspector General. The duplication
fees to be charged for documents produced in response to a request for access under the Privacy Act are proposed to be
the same as those charged for documents produced in response to a request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA),
because requests under the Privacy Act are likely to be processed also under FOIA. (No fees for search or review are
proposed, because such fees are not authorized under the Privacy Act.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board proposes to change the special procedures for release of medical records to clarify that release of medical
records through a licensed physician does not permit the licensed physician to withhold the medical records from
the requester. Rather, the licensed physician is expected to provide access to the medical records while explaining
sensitive or complex information contained in the medical records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the proposed rule specifically lists the Board's systems of records that are exempt from certain provisions
of the Privacy Act to the extent they contain either law enforcement information or reference information provided
in confidence. Following adoption of this proposed rule in final (after receipt and review of comments), the Board
intends to review and update the Board's systems of records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 603(b)), a ``description of the reasons why action by the agency
is being considered'' and a ``succinct statement of the objectives or, and legal basis for, the proposed rule'' are
found elsewhere in this preamble. The Board proposes that the provisions in this rule be applicable to all persons
submitting requests for access to information under the Privacy Act of 1974 (5U.S.C. 552a). An exemption for small
entities is not appropriate because the Privacy Act protects the privacy of individuals from unauthorized access
by any entity. This proposed rule is not expected to have any significant impact on small entities.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 408(d) of Public Law 102&hyph;366 (September 4, 1992) directs SBA to review and to revise those regulations
intended to provide for the ``safety and soundness'' of Leveraged Licensees, with a view towards exempting non-Leveraged
Licensees from compliance with inappropriate regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, SBA has identified 7 areas of its regulations where some exemptions to certain provisions could be made.
Three regulatory changes that would distinguish between Leveraged and non-Leveraged Licensees have already been
proposed. See 58 FR 41882 at 41894 and 41896, August 5, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In selecting those areas in which regulatory relief could be granted, SBA tried to balance two objectives: (1) To insure
that SBIC investing promotes the ``flow of private equity capital and long-term loan funds which small-business
concerns need for the sound financing of their business operations and for their growth, expansion, and modernization'';
and (2) to reduce the financial risk to the Government that arises from its guarantees or purchases of Leverage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an SBIC has no Leverage, the Government is obviously not at financial risk. Therefore, in many instances, relief
from certain regulations can be provided. SBA therefore proposes to provide exemptions to non-Leveraged Licensees
from compliance with certain sections that are discussed below. It should be clearly understood, however, that a
Licensee that has availed itself of the exemptions proposed to be extended to non-Leveraged Licensees must bring
itself into compliance with all applicable regulations before any Leverage may be extended; and no Leverage will
be extended on the basis of a Licensee's promise to bring itself into compliance subsequently.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under &sect;107.709, changes in the compensation of an SBIC's managers now require advance approval by SBA. SBA's
underlying concern is the risk to its position as an investor in or (contingent) creditor of the Licensee as the result
of dissipation of assets through the payment of compensation that may be excessive relative to the size of an SBIC.
However, without Leverage funds at risk, SBA would not be as concerned about levels of compensation so long as required
minimum capital levels were maintained. Accordingly, a non-Leveraged Licensee would not be required to obtain SBA's
prior approval for its compensation arrangements; however, all compensation agreements and changes therein would
be required to be reported for subsequent approval pursuant to &sect;107.1004(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 107.710 imposes limitations on the expenditures a Licensee may make for the maintenance and preservation
of physical assets acquired in connection with the liquidation of a Portfolio asset, including payments of mortgage
interest, principal, and taxes. SBA proposes to exempt non-Leveraged Licensees from the requirement of SBA approval
for such expenditures, and to leave the determination to make such expenditures entirely to the discretion of the
non-Leveraged Licensee's managers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The minimum Private Capital levels of $2.5 million for section 301(c) companies and $1.5 million for section 301(d)
companies are floors established by the Act. If a Licensee has no Leverage, SBA is not at financial risk if Private Capital
is reduced. Accordingly, &sect;107.802 is proposed to be amended so that non-Leveraged Licensees may have voluntary
decreases in Private Capital as long as they do not drop below the applicable statutory minimum. Licensees which are
liquidating in accordance with a plan previously approved in writing by SBA may decrease private capital without
restriction. All decreases in private capital for non-leveraged licensees shall still be reported to SBA pursuant
to &sect;107.1004(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under &sect;107.904(a) SBA's prior written approval is presently required whenever a Licensee disposes of assets,
including assets acquired in liquidation, by transfer to an Associate (except as a dividend); and SBA's approval
is conditional upon a showing that the proposed terms of disposal are no less favorable to the Licensee than are elsewhere
obtainable. The need for such a restriction is obvious when SBA is at risk as a guarantor, creditor, or investor. When
no such risk to SBA exists, the need for the restriction disappears.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule will not be a significant regulatory action for the purposes of Executive Order 12866 because,
if promulgated as final, it is not likely to have an annual impact on the national economy of $100 million or more, and,
for purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, it will not have a significant economic impact upon a substantial number of small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule is proposed pursuant to a statutory mandate (Section 408(d) of Pub. L. 102&hyph;366) direction SBA to review
its regulations and to exempt non-Leveraged Licensees from compliance with those regulations primarily intended
to insure the safety and soundness of Leveraged Licensees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential benefits of this proposed regulation have been set forth in the discussion above, under Supplementary
Information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential cost of this proposed regulation cannot be quantified or estimated.

to a previously-approved contract, shall be submitted to SBA for SBA's prior written approval; any doubt regarding
the materiality of a change shall be resolved by submission to SBA. Licensees with no outstanding Leverage shall submit
all such contracts, or material changes, to SBA within 30 days of execution for postapproval, pursuant to &sect;107.1004.

Description of Rulechange Sought: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
To require operators and third party maintenance facilities to use standardized forms when performing routine and
non-routine maintenance at the C-check level and above.

Petitioner's Reason for the Request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
The petitioner feels the enormous variation in methods and forms leads to extreme difficulty in comparative analysis;
and that by standardizing the forms, the ability to draw meaningful conclusions will be significantly improved,
thereby enhancing safety and FAR compliance.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain de Havilland,
Inc., Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;100 and &hyph;300 series airplanes, that currently requires inspection to detect
cracks of the upper drag strut trunnion fittings of the nose landing gear, inspection to verify tightness of the fitting
attachment bolts, and replacement of the fittings or fasteners, if necessary. This action would require a terminating
modification that would eliminate the need for repetitive inspections; and would limit the applicability of the
rule. This proposal is prompted by the development of a modification that positively addresses the identified unsafe
condition. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of the upper drag strut trunnion
fittings of the nose landing gear, which could lead to collapse of the nose landing gear.

Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 15, 1993, the FAA issued AD 93&hyph;08&hyph;03, Amendment 39&hyph;8550 (58 FR 25549, April 27, 1993), applicable
to certain de Havilland Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;100 and &hyph;300 series airplanes, to require inspection to detect
cracks of the upper drag strut trunnion fittings of the nose landing gear, inspection to verify tightness of the fitting
attachment bolts, and replacement of the fittings or fasteners, if necessary. That action was prompted by reports
of cracks detected in two trunnion fittings which retain and support the nose landing gear upper drag link. Studies
indicate that these fittings have a low fatigue life. Initial investigations revealed that ground handling caused
higher loads than initially predicted, primarily due to towing of the airplane. Cracked trunnion fittings may be
further aggravated by loose fasteners (loose nuts, washers, and bolts). The requirements of that AD are intended
to prevent failure of the upper drag strut trunnion fittings of the nose landing gear, which could lead to collapse
of the nose landing gear.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since issuance of that AD, the manufacturer has designed a modification of the nose landing gear drag link trunnion
fittings and fasteners that will significantly improve the fatigue life of these parts and should eliminate the possibility
of cracked fittings. De Havilland has issued Service Bulletin S.B. 8&hyph;53&hyph;45, dated July 12, 1993, that
describes procedures for installation of Modification 8/1880, which entails replacing both currently-installed
upper drag strut trunnion fittings and fasteners of the nose landing gear with new, improved upper drag strut trunnion
fittings and new fasteners, and installation of a new sensor bracket. Installation of new fasteners will secure the
fittings. The grease nipple in each new fitting is installed at an angle to the horizontal to allow easier access for
lubrication. Transport Canada Aviation, which is the airworthiness authority for Canada, has approved this service
bulletin, but it has not classified it as mandatory.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed Modification 8/1880 and has determined that implementation of this modification will positively
address the unsafe condition identified as failure of the upper drag strut trunnion fittings of the nose landing gear,
which could lead to collapse of the nose landing gear.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of Section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement.
Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada Aviation has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of Transport Canada Aviation, reviewed all available information,
and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in
the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of the same type design
registered in the United States, the proposed AD would supersede AD 93&hyph;08&hyph;03 to continue to require inspection
to detect cracks of the upper drag strut trunnion fittings of the nose landing gear, inspection to verify tightness
of the fitting attachment bolts, and replacement of the fittings or fasteners, if necessary. Additionally, the proposed
AD would require incorporation of Modification 8/1880. When accomplished, this modification would terminate the
need for the currently required inspections. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with
the service bulletin described previously.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the proposed AD would limit the applicability of the rule to exclude those airplanes on which Modification
8/1880 has been accomplished previously. The manufacturer has installed Modification 8/1880 on airplanes having
serial numbers 385 and subsequent prior to delivery. Airplanes so modified are not subject to the unsafe condition
addressed by this proposed AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 125 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
9 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required
parts would cost approximately $1,860 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed
AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $294,375, or $2,355 per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to revoke the Class
C and Class E airspace areas at Mather AFB, Sacramento, CA, due to the closure of Mather AFB on May 15, 1993. This proposed
rule would also alter the Sacramento, McClellan AFB, CA, Class C airspace area to encompass part of the airspace previously
delegated to Mather AFB. This proposal would alter the Sacramento Executive Airport, CA, Class D airspace area designation
by removing all references to the Sacramento Mather AFB. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North
American Datum 83. Class C, D, and E airspace designations are published in paragraphs 4000, 5000, and 6003, respectively,
of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14
CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class C, D, and E airspace designations listed in this document would be subsequently
removed or published, as appropriate, in the Order.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulatory Evaluation Summary
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'', as defined by Executive
Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review). The anticipated costs and benefits associated with this proposed
rule are summarized below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule would revoke the Mather Air Force Base (AFB) Class C and Class E airspace areas at Sacramento, CA,
due to the closure of Mather AFB on May 15, 1993. In addition, this proposed rule would accomplish two other objectives.
First, it would alter the Sacramento Executive Airport, CA, Class D airspace area designation, by removing all references
to the Sacramento Mather AFB. Second, it would modify the McClellan AFB Class C airspace area, at Sacramento, CA, by
expanding the boundaries to the south. This modification would be necessary to prevent a potential deterioration
of safety that could result from greater mixing of visual flight rules (VFR) operations and instrument flight rules
(IFR) operations once the Class C airspace area at Mather AFB is revoked. The FAA has determined that the revocation
of the Class C airspace area at Mather AFB would reduce the Class C airspace area and expose the arrival flow of air traffic
to the McClellan AFB to more potentially conflicting VFR traffic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Class C airspace area concept (like that for Class B airspace, though to a lesser extent) was developed to reduce
the likelihood of midair collisions in the congested airspace surrounding large airports in which large turbine-powered
aircraft are mixing with smaller aircraft of varying performance characteristics. In addition, VFR and IFR aircraft
are also mixing. As this complexity increases, so does the potential for midair collisions. This type of condition
warrants an expansion of Class C airspace. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary benefit of this proposed rule is that it would ensure that the current level of aviation safety remains
intact. The termination of the Mather AFB Class C airspace area would permit transiting VFR aircraft to fly closer
to McClellan AFB without entering the Class C airspace area. In order to minimize potential conflicts with traffic
intending to land or take off from the airport, the FAA has concluded that the Class C airspace area at McClellan AFB
should be expanded to the south. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule would have a positive impact on operational efficiency by allocating additional airspace to users
who choose to avoid the Class C airspace area. The revocation of the Class C airspace area at Mather AFB would significantly
contract the Class C airspace area in the vicinity of McClellan AFB. Aircraft operators who previously circumnavigated
the Mather AFB Class C airspace area would be able to fly in this airspace without contacting ATC or having to satisfy
associated avionics requirements. The planned expansion in the McClellan AFB Class C airspace area would involve
some of the airspace that formerly belonged to the Mather Class C airspace area. Therefore, no additional airspace
would be converted into Class C airspace. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule would not impose additional administrative cost on the FAA for either personnel or equipment.
The additional operations workload the proposed rule is expected to generate can be handled with current personnel
and equipment resources in place at the McClellan AFB, CA, Class C airspace area. Another potential cost to the FAA
associated with the proposed rule would be the revision of aeronautical charts to reflect the change in airspace around
McClellan AFB. The change would be incorporated during the routine updating and printing of the charts, however,
so that all costs associated with printing aeronautical charts are assumed to be a normal cost of doing business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule is not expected to impose any incremental costs on users to the McClellan AFB, CA, Class C airspace
area. This assessment is based on the fact that the proposed rule would only modify the McClellan AFB, CA, Class C airspace
area by expanding it to the south of McClellan AFB. This additional airspace would be taken from the Mather AFB Class
C airspace area. Any users of this airspace (i.e., pilot schools, air taxi operators, general aviation (GA) operators)
would be able to continue their flying practices in the same manner as before. Thus, the proposed rule would not adversely
affect these airspace users. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule would not impose any costs on either the FAA, the aviation community, or society. Although the FAA
concludes that this proposed rule would not have an impact on safety other than to ensure the maintenance of current
levels, the rule proposed is expected to promote the efficiency of operations. Thus, the FAA contends that this proposed
rule is cost-beneficial.

Regulatory Flexibility Determination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily and disproportionately
burdened by Government regulations. The RFA requires agencies to review rules that may have ``a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' The types of small entities that would be potentially affected
by the implementation of the proposed rule are air taxi operators and pilot schools.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Neither air taxi operators nor pilot schools would be impacted by this planned expansion. This assessment is based
on the fact that this expansion would capture some of the airspace that was previously included in the Mather AFB Class
C airspace area. Current users of this airspace would be able to continue to do so in the same manner as before. Thus,
there would be no incremental cost impact on these operators as a result of this proposed rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would not have an effect on the sale of foreign aviation products or services in the United States,
nor would it have an effect on the sale of U.S. products or services in foreign countries because the proposed rule would
neither impose costs on aircraft operators nor aircraft manufacturers (U.S. or foreign).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On January 22, 1993, the Federal Supply Service (FSS) published notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 5731) of its intent after October 1, 1993, to discontinue issuing paper deliver orders in favor of electronic
distribution of delivery orders under stock, special order program, and schedule contracts. This change to the GSAR
revises the clause at 552.216&hyph;73, Placement of Orders, to provide for placement of orders through computer-to-computer
Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) or by an alternative method employing facsimile transmission if computer-to-computer
EDI is not possible. Other agencies, if authorized to directly place delivery orders under a GSA contract, may continue
to mail paper orders. The change also prescribes a new clause describing ordering information a contractor should
provide to the contracting officer.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An initial regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared and submitted to the Acting Chief Counsel for Advocacy
of the Small Business Administration. Copies of the initial regulatory flexibility analysis are available from
the office identified above. The initial regulatory flexibility analysis indicates that the proposed rule will
affect contractors, including small businesses under FSS solicitations issued under its Stock, Special Order,
and Multiple Award Schedule Programs. In FY 1993 more than 850 solicitations were issued and approximately 35,000
offers were received. Approximately 75 percent were received from small business concerns. On January 22, 1993,
FSS published a notice of intent to discontinue placing paper delivery orders (58 FR 5731) and invited public comment.
Of the 70 comments received there were five received from small businesses that expressed concern about the effect
of the policy on small business. One stated it personally would not be affected and a second indicated the policy would
impose some inconvenience as it currently had no computer or FAX capability. Three expressed concern over their ability
to continue to be Government suppliers as they currently had neither a EDI compatible computer or facsimile machine.

The information collection requirements contained in this proposed rule have been submitted to the Office of Management
and Budget for approval. Comments on the information collection requirements may be directed to the Office of Information
and Regulatory Affairs of OMB, Attention: Desk Officer for GSA, Washington, DC 20503. The title of one of the information
collections is ``GSAR 552.216&hyph;73, Placement of Orders,'' used in GSA's Federal Supply Services' (FSS's) Stock,
Special Order, and Schedule Programs. FSS intends to maximize the use of computer-to-computer electronic data interchange
(EDI) to place delivery orders. To accomplish computer-to-computer EDI, a company will have to enter into a Trading
Partner Agreement (TPA) with FSS (as an alternative, a contractor can receive delivery orders through facsimile
transmission). This extended use of EDI furthers congressional and executive branch policies that Federal agencies
provide leadership in advancing environmental objectives through technology and the expanded use of electronic
commerce.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSS anticipates entering into 400 TPA's with contractors, an expansion of the information collection currently
approved under OMB Control No. 3090&hyph;0248. The same protocols apply to a contractor's commercial activity.
Consequently, if it currently uses electronic commerce for its commercial activity, the total burden is the time
it takes to sign and submit its current protocols. Otherwise, it is estimated that it would take approximately one
hour for a contractor to develop the necessary protocols. Based upon one hour per respondent, the additional burden
to the public will be 400 hours. The title of the second information collection is 552.216&hyph;74, Ordering Information.
This information collection requires offerors to identify their representative who is familiar with establishing
EDI interfaces; telephone numbers of facsimile equipment, if computer-to-computer EDI is not practicable; and
postal mailing addresses, if delivery orders are mailed. It is estimated that it will take an average of one-half hour
to develop this information.

speckled hind per vessel and prohibit sale of these species; (3) include tilefish species in the current grouper bag
limit; (4) require that vessel logbooks be submitted by all permitted vessels; and (5) close the Oculina Bank habitat
area of particular concern to fishing for snapper-grouper species and prohibit fishing while anchored in that area.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Amendment 6 was prepared by NMFS under authority of section 304(c)(1)(B) of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and
Management Act (Magnuson Act), which provides for the Secretary to prepare an FMP or FMP amendment when the appropriate
Council does not submit a revised amendment to replace a disapproved portion of an FMP amendment. The Secretary does
not intend to implement this amendment unless absolutely necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to a severely overfished condition of haddock, cod, and yellowtail flounder, the Council submitted Amendment
5 to the FMP, which was approved January 3, 1994, except for two measures that were disapproved on September 30, 1993.
The two disapproved measures were a 5,000-pound (2,268-kg) possession limit for haddock and an exemption to the FMP
regulations for winter flounder when fishing in state waters. The 5,000-pound (2,268-kg) possession limit for haddock
was disapproved because the Secretary determined it was inadequate to protect haddock stocks on the Georges Bank
and in the Gulf of Maine, which are at historically low levels of abundance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An emergency rule was implemented effective from January 3, 1994, through April 2, 1994 (59 FR 26, January 3, 1994),
that contains the following measures: (1) A possession limit for haddock for all vessels permitted under the multispecies
fishery, except scallop dredge vessels, which are prohibited from possessing or landing haddock; (2) a closure of
the Closed Area II to all vessels except scallop dredge vessels and lobster pot vessels from January through May; (3)
an expansion of Closed Area II by 20 minutes longitude west and 15 minutes latitude south, along its western and southern
boundaries; (4) a suspension of the February through May closure of Closed Area I to all vessels except those using
sink gillnet gear; (5) a prohibition on transfer of fish at sea; and (6) a ban on pair trawling in the multispecies fishery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendment 5 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Northeast Multispecies Fishery was approved on January 3, 1994,
and has several measures also contained in the emergency rule. Since Amendment 5 is scheduled for implementation
before the current emergency rule expires on April 2, 1994, those measures are not contained in proposed Amendment
6. Measures contained in Amendment 5 that are not contained in proposed Amendment 6 are: (1) An expansion of the size
of Closed Area II; (2) a suspension of the closure of Closed Area I to all vessels except vessels using sink gillnet gear;
(3) a prohibition on the transfer of fish at sea; and (4) a ban on pair trawling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed Amendment 6 contains two measures: (1) A 500-pound (226.8-kg) possession limit for haddock, for all vessels
permitted under the multispecies fishery, except sea scallop dredge vessels which are prohibited from possessing
or landing haddock, and (2) a closure of Closed Area II to all vessels, except lobster pot vessels and scallop dredge
vessels, from January through June, on an annual basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS is interested in receiving comments on Amendment 6, the EA and RIR and will consider all public comments before
a decision is made whether or not to approve the Amendment. Proposed regulations to implement Amendment 6 will be published
within 15 days after the submission of the amendment to the New England Fishery Management Council for its consideration
and comment as required under section 304(c)(2)(A)(iii) of the Magnuson Act.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is supplementing its December 31, 1991 proposal to rescind 40 CFR part 61, subpart T (subpart T) as it applies to
owners and operators of uranium mill tailings disposal sites licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)
or an affected Agreement State (Agreement States). This document supplements, and does not withdraw EPA's prior
proposal to rescind. This document describes and invites comment on provisions for reconsideration of rescission
and reinstatement of subpart T, and describes relevant events that have occurred since the December 1991 proposal.
Additionally, EPA invites comment on the Agency's proposed determination that the NRC regulatory program protects
public health with an ample margin of safety, including specific aspects of that determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Neither proposal applies to uranium mill tailings disposal sites regulated under subpart T that are also under the
control of the Department of Energy (DOE). As a National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs)
promulgated on December 15, 1989, subpart T regulates emissions of radon-222 into the ambient air from uranium mill
tailings disposal sites. EPA is requesting comments only on the contents of this notice and has included a specific
request for comments as to certain aspects of this proposal. EPA is establishing a 45 day comment period for receipt
of all comments.

Uranium mill tailings are sand-like wastes that result from the processing of uranium ore. Tailings are stored in
large surface impoundments, called piles, in amounts from less than one million tons to over thirty million tons,
over areas that may cover hundreds of acres. Most piles are located in the Western United States, and all piles emit
radon gas, a decay product of radium in the waste material resulting from the processing of ore to recover uranium at
the uranium mills.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To deal specifically with the risks associated with these tailings, Congress passed the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation
Control Act (UMTRCA) in 1978 (42 U.S.C. 2022, 7901&hyph;7942). In enacting UMTRCA, Congress found that uranium mill
tailings may pose a potential and significant radiation health hazard to the public, and that every reasonable effort
should be made to provide for the stabilization, disposal, and control in a safe and environmentally sound manner
of such tailings in order to prevent or minimize radon diffusion into the environment and to prevent or minimize other
environmental hazards from such tailings. See 42 U.S.C. 7901(a). Under UMTRCA, two programs were established to
protect public health and the environment from the hazards associated with uranium mill tailings. One program (Title
I) required the Department of Energy (DOE) to conduct the necessary remedial actions at designated inactive uranium
mill tailing sites to achieve compliance with the general environmental standards to be promulgated by EPA. These
sites were generally abandoned uranium processing sites for which a license issued by the NRC or its predecessor,
the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), was not in effect on January 1, 1978. The other program (Title II) pertained to
active sites, which are those that are licensed by the NRC or an affected Agreement State. Requirements for licensed
sites include the final disposal of tailings, including the control of radon after milling operations cease. UMTRCA
also required that EPA promulgate standards for these licensed sites, including standards that protect human health
and the environment in a manner consistent with standards established under Subtitle C of the Solid Waste Disposal
Act, as amended. The NRC, or an Agreement State, is responsible for implementing the EPA standards at licensed uranium
milling sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of NRC's 1982 authorization and appropriations, Congress amended UMTRCA on January 4, 1983. Public Law 97&hyph;415,
sections 18(a) and 22(b), reprinted in 2 1982 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News at 96 Stat. 2077 and 2080. As partially
amended thereby, EPA was required to promulgate standards of general applicability for the protection of the public
health, safety, and the environment from radiological and nonradiological hazards associated with the processing
and with the possession, transfer, and disposal of byproduct material as defined under section 11e(2) of the AEA,
e.g., uranium mill tailings. Requirements established by the NRC with respect to byproduct material must conform
to the EPA standards. Any requirements of such standards adopted by the NRC shall be amended as the NRC deems necessary
to conform to EPA's standards. In establishing such standards, the Administrator was to consider the risk to the public
health, safety, and the environment, the environmental and economic costs of applying such standards, and such other
factors as the Administrator determines to be appropriate. See 42 U.S.C. 2022(b)(1).

As promulgated by EPA under subpart D of 40 CFR part 192 in 1983 and implemented by NRC pursuant to its regulations at
10 CFR part 40, appendix A, a Title II site licensed by NRC or an Agreement State, could indefinitely continue to emit
radon at levels that could result in risks higher than allowed under the CAA. It was this possibility which compelled
EPA to promulgate subpart T of 40 CFR part 61 under CAA section 112. In addition, the UMTRCA regulations prior to the
recent EPA amendments called for an impoundment design that would achieve compliance with the 20

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 16, 1985, NRC promulgated rules at 10 CFR part 40, appendix A to conform NRC's regulations issued five years
earlier to the provisions of EPA's general UMTRCA standards other than those affecting ground water protection at
40 CFR part 192. (50 FR 41852). NRC completed conforming amendments for groundwater protection in appendix A of part
40 in 1987. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Neither the UMTRCA standards promulgated by EPA in 1983 nor the NRC standards promulgated in 1985, established compliance
schedules to ensure that non-operational tailings piles would be closed, and that the 20 pCi/m2-s standard would
be met, within a reasonable period of time. Moreover, the EPA standards and NRC criteria also did not require monitoring
to ensure compliance with the flux standard. 50 FR 41852 (October 16, 1985). To rectify these shortcomings of the current
EPA and NRC programs regulating uranium mill tailings, EPA promulgated standards under Section 112 of the CAA on October
31, 1989, to ensure that the piles would be closed in a timely manner with monitoring. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 15, 1989, EPA promulgated national standards regulating radionuclide emissions to the ambient air from
several source categories, including non-operational sites used for the disposal of uranium mill tailings. (54
FR 51654). These sites are either under the control of the DOE pursuant to Title I of the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation
Control Act (UMTRCA) of 1978, 42 U.S.C. 7901 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., or are under the control of NRC or Agreement State-licensees pursuant to Title II of UMTRCA. These standards_subpart
T of 40 CFR part 61 (subpart T)_were promulgated pursuant to the authority of Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) section 112 as
it existed in 1989. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart T of 40 CFR part 61, limits radon-222 emissions to the ambient air from non-operational uranium mill tailings
disposal sites licensed by the NRC or an affected Agreement State. Subpart T requires that these sites, which consist
of large (i.e., numerous acre) impoundments or piles, comply with a radon flux standard of 20 pCi/m2-s. 40 CFR 61.222(a).
Moreover, compliance must be achieved within two years of when the site becomes non-operational, 40 CFR 61.222(b),
which for piles which had ceased operation prior to the time of promulgation was no later than December 15, 1991. While
at the time of promulgation EPA recognized that many sources might not be able to achieve this date, EPA was constrained
by then existing CAA section 112(c)(1)(B)(ii) which allows a maximum of two years for facilities to come into compliance.
EPA stated that for those sites which could not meet the two-year date, the Agency would negotiate expeditious compliance
schedules pursuant to its enforcement authority under CAA section 113. See 54 FR 51683. Subpart T also calls for monitoring
and recordkeeping to establish and demonstrate compliance. See 40 CFR 61.223 and 61.224. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart T was part of a larger promulgation of radionuclide NESHAPs that represent the Agency's application of the
policy for regulating CAA section 112 pollutants which was first announced in the benzene NESHAP. 54 FR 38044 (September
14, 1989). The NESHAP policy utilized a two-step approach. In the first step, EPA considered the lifetime risk to the
maximally exposed individual, and found that it is presumptively acceptable if it is no higher than approximately
one in ten thousand. This presumptive level provides a benchmark for judging the acceptability of a category of emissions.
This first step also considers other health and risk factors such as projected incidence of cancer, the estimated
number of persons exposed within each individual lifetime risk range, the weight of evidence presented in the risk
assessment, and the estimated incidence of non-fatal cancer and other health effects. After considering all of this
information, a final decision on a safe level of acceptable risk is made. This becomes the starting point for the second
step, determining the ample margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the second step, EPA strives to provide protection for the greatest number of persons possible to an individual
lifetime risk level no higher than approximately one in one million. In this step, the Agency sets a standard which
provides an ample margin of safety, again considering all of the health risk and other health information considered
in the first step, as well as additional factors such as costs and economic impacts of controls, technological feasibility,
uncertainties, and any other relevant factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA noted that standards it had already promulgated pursuant to the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act (UMTRCA)
of 1978 (42 U.S.C. 2022, 7901&hyph;7942) would eventually limit radon emissions from those sites to a flux of 20 pCi/m2-s
(see 40 CFR part 192, subpart D), and thus EPA referred to that level as ``baseline.'' EPA's risk assessment revealed
that compliance with the 20 pCi/m2-s baseline would result in an estimated lifetime risk to the maximally exposed
individual of approximately 1 x 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4, a level EPA determined to be safe under the first step of the analysis. EPA further concluded in the second step, which
considers additional factors such as cost and technological feasibility, that the baseline level also provided
an ample margin of safety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Even though EPA determined that the baseline was protective of public health with an ample margin of safety, EPA still
found it was necessary to promulgate subpart T. This was because the baseline assumed compliance with the UMTRCA regulations
even though those regulations did not require that compliance occur in the foreseeable future and, in fact, many sites
were not proceeding towards the baseline level at the time subpart T was promulgated. In other words, EPA promulgated
subpart T to address the timing issue, which was not addressed in the UMTRCA regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary subpart T standard is the requirement that radon-222 emissions not exceed a flux of 20 pCi/m2-s. 40 CFR
61.222(a). Additionally, it requires that, once a uranium mill tailings pile or impoundment ceases to be operational,
it must be disposed of and brought into compliance with the emission limit within two years of the effective date of
the standard (by December 15, 1991) or within two years of the day it ceases to be operational, whichever is later. Lastly,
it requires monitoring of the disposed pile to demonstrate compliance with the radon emission limit. See 40 CFR 61.223
and 61.224. In its 1989 action, EPA recognized that even though NRC implements general EPA standards (promulgated
under UMTRCA) which also regulate these sites and call for compliance with a 20 pCi/m2-s flux standard (see 40 CFR part
192, subpart D), the UMTRCA regulatory program did not answer the critical timing concern addressed by subpart T.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The existing UMTRCA regulations set no time limits for disposal of the piles. Some piles have remained uncovered for
decades emitting radon. Although recent action has been taken to move toward disposal of these piles, some of them
may still remain uncovered for years.

54 FR at 51683. However, due to then-existing CAA section 112(c)(1)(B)(ii), EPA was constrained to requiring compliance
with the 20 pCi/m2-s baseline within two years, a date the Agency recognized many sites might find impossible to meet.
EPA announced that those situations could be dealt with through site-specific enforcement agreements under CAA
section 113. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart T requires compliance by owners and operators of uranium mill tailings disposal sites within two years of
becoming non-operational. 40 CFR 61.22(b). Pursuant to its authority under then-existing CAA section 112(c)(1)(B)(ii)
EPA waived compliance for two years for sites that were non-operational at the time of promulgation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, the earliest date by which sites were required to comply with the subpart T standards was December 15, 1991. Even
so, EPA recognized at the time of promulgation that many sources subject to subpart T might not be able to achieve compliance
by December 15, 1991. Because EPA felt constrained by the CAA as it existed at that time, EPA stated that for those sites
the Agency would negotiate expeditious compliance schedules pursuant to its enforcement authority under CAA section
113. See 54 FR 51683. By so doing, subpart T in effect mandates that the cover to meet that emissions level be installed
as expeditiously as practicable considering technological feasibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The numerical radon emission limit of subpart T, is the same as the UMTRCA standard at 40 CFR part 192, subpart D (subpart
D) (although under UMTRCA, the limit is to be met through proper design of the disposal impoundment, and is to be implemented
by DOE and NRC for the individual sites, while under the CAA, the standard is an emissions limit with compliance established
by EPA through monitoring). However, the two year disposal requirement and the radon monitoring requirement were
not separately required by the existing UMTRCA regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA amended 40 CFR part 192, subpart D on November 15, 1993, 58 FR 60340 to fill a specific regulatory gap with respect
to timing and monitoring that existed in that subpart. Under subpart D, sites are now required to construct a permanent
radon barrier pursuant to a design to achieve compliance with the 20 pCi/m2-s flux standard as expeditiously as practicable
considering technological feasibility (including factors beyond the control of the licensee) with a goal that this
occur by December 31, 1997, for those non-operational uranium mill tailings piles listed in the MOU between EPA, NRC
and the affected Agreement States (at 56 FR 67568), or seven years after the date on which the impoundments cease operation
for all other piles. The new requirement for verifying the flux with monitoring is meant to assure the efficacy of the
design of the permanent radon barrier following construction.

Section 84a(2) of the Atomic Energy Act requires NRC to conform its regulations to EPA's regulations promulgated
under UMTRCA. As noted above, the existing NRC criteria while providing a comprehensive response to EPA's general
UMTRCA standards did not compel sites to proceed to final closure by a date certain nor did they require monitoring.
NRC proposed uranium mill tailings regulations to conform the NRC requirements to EPA's proposed amended standards
at 40 CFR part 192 subpart D. 58 FR 58657 (November 3, 1993). The proposed regulations amend Criterion 6 and add a new
Criterion 6A together with new definitions in the Introduction to appendix A to part 40 of title 10 of the CFR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These CAA and UMTRCA programs duplicate each other by creating dual regulatory oversight, including independent
procedural requirements, while seeking to ensure compliance with the same numerical 20 pCi/m2-s flux standard.
Concern over this duplication inspired several petitions for reconsideration, most notably from NRC, the American
Mining Congress (AMC) and Homestake Mining Co. It was also alleged that subpart T was unlawful because it was physically
impossible for some sites to come into compliance with subpart T in the time required. While these petitions remain
pending before EPA (at least in part), EPA has taken several actions to address the issues they raise, including publishing
the proposal to rescind subpart T, as well as the Final Rule to amend 40 CFR part 192, subpart D (UMTRCA regulations)
and a Final Rule staying subpart T pending the conclusion of this proposed rule.

C. Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After promulgation of subpart T (and receipt of reconsideration petitions), the Clean Air Act was substantially
amended in November 1990. Included in the amended Act was an amendment that speaks directly to the duplication issue.
Newly enacted section 112(d)(9) provides that no standard for radionuclide emissions from any category or subcategory
of facilities licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (or an Agreement State) is required to be promulgated
under section 112 if the Administrator determines, by rule, and after consultation with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
that the regulatory program established by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act for
such category or subcategory provides an ample margin of safety to protect the public health. This provision strives
to eliminate duplication of effort between EPA and NRC, so long as public health is protected with an ample margin of
safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, Congress expressed sensitivity to the special compliance problems of uranium mill tailings sites through
new section 112(i)(3). This provision provides an additional 3-year extension to mining waste operations (e.g.,
uranium mill tailings) if the 4 years allowed (including a one year extension) for compliance with standards promulgated
under the amended section 112 is insufficient to dry and cover the mining waste (thereby controlling emissions).

D. Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) Between EPA, NRC and Affected Agreement States

In July of 1991, EPA, NRC and the affected Agreement States entered into discussions over the dual regulatory programs
established under UMTRCA and the CAA. In October 1991, those discussions resulted in a Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) between EPA, NRC and the Agreement States which outlines the steps each party will take to both eliminate regulatory
redundancy and to ensure uranium mill tailings piles are closed as expeditiously as practicable. See 56 FR 55434 (MOU
reproduced as part of proposal to stay subpart T); see also 56 FR 67537 (final rule to stay subpart T). The primary purpose
of the MOU is to ensure that owners of uranium mill tailings disposal sites that have ceased operation, and owners of
sites that will cease operation in the future, bring those piles into compliance with the 20 pCi/m2-s flux standard
as expeditiously as practicable considering technological feasibility (including factors beyond the control
of the licensee) with the goal that all current disposal sites be closed and in compliance with the radon emission standard
by the end of 1997, or within seven years of the date on which existing operations and standby sites enter disposal status.
This goal comports with Congress's concern over timing as reflected in CAA section 112(i)(3), as amended.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Discussions continued with the litigants and NRC, and in February 1993, an agreement was reached to settle the pending
litigation and the administrative proceeding, avoid potential future litigation, and otherwise agree to a potential
approach to regulations of NRC-licensed non-operational uranium mill tailings disposal sites. See 58 FR 17230 (April
1, 1993) (notice announcing settlement agreement under CAA section 113(g)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The settlement agreement adds comprehensive detail to, and thereby continues, the approach set forth in the MOU.
If implemented, the settlement agreement will result in the expeditious control of radon-222 emissions at non-operational
uranium mill tailings disposal sites without the delays and resource expenditures engendered by litigation and
contentious administrative process. It will enable EPA to fulfill the requirement of section 112(d)(9) that EPA
find, by rule, that the NRC regulatory program protects public health with an ample margin of safety. It does this,
in part, by changing EPA's UMTRCA regulations such that public health will be as well protected under UMTRCA as would
implementation of subpart T under the CAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the agreement, the pending litigation will not be dismissed until after certain terms in the agreement are fulfilled.
Moreover, the agreement does not legally bind or otherwise restrict EPA's rights or obligations under law; rather,
by its terms (paragraph 12), there is no recourse for a court order to implement the agreement. Indeed, the only remedy
for failure to meet the terms of the final agreement is activation by the litigants of the underlying litigation.

II. Rationale for Proposed Rule to Rescind 40 CFR Part 61 Subpart T for NRC and Agreement State Licensees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In light of the new statutory authority provided EPA by section 112(d)(9) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, EPA
met with NRC and the affected Agreement States to determine whether, with certain modifications to its regulatory
program under UMTRCA, the NRC regulatory program might provide an ample margin of safety. If so, subpart T would be
rendered superfluous and, therefore, needlessly duplicative and burdensome such that rescission pursuant to CAA
section 112(d)(9) would be appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In applying the risk methodology for CAA section 112 to the risk assessment for subpart T, EPA has already determined
that the baseline that would result once the 20 pCi/m2-s UMTRCA standard is met protects public health with an ample
margin of safety. Thus, if the regulatory program implemented by NRC assures that sites will achieve the baseline
(20 pCi/m2-s) as soon as practicable considering technological feasibility and factors beyond the control of the
licensee, then the NRC program would protect the public to the same extent as subpart T, and subpart T would not be necessary
for these facilities. More specifically, appropriate modifications to the UMTRCA regulatory scheme as implemented
by NRC and the affected Agreement States to ensure specific, enforceable closure deadlines and monitoring requirements
such that compliance with the baseline will occur as expeditiously as practicable considering technological feasibility
and factors beyond the control of the licensee, would protect public health with an ample margin of safety. In so concluding,
EPA relies wholly upon the risk analysis it conducted in promulgating subpart T. EPA is neither revisiting that analysis
here, nor does the Agency seek comment on that analysis.

, 426 U.S. 1158 (1986). As to uranium mill tailings disposal sites in particular, UMTRCA gives the Department of Energy
(DOE) the responsibility to clean up and dispose of certain (i.e., Title I) sites, and gives NRC the responsibility
for those (i.e., Title II) sites that are owned and operated by its licensees. EPA is responsible for promulgating
the generally applicable environmental standards to be implemented by both NRC and DOE. 42 U.S.C. 2022(a), 7911&hyph;7924;

Parts of EPA's final UMTRCA regulations are directed to the permanent disposal of uranium mill tailings. See 40 CFR
part 192, subpart D (subpart D). Among the requirements of subpart D is the mandate that radon releases from the disposal
sites not exceed a flux of 20 pCi/m2-s. 40 CFR 192.32(a) and (b). Other aspects of subpart D pertain to ground water,
monitoring, design, and duration of closure. See 40 CFR 192.32 and 192.33. With the exception of the ground water provisions
at 40 CFR 192.20(a)(2)-(3), all of subpart D was upheld by the Tenth Circuit in

Because NRC implements EPA's general UMTRCA standards for its licensees (as do its Agreement States), it has promulgated
its own implementing regulations in the form of ``criteria.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See generally 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
10 CFR part 40, appendix A. While these criteria set forth a variety of specific requirements_financial, technical,
and administrative_to govern the final reclamation (i.e., closure) design for each disposal site, they also provide
for ``site-specific'' flexibility by authorizing alternatives that are at least as stringent as EPA's general standards
and NRC's criteria, ``to the extent practicable'' as provided in section 84c of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Overall, NRC's implementation criteria set forth a rigorous program governing the reclamation of the disposal sites
so that closure will (1) last for 1,000 years to the extent reasonable, but in any event at least 200 years, and (2) limit
radon release to 20 pCi/m2-s throughout that period. The design must be able to withstand extreme weather and other
natural forces. Upon review, EPA believes the NRC criteria comprise a comprehensive response to EPA's general standards
at 40 CFR part 192, subpart D. However, as noted above, nothing in either EPA's general standards or NRC's implementing
criteria previously compelled sites to proceed towards final closure by a certain date. This was the reason for EPA's
decision in 1989 to promulgate the subpart T NESHAP under the CAA. Moreover, neither EPA's general UMTRCA regulations,
nor NRC's implementing criteria previously required appropriate monitoring to ensure compliance with the 20 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
pCi/m2-s standard. Nevertheless, as discussed below, the CAA was subsequently amended to allow the EPA not to regulate
NRC licensees if it concludes that the NRC regulatory scheme provides an ample margin of safety to protect the public
health.

B. Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990: Section 112(d)(9) (``Simpson Amendment'') 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this provision is to preserve governmental resources and avoid needless, burdensome, and potentially
contradictory CAA regulations. Specifically, section 112(d)(9) makes explicit that EPA need not regulate radionuclides
under the CAA for radionuclide sources that are sufficiently regulated by NRC or its Agreement States (under the Atomic
Energy Act or its component acts, such as UMTRCA). More particularly, section 112(d)(9) allows EPA to decline to regulate
under section 112 if the Administrator determines ``by rule, and after consultation with the [NRC],'' that NRC's
regulatory program for a particular source ``category or subcategory provides an ample margin of safety to protect
the public health.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As EPA interprets section 112(d)(9), the Agency may rescind the subpart T NESHAP as it applies to non-operational
uranium mill tailings disposal facilities licensed by NRC or an affected Agreement State 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
if 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the Agency (1) consults with NRC, (2) engages in public notice and comment rulemaking, and (3) finds that the separate
NRC regulatory program provides an equivalent level of public health protection (i.e., an ample margin of safety)
as would implementation of subpart T. While this rulemaking may commence prior to final development of NRC's regulatory
program, that program 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
must
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 fully satisfy the statute at the time EPA takes final action. In so doing, EPA must find that the NRC regulatory program
satisfies the CAA standard, not that full and final implementation of that program has already successfully occurred.

C. Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA, NRC and the affected Agreement States entered intensive discussions about these matters. This inter-agency
consultation and review resulted in the execution of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), a copy of which was printed
at the end of the proposed rule to rescind subpart T published December 31, 1991 (56 FR 67568). The primary purpose of
the MOU is to ensure that non-operational uranium mill tailings piles and impoundments licensed by NRC or an affected
Agreement State achieve compliance through emplacement of a permanent radon barrier with the 20 pCi/m2-s flux standard
specified in EPA's UMTRCA standards (40 CFR 192.32(b)(1)) as expeditiously as practicable considering technological
feasibility (including factors beyond the control of the licensee). The goal is that this occur as to all current disposal
sites by the end of 1997, or within seven years of when the existing operating and standby sites enter disposal status.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MOU called for EPA to modify its UMTRCA regulations (at 40 CFR part 192, subpart D) to address the timing concern
that resulted in EPA's 1989 decision to promulgate subpart T. In addition, the MOU called for NRC to modify its implementing
regulations at 10 CFR part 40, appendix A, as appropriate, and to immediately commence efforts to amend the licenses
of the non-operational mill tailings disposal site owners and operators to include reclamation plans that require
compliance with the 20 pCi/m2-s standard as expeditiously as practicable considering technological feasibility
(including factors beyond the control of the licensee). This was to be accomplished either through voluntary cooperation
with the licensees, or through administratively enforceable orders. In accordance with the MOU, the NRC and affected
Agreement States have agreed to amend the licenses of all sites whose milling operations have ceased and whose tailings
piles remain partially or totally uncovered. The amended licenses would require each mill operator to establish
a detailed tailings closure plan for radon to include key closure milestones and a schedule for timely emplacement
of a permanent radon barrier on all non-operational tailings impoundments to ensure that radon emissions do not exceed
a flux of 20 pCi/m2-s. These actions, coupled with NRC's commitment to enforce the amended licenses, are intended
to provide the basis for EPA to make the requisite findings under CAA section 112(d)(9) for rescission of subpart T.

In light of CAA section 112(d)(9), and in order to foster a consensus approach to regulation in this area, EPA then commenced
discussions with NRC, the American Mining Congress (AMC), and the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF). As a result of
discussions after execution of the MOU, a final settlement agreement was executed between EPA, AMC, EDF, NRDC and
individual site owners, to which NRC agreed in principle by letter. The settlement agreement continues the regulatory
approach set forth in the MOU adding extensive detail to that agreement.

On December 31, 1991, EPA took several steps towards fulfilling its responsibilities under the MOU and in implementing
CAA section 112(d)(9) by publishing three 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (FR) notices. In the first notice (56 FR 67537), EPA published a final rule to stay the effectiveness of 40 CFR part 61,
subpart T, as it applies to owners and operators of non-operational uranium mill tailings disposal sites licensed
by the NRC or an Agreement State. The stay will remain in effect until the Agency rescinds the uranium mill tailings
NESHAP at 40 CFR part 61, subpart T. However, if EPA fails to complete that rulemaking by June 30, 1994, the stay will
expire and the requirements of subpart T will become effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a second notice published on December 31, 1991, the Agency proposed to rescind the NESHAP for radionuclides that
appears at 40 CFR part 61, subpart T, as it applies to non-operational uranium mill tailings disposal sites licensed
by the NRC or an Agreement State (56 FR 67561). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the third notice, EPA published an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking to amend 40 CFR part 192, subpart D (56
FR 67569) to provide for site closure to occur as expeditiously as practicable considering technological feasibility
(including factors beyond the control of the licensee), and appropriate monitoring requirements for non-operational
uranium mill tailings piles. These amendments would ensure timely compliance and add monitoring requirements currently
lacking in the UMTRCA regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA published a notice on June 8, 1993, proposing to amend 40 CFR part 192 subpart D. (58 FR 32174). On November 15, 1993,
EPA published the final rule amending 40 CFR part 192, subpart D. (58 FR 60340). This final rule requires: (1) Emplacement
of a permanent radon barrier constructed to achieve compliance with, including attainment of, the 20 pCi/m2-s flux
standard by all NRC or Agreement State licensed sites that, absent rescission, would be subject to subpart T; (2) interim
milestones to assure appropriate progress in emplacing the permanent radon barrier; and (3) that site closure occur
as expeditiously as practicable considering technological feasibility (including factors beyond the control
of the licensee) after the impoundments cease operation. EPA announced a goal that this occur by December 31, 1997,
for those non-operational uranium mill tailings piles listed in the MOU between EPA, NRC and affected Agreement States
(at 56 FR 67568), or seven years after the date on which the impoundments cease operation for all other piles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As intended by EPA, the phrase ``as expeditiously as practicable considering technological feasibility,'' means
as quickly as possible considering: (1) The physical characteristics of the tailings and sites; (2) the limits of
available technology; (3) the need for consistency with mandatory requirements of other regulatory programs; and
(4) factors beyond the control of the licensee. While this phrase does not preclude economic considerations to the
extent provided by the phrase ``available technology,'' it also does not contemplate utilization of a cost-benefit
analysis in setting compliance schedules. The radon control compliance schedules are to be developed consistent
with the targets set forth in the MOU as reasonably applied to the specific circumstances of each site.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA recognized that the UMTRCA regulatory scheme encompasses a design standard. EPA made minor amendments to this
scheme to better facilitate implementation of the regulation without fundamentally altering the current method
of compliance. Subpart D, as amended, requires site control to be carried out in accordance with a written tailings
closure plan (radon), and in a manner which ensures that closure activities are initiated as expeditiously as practicable
considering technological feasibility (including factors beyond the control of licensees). The tailings closure
plan (radon), either as originally written or subsequently amended, will be incorporated into the individual site
licenses, including provisions for and amendments to the milestones for control, after NRC or an affected Agreement
State finds that the schedule reflects compliance as expeditiously as practicable considering technological feasibility
(including factors beyond the control of the licensee). The compliance schedules are to be developed consistent
with the targets set forth in the MOU as reasonably applied to the specific circumstances of each site with a goal that
final closure occur by December 31, 1997, for those non-operational uranium mill tailings piles listed in the MOU
between EPA, NRC and affected Agreement States (at 56 FR 67568), or seven years after the date on which the impoundments
cease operation for all other piles. These schedules must include key closure milestones and other milestones which
are reasonably calculated to promote timely compliance with the

20 pCi/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-s flux standard. Milestones which are not reasonably calculated to advance timely compliance with the radon air
emissions standard, e.g. installation of erosion protection and groundwater corrective actions, are not relevant
to the tailings closure plans (radon). In addition, subpart D requires that licensees ensure that radon closure milestone
activities, such as wind blown tailings retrieval and placement on the pile, interim stabilization (including dewatering
or the removal of freestanding liquids and recontouring), and radon barrier construction, are undertaken to achieve
compliance with, including attainment of, the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-s flux standard as expeditiously as practicable considering technological feasibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The goal of the amendments to subpart D is for existing sites, or those that become non-operational in the future, to
achieve compliance as expeditiously as practicable considering technological feasibility (including factors
beyond the control of licensees) within the time periods set forth in the MOU, including Attachment A thereto, and
for new sites to achieve compliance no later than seven years after becoming non-operational. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, if the NRC or an Agreement State makes a finding that compliance with the 20 pCi/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-s flux standard has been demonstrated through appropriate monitoring, after providing an opportunity for public
participation, then the performance of the milestone(s) may be extended. If an extension is granted, then during
the period of the extension, compliance with the 20 pCi/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-s flux standard must be demonstrated each year. Additionally, licensees may request, based upon cost, that the final
compliance date for emplacement of the permanent radon barrier, or relevant milestone set forth in the applicable
license or incorporated in the (radon) tailings closure plan, be extended. The NRC or an affected Agreement State
may approve such a request if it finds, after providing the opportunity for public participation, that: (1) The licensee
is making good faith efforts to emplace a permanent radon barrier constructed to achieve the 20 pCi/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-s flux standard; (2) such delay is consistent with the definition of ``available technology;'' and (3) such delay
will not result in radon emissions that are determined to result in significant incremental risk to the public health.
Such a finding should be accompanied by new deadlines which reasonably correspond to the target dates identified
in Attachment A of the MOU. (56 FR 67569). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA expects the NRC and Agreement States to act consistently with their commitment in the MOU and provide for public
notice and comment on proposals or requests to (1) incorporate radon tailings closure plans or other schedules for
effecting emplacement of a permanent radon barrier into licenses, and (2) amend the radon tailings closure schedules
as necessary or appropriate for reasons of technological feasibility (including factors beyond the control of the
licensees). Under the terms of the MOU, NRC should do so with notice timely published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In addition, consistent with the MOU, members of the public may request NRC for action on these matters pursuant to
10 CFR 2.206. EPA also expects the Agreement States to provide comparable opportunities for public participation
pursuant to their existing authorities and procedures.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The UMTRCA regulations, as promulgated by EPA and implemented by NRC prior to the 1993 amendments, while ultimately
limiting emissions to the same numerical level as subpart T, were supported by a variety of design-based substantive
and procedural requirements that speak to UMTRCA's unique concern that final site closure occur in a manner that will
last 1,000 years or at least 200 years, but did not require monitoring of emissions to confirm the performance of the
earthen cover. See generally 10 CFR part 40, appendix A and 40 CFR part 192. Subpart D, as amended, requires all appropriate
monitoring be conducted pursuant to the procedures described in 40 CFR part 61, appendix B, Method 115, or any other
measurement method proposed by a licensee and approved by NRC or the affected Agreement State as being at least as effective
as EPA Method 115 in demonstrating the effectiveness of the permanent radon barrier in achieving compliance with
the 20 pCi/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

This monitoring will verify that the design of the permanent radon barrier is effective in ensuring that emissions

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

event may suffice to verify the design of the permanent radon barrier to ensure continued compliance. Note, however,
that if the NRC or an Agreement State extends the time for performance of milestones after making a finding that compliance
with the 20 pCi/m

2. NRC Regulatory Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 3, 1993, NRC proposed uranium mill tailings regulations to conform the NRC requirements to EPA's proposed
amended standards at 40 CFR part 192 subpart D. (58 FR 58657). Section 84a(2) of the Atomic Energy Act requires NRC to
conform its regulations to EPA's regulations promulgated under UMTRCA. As noted above, the existing NRC criteria
while providing a comprehensive response to EPA's general UMTRCA standards did not compel sites to proceed to final
closure by a date certain nor did they require monitoring. The proposed regulations amend Criterion 6 and add a new
Criterion 6A and definitions to the Introduction to appendix A to part 40 of title 10 of the CFR. Consistent with the
MOU, NRC's proposal provides for timely emplacement of the ``final'' radon barrier and requires appropriate verification
of the radon flux through that barrier. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed Criterion 6 paragraph 2 provides for appropriate testing and analysis to verify that the construction of
the barrier effectively controls radon from uranium byproduct material to a level not exceeding 20 pCi/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-s. Paragraph 3 requires verification of the radon flux to be conducted over the covered portion of the pile or impoundment
if phased emplacement of the barrier is authorized. Paragraph 4 would require reporting and recordkeeping. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As proposed, Criterion 6A addresses the timeliness of complying with the requirements of Criterion 6 as applied to
uranium mill tailings. Paragraph 1 would require compliance with Criterion 6 as expeditiously as practicable considering
technological feasibility after a pile or impoundment containing uranium byproduct materials ceases operation.
In addition, this paragraph would require inclusion of specified interim milestones in the individual site license.
Proposed Criterion 6A also sets forth the conditions for Commission approval of extensions for performance of milestones
and continued acceptance of uranium byproduct and other materials in the pile or impoundment. See Proposed 10 CFR
part 40 appendix A Criterion 6A paragraphs 2 and 3 at 58 FR 58664.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Amendment of NRC and Agreement State Licenses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with their commitments under the MOU, as well as EPA's previous proposal to rescind subpart T (56 FR 67561
December 31, 1991), NRC and the affected Agreement States agreed to amend the licenses of all non-operational uranium
mill tailings sites to ensure inclusion of schedules for emplacing a permanent radon barrier on the tailings impoundments,
as well as interim milestones (e.g., wind blown tailings retrieval and placement on the pile, interim stabilization
and radon barrier construction). To this end, NRC and the Agreement States requested the licensees to voluntarily
seek amended licenses and have completed processing those requests. NRC has continued the spirit of cooperation
between EPA and NRC by keeping the Agency apprised of the status of the approval of reclamation plans and amendment
of licenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As of September 30, 1993, NRC and the Agreement States had completed all license amendments for closure of licensed
non-operational impoundments, with the exception of the license amendment for the Atlas site located in Moab, Utah.

NRC informed EPA by letter that the Commission received extensive comments on NRC's July 20, 1993 proposal to approve
the Atlas reclamation plan, including the closure schedule and interim milestones required by the MOU, and the Environmental
Assessment and the Finding of No Significant Impact for the Atlas mill. NRC rescinded its Finding of No Significant
Impact for the Atlas mill in October 1993. 58 FR 52516 (October 8, 1993). One issue appears to be the potential for flooding
of the Atlas impoundment if it is reclaimed on-site, due to the proximity of the site to the Colorado River. This concern
and others appear to have caused delays in the license amendment for this site. NRC informed EPA it intends to reassess
the reclamation plan for that site and prepare a report. Based on the results of that reassessment, the NRC will determine
what the next steps should be. In its reassessment of the reclamation plan, NRC will obtain input from Federal, State,
and local representatives. NRC is actively pursuing a timely final decision on the Atlas site location and its reclamation
plan. To this end, NRC informed EPA by letter dated December 28, 1993, that NRC has conducted several meetings with
the various representatives enumerated above and has requested additional technical information from the licensee.

The near edge of town is located about 2 km to the east of the Atlas tailings impoundment. However, it appears the area
within a 1.5 km radius of the Atlas mill tailings impoundment site is sparsely populated. An interim cover is being
placed over the impoundment for radon emission control as the Atlas tailings impoundment dries sufficiently to allow
access of the necessary equipment. As discussed in the Background Information Document (BID) for the amendments
to 40 CFR 192 subpart D, interim covers significantly reduce radon emissions. Technical Support for Amending Standards
for Management of Uranium Byproduct Materials: 40 CFR Part 192 Background Information Document, EPA 402&hyph;R&hyph;93&hyph;085,
October 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the 1996 MOU target date for emplacement of the permanent radon barrier is extended by NRC, EPA will review such an
extension at that time. Under the present circumstances, it appears an extension of the MOU target date would be consistent
with the factors to be considered under the ``as expeditiously as practicable'' standard at 40 CFR section 192.32(a)(3)(i),
since there may be a need for consistency with mandatory requirements of other regulatory programs (i.e., NEPA) and
there may be factors beyond the control of the licensee. 40 CFR section 192.31(k). Based on representations from NRC,
EPA believes that the extra time NRC is taking to further review the proposed Atlas mill site reclamation plan is necessary
to address the large amount of public comments received and that it will result in a final solution that is more responsive
to public comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC and the affected Agreement States have also agreed to enforce the provisions of the amended licenses to ensure
compliance with the new schedules for emplacing the permanent radon barriers, including interim milestones, and
to ensure (and verify) the efficacy of the design and construction of the barrier to achieve compliance with the 20
pCi/m2-s flux standard contained in the amendments to subpart D.

III. Proposed Rule To Rescind 40 CFR Part 61, Subpart T for NRC and Agreement State Licensees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to rescind subpart T as it applies to non-operational uranium mill tailings disposal sites licensed
by NRC or an affected Agreement State. The Agency sets forth this proposal pursuant to its authority under CAA section
112(d)(9), as amended in 1990. The support for this proposal includes (1) The MOU, which reflects consultation with
NRC and the affected Agreement States and sets forth a course of conduct that will bolster NRC's regulatory program
under UMTRCA so that it is protective of public health with an ample margin of safety, (2) the settlement agreement
which adds comprehensive detail to the MOU, (3) EPA's amendments to 40 CFR part 192 subpart D, (4) the relevant license
amendments, to date, and (5) expected amendments by NRC to its implementation regulations at Appendix A, 10 CFR part
40.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 112(d)(9) authorizes EPA to decline to regulate radionuclide emissions from NRC-licensees under the CAA
provided that EPA determines, by rule, and after consultation with NRC, that the regulatory scheme established by
NRC protects the public health with an ample margin of safety. The legislative history of section 112(d)(9) provides
additional guidance as to what is meant by ``an ample margin of safety to protect the public health'' and what process
the Administrator should follow in making that determination in a rulemaking proceeding under section 112(d)(9).
The Conference Report points out that the ``ample margin of safety'' finding under section 112(d)(9) is the same ``ample
margin of safety'' requirement that was contained in section 112 of the CAA prior to its amendment in 1990. The conferees
also made clear that the process the Administrator was expected to follow in making any such determination under section
112(d)(9) was that ``required under the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals in

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has already made a determination in promulgating subpart T that compliance with the 20 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
pCi/m2-s standard protects public health with an ample margin of safety. EPA con
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
ducted a risk analysis in promulgating subpart T in 1989. At that time, EPA determined that the 20 pCi/m2-s flux standard
was a ``baseline'' that was provided by EPA's general UMTRCA standards at 40 CFR part 192 subpart D. EPA further determined
that compliance with that baseline would be protective of public health with an ample margin of safety. EPA promulgated
subpart T to ensure achievement of the flux standard at non-operational sites in a timely manner. In conducting this
rescission rulemaking, EPA is not revisiting the risk analysis nor decision methodology that supported the promulgation
of subpart T; rather, EPA is only visiting whether NRC's regulatory program under UMTRCA will meet the 20 pCi/m2-s
flux standard established in subpart T as being a safe level in a timely manner thereby rendering subpart T unnecessarily
duplicative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's proposed determination that the NRC regulatory program protects public health with an ample margin of safety
includes a finding that NRC and the affected Agreement States are implementing and enforcing, in significant part
on a programmatic and site-specific basis: (1) The regulations governing the disposal of uranium mill tailings promulgated
by EPA and NRC consistent with the settlement agreement described above; and (2) the operating license (i.e., tailings
closure plan) requirements that establish milestones for the purpose of emplacing a permanent radon barrier that
will achieve compliance with the 20 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
pCi/m2-s flux standard. In addition, in determining whether EPA's and NRC's regulatory changes have been effectively
promulgated, EPA will assess whether any judicial challenge to these regulations is pending and, if so, whether such
challenge presents a significant risk of interference with the purposes and objectives of the MOU, as reflected in
the regulatory changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. EPA's UMTRCA Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above, EPA has modified its UMTRCA regulations (40 CFR part 192 subpart D) to require compliance with
the 20 pCi/m2-s flux standard as expeditiously as practicable considering technological feasibility (and factors
beyond the control of the licensee), and to require appropriate monitoring to verify the efficacy of the design of
the permanent radon barrier. By definition, no more rapid compliance can, as a practical matter occur, because this
schedule represents the earliest that the sites could be closed. EPA expects that these compliance schedules will
be developed consistent with the targets set forth in the MOU as reasonably applied to the specific circumstances
of each site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When EPA promulgated subpart T it recognized that many sources might not be able to comply with the two year compliance
date then required pursuant to section 112. Based on this, subpart T includes a provision that in such a case EPA would
``establish a compliance agreement which will assure that disposal will be completed as quickly as possible.'' 40
CFR 61.222(b). The time period required for closure under subpart D embodies the same approach. In practice, therefore,
both subpart T and subpart D establish the same basic timeframes for achievement of the flux standard. Assuming NRC
and the Agreement States faithfully implement subpart D and the license amendments required under subpart D, EPA
would not expect there to be any significant difference between these two programs in the amount of time required for
sites to comply with the flux standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, subpart D as amended, provides that NRC may grant an extension of time to comply with either of the
following deadlines: (1) Performance of milestones based upon a finding that compliance with the 20 pCi/m2-s flux
standard has been met, or (2) final compliance beyond the date or relevant milestone based upon cost. EPA considers
these two bases upon which NRC may grant an extension to be mutually exclusive, i.e., a request for a specific extension
may be based on one or the other but not both grounds. If a milestone is being extended for a basis other than cost, such
an extension may be granted if NRC finds that compliance with the 20 pCi/m2-s flux standard has been demonstrated using
EPA Method 115 or an NRC approved alternative. In addition the site must continue to demonstrate compliance with this
flux standard on an annual basis. However, if a licensee requests extension of the final compliance date (or relevant
milestone) based upon cost, such an extension may only be granted if NRC finds that the three criteria specified in
40 CFR section 192.32(a)(3)(iii) are met. Any extensions of the final compliance date based upon cost will be granted
on a site-specific basis.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a licensee requests an extension of the final compliance date based upon cost, technology may not be used as a basis
for granting the extension unless the costs are grossly excessive, as measured by normal practice within the industry.
EPA recognizes that the emissions from the pile may exceed the 20 pCi/m2-s flux standard pending final compliance,
but believes these increases will be minimal and of limited duration. Further, a lifetime individual risk of approximately
1 in 10,000 is considered safe under the benzene policy based on 70 years of exposure. 54 FR 38044 (September 14, 1989).
EPA does not anticipate the short extensions in the time to complete the radon barrier contemplated in subpart D and
the proposed NRC conforming amendments to increase the maximum lifetime individual risk beyond 1 in 10,000, the level
which EPA found to protect the public health with an ample margin of safety in promulgating subpart T. 54 FR 51656 (December
15, 1989). EPA believes this is consistent with the reality of short-term risks from radon emissions during the period
of delay, and consistent with the risks associated with negotiated compliance agreements when non-operational
sites fail to close within the two year period required by subpart T. EPA believes these emissions should not exceed
those emissions which could occur under subpart T if compliance agreements had been negotiated. Extensions based
upon cost will only be granted if NRC or an Agreement State finds, after providing an opportunity for public participation,
that the emissions caused by the delay will not cause significant incremental risk to the public health. Additionally,
a site requesting an extension based upon cost must demonstrate that it is making a good faith effort to emplace the
permanent radon barrier. In many situations, where an interim cover is in place, radon emissions are significantly
reduced and tailings which are wet or ponded emit no significant levels of radon. EPA would also evaluate extensions
under the proposed section 61.226(c) provisions to determine whether the Agency should reconsider the rescission
and seek reinstatement of subpart T, on either a programmatic or site-specific basis. Thus, under the circumstances,
EPA believes affording authority for extensions of the final compliance date based upon cost is not inconsistent
with protecting the public health and today's proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, NRC or an Agreement State may extend the date for emplacement of the radon barrier based on ``factors
beyond the control of the licensee,'' as that term is implicit in the definition of ``as expeditiously as practicable.''
EPA understands that under subpart D's provisions there is no bar to NRC or an Agreement State reconsidering a prior
decision establishing a date for emplacement of the radon barrier that meets the standard of ``as expeditiously as
possible.'' Such reconsideration could, for example, be based on the existence of factors beyond the control of the
licensee, or on a change in any of the various factors that must be considered in establishing a date that meets the ``as
expeditious as practicable'' standard of &sect;192.32(a)(3)(i). However EPA stresses that such a change in circumstances
would not automatically lead to an extension. It would be incumbent on NRC or an Agreement State to evaluate all the
factors relevant under &sect;192.32(a)(3)(i) before it could change a previously established milestone or date
for emplacement of the final barrier, and any new date would have to meet the standard set out in &sect;192.32(a)(3)(i).
Finally, NRC's and Agreement States' authority to reconsider previously established milestones or dates would
include authority to shorten or speed up such dates, as well as extend them. EPA also expects that public participation
consistent with that level of participation provided in the MOU and the settlement agreement will be afforded the
public by NRC and the Agreement States in amending the licenses due to ``factors beyond the control of the licensee,''
or for any other basis.

3. NRC's Proposed Conforming Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed previously, NRC has proposed regulations to conform appendix A of 10 CFR part 40 to EPA's general standards
promulgated under UMTRCA; the proposed rule is currently in the public comment stage 58 FR 58657 (November 3, 1993).
Because the public process may alter the final rule, especially since an alternative for

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Criterion 6A 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
paragraph 2 was proposed, EPA believes that the adequacy of the NRC conforming regulations can only be determined
after the NRC conforming regulations are finalized. In making this determination, EPA's decision will be based upon
the Commission's final rule which must implement 40 CFR part 192, subpart D. EPA will determine whether NRC's regulations
support rescission in its final rule to rescind subpart T. EPA is inviting comments as to whether NRC's proposed conforming
regulations support EPA's proposal(s) to rescind subpart T by either adequately and appropriately implementing
EPA's amendments to 40 CFR part 192, subpart D, or may reasonably be expected to do so prior to rescission of subpart
T.

4. License Amendments to Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Table 1 illustrates that all NRC and affected Agreement State licenses, except one, have been modified pursuant to
the MOU. Attachment A to the MOU, developed in conjunction with each site and considering the particular circumstances
of that site, lists target dates for emplacement of the permanent radon barrier with ``a guiding objective that this
occur to all current disposal sites by the end of 1997, and within seven years of when the existing operating and standby
sites cease operation.'' 56 FR 67568 (December 31, 1991). The MOU requires NRC and the Agreement States to ``ensure
.&blank;.&blank;. that cover emplacement on the tailings impoundments occurs as expeditiously as practicable
considering both short-term reductions in radon releases and long-term stability of the uranium mill tailings.''
Id. The compliance schedules are to be developed consistent with the MOU targets as reasonably applied to the specific
circumstances of each site with a goal that final closure occur by December 31, 1997, for those non-operational uranium
mill tailings piles listed in the MOU.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA believes the NRC and the Agreement States are acting in good faith to implement their commitments under the MOU
by amending the site licenses. The license amendments by NRC and the affected Agreement States appear to reflect closure
as expeditiously as practicable, thus supporting rescission of subpart T and a determination that the NRC program
protects public health with an ample margin of safety. In addition, consistent with their commitments under the MOU,
NRC and the affected Agreement States are providing opportunities for public participation in the license amendment
process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The license amendments noted in Table 1 reflect consistent application of the dates contained in the MOU. Three exceptions
are worth noting. First, although the license amendment for the Atlas site is not complete, EPA is confident that NRC
is actively pursuing final resolution of the pending reclamation plan. Pending final approval of a reclamation plan,
the Atlas site is continuing to emplace an interim cover on the pile to control radon emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the license amendments for the ANC Gas Hills site address two separate impoundments. Consistent with the
MOU, the license amendment for the non-operational impoundment contains a December 31, 1994, date for emplacement
of the permanent radon barrier. Additionally, an impoundment previously designated as operational for in-situ
waste disposal is now non-operational. Emplacement of the permanent radon barrier on this second impoundment is
scheduled to be completed by June 30, 1996, well within the seven year goal of the MOU for impoundments which cease operations
after December 31, 1991.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Lastly, the license amendment dates for two additional sites, the Ford-Dawn Mining site and the WNI site both located
in the Agreement State of Washington, are also beyond the dates contained in the MOU. However, Washington State notes
that for these sites the closure date was changed because of the groundwater remediation schedule, and the difficulty
experienced in drying the piles due to the evaporation and precipitation rates. In sum, EPA believes that the license
amendments adopted by NRC and the Agreement States to date reflect a good faith attempt to implement the MOU and require
closure of the sites as expeditiously as practical considering technological feasibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While NRC and the Agreement States have obtained license amendments for all but one of the relevant sites, they have
not as of yet established a record for enforcement of these milestones, including action on requests for extensions.
Based on NRC representations, no milestones occurring after the date of the MOU, October 1991, have been missed and
as included in footnote 2 of Table 1, an application for an extension is pending but no action has been taken. However,
given their response to the requirements of the MOU, and the rulemaking being conducted by NRC to implement the requirements
of subpart D, EPA believes it may well be able to conclude that the milestones established in the licenses for emplacement
of the permanent radon barrier (i.e., the tailings closure plan (radon)) will be implemented and enforced in significant
part on a programmatic and site-specific basis. The relevant portions of the amended licenses have been placed in
the docket for this action, as well as letters from NRC to EPA apprising the Agency of the status of the license amendments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA and NRC have completed many actions required by the MOU, including: revising the NRC and affected Agreement State
licenses to reflect the MOU requirements, promulgating amendments to EPA's UMTRCA regulations at 40 CFR part 192,
subpart D, and proposing to conform the NRC regulations at 40 CFR part 10 to EPA's revised UMTRCA regulations. Based
on EPA's review, to date, of the regulatory program established by NRC under UMTRCA (as contained at 10 CFR part 40,
appendix A), EPA has determined that, once the timing and monitoring concerns are fully and finally addressed consistent
with EPA's UMTRCA standards, as well as consistent with and including the other actions (e.g., license amendments)
contemplated by the MOU, the NRC criteria will result in reclamation designs and schedules fully adequate to ensure
compliance with the 20 pCi/m2-s flux standard as expeditiously as practicable considering technological feasibility
(including factors beyond the control of the licensee). Additionally, EPA expects that when the NRC regulations
are finally amended, the Agency should be able to find that NRC and the affected Agreement States are or will be implementing
and enforcing, in significant part, the regulations governing disposal of tailings and the operating license requirements
(tailings closure plan (radon)) that establish milestones for emplacement of a permanent radon barrier that will
achieve compliance with the 20 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
pCi/m2-s flux standard on a programmatic and a site-specific basis. The Agency intends ``in significant part'' to
mean that NRC or an affected Agreement State is implementing and enforcing the regulatory and operating license requirements
in a manner that EPA reasonably expected to not materially (i.e., more than de minimis)
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 interfere with compliance with the 20 pCi/m2-s standard as expeditiously as practicable considering technological
feasibility (including factors beyond the control of the licensee). As part of its determination, EPA requests comments
on whether any judicial challenge to EPA's and NRC's regulations are to be expected and whether such challenge presents
a significant risk of interference with the purposes and objectives of the MOU, as reflected in the regulatory changes
as part of its determination of whether EPA's and NRC's regulatory changes have been effectively promulgated.

B. Reconsideration Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Atomic Energy Act, NRC has the authority to waive, for reasons of practicability, the dual requirement of
the MOU that compliance with the 20 pCi/m2-s flux standard occur as expeditiously as practicable considering technological
feasibility. 42 U.S.C. 2114(c). NRC considers the term ``practicability'' to include certain economic considerations
not contemplated by the requirement of the MOU that compliance occur as expeditiously as practicable considering
technological feasibility. In promulgating subpart T, the CAA did not permit, and EPA did not consider, site-specific
waivers from ultimate compliance with that standard. Thus, as a theoretical matter, EPA recognized in its December
1991 proposal that this waiver authority might be exercised in a manner not addressed in the MOU even after the UMTRCA
regulations have been promulgated and each license amended, although EPA has no reason to believe such relaxation
of restriction will actually occur. Nevertheless, EPA recognized that this authority would not exist under the CAA
and subpart T and, thus, there is some concern over the potential for deviation from the agreements contained in the
MOU.

1. December 31, 1991 Proposed Rule To Rescind subpart T
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the concern over the waiver authority in the Atomic Energy Act, and in order to ensure its exercise does
not alter EPA's finding that the NRC regulatory program protects public health with an ample margin of safety, EPA
announced in its December 31, 1991, proposal that certain conditions and grounds for reconsideration would be included
in any final decision to rescind subpart T. In this way, EPA might base its rescission finding upon its view of the NRC
regulatory program contemplated by the MOU at the time of taking final action, while also providing some assurance
that EPA would revisit that finding should NRC or the affected Agreement States substantially deviate from that program.
Thus, in December 1991, EPA proposed certain conditions and grounds for reconsideration, to provide assurance that
any finding by the Agency that the NRC program is sufficient to justify rescission of subpart T under CAA section 112(d)(9)
would be revisited if the NRC program is actually implemented in a manner inconsistent with that finding. The specific
reconsideration options proposed by EPA were published at 56 FR 67565 (December 31, 1991).

EPA has reviewed the various options for reconsideration proposed in December 1991 in light of the comprehensive
details added to the terms of the MOU by the settlement agreement finalized in April 1993. EPA is now proposing an additional
reconsideration option that is a combination of the options proposed in December 1991. It is in effect a hybrid of that
December 1991 proposal. While EPA is not withdrawing its prior reconsideration proposal and the reconsideration
options contained therein, the additional reconsideration option proposed today is currently preferred by EPA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes the following reconsideration provisions, which include both programmatic and site-specific bases
for reinstatement, represent a comprehensive approach under both the MOU and settlement agreement. EPA requests
comment on these proposed reconsideration provisions. The Agency notes that the 20 pCi/m2&hyph;s flux standard
must be met by all sites as provided by 40 CFR part 192, subpart D. EPA does not intend to reconsider the decision to rescind
subpart T for any site that is in fact meeting the 20 pCi/m2-s flux standard, absent other factors that would indicate
the need for reinstatement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's proposal establishes an obligation for the Administrator to reinstate subpart T as applied to owners and
operators of non-operational uranium mill tailings disposal sites licensed by NRC or an affected Agreement State
provided certain conditions are met. Additionally, today's proposal sets forth the procedures for EPA to act on a
petition to reconsider rescission of subpart T which seeks such reinstatement. However, the proposed provisions
are not intended to be exclusive. EPA reserves the right to initiate reinstatement of subpart T if appropriate. Pursuant
to section 553(e) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553(e) interested persons may petition the EPA to
initiate reinstatement of subpart T, in addition to petitions for reinstatement under the procedures proposed today.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed reconsideration provisions establish procedures for persons to petition EPA for reconsideration
of the rescission and seek reinstatement of subpart T and EPA's response to such petitions. Provisions for the substantive
conditions for reconsideration of the rescission of this subpart and subsequent reinstatement for NRC-licensees
are also included. Under the provisions proposed today, a person may petition the Administrator for reconsideration
of the rescission and seek reinstatement of subpart T under &sect;61.226(a) which provides for programmatic and
site-specific reinstatement. If reconsideration is initiated it must be conducted pursuant to notice and comment
rulemaking. It is important that any alleged failures by NRC or an affected Agreement State to implement and enforce
the regulations governing uranium mill tailings or the applicable license requirements be addressed in a timely
manner. These provisions are intended to ensure that persons may seek recourse from the Administrator if they are
adversely affected by the failure of NRC or an affected Agreement State to implement and enforce, in significant part,
on a programmatic and a site-specific basis the regulations governing the disposal of uranium mill tailings promulgated
by EPA and NRC, requirements of the tailings closure plan or operating license requirements establishing milestones
for the purpose of emplacing a permanent radon barrier that will achieve compliance with the 20 pCi/m2&hyph;s flux
standard. Thus, EPA is proposing to establish a non-discretionary duty to take final action granting or denying an
authorized petition for reconsideration of the rescission of subpart T within 300 days of receipt of the petition.
If EPA grants such petition it would then proceed to initiate rulemaking to reinstate subpart T. This rulemaking,
however, is not subject to the 300 day time period. This schedule is intended to provide EPA and NRC adequate time to
resolve any potential problems identified by a petition. Failure to meet this deadline may be subject to an action
in District Court under CAA section 304 to order that EPA take final action on the petition. Review of that final response
would be in the Circuit Court of Appeals under CAA section 307(b). If EPA grants such a petition and initiates rulemaking
to reinstate subpart T, then final agency action would not occur until EPA had concluded such rulemaking. Consistent
with the settlement agreement, EPA may propose to grant or deny the petition within 120 days of receipt, allow a comment
period of at least 60 days, and take final action granting or denying the petition within 120 days of the close of the
comment period.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed procedures, EPA shall summarily dismiss without prejudice a &sect;61.226(a) petition to reconsider
the rescission and seek reinstatement of subpart T on a programmatic basis, unless the petitioner demonstrates that
it provided written notice of the alleged failure to NRC or an affected Agreement State at least 60 days before filing
its petition with EPA. This notice to NRC must include a statement of the grounds for such a petition. This notice requirement
may be satisfied, among other ways, by submissions or pleadings submitted to NRC during a proceeding conducted by
NRC. The purpose of this advance notice requirement is to provide NRC or an affected Agreement State with an opportunity
to address the concerns raised by the potential petitioner. Additionally, EPA shall summarily dismiss without prejudice
a section 61.226(a) petition to reconsider the rescission and seek reinstatement of subpart T on a site-specific
basis, unless the petitioner demonstrates that it provided, at least 60 days before filing its petition with EPA,
a written request to NRC or an affected Agreement State for enforcement or other relief, and unless the petitioner
alleges that NRC or the affected Agreement State failed to respond to such request by taking action, as necessary,
to assure timely implementation and enforcement of the 20 pC1/m

the concerns raised by the potential petitioner through its standard enforcement mechanisms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administrator may also initiate reconsideration of the rescission and reinstatement of subpart T as applied
to owners and operators of non-operational uranium mill tailings disposal sites if EPA believes it is appropriate
to do so. For example, EPA may initiate such reconsideration if it has reason to believe that NRC or an affected Agreement
State has failed to implement and enforce, in significant part, the regulations governing the disposal of uranium
mill tailings promulgated by EPA and NRC or the tailings closure plan (radon) requirements establishing milestones
for the purpose of emplacing a permanent radon barrier that will achieve compliance with the 20 pCi/m

&hyph;s flux standard. Before the Administrator initiates reconsideration of the rescission and reinstatement
of subpart T, EPA shall consult with NRC prior to initiating a rulemaking to address EPA's concerns. If the consultation
does not resolve the concerns, EPA shall provide NRC with 60 days notice of the Agency's intent to initiate rulemaking
to reinstate this subpart.

Upon completion of a reconsideration rulemaking, EPA may: (1) Reinstate subpart T on a programmatic basis if EPA determines,
based on the record, that NRC has significantly failed to implement and enforce, in significant part, on a programmatic
basis, (a) the regulations governing the disposal of uranium mill tailings promulgated by EPA and NRC or (b) the operating
license requirements establishing milestones for the purpose of emplacing a permanent radon barrier that will achieve
compliance with the 20 pCi/m2-s 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
flux standard; (2) reinstatement subpart T on a site-specific basis if EPA determines, based on the record, the NRC
or an affected Agreement State has significantly failed to implement and enforce, in significant part, on a site-specific
basis, (a) the regulation governing the disposal of uranium mill tailings promulgated by EPA and NRC or (b) the operating
license requirements establishing milestones for the purpose of replacing a permanent radon barrier will not achieve
compliance with the 20 pCi/m2-s flux standard; or (3) issue a finding that NRC is implementing and enforcing on either
a site-specific or programmatic basis the regulations operating license requirements described above and that
reimbursement of subpart T is not appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations establish an obligation for the Administrator to reinstate subpart T as applied to owners
and operators of non-operational uranium mill tailings disposal sites if the Administrator determines by rulemaking,
based on the record, that NRC or an affected Agreement State has failed on a programmatic basis to implement and enforce,
in significant part, the regulations governing the disposal of uranium mill tailings promulgated by EPA and NRC or
the tailings closure plan (radon) requirements establishing milestones for the purpose of emplacing a permanent
radon barrier that will achieve compliance with the 20 pCi/m2-s flux standard. The Administrator also shall reinstate
subpart T on a site-specific basis as applied to owner and operators of non-operational uranium mill tailings disposal
sites if the Administrator determines by rulemaking, based on the record, that NRC or an affected Agreement State
has failed on a site-specific basis to achieve compliance by the operator of the site or sites with applicable license
requirements, regulations, or standards implemented by NRC and the affected Agreement States. Under today's proposal,
EPA shall reinstate subpart T only for the failures enumerated in the preceding sentence that may reasonably be anticipated
to significantly interfere (i.e., more than de minimis) with the timely emplacement of a permanent radon barrier
constructed to achieve compliance with the 20 pCi/m2-s flux standard at uranium mill tailings disposal sites. EPA
intends ``in significant part'' to mean that in rescinding subpart T, EPA must find that NRC or an affected Agreement
State is implementing and enforcing, on a programmatic and a site-specific basis: (1) The regulations governing
the disposal of uranium mill tailings promulgated by EPA and NRC consistent with the MOU and settlement agreement
and (2) the tailings closure plan (radon) requirements establishing milestones for the purpose of emplacing a permanent
radon barrier that will achieve compliance with the 20 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
pCi/m2-s flux standard in a manner that is not reasonably expected to materially (i.e., more than de minimis) interfere
with compliance with the 20 pCi/m2-s flux standard as expeditiously as practicable considering technological feasibility
(including factors beyond the control of the licensee). Reinstatement would require an EPA finding that NRC or an
affected Agreement State has failed to implement and enforce in this manner.

to 40 CFR part 192, subpart D; (2) NRC's regulations at 10 CFR part 40, appendix A either already adequately and appropriately
implement the revisions to EPA's regulations, or may reasonably be expected to do so prior to rescission of subpart
T; (3) the revision of NRC and affected Agreement State licenses reflect the new requirements of subpart D; and (4)
any judicial or administrative challenge to EPA or NRC regulations is expected to present a significant risk of interference
with full compliance with the MOU and the settlement agreement. Additionally, EPA requests comments on the proposed
reconsideration provisions described above and included in a new section 61.226 added to subpart T. In particular
EPA requests comments as to whether these provisions effectively implement the regulatory approach of the MOU and
settlement agreement, especially the terms providing specific time periods for a reconsideration rulemaking.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 57735, October 4, 1993) the Agency must determine whether this regulation, if
promulgated, is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order.
The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal
governments or communities;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action is not a significant regulatory action as that term is defined in Executive Order 12866, since it will not
result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or another adverse economic impact; it does not create a serious
inconsistency or interfere with another agency's action; it does not materially alter the budgetary impacts of entitlements,
grants, user fees, etc.; and it does not raise novel legal or policy issues. Thus, EPA has determined that rescinding
subpart T as it applies to owners and operators of uranium mill tailings disposal sites that are licensed by the NRC
or an affected Agreement State is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order 12866
and is therefore not subject to OMB review.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 603 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 603, requires EPA to prepare and make available for comment
an ``initial regulatory flexibility analysis'' which describes the effect of the proposed rule on small business
entities. However, section 604(b) of the Act provides that an analysis not be required when the head of an Agency certifies
that the rule will not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Most firms that own uranium mill tailings piles are divisions or subsidiaries of major U.S. and international corporations.
Many are parts of larger diversified mining firms which are engaged in a number of raw materials industries; the disposal
of uranium mill tailings piles represents only a small portion of their overall operations. Others are owned by major
oil companies and electric utilities which were engaged in horizontal and vertical integration, respectively,
during the industry's growth phase in the 1960s and 1970s.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It was found in 1989 rulemaking that there was no significant impact on small business entities. There has been no change
in this, and no new tailings piles have been constructed since 1989. I certify that this proposed rule to rescind 40
CFR part 61, subpart T as applied to owners and operators of NRC licensed non-operational uranium mill tailings disposal
sites, if promulgated as a final rule, will not have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

(a) Reinstatement of this subpart.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Administrator shall reinstate 40 CFR part 61, subpart T as applied to owners and operators of non-operational
uranium mill tailings disposal sites that are licensed by the NRC or an affected Agreement State if the Administrator
determines by rulemaking, based on the record, that NRC or an affected Agreement State has:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Failed on a programmatic basis to implement and enforce, in significant part, the regulations governing the disposal
of uranium mill tailings promulgated by EPA and NRC or the tailings closure plan (radon) (i.e., contained in the operating
license) requirements establishing milestones for the purpose of emplacing a permanent radon barrier that will
achieve compliance with the 20 pCi/m2-s flux standard; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Those failures may reasonably be anticipated to significantly interfere (i.e., more than de minimis) with the
timely emplacement of a permanent radon barrier constructed to achieve compliance with the 20 pCi/m2-s flux standard
at uranium mill tailings disposal sites.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) The Administrator shall reinstate 40 CFR part 61, subpart T on a site-specific basis as applied to owners and operators
of non-operational uranium mill tailings disposal sites that are licensed by the NRC or an affected Agreement State
if the Administrator determines by rulemaking, based on the record:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) That NRC or an affected Agreement State has failed on a site-specific basis to achieve compliance by the operator
of the site or sites with applicable license requirements, regulations, or standards implemented by NRC and the affected
Agreement States; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Those failures may reasonably be anticipated to significantly interfere (i.e., more than de minimis) with the
timely emplacement of a permanent radon barrier constructed to achieve compliance with the 20 pCi/m2-s flux standard
at uranium mill tailings disposal sites.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Procedures to Petition for Reconsideration of Rescission of this subpart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) EPA shall summarily dismiss a petition to reconsider rescission and seek reinstatement of this subpart under
&sect;61.226(a)(1) (programmatic basis), without prejudice, unless the petitioner demonstrates that written
notice of the alleged failure(s) was provided to NRC at least 60 days before filing the petition with EPA. This notification
shall include a statement of the grounds for such a petition and this notice requirement may be satisfied by, but is
not limited to, submissions or pleadings submitted to NRC during a proceeding conducted by NRC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) EPA shall summarily dismiss a petition to reconsider rescission and seek reinstatement of this subpart under
&sect;61.226(a)(2) (site-specific basis), without prejudice, unless the petitioner demonstrates that a written
request was made to NRC or an affected Agreement State for enforcement or other relief at least 60 days before filing
its petition with EPA, and unless the petitioner alleges that NRC or the affected Agreement State failed to respond
to such request by taking action, as necessary, to assure timely implementation and enforcement of the 20 pCi/m2-s
flux standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Upon receipt of a petition under &sect;61.226(b)(1) that is not dismissed under &sect;61.226 (b)(2) or (b)(3),
EPA will propose to grant or deny an authorized petition to reconsider, take comments on the Agency's proposed action,
and take final action granting or denying such petition to reconsider within 300 days of receipt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Reconsideration of Rescission of this subpart Initiated by the Administrator.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Administrator may initiate reconsideration of the rescission and reinstatement of this subpart as applied
to owners and operators of non-operational uranium mill tailings disposal sites if EPA has reason to believe that
NRC or an affected Agreement State has failed to implement and enforce, in significant part, the regulations governing
the disposal of uranium mill tailings promulgated by EPA and NRC or the tailings closure plan (radon) requirements
establishing milestones for the purpose of emplacing a permanent radon barrier that will achieve compliance with
the 20 pCi/m2-s flux standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Before the Administrator initiates reconsideration of the rescission and reinstatement of this subpart under
&sect;61.226(c)(1), EPA shall consult with NRC to address EPA's concerns and if the consultation does not resolve
the concerns, EPA shall provide NRC with 60 days notice of the Agency's intent to initiate rulemaking to reinstate
this subpart.
