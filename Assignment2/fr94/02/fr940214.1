SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) proposes to restructure the procedures for licensing cottonseed samplers
to draw, prepare and submit cottonseed samples for USDA's official cottonseed grading program. The proposed revision
would significantly reduce the paperwork burden involved in the licensing of official cottonseed samplers by eliminating
the bonding requirement and the license fee, and extending the license period from 1 to 5 years. Under the proposed
revision, official cottonseed samplers would still be required to obtain a license from USDA, and sampling equipment
and procedures would continue to receive the same level of supervision from AMS Cotton Division personnel.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have
retroactive effect. This rule would not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies unless they present
an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior
to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administrator, Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), has certified that this action will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) because: (1) The proposed changes in licensing procedures will decrease the cottonseed sampler's paperwork burden;
(2) the proposed change in licensing procedures will not affect competition in the marketplace; and (3) participation
in USDA's official cottonseed grading program is voluntary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information collection requirements for cottonseed sampler licenses contained in this proposed rule have been
previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget and assigned OMB control number 0581&hyph;0008 under
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). This proposed revision, if adopted, would significantly reduce the information collection requirements for
34 licensed cottonseed samplers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cottonseed sampler license form CN&hyph;248 requires an estimated 0.17 hours or 10.2 minutes to complete. The
paperwork burden for the 34 cottonseed samplers' license renewal each year amounts to 5.78 hours. This proposed rule,
by requiring that licenses be renewed every 5 years, will reduce the paperwork burden to 1.16 hours, an 80 percent reduction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is anticipated that the simplification of licensing procedures for cottonseed samplers, if adopted, would become
effective on July 1, 1994, so that implementation could be coordinated with the start of the 1994 cotton harvest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USDA provides official grading of cottonseed under the authority of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 (7 U.S.C.
1624), which requires USDA to supervise the drawing, preparation, and handling of samples submitted for official
grading. Current regulations require that applications for initial and renewal cottonseed sampler's licenses,
both of which expire in 1 year, be accompanied by proof that the sampler is bonded by an approved surety company, including
a power of attorney, and a small fee ($20.00 for new licenses and $18.00 for renewals). These requirements are unnecessary
for the maintenance of an acceptable level of supervision of cottonseed sampling by USDA. In addition, the licensing
process would be simplified if these requirements were eliminated and the license period extended to 5 years. The
licensing procedures for cotton samplers were revised similarly 15 years ago with no adverse effects to the level
of supervision provided by AMS, and this revision would make the procedures for cottonseed sampler licensing consistent
with those for cotton samplers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed regulations, official cottonseed samplers would still be required to obtain a license, and sampling
equipment and procedures would continue to receive the same level of supervision from Agricultural Marketing Service,
Cotton Division personnel. The expected effects of this proposed revision would be to: (1) Decrease both the applicant's
expense and paperwork burden required for licensing; and (2) simplify the procedures and reduce the time required
by the Cotton Division employees to process the applications and maintain license records. While the effects on the
cottonseed industry are expected to be nominal in both cases, justification for continuing the bonding requirement,
license fee, and 1-year license period cannot be supported by experience in the supervision of USDA's official cottonseed
grading program in recent years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, &sect;&sect;61.26 and 61.28, which detail the bonding requirements for both newly issued and renewal
cottonseed sampling licenses, would be deleted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;61.27, the period of new and renewal licenses would be extended from 1 to 5 years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 61.29 and 61.43, which set forth the designation of bond approval authority and the fees for new and renewal
licenses, respectively, would be deleted.

 This document invites written comments on a proposal to suspend certain provisions of the Southwest Plains Federal
milk marketing order (Order 106) for the months of February 1994 through August 1996. The proposal would suspend a
portion of the supply plant shipping requirement and the touch-base requirement during the months of February through
August of each year. The action was requested by Kraft General Foods (Kraft), which contends the suspension is necessary
to prevent the uneconomical and inefficient movement of milk and to ensure that producers historically associated
with the market will continue to have their milk pooled under Order 106.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule
on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified
that this proposed action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
Such action would lessen the regulatory impact of the order on certain milk handlers and would tend to ensure that dairy
farmers would continue to have their milk priced under the order and thereby receive the benefits that accrue from
such pricing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed suspension has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not
intended to have a retroactive effect. If adopted, this proposed action will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations,
or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with the rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), provides that administrative proceedings
must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to
an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any obligation
imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of the order or to be exempted
from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing, the Secretary
would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the
handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's
ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.

Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, suspension
of the following provisions of the order regulating the handling of milk in the Southwest Plains marketing area is
being considered for the months of February through August of 1994 through 1996, effective upon publication in the

Statement of Consideration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed suspension would suspend the requirement that producers ``touch-base'' at a pool plant with at least
one day's production during the month before their milk is eligible for diversion to a nonpool plant. By suspending
the touch-base provision, producer milk would not be required to be delivered to pool plants before going to unregulated
manufacturing plants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the proposed suspension would allow a supply plant that has been associated with the Southwest Plains
order during the months of September through January of each year to qualify as a pool plant without shipping any milk
to a pool distributing plant during the following months of February through August. Without the suspension, a supply
plant would be required to ship 20 percent of its producer receipts to pool distributing plants to qualify as a pool
plant during each of the months of February through August.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to Kraft's letter requesting the suspension, supplemental milk supplies will not be needed to meet the
fluid needs of distributing plants. Kraft anticipates that there will be an adequate supply of direct-ship producer
milk located in the general area of distributing plants available to meet the Class I needs of the market. Consequently,
it states, there is no need to require producers located some distance from pool distributing plants to touch-base
when their milk can more economically be diverted directly to manufacturing plants in the production area.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule is issued in conformance with Executive Order 12866. Based on information compiled by the Department,
it has been determined that this proposed rule:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Would have an annual effect on the economy of less than $100 million;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Would not adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition,
jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Would not alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Would not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or principles
set forth in Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule deals primarily with requirements imposed upon foreign governments and non-profit entities
distributing relief supplies overseas. Therefore, the proposed rule does not have a significant impact upon a substantial
number of small business entities and Regulatory Impact Statement was not prepared. A copy of this proposed rule has
been sent to the Chief Counsel, Office of Advocacy, U.S. Small Business Administration.

with state and local officials. See the notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 46 FR 29115 (June 24,
1983). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under the Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. The proposed rule would
have pre-emptive effect with respect to any state or local laws, regulations, or policies which conflict with such
provisions or which otherwise impede their full implementation. The proposed rule would not have retroactive effect.
Administrative proceedings are not required before parties may seek judicial review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of Agriculture is committed to carrying out its statutory and regulatory mandates in a manner that
best serves the public interest. Therefore, where legal discretion permits, the Department actively seeks to promulgate
regulations that promote economic growth, create jobs, are minimally burdensome and are easy for the public to understand,
use or comply with. In short, the Department is committed to issuing regulations that maximize net benefits to society
and minimize costs imposed by those regulations. This principle is articulated in Executive Orders 12291 and 12498.
The Department applies this principle to the full extent possible, consistent with law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has developed and reviewed this regulatory proposal in accordance with these principles. Nonetheless,
the Department believes that public input from all interested persons can be invaluable to ensuring that the final
regulatory product is minimally burdensome and maximally efficient. Therefore, the Department specifically seeks
comments and suggestions from the public regarding any less burdensome or more efficient alternative that would
accomplish the purposes described in the proposal. Comments suggesting less burdensome or more efficient alternatives
should be addressed to the agency as provided in this Proposed Rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule would govern the donation of agricultural commodities overseas pursuant to section 416(b) of
the Agricultural Act of 1949 (7 U.S.C. 1431(b)) and the Food for Progress Act of 1985 (7 U.S.C. 1736o). These regulations
contain many provisions that have been standard terms of agreements with recipients, i.e., Cooperating Sponsors,
for a number of years. As of October 1, 1991, the Agency for International Development no longer is a signatory to section
416(b) program agreements and pursuant to E.O. 12752, 56 FR 8255, the Secretary of Agriculture was delegated the President's
responsibilities under the Food for Progress Act. Accordingly, it is appropriate for the Department of Agriculture
to promulgate regulations to govern operations under these two programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generally, the regulatory provisions herein would apply equally to both programs; however, certain provisions
dealing with the sale of commodities and the use of local currencies generated from such sales apply only to the section
416(b) program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties should carefully read the full proposed rule. Of particular note are the following points: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Nominations of shipping agents for Cooperating Sponsors participating in the Food for Progress Act will be made
to USDA in conformity with the conflict of interest provisions currently applicable only to section 416(b) and of
the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 (Pub. L. 480). This will place all USDA concessional
export programs on the same basis regarding conflict of interest reviews in connection with shipping agents. In this
regard, the proposed regulations include limitations on commissions that may be paid to shipping agents that follow
the limitations currently proposed for shipping agents participating in the title I, Public Law 480 program. See
57 FR 53607, November 12, 1992. Comments received regarding these limitations are presently being reviewed and will
also be considered in relation to this proposed rule. These proposed rules, however, would also limit the agents commission
to a percentage of the gross freight attributable to the ocean segment of any movement that may be contracted on a through
bill of lading or involve obligations at discharge such as bagging grain. This limitation is included because freight
charges attributed to inland movements to many destinations receiving section 416(b) and Food for Progress commodities
are relatively high due to various difficult conditions in these countries. CCC does not have an effective mechanism
to determine the reasonableness of these charges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. These regulations apply only to agreements for the donation of agricultural commodities and not to any sales to
Cooperating Sponsors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Specific criteria are established to govern the approval of agreements or of activities under such agreements.
Detailed information is required in the Plan of Operation submitted in connection with a section 416(b) agreement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The proposed rule contains detailed procedures for the procurement of ocean transportation including requirements
for competitive bidding in the fixture of vessels on charter terms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The regulations include specific guidance for ocean carrier and inland claims and for disposing of commodities
unfit for intended use. In this regard, the regulations would adopt procedures similar to those in effect for title
II, Public Law 480 shipments and should be familiar to many Cooperating Sponsors.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This part contains the general terms governing agreements between CCC and Cooperating Sponsors providing for the
donation of agricultural commodities to carry out programs of assistance outside the United States under the authority
of section 416(b) of the Agricultural Act of 1949, or support of developing countries and countries that have made
commitments to introduce or expand free enterprise elements in their agricultural economies under the authority
of the Food for Progress Act of 1985. Program Agreements may contain other provisions when CCC determines that such
provisions are necessary to effectively carry out a particular Program Agreement. Except as otherwise specified
herein, these regulations apply to only donations to Cooperating Sponsors under both the section 416(b) and Food
for Progress programs. However, these regulations do not apply to donations to intergovernmental agencies (such
as the World Food Program) or organizations unless CCC and such intergovernmental agency or organization enters
into a Program Agreement incorporating this part.

private domestic markets for the purchase and sale of such commodities. CCC shall require Cooperating Sponsors to
submit a Plan of Operation similar to the Plan of Operation described in &sect;1499.5(b) when CCC determines such
would be necessary to identify specific activities to be undertaken by the Cooperating Sponsor in order to accomplish
the purposes of the Food for Progress program. In such case, proposed activities will be evaluated in accordance with

at U.S. port in the case of bulk grain shipments, or f.a.s. vessel at U.S. port or at the intermodal point for all other
commodities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Cooperating Sponsor shall bear all costs and expenses incurred subsequent to the transfer of title, except
that, when specifically provided in the Program Agreement or upon the determination by CCC that it is the best interest
of the program to do so, CCC may pay or make reimbursement for all or a portion of the reasonable transportation costs
from U.S. ports to designated ports or points of entry abroad, and in the case of urgent and extraordinary relief requirements,
all or a portion of the reasonable transportation costs from designated points of entry abroad to storage and distribution
sites, and reasonable associated storage and distribution costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) (i) In the case of countries receiving commodities under the Food for Progress Program, CCC may agree to make payments
to Cooperating Sponsors to assist in the administration, sale, and monitoring of food assistance programs to strengthen
private sector agriculture in such countries. The Program Agreement will specify the maximum dollar amount of funding
that CCC will pay the Cooperating Sponsor for such costs. Payment of the above funds will only be made to the Cooperating
Sponsor in such amounts, and for such purposes, as may be specifically approved in writing by the Controller, CCC and
the General Sales Manager. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) CCC may, at its option, advance to the Cooperating Sponsor not more than 85 percent of the total dollar amount specified
in the Program Agreement for the costs identified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. Funds committed but not

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iv) The Cooperating Sponsor must submit to the Controller, CCC, invoices supporting the charges incurred against
the advance, or for which reimbursement is claimed, within 60 days from the date the service is received. All charges
must be reasonable and foreign currency transactions must be supported by evidence of the specific exchange rate
incurred. A delay in receipt, or non-receipt, of supporting documentation by the Controller, CCC, may result in CCC's
refusal to release future advances. The Cooperating Sponsor shall promptly refund to CCC all funds advanced, together
with all interest earned on such funds, if either not utilized within 180 days after the advance for purposes for which
the funds were advanced, or for which documentation supporting the expenditure is not supplied to CCC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) All CCC advances must be deposited in an interest bearing account with interest earned on the funds advanced used

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If the Program Agreement specifies that CCC will finance only the ocean freight differential (``OFD'') on U.S.
flag vessels, the Director, Public Law 480&hyph;OD will compute OFD as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) when non-U.S.-flag vessels are offered, the OFD will be the difference between the weighted average freight rate(s)
of non-U.S. flag vessel(s) fixed or offered that could carry the quantity of cargo absent the requirement to use U.S.-flag
vessels, and the rate for the U.S. flag vessel(s) fixed; or the rate(s) offered (including any lower rates negotiated)
by U.S.-flag vessels(s) which could have carried the required tonnage and represents the lowest land cost (U.S. flag
basis).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) When non U.S. flag vessels are not offered, or when offered, have specifications which preclude their use, the
rate to be used in computing OFD will be determined by using any market data deemed relevant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) When the recipient country employs its own flag vessels or other flag vessels under its control, the non-U.S.
flag rate to be used in computing OFD will be determined using any market data deemed relevant.

such letter of credit. Charter parties and liner booking contracts may not contain a specified detention rate. The
ocean carrier shall be entitled to reimbursement, as damages for detention, all time so lost, for each calendar day
or any part of the calendar day, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. The period of such delay shall not commence

irrevocable letters of credit have been established for ocean freight or the time the vessel begins loading, whichever
is earlier. Time calculated as detention shall not count as laytime. Reimbursement for such detention shall be payable
no later than upon the vessel's arrival at the first port of discharge.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iv) charges attributable to the failure of the vessel to present before the canceling date including, but not limited
to inspection, fumigation, and carrying charges, will be for the account of the ocean carrier.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) ocean freight is earned under a charter party when the vessel and cargo arrive at the first port of discharge, Provided,
That if a force majeure as described in paragraph (f)(3) below prevents the vessels arrival at the first port of discharge,
95% of the ocean freight is payable or, if the charter party provides for completing additional requirements after
discharge such as bagging, stacking, or inland transportation, 85% of the ocean freight is payable, at the time the
General Sales Manager determines that such force majeure was the cause of nonarrival; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) when the ocean carrier offers delivery to destination ports on U.S.-flag vessels, but foreign-flag vessels
are used for any part of the voyage to the destination port, without first obtaining the approval of the Cooperating
Sponsor, KCCO, and any other approval that may be required by the Program Agreement, the ocean freight rate will be
reduced to the lowest responsive foreign-flag vessel rate offered in response to the same invitation for bids and

 When the Program Agreement provides that CCC will pay any portion of the ocean freight:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 100% of the ocean freight is payable upon receipt of the documents specified in paragraph (g) of this section, unless
the charter party or liner booking note provides for completing additional requirements after discharge such as
bagging, stacking, or inland transportation, in which case 85% of the ocean freight is payable. The balance of freight
remaining will be paid upon receipt of notification from the Cooperating Sponsor that the vessel has fulfilled all
the requirements of the charter party or liner booking contract in a successful manner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Demurrage will not be paid or reimbursed by CCC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) CCC will waive the requirement in paragraph (g) of this section for a notice of arrival if the General Sales Manager
determines upon submission of evidence on the part of the ocean carrier that the vessel is lost or unable to proceed
to destination after completion of loading as a result of one or more of the following causes (force majeure): Damage

(a) Section 416(b). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, commodities donated under a section 416(b) Program Agreement
may be sold or bartered only in accordance with an approved Plan of Operation. Such sales or barters may be approved
by CCC on a case-by-case basis for the following purposes only:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) to finance the distribution, handling or processing costs of the donated commodities in the importing country
or in a country through which the commodities must be transshipped, or other activities in the importing country that
are consistent with providing food assistance to needy people;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) in the case of sales of commodities furnished to nonprofit and voluntary agencies, or cooperatives, to generate
proceeds to be used to transport, store, distribute and otherwise enhance the effectiveness of the use of commodities,
and to implement income generating community development, health, nutrition, cooperative development, agricultural
program, and other development activities;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) to cover expenses of the type identified in section 406 of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance
Act of 1954; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) for any other use specifically authorized by statute.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Commodities may be sold or bartered only in the importing country or other country specifically approved by CCC.
Monetized proceeds must be expended within either the country of origin or in other countries as necessary to expedite
transportation of commodities, or in countries which generally accept the type of currency generated by the sale.
Monetized proceeds must be expended within one year of acquisition unless CCC specifically agrees that a longer period
is necessary to achieve the purposes of paragraph (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section, commodities may be sold or bartered without prior
approval of CCC where damage has occurred to the commodity rendering it unfit for the intended program purposes, and
sale or barter is necessary to mitigate the loss of the value of the damaged commodity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Cooperating Sponsors who sell or barter commodities must enter into a written agreement with the other party to
the sale transaction. A copy of the executed agreement must be provided to the Agricultural Counselor or Attache.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) All monetized proceeds shall be deposited into a special interest bearing account for control and monitoring
unless interest bearing accounts are prohibited by the laws or customs of the importing country or such requirement
would impose an undue burden on the Cooperating Sponsor. Any accrued interest shall be used only for approved activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Cooperating Sponsors shall not be required to monitor, manage, report on, or account for the distribution or use
of such sold or bartered commodities after all sales proceeds have been fully deposited in a special account and title
to the commodities has passed to buyers or other third parties pursuant to a sale or barter transaction. The sales proceeds
and the uses thereof, however, must be monitored, managed, reported and accounted for as provided in the relevant
sections of this part 1499.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(7) Commodities approved for sale or barter need not be imported and sold free of all duties and taxes, but nongovernmental
Cooperating Sponsors may negotiate agreements with the host government permitting the duty and tax-free import
and sale of such commodities. Even where the Cooperating Sponsor negotiates such exempt status, the prices at which
the Cooperating Sponsor sells the commodities to the purchaser shall reflect prices that would be obtained in a competitive
commercial transaction, i.e., the prices would include the cost of duties and taxes, so that the amounts normally
paid for duties and taxes would accrue for the benefit of the Cooperating Sponsor's approved program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) No part of the proceeds or services realized from sales or barters may be used for operating and overhead expenses,
other than for personnel and administrative costs of local cooperatives. Operating and overhead expenses are costs
attributable to the overall administration and management expenses of the Cooperating Sponsor in its regional,
national, or U.S. offices, including rent, taxes, insurance, utilities, telephone, office supplies, and depreciation,
and in the case of nonprofit private and voluntary agencies and cooperatives, costs of monitoring, evaluation, auditing,
and travel within the host country except where such costs are directly related to a specific activity and essential
to the effective implementation of the activity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) The Cooperating Sponsor shall use commercially reasonable procurement practices in purchasing goods or services
and in construction activities using monetization proceeds or program income, and shall employ procedures that
prevent fraud, self-dealing, and conflicts of interest and provide for free and open competition to the maximum extent
practicable. Title to real and personal property acquired with monetization proceeds and program income shall be
vested in the Cooperating Sponsor, with the Cooperating Sponsor providing the Controller, CCC with an inventory
list of all assets valued at one thousand dollars (USD) or more. The Cooperating Sponsor shall dispose of such property
as directed by the Agricultural Counselor or Attache in the event the program terminates or is transferred to another
Cooperating Sponsor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) Monetized proceeds and program income may not be used to acquire, develop, construct, alter or upgrade land,
buildings or other real property improvements or structures that are either:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) owned or managed by a church or other organization engaged exclusively in religious activity, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) used in whole or in part for sectarian purposes. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, monetized proceeds
or program income may be used to finance repair or rehabilitation of an existing structure owned or managed by a church
or organization engaged exclusively in religious activity to the extent necessary to avoid spoilage or loss of donated
commodities, provided that the structure is not used in whole or in part for any sectarian purpose while donated commodities
are stored in it. The use of monetized proceeds or program income to finance construction of such a structure may be
approved in the operational plan or by the Agricultural Counselor or Attache if the structure is needed and will be
used for the storage of donated commodities for a sufficient period of time to warrant the expenditure of monetized
proceeds or program income and the structure will not be used for any sectarian purpose during this period.

require that the provider of such services (1) shall fully account to the Cooperating Sponsor for all commodities
delivered or otherwise be liable for the value of all unaccounted commodities and (2) shall maintain adequate records
and submit periodic reports pertaining to performance under the agreements. Copies of the executed agreements shall
be provided to the Agricultural Counselor or Attache.

labeled in the language of the country in which the commodities are to be distributed with the name of the commodity
and, except where the donated commodities are to be sold or bartered pursuant to an approved Plan of Operation after
processing, packaging or repackaging, that the commodity is furnished by the people of the United States of America

expenses incurred for such repackaging. No prior approval is required for such expenses equaling $500 or less. If
such expense is estimated to exceed $500, the authority to repackage and incur such expense must be approved by the
Agricultural Counselor or Attache in advance of repackaging.

of sales shall be deposited with the U.S. Disbursing Officer American Embassy, for the credit of CCC in an appropriate
CCC account as determined by CCC. However, if the commodities were donated for monetization programs, the net sales
proceeds, after deducting expenses incidental to handling and disposition of the damaged commodity, shall be deposited
to the special account established for monetized proceeds, and the Cooperating Sponsor is responsible for documenting
the amount of the sales proceeds from the sale of damaged commodities deposited to the special account. The Cooperating
Sponsor shall seek guidance from CCC regarding sales proceeds in the event the Cooperating Sponsor executed a sales

If after arrival in a foreign country it appears that the commodity, or any part thereof, may be unfit for the use authorized
in the Program Agreement, the Cooperating Sponsor shall immediately arrange for inspection of the commodity by a
public health official or other competent authority approved by the Agricultural Counselor or Attache. If no competent
local authority is available, the Agricultural Counselor or Attache may determine whether the commodities are unfit
for the use authorized in the Program Agreement, and, if so, may direct disposal in accordance with paragraphs (b)
(1) through (4) of this section. The Cooperating Sponsor shall arrange for the recovery for authorized use of that
part designated during the inspection as suitable for authorized use. If, after inspection, the commodity (or any
part thereof) is determined to be unfit for authorized use, the Cooperating Sponsor shall notify the Agricultural
Counselor or Attache of the circumstances pertaining to the loss or damage. With the concurrence of the Agricultural
Counselor or Attache, the commodity determined to be unfit for authorized use shall be disposed of in the following
order of priority:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) By transfer to an approved section 416(b) program for use as livestock feeding feed. CCC shall be advised promptly
of any such transfer so that shipments from the United States to the livestock feeding program can be reduced by an equivalent
amount;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Sale for the most appropriate use, i.e., animal feed, fertilizer, or industrial use, at the highest obtainable
price. When the commodity is sold, all U.S. Government markings shall be obliterated or removed;

(3) By donation to a governmental or charitable organization for use as animal feed or for other non-food use; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If the commodity is unfit for any use or if disposal in accordance with paragraph (b)(1), (2) or (3) of this section
is not possible, the commodity shall be destroyed under the observation of a representative of the Agricultural Counselor
or Attache, if practicable, in such manner as to prevent its use for any purpose.

be signed by all parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) (i) If the Cooperating Sponsor arranges for an independent cargo surveyor, the Cooperating Sponsor shall obtain
a certification by a public health official or similar competent authority as to the condition of the commodity in
any case where a damaged commodity appears to be unfit for the use authorized in the Program Agreement; and a certificate
of disposition in the event the commodity is determined to be unfit for its intended use. Such certificates shall be
obtained as soon as possible after discharge of the cargo. The Cooperating Sponsor shall forward any narrative chronology
or other commentary it can provide to assist in the adjudication of ocean transportation claims and shall prepare
such a narrative in any case where the loss is estimated to be in excess of $5,000.00. The Cooperating Sponsor may, at
its option, also engage the independent surveyor to supervise clearance and delivery of the cargo from customs or
port areas to the Cooperating Sponsor or its agent and to issue delivery survey reports thereon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In the event of cargo loss and damage, the Cooperating Sponsor shall provide the names and addresses of individuals
who were present at the time of discharge and during survey and who can verify the quantity lost or damaged. For bulk
grain shipments, in those cases where the Cooperating Sponsor is responsible for survey and outturn reports, the
Cooperating Sponsor shall obtain the services of an independent surveyor to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Observe the discharge of the cargo and report on discharging methods including scale type, calibrations and any
other factor which may affect the accuracy of scale weights, and if scales are not used, the reason should be stated
and the method of weight determination fully described; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Estimate the quantity of cargo, if any, lost during discharge through carrier negligence; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Advise on the quality of sweepings; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Obtain copies of port or vessel records, if possible, showing quantity discharged; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Provide immediate notification to the Cooperating Sponsor if additional services are necessary to protect cargo
interests of if surveyor has reason to believe that the correct quantity was not discharged. In the case of shipments
arriving in container vans, Cooperating Sponsors shall require the independent surveyor to list the container van
numbers and seal numbers shown on the container vans, and indicate whether the seals were intact at the time the container
vans were opened, and whether the container vans were in any way damaged. To the extent possible, the independent surveyor
should observe discharge of container vans from the vessel to ascertain whether any damage to the container van occurred
and arrange for surveying the contents as soon as possible after opening. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Cooperating Sponsors shall send copies to KCFMO, Chief, Debt Management Office of all reports and documents
pertaining to the discharge of commodities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) CCC will reimburse the Cooperating Sponsor for incurred costs upon receipt of the survey report and the surveyor's
invoice or other documents that establish the survey cost. CCC shall not reimburse a Cooperating Sponsor for the costs
of only a delivery survey, in the absence of a discharge survey, or for any other survey not taken contemporaneously
with the discharge of the vessel, unless such deviation is justified to the satisfaction of CCC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Survey contracts shall be let on a competitive bid basis unless CCC determines that the use of competitive bids
would not be practicable. CCC may preclude the use of certain surveyors because of conflicts of interest or lack of
demonstrated capability to properly carry out surveying responsibilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ocean carrier loss and damage. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Notwithstanding transfer of title to the Cooperating Sponsor, the CCC shall have the right to file, pursue, and
retain the proceeds of collection from claims arising from ocean transportation cargo loss and damage, including
loss and damage occurring between the time of transfer of title and loading aboard a vessel. CCC assumes general average
contributions and all valid general average incidents which may arise from the movement of commodity to the destination
ports. CCC shall receive and retain all allowances in general average. Where the Cooperating Sponsor pays the ocean
freight or a portion thereof, it shall be entitled to pro rata reimbursement received from any claims related to ocean
freight charged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Cooperating Sponsor shall: File notice with the ocean carrier immediately upon discovery of any cargo loss
or damage, promptly initiate claims against the ocean carriers for such loss and damage, take all necessary action
to obtain restitution for losses, and provide CCC copies of all such claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Cooperating
Sponsors need not file a claim when the cargo loss is less than $100, or in any case when the loss is between $100 and $300
and the Cooperating Sponsors determine that the cost of filing and collecting the claim will exceed the amount of the
claim. Cooperating Sponsors shall transmit to KCFMO, Chief, Debt Management Office information and documentation
on such lost or damaged shipments when no claim is to be filed. When General Average has been declared, Cooperating
Sponsors need not file or collect claims for loss of, or damage to, commodities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Amounts collected by Cooperating Sponsors on claims against ocean carriers which are less than $200 may be retained
by the Cooperating Sponsor. On claims involving loss of damage of $200 or more the Cooperating Sponsors may retain
from collections received by them, either $200 plus 10 percent of the difference between $200 and the total amount
collected on the claim, up to a maximum of $500; or the actual administrative expenses incurred in collection of the
claim, provided retention of such administrative expenses is approved by CCC. Allowable collection costs shall
not to include attorneys fees, fees of collection agencies, and similar costs. In no event will CCC pay collection
costs in excess of the amount collected on the claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The Cooperating Sponsors also may retain from claim recoveries remaining after allowable deductions for administrative
expenses of collection, the amount of any special charges, such as handling and packing costs, which the Cooperating
Sponsor has incurred on the lost or damaged commodity and which are included in the claims and paid by the liable party.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(5) The Cooperating Sponsor may redetermine claims on the basis of additional documentation or information not considered
when the claims were originally filed when such documentation or information clearly changes the ocean carrier's
liability. Approval of such changes by CCC is not required regardless of amount. However, copies of redetermined
claims and supporting documentation or information shall be furnished to CCC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The Cooperating Sponsor may negotiate compromise settlements of claims of any amount, provided that proposed
compromise settlements of claims having a value of $5,000 or more shall require prior approved in writing by CCC. When
a claim is compromised, the Cooperating Sponsor may retain from the amount collected, the amounts authorized in paragraph
(d)(3) of this section, and in addition, an amount representing such percentage of the special charges described
in paragraph (d)(4) of this section as compromised amount is to the full amount of the claim. When a claim is less than
$600, the Cooperating Sponsor may terminate collection activity when it is determined that pursuit of such claims
will not be economically sound. Approval for such termination by CCC is not required; however, the Cooperating Sponsor
shall notify KCFMO, Chief, Debt Management Division when collection activity on a claim is terminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) All amounts collected in excess of the amounts authorized herein to be retained shall be remitted to CCC. For the
purpose of determining the amount to be retained by the Cooperating Sponsor from the proceeds of claims filed against
ocean carriers, the word ``claim'' shall refer to the loss and damage to commodities which are shipped on the same voyage
of the same vessel to the same port destination, irrespective of the kinds of commodities shipped or the number of different
bills of lading issued by the carrier. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) If a Cooperating Sponsor is unable to effect collection of a claim or negotiate an acceptable compromise settlement
within the applicable period of limitation or any extension thereof granted in writing by the liable party or parties,
the rights of the Cooperating Sponsor to the claim shall be assigned to CCC in sufficient time to permit the filing of
legal action prior to the expiration of the period of limitation or any extension thereof. Generally, the Cooperating
Sponsor shall assign claim rights to CCC no later than 60 days prior to the expiration of the period of limitation or
any extension thereof. In all cases, the Cooperating Sponsor, shall keep CCC informed of the progress of its collection
efforts and shall promptly assign their claim rights to CCC upon request. Subsequently, if CCC collects on or settles
the claim, CCC shall, except as indicated below, pay to the Cooperating Sponsor the amount to which it would have been
entitled had it collected on the claim. The additional 10 percent on amounts collected in excess of $200 will be payable,
however, only if CCC determines that reasonable efforts were made to collect the claim prior to the assignment, or
if payment is determined to be commensurate with the extra efforts exerted in further documenting the claim. If documentation
requirements have not been fulfilled and the lack of such documentation has not been justified to the satisfaction
of CCC, CCC will deny payment of all allowances to the Cooperating Sponsor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) When a Cooperating Sponsor fails to file a claim, permit a claim to become time-barred, or fail to take timely actions
to insure the right of CCC to assert such claims, and CCC determines that the Cooperating Sponsor failed to properly
exercise its responsibilities under the Agreement, the Cooperating Sponsor shall be liable to the United States
for the cost and freight value of the commodities lost to the program.

commodities of equal value). If the Cooperating Sponsor:

for such payment or replacement if it is determined by CCC that such improper distribution or use, or such loss or damage,
could not have been prevented by proper exercise of the Cooperating Sponsor's responsibility under the terms of the
Program Agreement. Normal commercial practices in the country of distribution shall be considered in determining
whether there was a proper exercise of the Cooperating sponsor's responsibility. Payment by the Cooperating Sponsor
shall be made in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.

 (1) In addition to survey or outturn reports to determine ocean carrier loss and damage, the Cooperating Sponsor shall,
in the case of landlocked countries, arrange for an independent survey at the point of entry into the recipient country
and make a report as set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. CCC will reimburse the Cooperating Sponsor for the
costs of survey as set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Where any damage to or loss of the commodity or any loss of monetized proceeds or program income is attributable
to a warehouseman, carrier or other person, the Cooperating Sponsor shall make every reasonable effort to pursue
collection of claims for such loss or damage. The Cooperating Sponsor shall furnish a copy of the claim and related
documents to the Agricultural Counselor or Attache. Cooperating Sponsors who fail to file or pursue such claims shall
be liable to CCC for the value of the commodities or loss of monetized proceeds or program income is attributable to
a warehouseman, carrier or other person, the Cooperating Sponsor shall make every reasonable effort to pursue collection
of claims for such loss or damage. The Cooperating Sponsor shall furnish a copy of the claim and related documents to
the Agricultural Counselor or Attache. Cooperating Sponsors who fail to file or pursue such claims shall be liable
to CCC for the value of the commodities or monetized proceeds or program income lost, damaged, or misused: Provided,
however, that the Cooperating Sponsor may elect not to file a claim if the loss is less than $500. The Cooperating Sponsor
may retain $150 of any amount collected on an individual claim. In addition, Cooperating Sponsors may, with the written
approval of the Agricultural Counselor or Attache, retain amounts to cover special costs of collection such as legal
fees, or pay such collection costs with monetized proceeds or program income. Any proposed settlement for less than
the full amount of the claim requires prior approval by the Agricultural Counselor or Attache. When the Cooperating
Sponsor has exhausted all reasonable attempts to collect a claim, it shall request the Agricultural Counselor or
Attache to provide further instructions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) At a minimum, the Cooperating Sponsor shall pursue any claim by initial billings and with three progressively
stronger demands at not more than 30 day intervals. If these efforts fail to elicit a satisfactory response, legal
action in the judicial system of the cooperating country shall be pursued unless:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Liability of the third party is not provable, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The cost of pursuing the claim would exceed the amount of the claim,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The third party would not have enough assets to satisfy the claim after a judicial decision favorable to the cooperating
sponsor, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Maintaining legal action in the country's judicial system would seriously impair the Cooperating Sponsor's
ability to conduct an effective program in the country.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Cooperating Sponsor's decisions not to take legal action, and reasons therefore, must be submitted in writing to
the Agricultural Counselor or Attache for review and approval, and the Agricultural Counselor or Attache may require
the Cooperating Sponsor to obtain the opinion of competent legal counsel to support its decision. A Cooperating Sponsor
may request approval to terminate legal action after it has commenced for any of the exceptions described above or
if CCC determines that it is otherwise appropriate to terminate legal action prior to judgment. In each instance the
Agricultural Counsel or Attache must provide the Cooperating Sponsor with a written explanation of its decision.
If the Agricultural Counselor or Attache approves a Cooperating Sponsor's decision not to take further action on
the claim for reasons described in paragraph (f)(3)(iv) of this section, the Cooperating Sponsor shall assign the
claim to CCC and shall provide to CCC all documentation relating to the claim.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When payment is to be made for commodities misused, lost or damaged, the value shall be determined on the basis of the
domestic market price at the time and place the misuse, loss or damage occurred. When it is not feasible to determine
such market price, the value shall be the f.o.b. or f.a.s. commercial export price of the commodity at the time and place
of export, plus ocean freight charges and other costs incurred by the U.S. Government in making delivery to the Cooperating
Sponsor. When the value is determined on a cost basis, the Cooperating Sponsor may add to the value any provable costs
it has incurred prior to delivery by the ocean carrier. In preparing the claim statement, these costs shall be clearly
segregated from costs incurred by the Government of the United States. With respect to claims other than ocean carrier
loss or damage claims, the value of misused, lost or damaged commodities may be determined on some other justifiable
basis, at the request of the Cooperating Sponsor or upon the recommendation of the Agricultural Counselor or Attache
or CCC designated representative. When replacement is made, the value of commodities misused, lost or damaged shall
be their value at the time and place the misuse, loss, or damage occurred and the value of the replacement commodities
shall be their value at the time and place replacement is made.

 (1) The Cooperating Sponsor shall promptly notify the Agricultural Counselor or Attache or CCC designated representative,
in writing, of the circumstances pertaining to any loss, damage, or misuse of commodities valued at $500 or more occurring
within the country of distribution or intermediate country. The report shall be made as soon as the Cooperating Sponsor
has adequately investigated the circumstances, but in no event more than ninety (90) days from the date the loss became
known to the Cooperating Sponsor. The report shall identify the party in possession of the commodities and the party
responsible for the loss, damage or misuse; the kind and quantities of commodities; the size and type of containers;
the time and place of misuse, loss, or damage; the current location of the commodity; the Program Agreement number,
the CCC contract numbers, or if unknown, other identifying numbers printed on the commodity containers; the action
taken by the Cooperating Sponsor with respect to recovery or disposal; and the estimated value of the commodity. The
Cooperating Sponsor shall explain the unavailability of any of the above information. The Cooperating Sponsor shall
also report the details regarding any loss or misuse of monetized proceeds or program income.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Cooperating Sponsor shall report quarterly to the Agricultural Counselor or Attache any loss, damage to or
misuse of commodities resulting in loss of less than $500. The Cooperating Sponsor shall inform the Agricultural
Counselor or Attache or CCC designated representative if it has reason to believe there is a pattern or trend in the
loss, damage, or misuse of such commodities and submit a report on the basis described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section
together with such other information as the Cooperating Sponsor has available to it. The Agricultural Counselor
or Attache may require additional information about any commodities lost, damaged or misused if it believes such
information is necessary in order to maintain the integrity of the program.

amounts paid by Cooperating Sponsors and third parties in the country of distribution shall be deposited with the
U.S. Disbursing Officer, American Embassy, preferably, in U.S. dollars with instructions to credit the deposit
to an appropriate CCC account as determined by CCC, or in local currency at the official exchange rate applicable to

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is proposing to amend the Federal meat and poultry products inspection
regulations to require appeals above the circuit supervisor level that are related to disposition of retained meat
and poultry product to be made in writing; provide that an establishment has 20 calendar days to appeal a retention,
recondition or rework product, or properly dispose of the product; and establish procedures to ensure appropriate
disposition of product immediately after a decision has been reached on an appeal. The proposal also would allow establishments
to accumulate retained product for the purpose of re-examination with specialized detecting equipment provided
written procedures for such activity are approved by the Regional Director. This proposal rule responds to recommendations
from USDA's Office of Inspector General.

This proposed rule is in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This proposed rule: (1) Would have an effect on the
economy of less than $100 million; (2) would not adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy,
productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments
or communities; (3) would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned
by another agency; (4) would not alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or
rights and obligations of recipients thereof; and (5) would not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal
mandates, the President's priorities, or principles set forth in Executive Order 12866.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. States and local jurisdictions
are preempted under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) and the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) from imposing
any marking or packaging requirements on federally inspected meat or poultry products that are in addition to, or
different than, those imposed under the FMIA and PPIA. States and local jurisdictions may, however, exercise concurrent
jurisdiction over meat and poultry products that are outside official establishments for the purpose of preventing
the distribution of meat and poultry products that are misbranded or adulterated under the FMIA or PPIA, or, in the
case of imported articles, which are not at such an establishment, after their entry into the United States. Under
the FMIA and PPIA, States that maintain meat or poultry inspection programs must impose requirements on State inspected
products and establishments that are at least equal to those required under the FMIA and PPIA. These States may, however,
impose more stringent requirements on such State inspected products and establishments.

This proposed rule is not intended to have retroactive effect. There are no applicable administrative procedures
that must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule. However, the administrative
procedures specified in Part 335 of Federal meat inspection regulations and Part 381, Subpart W of the poultry products
inspection regulations, must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule, if the challenge
involves any decision of an inspector relating to inspection services provided under the FMIA and PPIA.

Effects on Small Entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Administrator, FSIS, has made an initial determination that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The proposal provides a time limit of 20 calendar days to appeal a
decision to retain meat or poultry products that was made by the in-plant inspector and concurred in by the circuit
supervisor, recondition or rework product, or properly dispose of the product. FSIS has determined that a 20-day
time period provides ample time for the establishment to research and evaluate the situation and make a decision on
whether to recondition or rework the product or request that the product be condemned by the inspector. In addition,
the proposal would require that establishment management make such appeals in writing. The proposal would exempt
establishments from the 20-day time limit for reconditioning and reworking product when establishments intend
to accumulate product for re-examination by mechanical detecting devices. Because of the expense to establishments
of renting mechanical detecting equipment and employing technicians to operate the equipment, some establishments
may elect to store product suspected of being adulterated until a sufficient amount is accumulated to justify the
cost of the detection equipment and technicians. However, the Agency would allow the accumulation of suspect product
beyond the 20 days only if the establishment has written procedures on file that provide information to assure that
the identity, location and security of suspect product is maintained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has determined that the additional paperwork burden associated with this proposed rule is necessary to
maintain control of and assure proper disposition of product that may be adulterated. The Agency has reviewed the
recordkeeping requirements and has determined that they do not impose a significant burden on small entities.

Paperwork Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This proposal would require that establishments electing to accumulate product for re-examination with mechanical
detection devices submit written procedures to the Regional Director for prior approval. Approval of the written
procedure will be based on the establishment's ability to provide the physical space to store the accumulated product
and its ability to assure that the identity and security of the product is maintained. These procedures would describe
how the establishment will maintain the identity of the suspect product, where the suspect product will be stored,
how long the product will be stored, and what measures will be taken to secure the product. The proposal would also require
that appeals above the circuit supervisor's level be made in writing. These paperwork requirements will be submitted
to the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and the Poultry Products Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 451 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) require the Secretary of Agriculture to administer an inspection program that assures consumers that meat and poultry
products distributed in commerce are wholesome, not adulterated, and properly marked, labeled, and packaged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During processing, there are a number of ways that meat and poultry products may become adulterated or misbranded.
When product is suspected of being adulterated or misbranded, FSIS inspectors place a ``U.S. Retain'' tag on the suspect
product at the time of reinspection at the official establishment and the product is held for further inspection.
Upon further inspection, if the product is found to be adulterated, it is subject to condemnation. However, the inspector
may permit product to be reconditioned or reworked so it will not be misbranded or adulterated under certain conditions
(9 CFR 318.2 and 381.99).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Once product is retained, an establishment must recondition or rework the retained product, properly dispose of
the product, or appeal the inspector's/circuit supervisor's decision to his/her immediate supervisor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, there is no time limit on actions to be taken by the establishment when product is retained by FSIS. At times,
retained product is accumulated from different lots and held in storage for several months or more with no action taken
or planned by the establishment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations are intended to prevent incidents such as one recently investigated by USDA's Office of
Inspector General involving the release of beef trimmings containing plastic shavings from plastic cutting boards.
The investigation disclosed that about 160,000 pounds of beef trimmings containing plastic shavings had been produced
at different times at two different establishments of the same corporation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Suspect product was retained by FSIS in April and September 1991. FSIS allowed the release of all of the trimmings in
December 1991 after examining a sample of product produced at one of the establishments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Office of Inspector General (OIG) provided a report
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 of the investigation to the Secretary of Agriculture on July 30, 1992. Although the investigation disclosed that
FSIS's inspection process ensures a safe and wholesome product, the report recommended, among other things, that
FSIS strengthen its regulations with regard to documenting appeals, providing procedures for reconsidering retention
decisions, and handling and disposition of retained product.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS is proposing to amend the Federal meat and poultry products inspection regulations to: (1) Require establishments
to submit written appeals above the circuit supervisor's level when the appeal relates to disposition of retained
meat or poultry product, (2) provide that an establishment has 20 calendar days to: (a) Appeal a retention, (b) recondition
or rework product, or (c) properly dispose of the product, and (3) establish procedures to ensure appropriate disposition
of product immediately after a decision has been reached on an appeal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS has determined that a 20-day time period provides ample time for the establishment to research and evaluate the
situation and make a decision on whether to recondition or rework the product or request that the product be condemned
by the inspector. The time limit would not apply, however, for retained product that is accumulated for re-examination
using mechanical detecting devices. Frequently, when contamination (plastic, metal or other foreign material
capable of detection with approved specialized detection equipment) occurs during processing, it is difficult
to visually determine the precise amount of product affected. Therefore, FSIS permits the use of approved mechanical
detection devices, such as X-ray equipment, to be used by establishments to detect such contamination and to salvage
the portions of the product that are not contaminated. The mechanical detection equipment must be approved as prescribed
in &sect;&sect;308.5 and 381.53 of the meat and poultry inspection regulations. Because of the expense to establishments
of renting mechanical detection equipment and employing technicians to operate the equipment, some establishments
may elect to store product suspected of being contaminated until a sufficient amount is accumulated to justify the
cost of the detection equipment and technicians.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed regulations, FSIS would allow the accumulation of suspect product beyond 20 calendar days only
if the product is intended for further examination by mechanical detection equipment and only when the establishment
has written procedures on file that provide information to assure that the identity, location and security of suspect
product are maintained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, if the Administrator or his/her designee determines that the establishment's written procedures for accumulating
product are unacceptable, FSIS would not permit the establishment to accumulate suspect product beyond 20 calendar
days and would formally notify the establishment in writing of the basis for this decision. The establishment would
then be afforded an opportunity to modify the procedure in accordance with the formal notification by submitting
a written statement in response to the denial notification. The establishment would also be afforded a right to request
a hearing with respect to the merits or validity of the denial. If the establishment requests a hearing and the Administrator
or his/her designee, after review of the answer, determines the initial determination to be correct, he/she would
file the notification, answer and the request for hearing, which shall constitute the complaint and answer in the
proceeding, with the Hearing Clerk of the Department. The proceeding would be conducted in accordance with Rules
of Practice which shall be adopted for this proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the footnotes in &sect;&sect;318.2 and 381.145 of the Federal meat and poultry products inspection
regulation would be revised to reflect that the Agency is authorizing field office personnel to develop sampling
plans for specific products.

Further information concerning sampling plans which have been adopted for specific products may be obtained from
the circuit supervisors of program circuits. These sampling plans are developed for individual products and will
be distributed for field use as they are developed. The type of plan applicable depends on factors such as whether the
product is in containers, stage of preparation, and procedure followed by the establishment operator. The specific
plan applicable depends on the kind of product involved, such as liver, oxtail, etc.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) For up to twenty (20) calendar days, if a product has become soiled or unclean by falling on the floor or in any other
accidental way, an the inspector determines the condition can be corrected, in which case the product shall be cleaned
(including trimming if necessary) or otherwise handled in a manner approved by the inspector to assure that it will
not be adulterated or misbranded and shall then be presented for final reinspection and disposal in accordance with
this section within a period of twenty (20) calendar days, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) When the Regional Director grants prior approval of an establishment's written procedures for storing at the
official establishment product suspected of adulteration with metal, plastic, or other material capable of detection
by the use of approved specialized mechanical detection devices prior to final reinspection. These written procedures
shall describe how the establishment will maintain the identity of the suspect product, where the suspect product
will be stored, how long the product will be stored, and what measures will be taken to secure the product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Approval of an establishment's written procedures for accumulating product will be based on the establishment's
ability to provide the physical space to store the accumulated product and its ability to assure that the identity

for the denial. The establishment will be afforded an opportunity to modify the procedure in accordance with the notification.
The establishment shall be afforded an opportunity to submit a written statement in response to this notification
of denial and a right to request a hearing with respect to the merits or validity of the denial. If the establishment
requests a hearing and the Administrator or his/her designee, after review of the answer, determines the initial
determination to be correct, he/she shall file with the Hearing Clerk of the Department the notification, answer
and the request for hearing, which shall constitute the complaint and answer in the proceeding, which shall hereafter

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Jetstream
Model 4101 airplanes. This proposal would require installation of new fairlead assemblies and P-clips; inspection
to detect damage of the wiring harness at the wing rear spars; repair or replacement of any damaged wiring harness with
a new wiring harness assembly; and verification of the position of the currently installed P-clips, and repositioning,
if necessary. This proposal is prompted by a report of abrasion of an electrical power cable in the wiring harness at
the wing rear spar. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent abrasion of electrical power cables
in the wiring harnesses at the wing rear spars, which could lead to a dormant failure of emergency fuel and hydraulic
shutoff services.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Jetstream Model 4101 airplanes. The CAA advises that the manufacturer
found an abraded electrical power cable in the wiring harness at the wing rear spar on one airplane. The cause of this
abrasion has been attributed to insufficient clearance between the electrical cable loom and the flap mechanism.
Abrasion of these cables, if not corrected, could result in dormant failure of emergency fuel and hydraulic shutoff
services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Jetstream Aircraft Limited has issued Service Bulletin J41&hyph;57&hyph;003, dated October 13, 1993, that describes
procedures for installation of new fairlead assemblies and P-clips; visual inspection to detect damage of the wiring
harnesses at the wing rear spars; verification of the positioning of the currently installed P-clips; and repositioning
of improperly installed P-clips. The CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory in order to assure the continued
airworthiness of these airplanes in the United Kingdom. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require installation of new fairlead assemblies and
P-clips; visual inspection to detect damage of the wiring harnesses at the wing rear spars; verification of the positioning
the of currently installed P-clips, and repositioning improperly installed P-clips. The actions would be required
to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would also require that operators repair or replace damaged wiring harnesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 12 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
2 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required
parts would be provided by the manufacturer at no cost to the operator. Based on these figures, the total cost impact
of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,320, or $110 per airplane. This total cost figure assumes
that no operator has yet accomplished the proposed requirements of this AD action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44FR
11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ``

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The act, as amended by the amendments (Pub. L. 94&hyph;295) and the SMDA (Pub. L. 101&hyph;629), established a comprehensive
system for the regulation of medical devices intended for human use. Section 513 of the act (21 U.S.C. 360c) established
three categories (classes) of devices, depending on the regulatory controls needed to provide reasonable assurance
of their safety and effectiveness. The three categories of devices are: Class I, general controls; class II, special
controls; and class III, premarket approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Devices that were in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 (the amendments) are classified under section 513
of the act after FDA has done the following: (1) Received a recommendation from a device panel (an FDA advisory committee);
(2) published the panel's recommendation for comment, along with a proposed regulation classifying the device;
and (3) published a final regulation classifying the device. A device that is first offered in commercial distribution
after May 28, 1976, and is substantially equivalent to a device classified under this scheme, is also classified into
the same class as the device to which it is substantially equivalent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A device that was not in commercial distribution prior to May 28, 1976, and that is not substantially equivalent to
a preamendments device, is classified by statute into class III without any FDA rulemaking proceedings. The agency
determines whether new devices are substantially equivalent to previously offered devices by means of the premarket
notification procedure in section 510(k) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360(k)) and part 807 of the regulations (21 CFR part
807). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the recommendations of FDA's Dental Device Classification Panel, the agency published a final regulation
classifying 110 preamendments dental devices on August 12, 1987 (52 FR 30082). The TMJ prostheses were inadvertently
omitted from the dental devices considered for reclassification by the panel and the agency. Based upon the recommendations
of the Dental Products Panel, following its April 21, 1989 meeting, FDA proposed on September 18, 1992 (57 FR 43165),
to classify the Interarticular Disc Prosthesis, the Mandibular Condyle Prosthesis, the Glenoid Fossa Prosthesis,
and the Total Temporomandibular Prosthesis into class III. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the April 1989 meeting of the Dental Products Panel, the Panel did not make a recommendation regarding the classification
of the glenoid fossa prosthesis or the mandibular condyle prosthesis. The Panel noted, however, that an implanted
glenoid fossa should not be used with a naturally occurring mandibular condyle, and an implanted mandibular condyle
should not be used with a naturally occurring glenoid fossa. At the February 11, 1993 meeting, the Dental Products
Panel recommended that the mandibular condyle prosthesis and the glenoid fossa prosthesis be classified into class
III. Based upon these recommendations, FDA is reproposing the classification of these two devices into class III.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The effect of classifying a device into class III is to require each manufacturer of the device to submit to FDA a premarket
approval application (PMA) by a date to be set in a future regulation under section 515(b) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360e(b)).
Each application must include sufficient valid scientific evidence to provide reasonable assurance that the device
is safe and effective under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in its proposed labeling.
PMA's for class III preamendments devices must be submitted within 30 months after final classification, or 90 days
after the agency publishes a final regulation under 21 U.S.C. 360e(b) requiring PMA's for the device, whichever is
later. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA advises manufacturers of the devices being classified that, if the devices are classified into class III, the
agency intends to require PMA's to be filed for these devices at the earliest date allowed under the statute. Therefore,
PMA's (or approved investigational device exemptions) would be required for these devices on the last day of the 30th
month following final classification into class III.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Dental Products Panel, an FDA advisory committee, made the following recommendation regarding the classification
of the glenoid fossa prosthesis:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Identification:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A glenoid fossa prosthesis is a device that is intended to be implanted in the temporomandibular joint to augment a
glenoid fossa, and provide an articulation surface for the head of a naturally occurring mandibular condyle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Recommended classification: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Class III (premarket approval). The Dental Products Panel recommended that premarket approval of the glenoid fossa
prosthesis be high priority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Summary of reasons for recommendation:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Dental Products Panel recommended that the glenoid fossa prosthesis be classified into class III because the
Panel believed that premarket approval is necessary to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness
of the device. The Panel also believed that the device presents a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury
to the patient and that insufficient information exists to determine that general controls, either alone or in combination
with the special controls applicable to class II devices, are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of the safety
and effectiveness of the device. Therefore, the device should be subject to premarket approval to ensure that each
manufacturer of this device develop sufficient information to provide reasonable assurance that it is safe and effective.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Summary of data on which the recommendation is based: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Dental Products Panel based its recommendation on the Panel members' personal knowledge of, and clinical experience
with, the device and presentations by Panel members and interested parties (Ref. 1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Risks to health:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The following risks are associated with the glenoid fossa prosthesis: (a) Implant loosening or displacement. The
screws used to anchor the implant may loosen, resulting in implant loosening or displacement causing changes in bite,
difficulty in chewing, limited joint function, and unpredictable wear on implant components (Refs. 2 through 5);
(b) Degenerative changes to the natural articulating surfaces. Implant breakdown may result in erosion or resorption
of the head of the mandibular condyle or the glenoid fossa. The erosion or resorption may result in intense pain, changes
in bite, difficulty in chewing, limited joint function, and perforation into the middle cranial fossa (Refs. 2 through
5); (c) Foreign body reaction. Implant deterioration and migration may result in a foreign body reaction characterized
by multinucleated giant cells (Refs. 2 through 5); (d) Infection. If the implant cannot be properly sterilized, infection
may result; (e) Loss of implant integrity. If the implant materials are unable to withstand mechanical loading, the
implant can be torn, perforated, delaminated, fragmented, fatigued, or fractured, resulting in failure of the device
to function properly (Refs. 2 through 5); (f) Corrosion. If the implant materials are subject to corrosion, toxic
elements may migrate to various parts of the body; (g) Chronic pain. Degenerative changes within the articular surfaces
and components of the temporomandibular joint due to implant breakdown may result in chronic pain (Refs. 2 through
5); (h) Changes to the contralateral joint. Unilateral placement of the implant may result in deleterious effects
to the contralateral joint; and (i) Malocclusion. Placement of the device may produce an improper occlusal relationship.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA agrees with the Dental Products Panel's classification recommendation and is proposing that the glenoid fossa
prosthesis be classified into class III (premarket approval). FDA believes that insufficient information exists
to identify the proper materials or design for the glenoid fossa prosthesis. Therefore, FDA is proposing that premarket
approval of the glenoid fossa prosthesis be given high priority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The act requires the agency to classify into class III a device that presents a potential unreasonable risk of illness
or injury unless it determines that premarket approval is not necessary to provide reasonable assurance of the safety
and effectiveness of the device. FDA believes that the device presents a potential unreasonable risk of illness or
injury to the patient if there are not adequate data to ensure the safe and effective use of the device. The agency believes
that general controls, either alone or in combination with the special controls applicable to class II devices, are
insufficient to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the device.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(e)(2) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.

V. Economic Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has examined the costs and benefits of this proposed rule to classify two TMJ implants into class III in accordance
with Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354). The proposed rule would not
impose any new requirements. Therefore, FDA concludes that the proposed rule is not a significant rule as defined
by Executive Order 12866. In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the agency certifies that the proposed
rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule would revise the conditions for coverage of suppliers of end-stage renal disease services to incorporate
by reference standards for monitoring the quality of water used in dialysis as published by the Association for the
Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) in ``Hemodialysis Systems'' (2nd Edition). It would also update
an existing incorporation by reference to refer to the 1993 edition of AAMI's voluntary guidelines on ``Recommended
Practice for Reuse of Hemodialyzers''. These standards and guidelines contain recognized benchmarks for high quality
dialysis procedures. Section 1881(b)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act authorizes the Secretary to limit Medicare
payment for ESRD services to facilities meeting the requirements prescribed in regulations.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1881 of the Social Security Act (the Act) authorizes Medicare coverage and payment for the treatment of end-stage
renal disease (ESRD) in approved facilities that provide dialysis and transplantation services to ESRD patients.
The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) grants approval of ESRD facilities after a State survey agency determines
that the facility is in compliance with conditions for coverage of suppliers of ESRD services in 42 CFR part 405, subpart
U. Since their initial publication on June 3, 1976 (41 FR 22502), the conditions for coverage have undergone several
revisions as a result of legislation, as well as operating experience, to reflect evolving medical standards and
techniques. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations contain conditions and standards prescribing the services that must be provided and the qualifications
of staff who provide those services. The decision as to whether a facility complies with a particular condition for
coverage depends on the manner and degree to which the supplier satisfies the various standards within each condition.
A supplier is not in compliance if, after completion of a survey, a State survey agency determines that the supplier
fails to comply with one or more of the standards within the conditions for coverage, and the deficiencies are of such
character as to limit substantially the supplier's capacity to furnish adequate care or to affect adversely the health
and safety of patients.

II. Quality of Water Used in Dialysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Our current regulation governing the quality of water used in dialysis at &sect;405.2140(a)(5) requires that water
used for dialysis must be analyzed periodically and treated as necessary to maintain a continuous supply that is biologically
and chemically compatible with acceptable dialysis techniques. Records of test results and equipment maintenance
are maintained at the facility. This standard was developed in 1976 and has never been modified.

State agency surveyors have difficulty measuring facility compliance with the standard due to its lack of specificity.
Surveyors favor a standard that includes specific biological and chemical water purity levels and user monitoring
guidelines that can be applied consistently during each survey. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Water quality is one of the most important aspects of health and safety in dialysis. Contaminants in water used to make
the dialysis solution (dialysate) may cause adverse reactions when they enter the patient's bloodstream. Some chemical
contaminants are not normally harmful when present in usual physiological fluids but can become dangerous if their
concentrations are increased by contaminants in the water used to make dialysate. If water supplies are biologically
or chemically contaminated, such contaminates may be passed into the patient during the dialysis session, leading
to infection or other adverse consequences. Limits on bacterial growth in dialysate are necessary to prevent high
bacterial counts associated with pyrogenic reaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consultation with the Public Health Service and a variety of professionals in the dialysis industry, we have
concluded that establishing specific, measurable standards regarding the quality of water used in dialysis would
better ensure the health and safety of Medicare beneficiaries. We propose to incorporate by reference the water quality
standard approved by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) and published in ``Hemodialysis
Systems'' (2nd edition). According to the Public Health Service's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the
AAMI standard on water quality is the only standard available, is accepted by the medical community, and is already
utilized by most facilities. We assume that using this water quality standard will reduce patient risk. However,
we specifically solicit public comments on the validity of this assumption. We are also seeking comments on the assumption
that the majority of facilities are already using this standard.

III. AAMI Standard on Hemodialysis Systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1992 AAMI standard, ``Hemodialysis Systems,'' reflects the collective expertise of a committee of health care
professionals, in conjunction with device manufacturers and government representatives, to develop a standard
of performance for manufacturers that will, at a minimum, ensure the effective, safe performance of hemodialysis
systems, devices, and related materials. Included in the standard are specific water quality requirements, including
maximum levels of bacteriological and chemical contamination. Additionally, a guideline for the device user, with
specific emphasis on water purity assurance and monitoring, is appended to the standard. The standard is outcome-oriented
in that it stipulates only specific biological and chemical water purity levels and does not restrict the methods
used by facilities to attain and maintain the acceptable levels. We are interested in comments on whether the outcome
measures are appropriate and whether our assumption that most facilities can meet these requirements is reasonable.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each AAMI standard or recommended practice is reviewed at least every 5 years. These reviews are required because
of the constant changes in medical technology and to clarify or improve existing guidelines. The AAMI Renal Disease
and Detoxification Committee initiated a thorough review of the standard ``Hemodialysis Systems'' in 1986, recognizing
that the technology of hemodialysis had changed in a number of respects since the standard was originally published
in 1982. Task groups were established in those areas that the committee felt needed most careful review. As a result
of the work of these task groups and of review by the full committee, a proposed revision of the standard was prepared.
(The allowable levels of chemical contaminants in dialysis water were not changed.) Following committee balloting
and public review, the second edition of ``Hemodialysis Systems'' was approved March 16, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because AAMI guidelines represent medically acceptable standards and techniques developed in collaboration with
health professionals and industry representatives, we believe manufacturers and users already have access to,
and are familiar with, the standard. However, ``Hemodialysis Systems'' (2nd Edition) (ANSI/AAMI RD5) may be purchased
from AAMI, 3300 Washington Boulevard, suite 400, Arlington, Virginia 22201&hyph;4598. Upon final approval of the
incorporation by reference, the publication will be available for inspection at the HCFA Information Resource Center,
6325 Security Boulevard, Room G&hyph;10&hyph;A East High Rise Building, Baltimore, MD or the Office of the Federal
Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We propose to adopt the water quality requirements contained in sections 3.2.1_Water Bacteriology and 3.2.2_Maximum
Level of Chemical Contamination, as well as the guidelines for monitoring water purity contained in sections B1 through
B5 of Appendix B of AAMI's standard ``Hemodialysis Systems''. The requirements of these sections are summarized
below.

Monitoring Purity of Water Used for Hemodialysis

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Appendix B outlines the responsibilities of users of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hemodialysis systems to ensure purity of water used for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hemodialysis. Sections B1 through B5 delineate committee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendations with respect to frequency of monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water used in dialysis to ensure that the maximum levels of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminants specified in section 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeded. These recommendations include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+ The bacteriology of water and dialysate should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sampled at least monthly or more frequently to define, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solve, and control problems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+ The frequency of sampling for chemical contaminants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
varies from 3 months to 12 months depending on the method of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water treatment. Because chemical contamination can vary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
widely from month to month, monthly testing is recommended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initially to develop a data base for determining optimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequency of testing for each facility. When chloramines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are added municipally to the water supply, the water used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepare dialysate should be checked for the presence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chloramines at least once a day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+ Maximum levels of organic chemicals, pesticides, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
herbicides, and radioactive material cannot be specified at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present, therefore, frequency of testing for these materials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cannot be established. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+ Frequency of disinfection of the water treatment and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disinfection system, dialysis machines, and equipment used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to distribute and prepare dialysate should be determined by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the results of microbiological monitoring, by any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements to meet AAMI standards and/or guidelines, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the manufacturer's recommendations.

IV. Reuse of Hemodialyzers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1881(f)(7) of the Act requires the Secretary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish protocols for reuse of hemodialyzers for those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities that voluntarily elect to reuse the filters. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the process of hemodialysis, the patient's blood is cleansed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of impurities by passing the blood through the filter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(hemodialyzer) of a hemodialysis machine. Various 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
techniques exist that allow these filters to be reused. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reuse involves cleaning, disinfecting, and preparing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposable hemodialysis devices for subsequent use for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same patient. Although the potential exists for adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patient outcomes from reuse, reprocessing and reuse of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dialyzers are safe when done properly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 2, 1987, through a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
publication (52 FR 36926), final regulations were issued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifying the performance requirements for reuse of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hemodialyzers and other dialysis supplies (&sect;405.2150). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 405.2150 requires ESRD facilities reusing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hemodialyzers to meet the voluntary guidelines and standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted by AAMI and issued in July 1986 as ``Recommended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Practice for Reuse of Hemodialyzers''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unlike AAMI ``standards'' which are directed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers, ``recommended practices'' are directed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health professionals and provide guidelines for the use, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care, and processing of a medical device or system. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AAMI guidelines on reuse of hemodialyzers are based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
national consensus of physicians, other health care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professionals, government representatives, patients, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry. They describe the details of reprocessing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dialyzers and address various areas such as personnel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualifications and training, patient considerations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment, reprocessing supplies, monitoring during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dialysis, quality assurance, and quality control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the publication of the 1986 edition of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Recommended Practice for Reuse of Hemodialyzers'' and HCFA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adoption of the recommended practice, users of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidelines have asked numerous questions. As a result of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the AAMI review of the 1986 guidelines, the Hemodialyzer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reuse Subcommittee of the AAMI Renal Disease and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Detoxification Committee developed a 1993 edition. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subcommittee consists of representatives from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturing, governmental (including HCFA), physician, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dialysis facility, and patient consumer communities.

The preliminary revisions underwent concurrent public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review and committee balloting which lasted 2 months. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final revisions also underwent public review and committee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
balloting and were approved May 3, 1993. A quorum of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two-thirds of the subcommittee was necessary to vote the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document's approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The announcement of the 1993 edition of ``Recommended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Practice for Reuse of Hemodialyzers'' was made in the ``AAMI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
News'', the ``American National Standards Institute Reporter'', 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and in press releases to 500 trade journals. The 1993 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
edition (ANSI/AAMI RD47) may be purchased from AAMI, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3300 Washington Boulevard, suite 400, Arlington, Virginia 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22201&hyph;4598. Upon final approval of the incorporation by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference, the 1993 edition will be available for inspection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the HCFA Information Resource Center, 6325 Security 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1993 edition is directed to the physician in charge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of hemodialyzer reprocessing by either the manual or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automated method and describes the essential elements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
good practices for reprocessing dialyzers to help assure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device safety and effectiveness. Some of the salient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes included in the document are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;New Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(OSHA) recommended environmental exposure limits of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a proposed rule would not have a significant economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact on a substantial number of small entities. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes of the RFA, all ESRD facilities are considered to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a proposed rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may have a significant impact on the operations of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12866 this proposed rule was reviewed by the Office of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management and Budget. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

B. Water Quality Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would incorporate into regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing industry standards on the quality of water used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dialysis to enable surveyors to accurately assess a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility's compliance with the standard on water quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AAMI standards are the result of a collaborative effort 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by health professionals and industry representatives to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respond to clinical needs and to help ensure patient health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and safety. It is our understanding that AAMI's recommended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum levels for water contaminants have been clearly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined and supported by scientific literature and developed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through industry consensus. Under the AAMI water standard, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the supplier/manufacturer of dialysis water treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment is responsible for assuring that the water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produced by the system routinely does not exceed the maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowable chemical contaminant levels. Because AAMI's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable contamination levels have been in effect since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1982 and are recognized as medically acceptable standards, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we believe that manufacturers have been producing, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities purchasing, equipment capable of meeting these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. We understand that technology is in place for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all facilities to meet the AAMI water standard and solicit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments on this understanding. While variations in water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality do typically occur, any changes that occur will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handled through consultation with State and local water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorities and safe purity levels ensured through continued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring by the physician in charge of dialysis. Although 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminants in water used in dialysate may cause adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patient reactions, actual documented adverse incidents are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rare when water is monitored properly. Because the AAMI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water quality standard represents long-standing acceptable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medical practice, we believe the vast majority of facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
already comply with this standard. Incorporation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AAMI standard into regulations will help ensure patient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health and safety by providing surveyors with a measurable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard with which they may assess facility compliance, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
especially in the few facilities that do not voluntarily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conform to the water quality guidelines adopted by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Reuse of Hemodialyzers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The AAMI ``Recommended Practice on Reuse'' does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promote either single use or reuse of dialyzers. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidelines were developed to acknowledge the widespread 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practice of reprocessing and provide recommendations for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
optimal hemodialyzer reprocessing. In January 1993, HCFA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Health Standard and Quality Bureau canvassed the 2,345 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare certified ESRD facilities to determine if they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practiced reuse, and if so, the disinfecting protocols used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sixty-five percent (1,532) of the facilities reported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practicing reuse. Of these facilities, approximately 51 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent use renalin as the germicide, with two-thirds of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these facilities using an automated disinfecting system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approximately 40 percent of the facilities reported using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formalin/formaldehyde as the germicide, with manual and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automated systems receiving equal use. Approximately 9 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of the facilities practicing reuse reported using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
glutaraldehyde as the germicide, with the majority of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities using an automated disinfecting system. Less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 1 percent of the facilities use other disinfecting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the 1993 AAMI guidelines do not differ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significantly from the 1986 guidelines (which all Medicare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participating facilities practicing reuse already must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet), we believe that the great majority of the facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practicing reuse would be in compliance with the new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards proposed in this regulation. The 1993 AAMI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards were developed through a public forum and their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adoption was well publicized. They reflect the most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
up-to-date reuse procedures already practiced by many of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities, and we do not believe that incorporating the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993 guidelines into our regulations, in and of itself, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would prompt any facility to begin or discontinue reuse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We expect that each facility would respond to these new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards based on the relationship of these standards to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its current reuse practices and to factors such as whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or not a facility presently meets the standards or can meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them without extensive changes, and whether or not the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility can buy new filters in quantity less expensively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than it can upgrade its reuse practices. As we said above, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
65 percent of the facilities are already reusing dialyzers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The major effect of this proposed rule would be to assure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that Medicare standards for reuse reflect safe and effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because we are unable to predict the decisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities would make in response to this regulation, we are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unable to quantify the potential effect it would have. Some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beneficiaries may be reassured that HCFA has adopted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific water quality standards and updated its standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for reuse of hemodialyzers to ensure their health and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety. However, we expect that there would be a negligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect on most beneficiaries and facilities since we believe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these revisions would make no major changes in current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility operation or patient experience. This proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule is not expected to result directly in any increases or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reductions in Medicare program expenditures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, we have determined, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary certifies that this proposed rule would not have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities and would not have a significant economic impact on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the operations of a substantial number of small rural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospitals. Therefore, we are not preparing analyses for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either the RFA or section 1102(b) of the Act.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is proposing to amend the VA Acquisition Regulation (VAAR) to increase the
amount which property holders and management brokers may spend for emergency property repairs. Advance blanket
authorization to management brokers is also being increased. Additionally, the dollar amount that Regional Office
Directors, Loan Guaranty Officers, and Assistant Loan Guaranty Officers are authorized to approve for the repair
of VA property, acquired under Chapter 37, Title 38, United States Code, is being increased to conform with the current
statutory authority.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Purchase of supplies and services for the repair to any VA property is authorized by Chapter 37, Title 38, United States
Code (U.S.C.). The dollar limit for management brokers' blanket advance authority to incur routine charges in connection
with the management of properties acquired by VA under Chapter 37, Title 38, U.S.C., was increased from $75 to $200
in 1981. Since that time, costs associated with services for which management brokers routinely incur expenses have
increased. Because of this, an increase to $500 is being implemented for both the management brokers' blanket authority
to incur expenses and the property holders' emergency repair threshold. Also, because of the increased costs of repairs,
Regional Office Directors, Loan Guaranty Officers, and Assistant Loan Guaranty Officers are authorized to approve
repair programs, (i.e., the aggregate amount of the proposed contracts to purchase supplies and services as contemplated
in a property analysis by the Loan Guaranty activity), where the estimated cost does not exceed $25,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These changes will further promote the efficient management of VA's acquired property inventory. Additionally,
VAAR Sections 871.103 and 871.106 are being removed because they are duplicative of the Federal Acquisition Regulation
(FAR). Technical amendments are being made to reflect the current organizational titles.

II. Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary certifies that this change will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. The increase in the amount
for routine charges or emergency repairs in connection with the management of properties will reduce the economic
burden placed on management brokers or property holders by reducing the administrative approval process. The remaining
proposed changes are VA internal procedures and will not directly affect any small entity.
