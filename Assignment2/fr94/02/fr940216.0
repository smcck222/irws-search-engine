 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
I. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In a notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of August 11, 1992 (57 FR 35833), FDA announced that a color additive petition (CAP 6C0203) had been filed by CTFA, 1101
17th St. NW., suite 300, Washington, DC 20036, proposing that the color additive regulations for FD&amp;C Red No.
40 be amended to provide for the safe use of FD&amp;C Red No. 40 and its lakes for coloring drugs and cosmetics intended
for use in the area of the eye. The petition was filed under section 721 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21
U.S.C. 379e). CTFA later amended the petition to limit the lakes requested for eye area use to the FD&amp;C Aluminum
Lake prepared in accordance with &sect;82.51 (21 CFR 82.51).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Definitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 70.3(s) (21 CFR 70.3(s)) defines the term ``area of the eye'' as ``the area enclosed within the circumference
of the supra-orbital ridge and the infra-orbital ridge, including the eyebrow, the skin below the eyebrow, the eyelids
and the eyelashes, and conjunctival sac of the eye, the eyeball, and the soft areolar tissue that lies within the perimeter
of the infra-orbital ridge.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``lake'' is defined in &sect;70.3(l) as ``a straight color extended on a substratum by adsorption, coprecipitation,
or chemical combination that does not include any combination of ingredients made by simple mixing process.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 70.5(a) (21 CFR 70.5(a)) states that ``No listing or certification of a color additive shall be considered
to authorize the use of any such color additive in any article intended for use in the area of the eye unless such listing
or certification of such color additive specifically provides for such use.'' The petitioner has requested that
FD&amp;C Red No. 40 and FD&amp;C Red No. 40 Aluminum Lake be listed for use in the area of the eye.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 82 (21 CFR part 82) lists the certifiable provisionally listed colors and specifications, and includes a description
of and specifications for the lakes that are permitted for use in foods (&sect;82.51) and in drugs and cosmetics (&sect;82.1051).
Sections 82.51 and 82.1051 list the acceptable lakes that can be combined with the straight colors listed therein.
The petitioner has requested that this order be limited to the Aluminum Lake of FD&amp;C Red No. 40, prepared in accordance
with &sect;82.51. Section 82.51 also limits to alumina the substrata that can be used for FD&amp;C lakes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Safety
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its evaluation of the safety of the proposed use of the subject color additive, FDA has considered the safety data
submitted to support current listings for the use of FD&amp;C Red No. 40 in foods, drugs, and cosmetics. FDA has also
evaluated ocular toxicity studies submitted to support eye area use of the color additive and its aluminum lake. The
agency has determined that the petitioned use is safe because no adverse effects were found in these studies at levels
relevant to the petitioned use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Conclusions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on data contained in the petition and other relevant information, FDA concludes that there is a reasonable certainty
that no harm will result from the use of FD&amp;C Red No. 40 and FD&amp;C Red No. 40 Aluminum Lake as color additives in
the area of the eye, and that the additives are safe for their intended use. The agency also concludes on the basis of
available data that the color additive will perform its intended effect and thus is suitable for the petitioned uses.
The agency, therefore, is amending the color additive regulations in &sect;&sect;74.1340(b) and 74.2340(b) (21
CFR 74.1340(b) and 74.2340(b)) to provide for the use of FD&amp;C Red No. 40 and FD&amp;C Red No. 40 Aluminum Lake in
drugs and cosmetics intended for use in the area of the eye. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This document provides for the permanent listing of the aluminum lake of FD&amp;C Red No. 40 for use in the area of the
eye. Other uses of the lakes of FD&amp;C Red No. 40 are already permanently listed under &sect;&sect;74.1340 and 74.2340.
The agency notes that &sect;&sect;74.1340(a)(3) and 74.2340(a)(2) refer to &sect;&sect;82.51 and 82.1051 for
the manufacturing process and specifications for the lakes of FD&amp;C Red No. 40. While the agency recognizes that
this referral is to a section that is designated as provisional, FDA considers this referral to be appropriate because
that section defines current good manufacturing practice and provides appropriate specifications to ensure the
quality and purity of lakes made with the color additive. The agency has under consideration an action to permanently
list all lakes that have been provisionally listed under parts 81 and 82. When that action is completed, FDA intends
to amend this referral as appropriate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Inspection of Documents
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with &sect;71.15 (21 CFR 71.15), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied upon
in reaching its decision to list the petitioned uses are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition (address above) by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided
in &sect;71.15, the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure
before making the documents available for inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VII. Environmental Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VIII. Objections
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at any time on or before March 18, 1994, file with the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separately numbered,
and each numbered objection shall specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation to which objection
is made and the grounds for the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requested shall specifically
so state. Failure to request a hearing for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing
on that objection. Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall include a detailed description
and analysis of the specific factual information intended to be presented in support of the objection in the event
that a hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis for any particular objection shall constitute
a waiver of the right to a hearing on the objection. Three copies of all documents shall be submitted and shall be identified
with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Any objections received in response to the
regulation may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. FDA will publish
notice of the objections that the agency has received or lack thereof in the

of the infra-orbital ridge.'' The term ``lake'' is defined in &sect;70.3(l) as ``straight color extended on a substratum
by adsorption, coprecipitation, or chemical combination that does not include any combination of ingredients made
by simple mixing process.''

III. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 70.5(a) (21 CFR 70.5(a)) states that ``No listing or certification of a color additive shall be considered
to authorize the use of any such color additive in any article intended for use in the area of the eye unless such listing
or certification of such color additive specifically provides for such use.'' The regulations, in &sect;81.1 (21
CFR 81.1), state that the color additive lakes listed therein may not be used in products that are intended to be used
in the area of the eye. The petitioner has requested that the uses for FD&amp;C Blue No. 1 and FD&amp;C Blue No. 1 Aluminum
Lake be expanded to include uses in the area of the eye.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 82 (21 CFR part 82) lists the certified provisionally listed colors and specifications and includes a description
of, and specifications for, the lakes that are permitted for use in foods (&sect;82.51) and in drugs and cosmetics
(&sect;82.1051). Sections 82.51 and 82.1051 list the acceptable lakes that can be combined with the straight colors
listed therein. The petitioner has requested that this order be limited to the Aluminum Lake of FD&amp;C Blue No. 1,
prepared in accordance with &sect;82.51. Section 82.51 also limits the substrata that can be used for FD&amp;C lakes
to alumina.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Safety
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its evaluation of the safety of the proposed use of the subject color additive, FDA has considered the safety data
submitted previously to support current listings for the use of FD&amp;C Blue No. 1 in foods, drugs, and cosmetics.
FDA also evaluated ocular toxicity studies submitted to support eye area use of the color additive and its aluminum
lake. FDA has determined that the petitioned use is safe, because no adverse effects were found in these studies at
levels relevant to the petitioned use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Conclusions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on data contained in the petition and other relevant material, FDA concludes that there is a reasonable certainty
that no harm will result from the use of FD&amp;C Blue No. 1 and FD&amp;C Blue No. 1 Aluminum Lake as color additives in
the area of the eye, and that the additives are safe for their intended use. The agency also concludes on the basis of
available data that the color additive will perform its intended effect and thus is suitable for the petitioned uses.
The agency, therefore, is amending the color additive regulations in &sect;&sect;74.1101(c) and 74.2101(c) (21
CFR 74.1101(c) and 74.2101(c)) to provide for the use of FD&amp;C Blue No. 1 and FD&amp;C Blue No. 1 Aluminum Lake in
drugs and cosmetics, respectively, intended for use in the area of the eye. This document provides for the permanent
listing of the aluminum lake of FD&amp;C Blue No. 1 for use in the area of the eye. Other uses of the lakes of FD&amp;C Blue
No. 1 are provisionally listed under &sect;&sect;81.1, 82.51, 82.101, and 82.1051. The agency notes that &sect;&sect;74.1101(b)(2)
and 74.2101(b)(2) refer to &sect;&sect;82.51 and 82.1051 for the manufacturing process and specifications for
the lakes of FD&amp;C Blue No. 1. While the agency recognizes that this referral is to a section that is designated as
provisional, FDA considers this referral to be appropriate because that section defines current good manufacturing
practice and provides appropriate specifications to ensure the quality and purity of lakes made with the color additive.
The agency has under consideration an action to permanently list all lakes that have been provisionally listed under
parts 81 and 82. When that action is completed, FDA intends to amend this referral as appropriate.

VI. Inspection of Documents
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with &sect;71.15 (21 CFR 71.15), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied upon
in reaching its decision to list the petitioned uses are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition (address above) by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided
in &sect;71.15, the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure
before making the documents available for inspection.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VII. Environmental Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VIII. Objections
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at any time on or before March 18, 1994, file with the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separately numbered,
and each numbered objection shall specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation to which objection
is made and the grounds for the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requested shall specifically
so state. Failure to request a hearing for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing
on that objection. Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall include a detailed description
and analysis of the specific factual information intended to be presented in support of the objection in the event
that a hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis for any particular objection shall constitute
a waiver of the right to a hearing on the objection. Three copies of all documents shall be submitted and shall be identified
with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Any objections received in response to the
regulation may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. FDA will publish
notice of the objections that the agency has received or lack thereof in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this document is to correct editorial errors contained in the May 27, 1993 interim rule. The following
provides a summary of the corrections that are being made by this document.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Corrections 1 and 2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 106(j) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992)
made operation of a local FSS program optional for Indian housing authorities (IHAs) for the Indian housing program.
For the Indian housing program, the FSS rule provides that IHAs that elect to operate local FSS programs are not subject
to minimum program size requirements as are housing agencies (HAs) other than IHAs. Note that the part 962 regulations,
which are the regulations applicable to the public housing FSS program, contain a section concerning minimum program
size requirements_24 CFR 962.105 (Minimum program size). (See table of sections at 58 FR 30889.) No comparable section,
however, is contained in the Indian housing FSS regulations. (See table of sections at 58 FR 30883).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two provisions in the Indian housing FSS regulations inadvertently make reference to minimum program size requirements_paragraph
(a)(2) in &sect;905.3020 (Program implementation) and &sect;905.3021 (Administrative fees). (See 58 FR 30887,
first column for both citations.) The last sentence of paragraph (a)(1) of &sect;905.3020 also uses the phrase ``families

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
required 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to be served'' (emphasis added) which indicates that IHAs are subject to minimum program size requirements. Accordingly,
the reference to minimum program size requirements in these two sections is incorrect, and is removed by this notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, &sect;905.3021 (Administrative fees) also contains a missing word. This section provides that the
performance funding system (PFS) shall provide for the inclusion of ``reasonable and administrative costs.'' The
correct phrase should be ``reasonable and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
eligible 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
administrative costs.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Corrections 3, 10 and 19. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In each of the three FSS rules (the Indian housing FSS rule, the public housing FSS rule, and the section 8 FSS rule),
the phrase, ``without good cause,'' should have been inserted where the rule discusses termination of the FSS contract
of participation on the basis of the family's failure to comply with the contract terms. Accordingly, this phrase
is added to &sect;905.3022 (b)(5) and (h)(2), &sect;962.303 (b)(5) and (h)(2), and &sect;984.303 (b)(5) and (i).
(See, respectively, 58 FR 30887 (second column), 30894 (first column), and 30900 (third column)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to inserting the phrase ``without good cause'' in &sect;984.303(b)(5), the word ``without'' in paragraph
(b)(5)(i) of this section should be ``withhold.'' (See 58 FR 30900).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Correction 4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;905.3024(b) (Total tenant payment and increases in family income), the second ``or'' should be ``for.''

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking has not been published for this regulation and good
cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking
procedures would have been impracticable. Specifically, severe weather conditions have developed hazardous icing
conditions and insufficient time exists to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking. The Coast Guard deems it to be
in the public's best interest to issue a regulation now as the conditions are presenting immediate hazards.

Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The hazards associated with icing conditions require immediate response to insure safe navigation and to prevent
tank barge hull failure. Recent surveys of the regulated area by industry and Coast Guard representatives has established
the need to impose restrictions.

Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This regulation is not considered a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not significant
under Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979), it will
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, and it contains no collection of
information requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard expects the impact of this regulation to be so minimal that a Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary.
The imposed restrictions are anticipated to be of short duration. To avoid any unnecessary adverse economic impact
on businesses which use the river for commercial purposes, Captain of the Port, St. Louis, Missouri will monitor the
situation and will authorize entry into the closed area as conditions warrant. Changes will be announced by Marine
Safety Information Radio Broadcast on VHF Marine Band Radio, Channel 22 (157.1 MHZ). Mariners may also call the Port
Operations Officer, Captain of the Port, St. Louis, Missouri at (314) 539&hyph;3823 for current information.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under the principles and criteria of Executive Order 12612, this regulation does not raise sufficient federalism
implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

Environmental Assessment

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.g.[5]
of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation
as an action to protect public safety.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule was published on an interim final basis on January 9, 1991 (56 FR 876), effective on that date, to allow immediate
repossession of adopted wild free-roaming horses and burros and cancellation of Private Maintenance and Care Agreements
(PMACAs) in cases where abuse or neglect are found to endanger the life or health of adopted animals. Horses and burros
for which title has been passed to private individuals do not qualify as ``wild free-roaming horses and burros'' pursuant
to 16 U.S.C. 1333, and, therefore, will not be affected by this rule. The interim final rule allowed 60 days for public
comment. One public comment was received. This comment supported the interim final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, the interim final rule is now adopted and published in final form. The wording of the interim final rule
has been modified somewhat to ensure consistency with the Departmentwide full force and effect rule located at 43
CFR 4.21, which was issued in final form on January 19, 1993, after the publication of the interim final wild horse and
burro rule. These technical amendments are needed to make 43 CFR part 4700 consistent with the Departmentwide full
force and effect rule. The rule does not in any way limit the right of appeal of persons whose PMACAs are revoked, and
allows such persons to petition for a stay of such decisions. It merely allows animals to be repossessed for their protection
until issues raised on appeal can be considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical amendments to paragraph (c) of &sect;4770.3 are also being made in this final rule to reflect the amendment
of the Departmentwide full force and effect rule. Paragraph (c) was added to &sect;4770.3 on July 6, 1992, to allow
the authorized officer to place wild horse and burro removal decisions in full force and effect. The technical amendments
to paragraph (c) are being made in this final rule to provide consistent wording within &sect;4770.3, and to make the
provisions of &sect;4770.3 consistent with the procedural requirements of 43 CFR 4.21. The amendments will not affect
the way in which the substance of paragraph (c) is implemented. Paragraph (c) of this section was not included in the
interim final rule published January 9, 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The principal author of this final rule is Vernon R. Schulze, Wild Horse and Burro Program Specialist, assisted by
the staff of the Division of Legislation and Regulatory Management, BLM Washington Office. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been determined that this rule does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality
of the human environment and that no detailed statement pursuant to Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of the Interior has determined under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) that this rule will not have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Additionally,
as required by Executive Order 12630, the Department has determined that the rule would not cause a taking of private
property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This document amends labeling and other requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 213, ``Child Restraint
Systems,'' for rear-facing infant restraint systems. The amendments made by this document were proposed in a notice
of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) published on April 16, 1993 (58 FR 19792). Rear-facing restraints are currently required
by Standard 213 to be labeled with warnings and other information about their proper use (S5.5.1 and S5.52). This rule
requires that the warning label for rear-facing restraints include a warning against using the restraint in any vehicle
seating position equipped with an air bag. This document also requires that printed instructions for these seats
include safety information about air bags.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
``Rear-facing infant restraint system,'' as used in this document, refers to an infant restraint system (except
a car bed) which is positioned in a vehicle so that the restrained infant faces the rear of the vehicle. In a frontal crash,
the crash forces are spread evenly across the infant's back and shoulders, the strongest part of an infant's body.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the rear-facing infant restraint is placed on a vehicle seat, the restraint's seat back projects forward, far
in front of the vehicle seat back. If the vehicle seating position is a front passenger one equipped with an air bag,
the forward-projecting seat back of the infant restraint may rest on or be located close to the part of the vehicle instrument
panel containing the air bag.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Placing a rear-facing restraint on such a vehicle seat raises a safety concern of the interaction between those restraints
and air bags. An air bag must inflate quickly to create a protective cushion that protects occupants during frontal
crashes. The quickly deploying air bag might injure an infant when it strikes the seat back of a rear-facing infant
restraint.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Fall of 1991, the agency evaluated air bag/infant restraint interactions by conducting 30 mph dynamic sled
tests with top and mid-mounted air bags. (The data from these tests are available in Docket No. 74&hyph;09, General
Reference.) NHTSA's findings from these tests indicate that air bags generally produce substantial increases in
the values for the head injury criterion (HIC) and chest acceleration of dummies seated in rear-facing restraints,
compared to the values for dummies in rear-facing restraints tested with no air bag.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To reduce the likelihood that an infant restraint would be placed in a vehicle seating position that has an air bag,
the agency is requiring each infant restraint to be labeled with a warning against such use. The warning must state
either:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Warning: When your baby's size requires that this restraint be used so that your baby faces the rear of the vehicle,
place the restraint in a vehicle seat that does not have an air bag.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
or
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Warning: Place this restraint in a vehicle seat that does not have an air bag.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The former warning is used for convertible infant seats, i.e., seats that can use rear-facing for infants and forward-facing
for older children. The latter is for seats that can be used only rear-facing for infants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The warning must be labeled on a red, orange or yellow background and be visible to a person installing the restraint.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA is also requiring that infant restraint manufacturers provide information on the air bag/infant restraint
interaction issue in their printed instructions accompanying the infant restraint. The manufacturers must provide
a warning against using rear-facing restraints in seating positions equipped with air bags, and explain the reasons
for, and consequences of, not following the warning.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has already required vehicle manufacturers to provide warnings and information about the interaction of air
bags and rear-facing infant restraints. This information must be placed on the sun visors in vehicles with air bags
and provided in the vehicle owner's manual. (This requirement is included in the rule implementing the provision
in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act requiring the agency to mandate air bags at all front outboard
seating positions in passenger cars, and in light trucks and multipurpose vehicles. 58 FR 46551, September 1, 1993.)
Today's rule supplements that requirement to increase the likelihood that parents will be made aware of the possible
effect of a deploying air bag on an infant restraint. Further, when the vehicle itself is labeled, parents will be provided
the safety information even if the infant restraint they are using lacks the label required by today's final rule (which
could happen if the infant restraint were manufactured before the effective date of today's rule).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements adopted in today's document are substantially similar to those NHTSA proposed in the April 1993

With the goal of having the warning be conspicuous, NHTSA proposed that the message be on a yellow background, and be
visible when the restraint is installed rear-facing in the vehicle. The agency requested comments on whether the
message should be required to be visible to a person in the driver's seat when the restraint is so installed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency received 16 comments on the NPRM. Commenters included child seat manufacturers (Century, Fisher Price,
Cosco), vehicle manufacturers (Volkswagen, Ford), state safety agencies (Michigan, New York), the National Transportation
Safety Board (NTSB), the American Academy of Pediatrics, consumer groups (SafetyBeltSafe, Advocates for Highway
and Auto Safety), business groups (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, National Automobile Dealers Association),
and private individuals. All the commenters generally supported the NPRM; several had suggested changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of the comments related to issues about the wording of the label. Comments were also received on the label's conspicuity,
and on the proposal that child seat manufacturers provide information about air bags in the consumer instructions
accompanying each restraint. In addition, some commenters were concerned about the possible effect of the labeling
and informational requirements on the possible development of infant restraints that can be safely used in an air
bag-equipped vehicle seating position.

Wording of the Label
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters addressed various issues about the wording of the warning label.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One issue is whether specific wording should be mandated. The proposed regulatory text contained the exact wording
of the label. Like the other safety warnings required by Standard 213, the air bag/infant restraint warning would
have to be printed word for word as set forth in the standard. Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety (Advocates) believed
the exact wording should be specified. ``It would not be appropriate to leave the wording of a safety warning label,
which must be concise, clear, accurate, and uniform, to manufacturer discretion.'' Commenters such as the American
Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), Jerome Koziatek and Robert Potter, Jr. conferred that the wording should be mandated,
and suggested changes to the wording to improve it. Ford opposed mandating the wording, believing that the prescribed
wording may limit the flexibility of manufacturers, especially if it became possible for a child seat manufacturer
to recommend use of an infant restraint in an air bag-equipped seating position under certain circumstances. (This
issue of the future development of infant restraints is further discussed below.) Ford stated that the wording currently
specified in Standard 213 ``can be altered as needed.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The specific wording of the safety warnings currently required by Standard 213 to be marked on a child seat is mandated.
Notwithstanding Ford, all other commenters appeared to understand that the wording of the air bag warning must appear
on the restraint as stated in the standard. It is for that reason that comments were requested and submitted on the efficacy
and appropriateness of the wording. NHTSA has decided to mandate the wording of the new air bag warning for the reasons
explained in the NPRM. Those reasons are consistent with Advocates' view, quoted above, that the wording must be carefully
crafted so as to reduce as much as possible the possibility that the warning is misunderstood. As explained in the NPRM:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[T]he message should be brief, alerting consumers to and reminding them about a safety concern without causing ``information
overload.'' The message also should not inadvertently induce the consumer to misuse a restraint, such as might happen
if the message were so loosely worded that consumers might conclude they could avoid the problem by simply turning
the restraint around so that the child is forward-facing when the restraint is used in an air bag equipped seating position.
The message also should be conspicuous.

To further clarify Standard 213's labeling requirements for Ford, NHTSA notes that the safety warnings required
by the standard may not be ``altered as needed'' by a manufacturer. If a manufacturer believes the wording should be
altered, it must submit a petition for rulemaking to change the requirements in Standard 213.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Cosco expressed concern that Standard 213 already requires too many warnings, and that another warning would compound
the complexity and confusion of the labeling. That child seat manufacturer is concerned that consumers may not pay
attention to or understand the warnings because there are simply too many warnings. Cosco suggested that NHTSA review
the labeling required by the standard and possibly condense some of the required information. Fisher-Price also
suggested that NHTSA undertake a ``complete reconsideration'' of Standard 213's labeling requirements, ``to assure
that on-seat markings are not rendered ineffectual because of the excess of required information.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA agrees that a significant amount of information is required to be labeled on an infant restraint, and is willing
to consider, in a future rulemaking, suggestions for ways in which the information could be edited or condensed. The
agency believes that the air bag warning is needed now notwithstanding that it will be another item of information
that competes for the attention of the consumer. However, the agency will review Standard 213's labeling requirements
as Cosco and Fisher-Price suggested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters were divided on whether the proposed wording was sufficiently clear. SafetyBeltSafe and the IIHS believed
the statements were clear; however, some other commenters believed the clarity of the wording could be improved.
The AAP believed that, in response to the proposed wording for convertible seats, some consumers might mistakenly
turn the restraint so that the infant is forward-facing in an air bag position. AAP suggested that the warning should
be clearer that an infant restraint must be used rear-facing, regardless of the presence of an air bag. To accomplish
this, AAP suggested that the warning include the statement, ``When your baby's size requires that this restraint
be used in a rear-facing position *&blank;*&blank;*'' as a condition precedent for the warning not to use the restraint
in an air-bag equipped seating position. NHTSA agrees the wording should refer to the baby's size and has made appropriate
changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters objected to certain words in the proposed warning. AAP suggested the word ``position'' should be
used instead of ``mode'' in the term ``rear-facing mode,'' since the former word is more commonly recognized than
the latter. Cosco said that adding ``mode'' following ``rear-facing'' is unnecessary. NHTSA has removed ``mode''
from the wording. Cosco also suggested the references to ``front seat'' or ``passenger side'' in ``passenger side
air bag'' are unnecessary, since they do not add any relevant information. The agency agrees. Mr. Koziatek suggested
the label should direct the consumer to ``secure'' the restraint instead of ``place'' it on the vehicle seat, to increase
the likelihood that the restraint will be fastened to the seat. NHTSA declines to make the change, because ``secure''
might distract a consumer from the purpose of the air bag warning.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some comments suggested adding more text to the warning label. Mr. Koziatek recommended that the label include a statement
directing the consumer to check the vehicle owner's manual for information about where the infant restraint should
be placed in the vehicle. The statement is not needed on the label. Child seat labels already must refer consumers to
the printed instructions for information on securing the child seat to the vehicle (S5.5.2(g)). Also, NHTSA is requiring
the printed instructions for child seats to include a statement that owners of vehicles with passenger side air bags
should refer to their vehicle owner's manual for child seat installation instructions. Moreover, NHTSA's September
1993 rule mandating air bags in passenger vehicles will require the sun visor on vehicles with passenger side air bags
to be labeled with a statement referring the consumer to the vehicle owner's manual for information about the warning
not to use a rear-facing infant restraint in a vehicle seating position equipped with an air bag. Placing the same information
on the child seat would be redundant, and would further crowd the child seat label.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other suggestions were made for adding additional text to the warning label. Mr. Potter believed a statement describing
the possible consequences of not following the warning is needed, such as by referring to the possibility of ``serious
injury or death.'' NHTSA disagrees, since this rule already requires the use instructions to contain information
on the consequences of not following the warning. SafetyBeltSafe suggested that the label should include a warning
in Spanish. NHTSA is not requiring the bilingual labeling for the reasons discussed at 55 FR 48262 (denial of Mattox
petition to require Spanish installation instructions, November 20, 1990). Thus, the standard requires manufacturers
to supply the information in English. However, once this requirement is met, manufacturers may supply the same information
in other languages, so long as the presence or location of the translation does not confuse consumers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters responded to the agency's request for comments on the merits of requiring a symbol (or graphic)
warning about using rear-facing restraints with an air bag. New York's Department of Motor Vehicles supported the
use of a symbol because ``a symbol would assist adults who are reading disabled or who speak a foreign language.'' The
AAP believed it would be desirable to have a symbol of a child restraint on the vehicle dashboard, ``if a non-confusing
symbol can be designed.'' Century commented that a symbol can increase the effectiveness of the warning label ``as
long as it adequately identifies and warns of the hazard.'' Cosco expressed reservations about requiring a symbol.
That commenter believed a symbol would draw an excessive amount of attention to the issue of the air bag's possible
effect on a rear-facing restraint ``over others that may be as bad or worse,'' such as, Cosco believes, the incompatibility
of vehicle belts with certain child seats. Cosco also stated that the effectiveness of a symbol depends on the ability
of the consumer to recognize it. ``If NHTSA requires such a symbol, it should be prepared to publicize it.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has decided not to require use of a symbol. Had it been required, the symbol would have been in addition to
the words. NHTSA believes that the words will draw sufficient attention to the label, especially since the warning
will be subject to the conspicuity requirements discussed in the next section. In response to New York's comment that
a symbol would assist adults who are reading disabled or who speak a foreign language, the agency is concerned that
there is no universally recognized symbol for effectively communicating the warning at this time. The lack of such
familiarity with a symbol would reduce the symbol's effectiveness and could cause confusion.

Conspicuity of the Label
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The conspicuity of the label is ensured by requirements concerning its location, color and font style.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The aspect of promoting the conspicuity of the label that engendered the most comments was the location of the warning
label, i.e., whether the message should be required to be visible to a person in the driver's seat if the restraint were
installed rear-facing in the front outboard passenger seating position. Seven commenters responded to this issue.
The IIHS concurred that the label should be visible to the driver. Century, Advocates, SafetyBeltSafe, Fisher-Price,
and the AAP objected to the driver's side approach. These commenters believed locating the label so that it is visible
to the driver reduces the effectiveness of the warning, since the warning would be readable only when the restraint
is improperly installed. The commenters believed a driver noticing the label on an improperly installed restraint
would be unlikely to take the time to exit the vehicle and move the restraint to the rear seat of the vehicle. Mr. Potter
suggested the label should be placed on the shoulder harness/webbing of the restraint.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA agrees that the warning should be visible to the installer while the restraint is being installed. The agency
thinks that there is merit in the commenters' belief that a driver who noticed the warning could be reluctant to stop
the vehicle to move a rear-facing infant restraint to the vehicle's rear seat after the infant restraint is installed.
Further, the driver would already have been provided a warning as a result of the September 1993 rule mandating air
bags in passenger vehicles. The rule requires the driver's side sun visor on vehicles with passenger side air bags
to be labeled with a warning against using rear-facing child restraints with the passenger side air bag. Accordingly,
NHTSA is requiring that the warning on the child restraint be visible to a person who is standing adjacent to the front
outboard passenger seat of a vehicle and installing the rear-facing infant restraint system in that seat.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirement concerning the color of the contrasting background for the warning has been changed from the proposal
in response to a comment from Ford. Ford suggested that red and orange be permitted in addition to yellow. NHTSA is permitting
those similarly bright and attention-attracting colors. Ford also suggested that the color be required only for
the word ``WARNING'' at the beginning of the required statement, instead of the entire statement. NHTSA is requiring
the entire statement to be printed against the color contrasting background to maximize the conspicuity of the warning.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Volkswagen objected to the requirement that the letters be capitalized, stating that manufacturers should be allowed
to decide on the print format. NHTSA disagrees. Standard 213 requires important safety messages on the proper use
of child restraints to be capitalized. These include a warning that the consequences of failing to follow the manufacturer's
use instructions can result in the child striking the vehicle's interior in a crash (S5.5.2(g)), and directions on
snugly adjusting the child restraint belts around the child (S5.5.2(h)) and on placing an infant restraint so that
it is rear-facing (S5.5.2(k)). The air bag warning is as important as these messages. Requiring the information to
be capitalized is consistent with the present labeling requirement of S5.5.2 to capitalize such information, and
increases the likelihood that the consumer will notice and read the information. However, NHTSA will revisit this
issue when it reviews all labeling requirements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule amends S5.6.1 to add a requirement that the printed instructions for rear-facing infant restraints must
provide a warning against using rear-facing restraints at seating positions equipped with air bags and must explain
the reasons for the warning and consequences of not following it. NHTSA is also requiring that the instructions include
a statement that owners of vehicles with front passenger side air bags should refer to their vehicle owner's manual
for child seat installation instructions. The agency adopted the latter requirement in response to a suggestion
from Volkswagen. Effective March 1994, the owner's manual of each vehicle having a front passenger side air bag must
include information on the proper positioning of occupants, including children, at seating positions equipped
with an air bag. The information must include any necessary precautions that should be heeded for the safety of those
occupants. The requirement adopted today for infant restraint instructions complements the requirement for the
vehicle owner's manual.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency believes that the label and information requirements adopted today will be effective in warning consumers
against using a rear-facing infant restraint in a vehicle seating position equipped with an air bag. The warning is
needed because data have indicated that unacceptably high forces are produced by a deploying air bag on present designs
of rear-facing infant restraints.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters, however, expressed concern that the requirements adopted today might impede the development
of rear-facing infant restraints that are safe to use in an air bag equipped seating position. These commenters indicated
that manufacturers are undertaking efforts to develop infant restraints that can be used in an air bag-equipped seating
position. Ford said that the warning statement may limit the flexibility of infant restraint manufacturers to recommend
using a rear-facing system in an air bag-equipped seating position under limited circumstances, such as if the vehicle
seat were adjusted to a certain position. Century stated that NHTSA should ensure that the warning label requirement
does not prevent future child seat designs that work adequately with an air bag. Century suggested that NHTSA should
begin defining a test procedure and performance criteria for testing the interaction of child restraints with air
bags.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA does not intend for this rule to impede the development of rear-facing restraints that are compatible with an
air bag. As discussed in the NPRM, the agency has been closely monitoring the work of a task force on Child Restraint
and Air Bag Interaction (CRABI) formed by the Society of Automotive Engineers. The task force is comprised of motor
vehicle and child seat manufacturers and highway safety researchers. It has developed guidelines consisting of
test procedures and test configurations (e.g., test dummies and a test fixture) that can be used for evaluating the
interactions between child restraints and air bags. Moreover, NHTSA has developed, for research and evaluation
purposes, procedures that were used in the Fall 1991 test program of air bags and rear-facing infant restraints. NHTSA
will continue to closely monitor the work of CRABI, especially regarding the development of test procedures evaluating
the performance of an infant restraint when used with a passenger side air bag. If CRABI were to develop a test procedure
from its guidelines, NHTSA would evaluate it to determine whether the procedure is appropriate for Standard 213.
Among other things, the procedure would have to be suitable for testing all types of infant restraints, and be able
to provide test results that assess the performance of the restraint in the real world. The agency will consider a test
procedure for incorporation into Standard 213 as soon as a suitable one is developed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rulemaking document was not reviewed under E.O. 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review.'' The agency has considered
the impact of this rulemaking action under the Department of Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures,
and has determined that it is not ``significant'' under them. NHTSA has prepared a regulatory evaluation for this
action which discussed the potential costs, benefits and other impacts of this rule. A copy of this evaluation has
been placed in the docket for this rulemaking action. Interested persons may obtain copies of it by writing to the docket
section at the address provided at the beginning of this notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To briefly summarize the evaluation, NHTSA estimates that the consumer cost of the labeling requirements of this
rule ranges from $0.09 to $0.17 per rear-facing infant restraint. The total annual cost for all infant restraints
will range from $350,280 to $661,640. This cost is expected to be even smaller if the warning statement is placed on
the existing FMVSS No. 213 label.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The evaluation also estimates that, assuming that the warning is effective at preventing any placing of rear-facing
restraints in air bag positions, 2 to 4 lives will be saved and 445 injuries will be reduced a year.

Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA has considered the effects of this rulemaking action under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I hereby certify
that it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Of the 11 current child
restraint manufacturers known to the agency (not counting vehicle manufacturers that produce and install built-in
restraints) there are three that qualify as small businesses. This is not a substantial number of small entities.
As to vehicle manufacturers that produce and install built-in restraints, most of those restraints are forward-facing
restraints and are installed in a rear seating position. Further, those manufacturers are generally not considered
small businesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regardless of the number of small entities, the rule will not have a significant economic impact on these entities.
Infant restraints range in cost between $20 and $70, with the average price about $39. Convertible seats range in cost
between $45 and $120, with the average price about $79. If the entire $0.17 cost of the rule were added to the cost of the
restraint, the typical infant restraint will increase in price by only 0.44 percent and the typical convertible seat,
by only 0.22 percent. Small organizations and governmental jurisdictions might be affected by the rule if these entities
procure child restraint systems for programs such as loaner programs. While the cost of the restraint could increase,
loaner program procurements will not be significantly affected. A program that had a fixed amount of money for procuring
child restraints will have its procurements reduced by only 0.34 to 0.57 percent. Thus, regardless of the number of
small organizations and governmental jurisdictions, NHTSA concludes the rule will not have a significant economic
impact on these entities.

Act (Safety Act; 15 U.S.C. 1392(d)), whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standard is in effect, a state may not
adopt or maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance which is not identical to the Federal
standard, except to the extent that the state requirement imposes a higher level of performance and applies only to
vehicles procured for the State's use. Section 105 of the Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1394) sets forth a procedure for judicial
review of final rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That section does

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS announces for the 1994 fishing year: (1) Total allowable catches (TAC) for each groundfish target species category
in the GOA and apportionments thereof among domestic annual processing (DAP), joint venture processing (JVP), total
allowable level of foreign fishing (TALFF), and reserves; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) apportionments of reserves to DAP; (3) assignments of the sablefish TAC to authorized fishing gear users; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) apportionments of pollock TAC among regulatory areas, seasons, and between inshore and offshore components;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) apportionment of Pacific cod TAC between inshore and offshore components; (6) ``other species'' TAC; (7) prohibited
species catch (PSC) limits relevant to fully utilized groundfish species; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) closures to directed fishing; (9) Pacific halibut PSC mortality limits; and, (10) seasonal apportionments of
the halibut PSC limits. A discussion of each of these measures follows. The process of determining TACs for groundfish
species in the GOA is established in regulations implementing the FMP, which was prepared by the Council under authority
of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). The FMP is implemented by regulations for
the foreign fishery at 50 CFR part 611 and for the U.S. fishery at 50 CFR parts 672 and 676. General regulations that also
pertain to U.S. fisheries appear at 50 CFR part 620. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to &sect;672.20(a)(2)(ii), the sum of the TACs for all species must fall within the combined optimum yield
(OY) range of 116,000&hyph;800,000 metric tons (mt) established for these species in &sect;672.20(a)(1). Under
&sect;&sect;611.92(c)(1) and 672.20(a)(2)(i), TACs are apportioned initially among DAP, JVP, TALFF, and reserves.
The DAP amounts are intended for harvest by U.S. fishermen for delivery and sale to U.S. processors. JVP amounts are
intended for joint ventures in which U.S. fishermen typically deliver their catches to foreign processors at sea.
TALFF amounts are intended for harvest by foreign fishermen. Regulations at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;672.20(a)(2)(ii) establish initial reserves equal to 20 percent of the TACs for pollock, Pacific cod, flounder
target species categories, and ``other species.'' Reserve amounts are set aside for possible reapportionment to
DAP and/or JVP if the initial apportionments prove inadequate. Reserves that are not reapportioned to DAP or JVP may
be reapportioned to TALFF according to &sect;672.20(d)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council met on September 21&hyph;26, 1993, and developed recommendations for proposed 1994 TAC specifications
for each target species category of groundfish on the basis of the best available scientific information. The Council
also recommended other management measures pertaining to the 1994 fishing year. Under &sect;672.20(c)(1)(ii),
1994 specifications were proposed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 60575, November 17, 1993). No JVP or TALFF amounts were specified because GOA groundfish are fully utilized
by the DAP fisheries. Under &sect;672.20(c)(1)(ii), one-fourth of the preliminary specifications and gear apportionments
and one-fourth of the Pacific halibut PSC amounts were effective January 1 on an interim basis and are now superseded
by the final 1994 specifications.

The Council met on December 6&hyph;10, 1993, to review the best available scientific information concerning groundfish
stocks, and to consider public testimony regarding 1994 groundfish fisheries. Scientific information is contained
in the November 1993 SAFE report for the GOA. The November 1993 SAFE report was prepared and presented by the GOA Plan
Team to the Council and the Council's Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC) and Advisory Panel (AP) and includes
the most recent information concerning the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) For pollock: Data from the 1993 spring hydroacoustic survey in Shelikof Strait conducted by the Alaska Fisheries
Science Center; egg production estimates of spawning biomass; estimates of catch-at-age from the 1992 fishery;
updated estimates of catch; length-frequency data from the 1993 hydroacoustic survey and the first quarter of the
1993 fishery; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) For sablefish: Data from the 1993 Cooperative and Domestic Longline Surveys; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) For Pacific cod: Size composition data from the NMFS longline surveys of the GOA were updated through 1993;

% values; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) For groundfish, generally: Harvest and discard data from the NMFS Observer Program Office for 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Plan Team recommended that, starting in 1994, rex sole be removed from the deep-water flatfish category and be
managed as a separate target species category to provide flexibility in managing rockfish bycatch. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For establishment of the acceptable biological catches (ABC) and TACs, the Council considered information in the
SAFE report, recommendations from its SSC and AP, as well as public testimony. The SSC adopted the ABC recommendations
from the Plan Team, which were provided in the SAFE report, for all of the target species categories, except that for
Pacific ocean perch (POP). The Council adopted the SSC ABC recommendations for each target species category, except
for POP. The Council's recommended ABCs, listed in Table 1, reflect harvest amounts that are less than the specified
overfishing amounts (Table 1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SSC calculated the POP ABC by applying a fishing mortality rate of F=0.08 that would reduce the spawning biomass
per recruit ratio to 44 percent of its pristine level and further reducing F to 0.04 based on the ratio of current female
spawner biomass to the optimal level. This rate was then applied to the 1994 exploitable biomass of 101,800 mt. The
Plan Team reduced this value further by the ratio of F

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, resulting in an ABC recommendation of 3,030 mt, to ensure that the ABC was less than the overfishing level of 3,940
mt. The SSC considered this adjustment inappropriate, stating that it arbitrarily foregoes catch without providing
biological justification. The SSC recommended that the ABC for POP be set at 3,943 mt. However, the Council adopted
the recommendation of the Plan Team and set the ABC for POP at 3,030 mt. The Plan Team's ABC of 3,030 mt better conforms
to the policy objectives of the POP rebuilding plan established under Amendment 32 to the FMP, adopted by the Council
in September 1993 and submitted for Secretarial review on December 18, 1993.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council recommended TACs equal to ABCs for pollock, Pacific cod, sablefish, shortraker/rougheye rockfish,
pelagic shelf rockfish, demersal shelf rockfish, thornyhead rockfish, and northern rockfish. The recommended
TACs for Pacific cod, sablefish, shortraker/rougheye, thornyhead rockfish and northern rockfish are at levels
that will support bycatch needs in other fisheries. Other TACs are set at levels that are fully utilized in the directed
fisheries. The Council recommended TACs less than the ABC for shallow-water and deep-water flatfish, POP, other
slope rockfish, Atka mackerel, rex sole, flathead sole, and arrowtooth flounder (Table 1). The sum of the TACs approved
by the Council for all GOA groundfish is 304,595 mt, which is within the OY range specified by the FMP. The sum of the TACs
is lower than the 1993 TAC sum of 306,651 mt. The sum of 1994 ABCs for all groundfish is 553,050 mt, which is lower than
the 1993 ABC total of 732,868 mt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For pollock, in September 1993, the Council adopted a preliminary ABC of 78,000 mt for the Western/Central Regulatory
Areas. However, at the September Plan Team meeting, the Plan Team requested that four additional exploitation strategies
be explored. Based on the results of these new analyses, which were presented at the November 1993 Plan Team meeting,
an ABC of 102,000 mt was recommended for the Western/Central Areas. The Plan Team recommendation represents the fishing
mortality strategy that was associated with a 95 percent chance of maintaining the spawner biomass level above the
threshold level (F=0.20). The Plan Team chose this fishing strategy because of recent trends in poor recruitment
of GOA pollock and because of ecosystem concerns. The Council concurred with the conservative exploitation strategy
and recommended a TAC and an ABC of 102,000 mt for pollock for the Western/Central GOA for 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The TACs for shallow-water (Western GOA) and deep-water (Central GOA) flatfish and rex sole (Central GOA) were set
at 4,500 mt, 7,500 mt and 7,500 mt, respectively. These amounts reflect recent harvest levels and will limit the halibut
bycatch associated with these fisheries. The TACs for flathead sole and arrowtooth flounder were set at 10,000 mt
and 30,000 mt, respectively, also to limit halibut bycatch. As discussed above, consistent with the Council's previously
adopted rebuilding policy for POP, a conservative exploitation rate was recommended. The recommended 1994 TAC of
2,550 mt was based on a rate intermediate between the optimal fishing rate and the rate required to provide unavoidable
bycatch. The POP ABC of 3,030 mt, recommended by the Council, provides a buffer between the TAC (2,550 mt) and the overfishing
level (3,940 mt). The Council also recommended that the overfishing level for POP be apportioned by regulatory area.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council adopted the AP's recommended ``other rockfish'' TACs for each regulatory area as follows: 199 mt for the
Western Regulatory Area; 988 mt for the Central Regulatory Area; and 3,813 mt for the Eastern Regulatory Area. The
Council was concerned that the directed fishery for ``other rockfish'' in the Eastern Regulatory Area could result
in high bycatches of other target species categories. The Council was particularly concerned that high bycatches
of demersal shelf rockfish (DSR) in the Southeast Outside District of the Eastern Regulatory Area could occur. In
1993, a trawl vessel operator caught substantial amounts of DSR in this district as bycatch while conducting a directed
fishery for ``other rockfish.'' As a result, the DSR TAC was reached prematurely and resulted in economic losses to
Southeast Alaska fishermen who otherwise depend on DSR for a certain amount of their annual income. Therefore, the
Council recommended that the TAC for ``other rockfish'' be set at an amount that would only support bycatch needs in
other directed fisheries. NMFS has determined that a TAC of 1,048 mt for the Eastern Regulatory Area would support
bycatch needs in other directed fisheries. This amount was derived using the amount of ``other rockfish'' bycatch
caught by vessels participating in the 1993 pelagic shelf rockfish directed fishery.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Amendment 31, approved on October 18, 1993, Atka mackerel was established as a separate target category beginning
with the 1994 fishing year. The Council made 1994 recommendations of overfishing and ABC for Atka mackerel. Uncertainty
about the biological status of Atka mackerel and the concern that Atka mackerel is a prey species for Steller sea lions
prompted the Council to adopt conservative TACs for this target species category. The Council established a TAC of
3,500 mt and apportioned the TAC between the Western (2,500 mt) and Central (1,000 mt) Regulatory Areas. NMFS implements
a TAC of 5 mt for Atka mackerel in the Eastern Regulatory Area, raising the total TAC to 3,505 mt, to accommodate small
amounts of Atka mackerel that might be caught in this management area. The total amount that was reported to have been
caught in the Eastern Regulatory Area during the 1993 fishing year was 0.6 mt. Providing an Atka mackerel TAC in the
Eastern Regulatory Area provides consistency with respect to reporting requirements for Atka mackerel in the Central
and Western Regulatory Areas, and will be less confusing for the fishing industry. NMFS has adjusted the TAC for the
``other species'' category and the overall sum of TACs to account for this change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council, after adopting the TACs, recommended 1994 apportionments of the TACs for each species category among
DAP, JVP, TALFF, and reserves. Existing harvesting and processing capacity of the U.S. industry is capable of utilizing
the entire 1994 TAC specification for GOA groundfish; therefore, the Council recommended that the DAP allowance
equal the TAC for each species category, resulting in no TALFF or JVP apportionments for the 1994 fishing year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS has reviewed the Council's recommendation for TAC specifications and apportionments and hereby approves these
specifications under &sect;672.20(c)(1)(ii)(B), except for ``other species.''

2. Apportionment of Reserves to DAP
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulations implementing the FMP require 20 percent of each TAC for pollock, Pacific cod, flatfish species, and the
``other species'' category be set aside in reserves for possible apportionment at a later date (&sect;672.20(a)(2)(ii)).
For the preceding 6 years, including 1993, NMFS has apportioned all of the reserves to DAP effective on January 1. For
1994, NMFS apportions reserves for each species category to DAP, anticipating that domestic harvesters and processors
will need all the DAP amounts. Specifications of DAP shown in Table 1 reflect apportioned reserves. Under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;672.20(d)(5)(iv), the public may submit comments on the apportionments of reserves. Comments should focus
on whether, and the extent to which, operators of vessels of the United States will harvest reserve or DAP amounts during
the remainder of the year and whether, and the extent to which, U.S. harvested groundfish can or will be processed by
U.S. fish processors or received at sea by foreign fishing vessels.

3. Assignment of the Sablefish TACs to Authorized Fishing Gear Users
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under &sect;672.24(c), sablefish TACs for each of the regulatory areas and districts are assigned to hook-and-line
and trawl gear. In the Western and Central Regulatory Areas, 80 percent of each TAC is assigned to hook-and-line gear
and 20 percent to trawl gear. In the Eastern Regulatory Area, 95 percent of the TAC is assigned to hook-and-line gear
and 5 percent is assigned to trawl gear. The trawl gear allocation in the Eastern Regulatory Area may only be used as
bycatch to support directed fisheries for other target species. Sablefish caught in the GOA with gear other than hook-and-line
or trawl gear must be treated as prohibited species and may not be retained. Table 2 shows the assignments of the 1994
sablefish TACs between hook-and-line and trawl gear.

4. Apportionments of Pollock TAC Among Regulatory Areas, Seasons, and Between Inshore and Offshore Components
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
In the GOA, pollock is apportioned by area, season, and inshore/offshore components. Regulations at &sect;672.20(a)(2)(iv)
require that the TAC for pollock in the combined W/C GOA be apportioned among statistical areas Shumagin (61), Chirikof
(62), and Kodiak (63) in proportion to known distributions of the pollock biomass. This measure was intended to provide
spatial distribution of the pollock harvest as a sea lion protection measure. Each statistical area apportionment
is further divided equally among the four quarterly reporting periods of the fishing year (Table 3). Within any fishing
year, any unharvested amount of any quarterly allowance of pollock TAC is added in equal proportions to the quarterly
allowance of following quarters, resulting in a sum for each quarter that does not exceed 150 percent of the initial
quarterly allowance. Similarly, harvests in excess of a quarterly allowance of TAC are deducted in equal proportions
from the remaining quarterly allowances of that fishing year. As defined at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;672.23(f), directed fishing for the four quarterly allowances will start on January 1, June 1, July 1, and October
1. The Eastern Regulatory Area pollock TAC of 7,300 mt is not allocated among smaller areas, or quarters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations at &sect;672.20(a)(2)(v)(A) require that the DAP apportionment for pollock in all regulatory areas
and all quarterly allowances thereof be divided into inshore and offshore components. The inshore component is apportioned
100 percent of the pollock DAP in each regulatory area after subtraction of amounts that are determined by the Regional
Director to be necessary to support the bycatch needs of the offshore component in directed fisheries for other groundfish
species. At this time, incidental amounts of pollock to be caught by the offshore component are unknown, and will be
determined during the fishing year.

6. ``Other Species'' TAC
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The FMP specifies that the TAC amount for the ``other species'' category is calculated as 5 percent of the 1994 combined
TACs for target species. For 1993, the Council recommended that ``other species'' be made available separately in
each of the three regulatory areas to avoid preemption of fishing activities in the remainder of the GOA by a target
fishery for Atka mackerel that developed in the Western Regulatory Area. Approval of Amendment 31, which established
Atka mackerel as a separate target species, removed the necessity to apportion ``other species'' among regulatory
areas in 1994. At the December 1993 meeting, the Council recommended a GOA-wide TAC of 14,504 mt for ``other species.''
As discussed above, a 1994 TAC of 5 mt for Atka mackerel in the Eastern Regulatory Area is established by NMFS, thus increasing
the TAC for ``other species'' to 14,505 mt.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Under &sect;672.20(b)(1), if NMFS determines, after consultation with the Council, that the TAC for any species
or species group will be fully utilized in the DAP fishery, a groundfish PSC limit applicable to the JVP fisheries may
be specified for that species or species group. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council recommended that DAP equal TAC for each species category. Zero amounts of JVP are available. NMFS concurs
with the Council's recommendation, and has not established any JVP amounts; therefore, no groundfish PSC limits
under &sect;672.20(b)(1) are necessary.

8. Closures to Directed Fishing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The ``proposed 1994 Initial Specifications of Groundfish and Associated Management Measures'' for the GOA (58 FR
60575, November 17, 1993) contained several closures to directed fishing for groundfish during 1994. The closures
for the final specifications are listed in Table 5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under &sect;672.20(c)(2)(ii), the Regional Director determined that the entire TACs or allocations of TAC of some
groundfish species and species groups will be needed as incidental catch to support other anticipated groundfish
fisheries during 1994. The Regional Director is establishing directed fishing allowances of zero mt and prohibiting
directed fishing for the remainder of the year for the fisheries listed in Table 5. Directed fishing standards for
the aforementioned closures may be found at &sect;672.20(g).

Under &sect;672.20(f)(2), annual Pacific halibut PSC limits are established and apportioned to trawl and hook-and-line
gear and are established for pot gear. At its December 1993 meeting, the Council recommended that NMFS reestablish
1993 halibut PSC limits of 2,000 mt for trawl gear and 750 mt for hook-and-line gear for 1994. The hook-and-line halibut
PSC limit is further apportioned between the DSR fishery (10 mt halibut mortality) and all other hook-and-line fisheries
(740 mt). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As in the proposed specifications, the Council recommended that pot gear be exempt from Pacific halibut PSC limits
for the 1994 fishing year. The Council proposed this exemption after considering that the groundfish catch and associated
halibut bycatch and mortality rates for pot gear are low (5 percent). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the September 1993 meeting, the Council recommended that NMFS prepare a rule for Secretarial approval that, if
approved, would authorize separate apportionments of the trawl halibut bycatch mortality limit between trawl fisheries
for the deep-water species complex (deep-water flatfish, rockfish, sablefish and arrowtooth flounder) and for
the shallow-water species complex (pollock, Pacific cod, shallow-water flatfish, flathead sole, Atka mackerel,
and ``other species''). At its December 1993 meeting, the Council further recommended that this action be implemented
under emergency rulemaking so that it could be effective early in 1994. An emergency rule was prepared by NMFS and implemented
February 7, 1994 (59 FR 6222, February 10, 1994). The emergency rule specifies trawl fishery apportionments of the
1994 GOA trawl halibut bycatch mortality limit and seasonal apportionments thereof. The emergency rule specifications
supersede those set forth in this notice during the effective period of the emergency rule.

The best available information on estimated halibut bycatch is available from 1993 observations of the groundfish
fisheries as a result of the NMFS Observer Program. The calculated halibut bycatch mortality by trawl, hook-and-line,
and pot gear through December 16, 1993, is 1,993 mt, 1,279 mt, and 2.4 mt, respectively, for a total of 3,214 mt. Halibut
bycatch restrictions seasonally constrained trawl gear fisheries during the first, second, and third quarters
of the fishing year. Halibut mortality did not constrain trawling effort in the fourth quarter of 1993. Trawling,
with the exception of trawling for pollock with pelagic trawl gear, was closed in 1993 from March 24 to March 29 (58 FR
16372, March 26, 1993), from April 19 to June 28 (58 FR 21545, April 22, 1993), and from August 3 to October 4 (58 FR 41640,
August 5, 1993) as a result of halibut PSC seasonal allowances. Hook-and-line gear was closed to directed fishing
for all but DSR on June 4 to December 31, 1993 (58 FR 32064, June 8, 1993; 58 FR 46095, September 1, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amount of groundfish that trawl or hook-and-line gear might have harvested if halibut had not been seasonally
limiting in 1993 is unknown. Even though halibut mortality was not constraining in the fourth quarter of 1993, some
amounts of groundfish remained unharvested. Sablefish and Pacific cod are of the most interest to fishermen using
hook-and-line gear. Over 900 mt of sablefish in the Western Regulatory Area, and 1,000 mt of Pacific cod in the Eastern
Regulatory Area remained unharvested during 1993. An unknown portion of these amounts likely would have been harvested
had 1993 halibut restrictions not been limiting.

At its December 1993 meeting, the Council adopted lower ABCs for pollock, Pacific cod, deep-water flatfish, flathead
sole, shallow-water flatfish, arrowtooth flounder, and POP than those established for 1993. The Council adopted
higher ABCs for sablefish, pelagic shelf rockfish, and demersal shelf rockfish than those established for 1993.
The ABCs for other groundfish are unchanged from 1993 levels. Rex sole and Atka mackerel were separated out of deepwater
flatfish and ``other species,'' and established as separate target species categories for 1994. More information
on these changes is included in the Final SAFE report dated November 1993 and in the Council and SSC minutes.

The total of the 1994 TACs for the GOA is 304,595 mt, a slight decrease from the 1993 TAC total of 306,651 mt. At its December
1993 meeting, the Council changed the 1994 TACs for some fisheries from the 1993 TACs. Those fisheries for which the
1994 TACs were lower than in 1993 are pollock (decreased to 109,300 mt from 114,400 mt), Pacific cod (decreased to 50,400
mt from 56,700 mt), POP (decreased to 2,550 mt from 2,560 mt), and ``other rockfish'' (decreased to 2,235 mt from 5,383
mt). Rex sole was separated from the deep-water flatfish complex in 1994 and assigned a separate TAC resulting in a
slight increase in the total TAC for the two target groups but reducing the TAC for deep-water flatfish. Those species
for which the 1994 TAC was higher than in 1993 are shallow-water flatfish (increased to 18,630 mt from 16,240 mt), sablefish
(increased to 25,500 mt from 20,900 mt), shortraker/rougheye (increased to 1,960 mt from 1,764 mt), pelagic shelf
rockfish (increased to 6,890 mt from 6,740 mt), DSR (increased to 960 mt from 800 mt) and thornyhead rockfish (increased
to 1,180 mt from 1,062 mt).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The stock assessment for 1992 conducted by the IPHC indicates that the total exploitable biomass of Pacific halibut
was 265.8 million pounds. This represents a decline in biomass of 11 percent from the previous stock assessment, a
rate similar to declines observed in previous years. The decline is expected to continue over the next few years as
a consequence of reduced recruitment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Halibut fisheries will be adjusted to account for the overall halibut PSC mortality limit established for groundfish
fisheries. The 1994 groundfish fisheries are expected to use the entire halibut PSC limit of 2,750 mt. The allowable
directed commercial catch is determined by accounting for the recreational catch, waste, and bycatch mortality,
and then providing the remainder to the directed fishery. Therefore, although the amount of halibut available for
directed halibut fisheries will be reduced, halibut bycatch in groundfish fisheries is not expected to have any effect
on halibut stocks.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Halibut bycatch may be reduced by (1) reducing amounts of groundfish TACs, (2) reducing halibut bycatch rates through
a Vessel Incentive Program, (3) modifications to gear and fish handling procedures, and (4) changes in groundfish
fishing seasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reductions in groundfish TACs do not usually provide incentives for fishermen to reduce bycatch rates. Costs that
would be imposed on fishermen as a result of reducing TACs depend on species and amounts of groundfish foregone.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Trawl vessels carrying observers for purposes of complying with the Observer Plan are subject to the Vessel Incentive
Program. The program encourages trawl fishermen to avoid high halibut bycatch rates while conducting groundfish
fisheries by specifying bycatch rate standards for various target fisheries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current regulations require groundfish pots to have halibut exclusion devices to reduce halibut bycatches. Resulting
low bycatch and mortality rates of halibut in pot fisheries have justified exempting pot gear from PSC limits. Because
halibut bycatch mortality in the pot fisheries is so low, and not expected to increase during 1994, the Council has
again recommended exempting these fisheries from halibut bycatch restrictions in 1994, as it did in 1993. A recent
change in the definition of pelagic trawl gear is intended to reduce bycatch of halibut by displacing fishing effort
off the bottom of the sea floor when certain halibut bycatch levels are reached during the fishing year. The definition
provides standards for physical conformation and also for performance of the trawl gear in terms of crab bycatch (58
FR 39680, July 26, 1993). A recent regulatory change required all hook-and-line vessel operators to employ careful
release measures when handling halibut bycatch (58 FR 28799, May 17, 1993). This measure is intended to reduce handling
mortality, increase the amount of groundfish harvested with the available halibut mortality limits, and possibly
lower overall halibut mortality in groundfish fisheries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Halibut bycatch will potentially be reduced by changes in some groundfish fishing seasons. The sablefish hook-and-line
season starts May 18, and the rockfish trawl fishery is delayed until the third quarter, July 4. These delays postpone
the start of the sablefish and rockfish fisheries to times when seasonal halibut bycatch rates are lower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Methods listed under (F) above, will be reviewed by NMFS and the Council to determine their effectiveness. Changes
will be initiated as necessary in response to this review or to public testimony and comment, either through regulatory
or FMP amendments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with the goals and objectives of the FMP to reduce halibut bycatches while providing an opportunity to
harvest the groundfish OY, NMFS proposes the assignments of 2,000 mt and 750 mt of halibut PSC mortality limits to trawl
and hook-and-line gear, respectively. While these limits will reduce the harvest quota for commercial halibut fishermen,
NMFS has determined that they will not result in unfair allocation to any particular user group. NMFS recognizes that
some halibut bycatch will occur in the groundfish fishery, but expansion of the Vessel Incentive Program, required
modifications to gear and handling procedures, and delays to the start of the sablefish hook-and-line gear and rockfish
trawl gear fisheries are intended to reduce adverse impacts on halibut fishermen while promoting the opportunity
to achieve the OY from the groundfish fishery.

10. Seasonal Allocations of the Halibut PSC Limits
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Under &sect;672.20(f)(2), NMFS seasonally allocates the halibut PSC limits based on recommendations from the Council.
The FMP requires that the following information be considered by the Council in recommending seasonal allocations
of halibut (a) seasonal distribution of halibut, (b) seasonal distribution of target groundfish species relative
to halibut distribution, (c) expected halibut bycatch needs on a seasonal basis relevant to changes in halibut biomass
and expected catches of target groundfish species, (d) expected bycatch rates on a seasonal basis, (e) expected changes
in directed groundfish fishing seasons, (f) expected actual start of fishing effort, and (g) economic effects of
establishing seasonal halibut allocations on segments of the target groundfish industry. The Council recommended
the same seasonal allowances of PSC limits for the 1994 fishing year as those in effect during the 1993 fishing year.
The publication of the final 1993 initial groundfish and PSC specifications (58 FR 16787, March 31, 1993) summarizes
Council findings with respect to each of the FMP considerations set forth above. At this time, the Council's findings
are unchanged from those set forth in 1993. Pacific halibut PSC limits, and apportionments thereof, are presented
in Table 6. Regulations specify that overages and shortfalls in PSC catches will be accounted for within the 1994 fishing
year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Slight adjustments from the 1993 seasonal allocations are proposed to accommodate dates of anticipated fishing
effort and the opening date of the hook-and-line directed fishery for sablefish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(May 18, 1994). Trawling for rockfish species will start on July 4, 1994 in accordance with &sect;672.23(d).

Assumed halibut mortality rates for halibut PSC bycatch in 1994 are similar to those used in 1993 and are unchanged
from those established in the proposed specifications. These rates are listed in Table 7 and reflect mandatory careful
release measures implemented during 1993 (58 FR 28799, May 17, 1993). Further information on halibut mortality can
be found in the November SAFE report. NMFS has determined that the Council's recommendation for the seasonal apportionments
of the Pacific halibut PSC to gear types and the assumed mortality rates are appropriate and is implementing the Council's

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Under regulations at &sect;672.23(c), the opening date for the directed fishing season for sablefish with hook-and-line
gear is the calendar day from May 9 through May 22 upon which the tide with the smallest tidal range occurs. According
to annual tide tables published by NOAA for 1994, this date is May 18, 1994. Therefore, in accordance with &sect;672.23
(b) and (c), the season will commence at 12:00 noon, Alaska local time, May 18, 1994.

 NMFS announces final specifications of total allowable catches (TACs), initial apportionments of TACs for each
category of groundfish, and associated management measures in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area
(BSAI) during the 1994 fishing year. This action is necessary to establish harvest limits and associated management
measures for groundfish during the 1994 fishing year. NMFS also is closing specified fisheries consistent with the
final 1994 groundfish specifications and fishery bycatch allowances of prohibited species. These measures are
intended to conserve and manage the groundfish resources in the BSAI.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Groundfish fisheries in the BSAI are governed by Federal regulations at 50 CFR part 675 that implement the Fishery
Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI (FMP). Other applicable regulations are found at 50 CFR 611.93
(foreign fishing) and 50 CFR part 676 (limited entry fisheries off of Alaska). The FMP was prepared by the North Pacific
Fishery Management Council (Council) and approved by the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) under the Magnuson Fishery
Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FMP and implementing regulations require the Secretary, after consultation with the Council, to specify annually
the apportionments of prohibited species catch (PSC) limits among fisheries and seasons (&sect;675.21(b)), the
TAC, initial domestic annual harvest (DAH), and initial total allowable level of foreign fishing (TALFF) for each
target species and the ``other species'' category (&sect;675.20(a)(2)). The sum of the TACs must be within the optimum
yield (OY) range of 1.4 million to 2.0 million metric tons (mt) (&sect;675.20(a)(2)). Specifications set forth in
Tables 1&hyph;7 of this action satisfy these requirements. For 1994, the sum of TACs is 2,000,000 mt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed BSAI groundfish specifications and specifications for prohibited species bycatch allowances for the
groundfish fishery of the BSAI were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 17, 1993 (58 FR 60584). Comments were invited through December 10, 1993. No written comments were received
within the comment period. Verbal comments were received, and public consultation with the Council occurred during
the Council meeting in Seattle, Washington, held December 6&hyph;10, 1993. Council recommendations and biological
and economic data that were available at the Council's December meeting were considered in implementing the final
1994 specifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The specified TAC for each species is based on the best available biological and socioeconomic information. The Council,
its Advisory Panel (AP), and its Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC) reviewed current biological information
about the condition of groundfish stocks in the BSAI at their September and December 1993 meetings. This information
was compiled by the Council's BSAI Groundfish Plan Team and is presented in the final 1994 SAFE report for the BSAI groundfish
fisheries, dated November 1993. The Plan Team annually produces such a document as the first step in the process of
specifying TACs. The SAFE report contains a review of the latest scientific analyses and estimates of each species'
biomass and other biological parameters. From these data and analyses, the Plan Team estimates an acceptable biological
catch (ABC) for each species category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A summary of the preliminary ABCs for each species for 1994 and other biological data from the September 1993 draft
SAFE report were provided in the discussion supporting the proposed 1994 specifications. The Plan Team's recommended
ABCs were reviewed by the SSC, AP, and Council at their September 1993 meetings. Based on the SSC's comments concerning
technical methods and new biological data not available in September, the Plan Team revised its ABC recommendations
in the final SAFE report dated November 1993. The revised ABC recommendations were again reviewed by the SSC, AP, and
Council at their December 1993 meetings. While the SSC endorsed most of the Plan Team's recommendations for 1994 ABCs
set forth in the final SAFE report, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the SSC recommended revisions to ABC amounts calculated for Bogoslof pollock, Greenland turbot, and Atka mackerel.
The Council adopted the SSC's recommendations for the 1994 ABSs. The final ABCs, listed in Table 1, reflect harvest
amounts that will not cause overfishing as defined in the FMP.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Plan Team indicated in the final 1994 SAFE report that the current estimate of biomass of Aleutian Basin pollock
(490,000 mt) is the best estimate, assuming that no recruitment to the stock has occurred and that natural mortality
(M) is 0.2. Reassessment of the Bogoslof area hydroacoustic survey with new threshold levels of abundance has not
changed previous conclusions that this stock has declined since 1988. The Plan Team assumed that no recruitment occurred
in 1993 or will occur in 1994, and projected a biomass for 1994 of 490,000 mt using M=.02. The Plan Team then calculated
the F

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
0.35
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 exploitation rate of 0.26 to derive an ABC of 127,000. The SSC, however, adjusted the exploitation rate downward by
25 percent to select a ratio of current biomass to optimal biomass. This leads to an ABC of 31,750. Due to lack of recruitment
predicted for 1993 and 1994, the Council recommended a TAC of 1,000 mt to provide for bycatch in other groundfish operations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The Plan Team used a new stock synthesis model to estimate the ABC, which was updated with catch and survey data through
October 1993. A more conservative exploitation rate of F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and an increased slope survey catchability coefficient of 0.75 was selected. These adjustments resulted in a conservative
ABC of 17,200 mt. Continued poor recruitment and stock abundance levels lead the SSC to recommend a continuation of
the present 7,000 mt ABC for this species. The Council concurred with this recommendation and set the TAC at 7,000 for
this species. The Council further recommended apportioning two-thirds of the Greenland turbot TAC (4,667 mt) to
the eastern Bering Sea, and one-third of the TAC (2,333 mt) to the Aleutian Islands in proportion to the biomass estimates
in these areas. The Council's recommendation will spread fishing effort over a larger area.

Atka Mackerel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SSC accepted the Plan Team's 1994 estimate of ABC (245,000 mt), although it expressed concern that the time series
of trawl surveys is short and inconsistent in coverage. The SSC also was apprehensive about possible environmental
problems that may result from an increased catch of the magnitude implied by the Plan Team's estimate of 1994 ABC. Atka
mackerel is a prey species of northern fur seals and Steller sea lions. During their migrations, northern fur seals
(a depleted species) feed heavily on Atka mackerel as they move through the Aleutian passes. Given these concerns,
the SSC recommended to continue its 1992 and 1993 policy to phase in the Plan Team's estimate of ABC over a 6-year period
by adopting the 1993 biomass estimate (816,000 mt) and raising the exploitation rate in steps. These incremental
steps are as follows: (M)(1)/6 in 1992, (M)(2)/6 in 1993, (M)(3)/6 in 1994, (M)(4)/6 in 1995, (M)(5)/6 in 1996 and M
in 1997. According to this schedule, the recommended ABC for 1994 is (0.30/2)(816,000)=122,500 mt. The main purpose
of this approach is to postpone a large ABC increase until new survey estimates are available to evaluate the phase-in
policy.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendment 28 to the BSAI FMP became effective August 11, 1993 (58 FR 37660, July 13, 1993). This amendment establishes
three new management districts in the Aleutian Islands (AI) subarea (western, central, and eastern AI management
districts) for the purpose of apportioning TAC of groundfish. The intent of this action is to improve TAC management,
disperse fishing effort, and minimize the potential for undesirable effects of concentrated fishing effort. The
Council recommended a 68,000 mt TAC for Atka mackerel in the BSAI in 1994. Based on the authority provided by Amendment
28, the Council recommended apportionment of the TAC for Atka mackerel among the AI management districts and the Bering
Sea relative to survey biomass estimates: 10,000 mt in the western area; 44,525 mt in the central area; and 13,475 mt
in the eastern area and Bering Sea combined.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council developed its TAC recommendations (Table 1) based on the final ABCs as adjusted for other biological and
socioeconomic considerations, including maintaining the total TAC in the required OY range of 1.4&hyph;2.0 million
mt. Each of the Council's recommended TACs for 1994 is equal to or less than the final 1994 ABC for each species category.
Therefore, NMFS finds that the recommended TACs are consistent with the biological condition of groundfish stocks.
The final ABCs, TACs, ITACs, overfishing levels and initial apportionments of groundfish in the BSAI area for 1994
are given in Table 1 of this action. The apportionment of pollock TACs among fisheries and seasons is discussed below.

Apportionment of TAC

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by &sect;&sect;675.20(a)(3) and 675.20(a)(7)(i), each species' TAC initially is reduced by 15 percent.
The sum of these 15 percent amounts is the reserve. The reserve is not designated by species or species group, and any
amount of the reserve may be reapportioned to a target species or the ``other species'' category during the year, providing
that such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reapportionments do not result in overfishing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The initial TAC (ITAC) for each target species and the ``other species'' category at the beginning of the year, which
is equal to 85 percent of TAC, is then apportioned between the domestic annual harvest (DAH) category and the total
allowable level of foreign fishing (TALFF). Each DAH amount is further apportioned between two categories of U.S.
fishing vessels. The domestic annual processing (DAP) category includes U.S. vessels that process their catch on
board or deliver it to U.S. fish processors. The joint venture processing (JVP) category includes U.S. fishing vessels
working in joint ventures with foreign processing vessels authorized to receive catches in the U.S. exclusive economic
zone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In consultation with the Council, the initial amounts of DAP and JVP are determined by the Director, Alaska Region,
NMFS (Regional Director). Consistent with the final notice of 1991&hyph;1993 initial specifications, the Council
recommended that 1994 DAP specifications be set equal to TAC and that zero amounts of groundfish be allocated to JVP
and TALFF. In making this recommendation, the Council considered the capacity of DAP harvesting and processing operations
and anticipated that 1994 DAP operations will harvest the full TAC specified for each BSAI groundfish species category.

percent to vessels catching pollock for processing by the inshore component and 65 percent to vessels catching pollock
for processing by the offshore component (Table 2). Definitions of these components are found at &sect;675.2.

Under regulations governing the CDQ program at &sect;675.27, NMFS may allocate the 1994 pollock CDQ reserves to eligible
Western Alaska communities or groups of communities that have an approved community development plan (CDP). The
Secretary has approved six CDP's and associated percentages of the CDQ reserve for each CDP recipient for 1994 (58
FR 61031, November 19, 1993). Table 3 lists the approved CDP recipients, and each recipient's allocation of the 1994
pollock CDQ reserve for each subarea.

Seasonal Allowances of Pollock TAC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under &sect;675.20(a)(2)(ii), the ITAC of pollock for each subarea or district of the BSAI area is divided, after
subtraction of reserves (&sect;675.20(a)(3)), into two allowances. The first allowance will be available for directed
fishing from January 1 to April 15 (roe season). The second allowance will be available from August 15 through the end
of the fishing year (non-roe season). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council recommended that the 1994 seasonal allowances of pollock be set at the same relative levels as in 1993 with
45 percent of the pollock ITAC specified for each management subarea or district during the roe season and 55 percent
during the non-roe season (Table 2). Although the Council is authorized under &sect;675.20(a)(7)(ii) to recommend
seasonal allowances of the 1994 CDQ pollock reserve, it did not take such action at its December 1993 meeting. Therefore
NMFS is limiting the 1994 fishery to 45 percent of the CDQ reserve during the roe season, consistent with the seasonal
split recommended by the Council for the inshore/offshore pollock fisheries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When specifying seasonal allowances of the pollock TAC, the Council and the Secretary consider the following nine
factors as specified in section 14.4.10 of the FMP: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Estimated monthly pollock catch and effort in prior years; 2. Expected changes in harvesting and processing capacity
and associated pollock catch; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Current estimates of, and expected changes in, pollock biomass and stock conditions; conditions of marine mammal
stocks; and biomass and stock conditions of species taken as bycatch in directed pollock fisheries;

4. Potential impacts of expected seasonal fishing for pollock on pollock stocks, marine mammals, and stocks and species
taken as bycatch in directed pollock fisheries; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The need to obtain fishery data during all or part of the fishing year; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Effects on operating costs and gross revenues; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The need to spread fishing effort over the year, minimize gear conflicts, and allow participation by various elements
of the groundfish fleet and other fisheries; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Potential allocative effects among users and indirect effects on coastal communities; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Other biological and socioeconomic information that affects the consistency of seasonal pollock harvests with
the goals and objectives of the FMP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A discussion of these factors relative to the roe and non-roe seasonal allowances (45 and 55 percent of the TAC, respectively)
was contained in the final 1993 specifications for BSAI groundfish (58 FR 8703, February 17, 1993). Considerations
under these factors remain unchanged from 1993 given that the relative seasonal allowances for 1993 and 1994 are the
same.

Apportionment of Pollock TAC to the Non-Pelagic Trawl Gear Fishery

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulations under &sect;675.24(c)(2) authorize the Secretary, in consultation with the Council, to limit the amount
of pollock TAC that may be taken in the directed fishery for pollock using non-pelagic trawl gear. This authority is
intended to reduce the amount of halibut and crab bycatch that occurs in non-pelagic trawl operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations were implemented during 1993 to more effectively limit the bycatch of halibut and crab when directed
fishing for pollock with non-pelagic trawl gear is closed (58 FR 39680, July 26, 1993). Given these regulatory constraints,
the Council did not recommend limiting the amount of pollock TAC that may be taken in the 1994 directed fishery for pollock
by vessels using non-pelagic trawl gear. NMFS concurs in the Council's recommendation, and no limit on the amount
of pollock TAC that may be taken in the directed fishery for pollock using non-pelagic trawl gear is specified.

At its June 1993 meeting, the Council adopted Amendment 24 to the FMP, which authorizes fixed allocations of the Pacific
cod TAC among vessels using trawl gear, hook-and-line gear or pot gear, and jig gear. A final rule implementing Amendment
24 was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 28, 1994 (59 FR 4009). That final rule specifies gear allocations of the 1994 Pacific cod TAC and seasonal
apportionments of the amount of Pacific cod TAC allocated to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear.

Regulations under &sect;675.24(c)(1) require that sablefish TACs for the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands subareas

proportions: Bering Sea subarea: trawl gear_50 percent; hook-and-line/pot gear_50 percent, and Aleutian Islands
subarea: trawl gear_25 percent; hook-and-line/pot gear_75 percent (Table 4).

The PSC limit of Pacific herring caught while conducting any trawl operation for groundfish in the BSAI is 1 percent
of the annual eastern Bering Sea herring biomass. The best estimate of 1994 herring biomass is 196,229 mt. This amount
was derived using 1993 survey data and an aged structured biomass projection model developed by the Alaska Department
of Fish and Game (ADF&amp;G). Complete analysis of the 1993 spawning data was provided by the ADF&amp;G at the Council's
December 1993 meeting. Therefore, the herring PSC limit for 1994 is 1,962 mt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations under &sect;675.21(b) authorize the apportionment of each PSC limit into bycatch allowances for specified
fishery categories. Regulations at &sect;675.21(b)(1)(iii) specify seven fishery categories (midwater pollock,
Greenland turbot/arrowtooth flounder/sablefish, rock sole/other flatfish, yellowfin sole, rockfish, Pacific
cod, and bottom pollock/Atka mackerel/``other species''). Regulations at &sect;675.21(b)(2) authorize the apportionment
of the non-trawl halibut PSC limit among three fishery categories (Pacific cod hook-and-line fishery, groundfish
pot gear fishery, and other non-trawl fisheries). The PSC allowances are listed in Table 5. In general, the fishery
bycatch allowances listed in Table 5 reflect the recommendations made to the Council by its AP. These recommendations
were based on 1993 bycatch amounts, anticipated 1994 harvest of groundfish by trawl gear and fixed gear, anticipated
changes in fishery bycatch needs pending approval of a final rule implementing Amendment 24, and assumed halibut
mortality rates in the different groundfish fisheries based on analyses of 1991&hyph;1993 observer data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1993, NMFS exempted groundfish pot gear fisheries from halibut bycatch restrictions in Amendment 21 to the FMP
(March 18, 1993, 58 FR 14524). During 1993, the halibut mortality associated with this groundfish catch was 2.5 mt,
based on an assumed halibut mortality rate of 5 percent. The Council recommended continuing to exempt groundfish
pot gear fisheries from halibut bycatch restrictions during the 1994 fisheries.

Regulations at &sect;675.21(b)(3) authorize the Secretary, after consultation with the Council, to establish
seasonal apportionments of prohibited species bycatch allowances among the fisheries to which bycatch has been
apportioned. Under &sect;675.21(b)(3), the basis for any such apportionment must be based on the following types
of information:

At its December 1993 meeting, the Council recommended that the halibut bycatch allowances listed in Table 5 be seasonally
apportioned as shown in Table 6, for yellowfin sole, rock sole/other flatfish, rockfish, and pollock/Atka mackerel/''other
species'' fishery categories. The recommended seasonal apportionments reflect recommendations made to the Council
by its AP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AP recommended seasonal apportionments of the halibut bycatch allowances specified for the yellowfin sole,
and rocksole/other flatfish fishery categories in anticipation of a 1994 rulemaking that would adjust the season
opening date for the BSAI yellowfin sole and ``other flatfish'' fisheries from May 1 to January 20. At its December
1993 meeting, the Council recommended that this action be implemented early in 1994 under an emergency interim rule.
The intent of the recommended season adjustment is to provide additional fishing opportunities in the BSAI early
in the year and reduce the incentive for trawl vessel operators to move from the BSAI to the Gulf of Alaska after the rock
sole roe fishery is closed, typically by the end of February. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AP recommended that 20 percent of halibut bycatch be apportioned to the rockfish fishery during the periods January
20 through April 1, and July 1 to December 31, and that 60 percent of the halibut bycatch be apportioned during the period
April 1 through July 1. The AP's recommendation was intended to provide a greater opportunity for participants in
this fishery to more fully harvest TAC amounts of all rockfish species within these recommended halibut bycatch apportionments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AP's recommended seasonal apportionment of the halibut bycatch allowance for the pollock/Atka mackerel/''other
species'' fishery category is based on the seasonal allowances of the Bering Sea pollock ITAC recommended for the
roe and non-roe seasons, and the assumption that most of the pollock taken during the roe season will be taken with pelagic
trawl gear with reduced halibut bycatch rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AP recommended a seasonal apportionment of the halibut bycatch allowance specified for the Pacific cod hook-and-line
gear fishery based on: (1) Anticipation that the proposed allocation of Pacific cod TAC among gear groups under Amendment
24 will be approved; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Most of the hook-and-line gear effort for Pacific cod will occur during the first half of 1994; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Council's desire to limit a hook-and-line fishery for Pacific cod during summer months when halibut bycatch
rates are high. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS approves the Council's recommendations for prohibited species bycatch allowances and seasonal apportionments.
The seasonal apportionments of the halibut bycatch allowances are intended to increase the harvest of the groundfish
OY by providing for directed groundfish fisheries when catches per unit of effort are high and corresponding halibut
species bycatch rates are relatively low.

For purposes of monitoring the fishery halibut bycatch mortality allowances specified in Table 6, the Regional Director
will use observed halibut bycatch rates and reported and observed groundfish catch to project when a fishery's halibut
bycatch mortality allowance is reached. The Regional Director monitors the fishery bycatch mortality allowances
using assumed mortality rates that are based on the best information available, including that contained in the final
annual SAFE report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assumed halibut mortality rates for halibut bycatch in 1994 are listed in Table 7. These rates are similar to those
used in 1993 and reflect mandatory careful release measures implemented during 1993 for the hook-and-line gear fisheries
(58 FR 28799, May 17, 1993). The derivation of mortality rates assumed for the trawl fishery is discussed in the preamble
to the final rule implementing halibut bycatch mortality limits (58 FR 14524, March 18, 1993). Assumed rates for the
hook-and-line gear fishery are explained in the rule implementing careful release procedures. Analysis of 1992
and 1993 observer data suggest that mortality rates for the hook-and-line gear fishery generally continue to reflect
1993 assumed rates. The assumed mortality rates listed in Table 7 reflect recommendations by the Council after review
of the International Pacific Halibut Commission and SSC recommendations. NMFS concurs with the Council's recommendations
as the best available information for 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
No PSC limits for groundfish species are specified in this action. Section 675.20(a)(6) authorizes NMFS to specify
PSC limits for groundfish species or species groups for which the TAC will be completely harvested by domestic fisheries.
These PSC limits apply only to JVP or TALFF fisheries. At this time, no groundfish are allocated to either JVP or TALFF
and specifications of groundfish PSC limits are unnecessary.

Closures to Directed Fishing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Fishing for groundfish in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands is authorized from January 1 through December 31, with
the following exceptions (&sect;675.23):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Directed fishing for yellowfin sole, ``other flatfish,'' arrowtooth flounder, and turbot is authorized from
May 1, 1994 to December 31, 1994, subject to the other provisions in the BSAI regulations;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Fishing for groundfish with trawl gear in the BSAI is prohibited until January 20, 1994;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Directed fishing for pollock by the inshore and offshore components, defined at &sect;675.2, is authorized from
January 1, 1994, through April 15, 1994, and August 15, 1994, through the end of the fishing year;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Directed fishing for pollock under the Western Alaska Community Development Quota Program is authorized from
January 1, 1994, through the end of the fishing year (&sect;675.23(e)); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Directed fishing with trawl gear in Zone 1 for rockfish, Greenland turbot, arrowtooth flounder and sablefish
is closed as there is no PSC to support this fishery (Table 5).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to these regulatory closures, the Council and NMFS annually recommend closures to directed fishing for
species needed as bycatch amounts in other directed fisheries. A principal consideration for the Council in developing
its 1994 TAC recommendations was ensuring that the sum of the species TACs did not exceed the maximum OY of 2 million
mt. After consideration of the amount of each species category TAC that is required for bycatch in other directed fisheries,
the Council and NMFS recommended that TAC amounts specified for the following species be closed to directed fishing:
(1) Pacific ocean perch in the Bering Sea; (2) other red rockfish in the Bering Sea; (3) shortraker/rougheye in the
Aleutian Islands; (4) other rockfish in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands; (5) arrowtooth flounder in the BSAI;
and (6) pollock in the Bogoslof district. Species or species groups identified in Table 8 will be necessary as incidental
catch to support other anticipated groundfish fisheries and TAC amounts for these species will be used for bycatch
purposes only. If NMFS determines the full TAC amount will not be used as bycatch, NMFS may open a directed fishery for
that species.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Through the amended Clean Air Act of 1990, Congress mandated that EPA promulgate new regulations requiring that gasoline
sold in certain areas be reformulated to reduce vehicle emissions of toxic and ozone-forming compounds. This document
finalizes the rules for the certification and enforcement of reformulated gasoline and provisions for unreformulated
or conventional gasoline.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Today's final rule is preceded by four previous notices: an initial notice proposing standards for reformulated
and conventional gasoline (NPRM) published on July 9, 1991 (56 FR 31176), a supplemental notice (SNPRM) published
on April 16, 1992 (57 FR 13416), an additional NPRM published on February 26, 1993 (58 FR 11722), and a notice of correction
for Phase II standards published on April 1, 1993 (58 FR 17175). Insofar as the rules finalized today mirror the proposed
standards, those previous documents may be referred to. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today's preamble explains the basis and purpose of the final rule, focusing on issues that have been revised since
the publication of the correction notice for the Phase II performance standards (58 FR 17175). Support documents,
including the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA), are available in Public Docket No. A&hyph;92&hyph;12.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The purpose of the reformulated gasoline regulations is to improve air quality by requiring that gasoline be reformulated
to reduce motor vehicle emissions of toxic and tropospheric ozone-forming compounds, as prescribed by section 211(k)(1)
of the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act), as amended. This section of the Act mandates that reformulated gasoline be sold
in the nine largest metropolitan areas with the most severe summertime ozone levels and other ozone nonattainment
areas that opt into the program. It also prohibits conventional gasoline sold in the rest of the country from becoming
any more polluting than it was in 1990. This requirement ensures that refiners do not ``dump'' fuel components that
are restricted in reformulated gasoline and that cause environmentally harmful emissions into conventional gasoline.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 211(k)(l) directs EPA to issue regulations that, beginning in 1995, ``require the greatest reduction in
emissions of ozone-forming and toxic air pollutants (``toxics'') achievable through the reformulation of conventional
gasoline, taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reductions, any non air-quality and other
air-quality related health and environmental impacts and energy requirements.'' The Act mandates certain requirements
for the reformulated gasoline program. Section 211(k)(3) specifies that the minimum requirement for reductions
of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and toxics for 1995 through 1999, or Phase I of the reformulated gasoline program,
must require the more stringent of either a formula fuel or an emission reductions performance standard, measured
on a mass basis, equal to 15 percent of baseline emissions. Baseline emissions are the emissions of 1990 model year
vehicles operated on a specified baseline gasoline. CAA compositional specifications for reformulated gasoline
include a 2.0 weight percent oxygen minimum and a 1.0 volume percent benzene maximum. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the year 2000 and beyond, the Act specifies that the VOC and toxics performance standards must be no less than that
of the formula fuel or a 25 percent reduction from baseline emissions, whichever is more stringent. EPA can adjust
this standard upward or downward taking into account such factors as feasibility and cost, but in no case can it be less
than 20 percent. These are known as the Phase II reformulated gasoline performance standards. Taken together, sections
211(k)(1) and 211(k)(3) call for the Agency to set standards that achieve the most stringent level of control, taking
into account the specified factors, but no less stringent than those described by section 211(k)(3).

(RIA), and Public Dockets A&hyph;91&hyph;02 and A&hyph;92&hyph;12 for a thorough description of the goals and regulatory
development of the reformulated and anti-dumping programs and discussions of a number of associated technical issues.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
A. Regulatory Negotiation (Reg Neg) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Shortly after passage of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, EPA entered into a regulatory negotiation with interested
parties to develop specific proposals for implementing both the reformulated gasoline and related anti-dumping
programs. These parties included representatives of the oil and automobile industries, vehicle owners, state air
pollution control officials, oxygenate suppliers, gasoline retailers, environmental organizations, and citizens'
groups. (See the 1991 NPRM for the members of the negotiating committee and a discussion of the process for selecting
them.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In August 1991 the committee reached consensus on a program outline and signed an ``Agreement in Principle'' describing
that consensus. EPA agreed to propose a two-step approach to reformulated gasoline. The first step would take effect
in 1995 and utilize a ``simple model'' to certify that a gasoline meets applicable emission reduction standards.
The simple model allows certification based on a fuel's oxygen, benzene, heavy metal and aromatics content and Reid
Vapor Pressure (RVP). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the second step, according to the regulatory negotiation agreement, EPA would propose a ``complex model''
to supplant the simple model for certifying compliance with these standards. Certification under the complex model
would take effect 4 years after it is promulgated. EPA also agreed to propose the more stringent Phase II emission performance
standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
B. July 9, 1991 NPRM (56 FR 31176) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The first NPRM for the reformulated gasoline program was published prior to the conclusion on the regulatory negotiations.
Normally, in a negotiated rulemaking, such a reg-neg committee meets to develop a proposed rule which will be acceptable
to all parties. If consensus is reached on a proposed rule, it is published as an NPRM. The committee members and the
entities they represent agree to support the proposal and not to seek judicial review of the final rule if it has the
same substance and effect as the consensus proposal. In this case, EPA published an NPRM while the advisory committee
was still conducting negotiations. The Agency believed that although consensus of the members on an acceptable rule
was possible, an NPRM was required at that time in order to meet the statutory deadline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1991 NPRM described the provisions of both a program to require the sale of gasoline which reduces emissions of
toxics and ozone-forming volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in certain nonattainment areas and a program to prohibit
the gasoline sold in the rest of the country from becoming more polluting. The 1991 notice described the outline of
the reformulated gasoline program as required by statutory provisions and options that the regulatory negotiation
committee members were considering. Topics included in the 1991 proposal consisted of the derivation of the emission
standards, fuel certification by modeling, opt-in provisions, credits, anti-dumping requirements, and enforcement
provisions for all aspects of the reformulated gasoline program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
C. April 16, 1992 SNPRM (57 FR 13416) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
As noted above, the Agency's SNPRM (57 FR 13416) reflected the agreement reached in the regulatory negotiation that
had been conducted to develop reformulated gasoline regulations under section 211(k). The Supplemental Notice
of Proposed Rulemaking (SNPRM) described the standards and enforcement scheme for both reformulated and conventional
gasoline. It also included specific proposals for the simple emission model to be used in gasoline certification
and enforcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
D. February 26, 1993 NPRM (58 FR 11722) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In their comments on the SNPRM, the ethanol industry expressed concern that the reformulated gasoline rulemaking,
as proposed in the SNPRM, effectively excluded ethanol from the reformulated gasoline market. In an attempt to address
their concern, the Agency proposed an ethanol incentive program, at the direction of former President Bush, intended
to promote the use of ethanol (and other renewable oxygenates) in reformulated gasoline. The objective of the proposed
renewable oxygenate program was to enhance the market share for renewable oxygenates while, theoretically, maintaining
the overall environmental benefits of the reformulated gasoline simple model. This would be accomplished by offsetting
any increase in volatility that may result from the inclusion of ethanol with volatility reductions that occur in
the rest of the RFG pool. This volatility balancing, however would not take into account any increase in volatility
in-use due to mixing of ethanol and non-ethanol gasoline blends (commingling). The renewable oxygenate program
would not be required in class B areas (the South) unless a state requested inclusion in the program. Thus, the NPRM
(58 FR 11722) for reformulated gasoline proposed revisions to the simple model, as well as to the associated anti-dumping,
and enforcement provisions. Also included in the NPRM were the proposed complex model for certification of reformulated
gasoline and the proposed Phase II performance standards. The complex model is now scheduled to take effect January
1, 1998. The complex model will provide a method of certification based on the fuel characteristics such as oxygen,
benzene, aromatics, RVP, sulfur, olefins and the percent of fuel evaporated at 200 and 300 degrees Fahrenheit (E200
and E300, respectively). The NPRM also proposed Phase II standards for reformulated gasoline which are to take effect
in the year 2000, as prescribed by section 211(k)(3) of the Clean Air Act (CAA). The proposed VOC performance standard
was 20&hyph;32 percent for class B and 26&hyph;35 percent for class C. EPA proposed to set the toxic standard at 20 or
25 percent reduction since additional toxics control was not found to be cost effective and, in most cases, these greater
toxics reductions were expected to occur through fuel reformulation for VOC control. The NPRM also included proposed
NO

E. Discussion of Major Comments and Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA received a number of comments on the first NPRM (56 FR 31176), the SNPRM (57 FR 13416), and the latest NPRM (58 FR 11722)
for reformulated and conventional gasoline. Comments covered a wide range of topics including regulatory procedure,
certification standards, modeling emissions by the simple and complex models, the role of ethanol and other oxygenates
in reformulated gasoline, vehicle testing, the anti-dumping program, Phase II standards, cost-effectiveness,
and a number of enforcement-related issues. EPA has conducted an analysis of the comments received and duly considered
the significant issues. Summaries of these comments and EPA's responses to them are contained in the Final Regulatory

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the publication of the NPRM, the Agency has continued to develop the complex model. The first revisions of the
complex emissions model since 1993 NPRM publication for reformulated gasoline have been provided to the public at
a June 2, 1993 public workshop. EPA developed several complex model options in July which was provided to the public.
In October of 1993, a draft version of the final complex model was released for public inspection as well. All the iterations
of the complex model since the publication of the 1993 NPRM have been available to the public via a public electronic
bulletin board and in submittals to the EPA Air Docket, Docket No. A&hyph;92&hyph;12. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All the various components of this rulemaking are being finalized in today's notice. The additional time has allowed
adequate public review of the complex model and its implications for the reformulated gasoline Phase II standards.

A. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The April 16, 1992 proposal of the Simple Model and Phase I standards was designed to be fuel and oxygenate neutral.
Ethanol, however, when added to gasoline in the amount needed to satisfy the oxygen content requirement of the Act
raises the Reid vapor pressure (RVP) of the resulting blend by about 1 psi, making it more difficult for ethanol blends
to meet the mass VOC performance standards than blends using other oxygenates. For ethanol to be blended with the RFG,
a blendstock gasoline with an RVP low enough to offset the increase resulting from adding ethanol would have to be obtained.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ethanol industry representatives commented that obtaining such blendstocks would be both difficult and expensive,
because ``sub-RVP'' blendstocks would be more costly to refine and because blendstock production would be controlled
by petroleum refiners. Methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), an oxygenate which does not boost a fuel's RVP, which is
derived from methanol gas and the petroleum product isobutylene and whose blends can readily be put through petroleum
pipelines, was thought to be the oxygenate of choice for most refiners. Ethanol's representatives theorized that
the oil industry would have a desire to use MTBE over ethanol and, thus, little incentive to make the sub-RVP blendstock
necessary for ethanol blending. The ethanol industry contended that a reformulated gasoline program which they
argued would effectively preclude ethanol was contrary to Congress' intent that ethanol have a role in the program.
They argued that the oxygen content requirement of section 211(k)(2) was motivated in large part by a desire to expand
markets for ethanol. They noted the strong support afforded the RFG legislative initiative by members of Congress
from agricultural states. They also cited statements in the legislative history indicating some members' expectation
that the RFG program would provide an increasing market for ethanol. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ethanol representatives contended that the benefits of ethanol use justify its inclusion in the RFG program. Specifically,
they explained that ethanol is currently made in the United States from domestically-grown grains, primarily corn,
and thus represents an important domestic and renewable source of energy. They further explained that to the extent
ethanol is used in place of imported petroleum products, it promotes the nation's energy independence and improves
its balance of trade, and that ethanol use also strengthens the market for corn, consequently reducing the need for
price supports. Moreover, as a biomass-based product, ethanol is potentially a renewable fuel to the extent the energy
derived exceeds any fossil fuel energy consumed in producing the ethanol.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In view of ethanol's importance to the nation's energy security and agricultural economy, ethanol representatives
urged that the proposal be revised to allow ethanol to effectively participate in the RFG market. They suggested several
possible revisions. For example, they argued that the 1 psi waiver granted to certain ethanol blends by section 211(h)
of the CAA be applied to ethanol-blended RFG under section 211(k). They reasoned that since Congress recognized in
the provision requiring nationwide reductions in fuel RVP that ethanol required such a waiver, ethanol should receive
a similar waiver if the VOC performance standard for RFG sold in the smoggiest cities were defined in terms of a required
reduction in RVP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the section 211(h) waiver were not available to RFG ethanol blends, the ethanol industry suggested that the VOC
reduction requirement take into account that specific VOCs from various reformulated gasolines differ in their
ozone formation potential. While ethanol raises a fuel's volatility and thus its VOC emissions, they argued that
the resulting VOCs are less ozone-forming than those that would otherwise occur. They urged that the 15 percent reduction
requirement should thus be interpreted to require a 15 percent reduction in ozone-forming potential, not simply
mass of ozone-forming VOCs. Ethanol supporters suggested additional ways of encouraging or even requiring ethanol
use in RFG. The Governors Ethanol Coalition, for instance, suggested that EPA require the RFG market to satisfy its
oxygenate requirements through a minimum percentage of domestically produced renewable fuel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on ethanol's importance to the nation's energy and agricultural policy, President Bush on October 1, 1992 announced
a plan to allow ethanol to effectively compete in the RFG program, with the expectation that, with barriers removed,
ethanol use would grow. In lieu of an RVP waiver, or inclusion of ozone reactivity this plan was based upon provisions
of section 211(k)(1) allowing the Administrator to take into consideration cost, energy requirements, and other
specified factors in setting RFG performance standards. The most significant part of this plan called for EPA to ``establish
rules for reformulated gasoline in all northern cities that will have the effect of granting a one-pound waiver for
the first 30 percent market share of ethanol blends, while achieving environmental benefits comparable to those
provided for in EPA's proposed rule and regulatory negotiation.'' The environmental benefits of the proposed RFG
program would be maintained by offsetting any increase in volatility of RFG containing ethanol with reductions in
the volatility of the rest of the reformulated gasoline pool. In response to the announcement by former President
Bush, EPA proposed on February 26, 1993 provisions to provide an RVP (and VOC) incentive for the use in reformulated
gasoline of renewable oxygenates such as ethanol.

B. Concerns With the Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the time of the February 26, 1993 proposal, EPA had a number of concerns with respect to its legality, energy benefits,
and environmental neutrality. Nevertheless, we proposed the provisions for public comment in the hope that these
concerns could be overcome based on new data and information developed in-house or received through public comment.
Since the time of the proposal these concerns have been enhanced. Additional data and information has been developed
which indicates that energy benefits would be unlikely to occur as a result of the proposal. While the production of
much of the ethanol in the country produces on the margin more energy and uses less petroleum than went into its production,
a recent study by the Department of Energy (refer to DOE's comments on the proposal) indicates that the margin disappears
when ethanol is mixed with gasoline. The energy loss and additional petroleum consumption necessary to reduce the
volatility of the blend to offset the volatility increase caused by the ethanol causes the energy balance and petroleum
balance to go negative. Since the potential energy benefits were the basis in the proposal for providing the incentives
for renewable oxygenates, the justification for the proposal no longer exists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional data and information has also been developed which indicates that VOC emissions would increase significantly
under the proposal. As discussed in section I of the RIA, the commingling effect of mixing ethanol blends with non-ethanol
blends in consumer's fuel tanks, the effect of ethanol on the distillation curve of the blend, and unrestricted early
use of the complex model combined result in roughly a 6&hyph;7.5% increase in gasoline vehicle VOC emissions even
though there is no increase in the average RVP of in-use gasoline. As a result, the proposal would have sacrificed 40
to 50 percent of the VOC control that is required under section 211(k) for reformulated gasoline in exchange for incentives
for what is likely to have been only a marginal increase in the market share of ethanol in reformulated gasoline and
no energy benefits or cost savings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in section I of the RIA, ethanol is not excluded from competing in the reformulated gasoline market under
the provisions of the April 16, 1992 SNPRM. As a result of the economic advantage of ethanol over other oxygenates,
ethanol should maintain a significant market share under the reformulated gasoline program even without the renewable
oxygenate incentives proposed in the February 16, 1993 proposal. As a result, the actual ethanol market share increase
as a result of the renewable oxygenate provisions would be expected to be far less than the maximum of 30% for which incentives
were provided. Given the relatively small increase in ethanol demand as a result of the renewable oxygenate provisions
in exchange for such a large loss in the environmental control of the reformulated gasoline program, there does not
appear to be any justification for promulgating these provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, comments were received from virtually all parties, including ethanol industry representatives,
that the proposal was unworkable and would significantly increase the cost of the reformulated gasoline program.
While EPA maintains that the program would have provided an economic incentive for the use of renewable oxygenates
in reformulated gasoline up to a 30% market share, EPA acknowledges that the proposal would have intruded into the
efficient operation of the marketplace, impacting the cost of the reformulated gasoline program. As a result, after
taking into account the cost, non-air quality and environmental impacts, and energy impacts, EPA has found itself
with no choice but to back away from the renewable oxygenate provisions of the February 26, 1993 proposal.

C. Provisions for the Final Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In lieu of the renewable oxygenate proposal, EPA investigated a number of options aimed at making the program more
workable by reducing the fuel tracking, recordkeeping, and enforcement burden associated with the proposal. While
such options tended to make the program more workable from the standpoint of the refining and fuel distribution processes,
they also tended to either reduce the assurance that the environmental benefits of the program would be achieved in
all areas covered by the RFG program, or to place additional restrictions on the flexibility contained in the proposal
for blending ethanol into gasoline. Given this and the other concerns with the proposal (cost, lack of energy benefits,
significant environmental loss, etc.), EPA did not believe these options to be appropriate or justifiable either
under the provisions of section 211(k) of the Act. The reader is referred to the Final Regulatory Impact Analysis for
a detailed discussion of the renewable oxygenate program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters suggested alternative provisions (1.0 psi RVP waiver for ethanol blends, inclusion of ozone
reactivity in the standard setting process, mandates for refiners to provide clear gasoline blendstock for downstream
blending with ethanol, etc.) to the proposed renewable oxygenate program to allow ethanol to play a larger role in
the reformulated gasoline program. It was argued that without such provisions ethanol would be excluded from the
market entirely in direct conflict with the intent of Congress in the CAA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA, however, does not agree that ethanol is excluded from competing in the reformulated gasoline marketplace under
the provisions of the April 16, 1992 proposal. In fact, as under the recently implemented wintertime oxygenated fuels
program, ethanol is expected to significantly increase its market share under the reformulated gasoline program,
especially in Midwestern areas where ethanol enjoys State tax incentives and relatively low distribution costs.
In addition, not only is ethanol expected to compete as an alcohol, but it also may compete with methanol as an ether
feedstock in the future. As a result, EPA believes that the treatment of ethanol blends under the April 16, 1992 proposal
is entirely consistent with the intent of Congress as expressed in section 211(k) of the CAA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The alternative provisions (1.0 psi RVP waiver for ethanol blends, inclusion of ozone reactivity in the standard
setting process, mandates for refiners to provide clear gasoline blendstock for downstream blending with ethanol,
etc.) suggested by various commenters to further enhance the competitiveness of ethanol in the reformulated gasoline
program are not appropriate. These provisions are both outside of EPA's legal authority under the CAA, and indefensible
from an environmental and scientific standpoint. The 1.0 psi waiver for example, could easily forfeit all VOC emission
reductions otherwise achieved by the reformulated gasoline program. A move away from the mass based standards of
the Act to reactivity based standards is not only unsupportable on the basis of the available scientific information,
but even if EPA were able to do so, it would be unlikely to provide any significant advantage for ethanol blends. As discussed
in section I of the RIA, the recent urban airshed modeling studies claiming that ethanol blends with a 1.0 psi waiver
do not increase ozone relative to an MTBE blended reformulated gasoline are frought with invalid assumptions and
inconsistencies and are not applicable to the reformulated gasoline situation. As a result, they provide no credible
scientific support for special provisions for ethanol in the context of the reformulated gasoline program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the lack of justification for the renewable oxygenate provisions of the February 26, 1993 proposal, the options
considered for simplifying that proposal, and other alternative provisions recommended by commenters, EPA is,
thus, basing the oxygenate-related provisions of the final rule on the provisions as proposed in the April 16, 1992
proposal. Despite this decision, EPA still believes ethanol will be able to compete favorably in the reformulated
gasoline market either as a direct additive or as an ether feedstock as discussed above. As such, EPA believes that
the nationwide production of ethanol will increase as a result of this rulemaking with corresponding benefits to
our Nation's agricultural sector. However, the increase may not be as large as it otherwise would have been had an incentive
program been promulgated for ethanol. The reader is referred to section I. of the RIA for additional description of
the comments and information which led up to this decision.

III. Simple Model for Reformulated Gasoline Compliance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 211(k) of the Clean Air Act, EPA requires that in order for a gasoline to be certified as reformulated,
it must contain at least 2.0 weight percent oxygen, no more than 1.0 volume percent benzene, and no heavy metals (unless
a waiver is granted); result in no increase in NO

, and toxics emission requirements effective between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 1997 and EPA's derivation of
them are set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and toxics requirements of reformulated gasoline are contained in this rulemaking. The first, by use of a ``Simple
Model,'' is described in this section. A second method, the use of the ``Complex Model'' is described in Section IV.
Provisions for augmenting the Complex Model through vehicle testing are described in Section V. For reasons set forth
in the April 16, 1992 SNPRM (57 FR 13417&hyph;13418) and discussed Section V, vehicle testing is not an option as a separate,
stand-alone method of certification. First, models can better reflect in-use emission effects since they can be
based on the results of multiple test programs. Second, individual test programs may be biased, either intentionally
or unintentionally. Third, fuel compositions tend to vary due in part to factors beyond the control of fuel suppliers,
potentially requiring testing of each batch if a model is not used. Finally, models make more efficient use of scarce
and expensive emissions effects data than is otherwise possible. For these reasons, EPA believes that the modeling
options promulgated by EPA are necessary for the reformulated gasoline program to achieve its environmental objectives
and to minimize the costs of the program. Comments were received suggesting that EPA allow certification based on
testing as an optional means of certification. However, for the same reasons discussed above, EPA does not believe
such an option would be appropriate. EPA would have much less certainty that the results of the test program were valid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the time of the simple model proposal, while a number of fuel parameters were thought to impact emissions, data were
sufficient for only a few of these parameters (Reid vapor pressure, fuel oxygen, benzene, and aromatics) to quantify
their effect with reasonable accuracy for use in an emissions model. For those additional parameters which were thought
to impact emissions in a directionally clear, but as of yet unquantifiable manner (sulfur, T90, and olefins), EPA
proposed that they be capped at the refiner's 1990 average level to prevent emission effects from changes in their
levels from undercutting the emission reductions achieved by the parameters contained in the simple model. The effect
of aromatics on VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions was also unclear, but instead of being capped, it was believed that the level of aromatics would be controlled
by the role aromatics plays in the formation of air toxics emissions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data is now available to accurately quantify not only the effects of RVP, oxygen, benzene, and aromatics on emissions,
but also sulfur, T90 (or E300), olefins, and T50 (or E200). The effects of these fuel parameters are incorporated into
the Complex Model described in Section IV.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Complex Model is the most accurate and complete model currently available for use in the reformulated gasoline
program. Absent any other considerations, EPA would require use of the Complex Model for purposes of certification.
However, based on leadtime considerations, EPA is allowing use of either the Simple or Complex Model during the first
three years of the reformulated gasoline program as proposed. These lead time considerations were described in the
April 1992 proposal (57 FR 13417&hyph;8). EPA is providing four years leadtime before use of the Complex Model is mandatory
to allow the regulated industry adequate time to plan and design necessary refinery modifications, obtain necessary
permits and capital, complete construction, and complete start-up and equipment shakedown. Furthermore, EPA has
every confidence that on average the refiners certifying their fuel using the Simple Model will achieve the emission
reductions that Congress intended for the reformulated gasoline program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Various comments were received criticizing the use of the Simple Model for fuel certification, stating that it had
limited flexibility, discouraged innovation, penalized refiners producing cleaner than average gasoline in 1990,
and should be scrapped. Many of these comments would appear to be resolved by the option available for early use of the
Complex Model. Therefore, in keeping with the need to provide adequate lead time and the fact that compliance with
the Simple Model will produce the mandatory VOC and toxic emission reductions, refiners will be permitted to use the
simple model for certification until December 31, 1997. Until this date, fuel suppliers will have the option of using
the complex model instead of the simple model to take advantage of the effects of parameters contained in the complex
model but not contained in the simple model (as described in the following paragraphs). The reader is referred to the
April 16, 1992 SNPRM for more discussion of these lead time provisions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The simple model for VOC emissions is comprised of fuel specifications for RVP and oxygen. Fuels sold at retail outlets
must have an RVP during the high ozone season (June 1 through September 15) of no more than 7.2 psi in VOC control region
1 (the southern areas typically covered by ASTM class B during the summer) and 8.1 psi in VOC control region 2 (the northern
areas typically covered by ASTM class C during the summer).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The differences in climate between these two types of areas requires a corresponding difference in gasoline volatility
to achieve the same emissions effect. The period of June 1 through September 15 was chosen for the high ozone season
because most of the ozone violations occur during this period. (See 56 FR 24242 for a discussion of the determination
of this period.)

Section 211(k)(3) of the Act requires that at a minimum reformulated gasoline comply with the more stringent of either
a 15% reduction in VOC emissions or a formula fuel described in that section, whichever is greater. EPA has determined
that the formula fuel would achieve less than a 15% reduction in VOC. As such, the minimum VOC emission reduction required
by the Act is 15%. As discussed in section IV, EPA believes that the VOC emission reduction in VOC control region 2 from
a fuel with an RVP of 8.1 psi and 2.0 weight percent oxygen will be sufficient to achieve the minimum 15% VOC emission
reduction relative to the Clean Air Act baseline gasoline (which has an RVP of 8.7 psi). In VOC control region 1, an 8.1
psi RVP fuel with 2.0 percent oxygen (which would meet the minimum 15% reduction requirement relative to the CAA baseline
fuel) would actually have greater emissions than a fuel meeting EPA's Phase II RVP control standards for VOC control
region 1 (maximum RVP of 7.8 psi). EPA believes that when Congress designated cities for inclusion in the reformulated
gasoline program that it intended the program to provide emissions reductions in addition to those provided by the
Phase II RVP requirements. If EPA merely required reformulated gasoline in VOC control region 1 to meet the RVP requirement
for VOC control region 2, then no reduction in VOC emissions would accrue under the first phase of the reformulated
gasoline program beyond those mandated by Phase II RVP standards. EPA projects that relative to Phase II RVP control
levels, a fuel with 7.2 psi RVP and 2.0 weight percent oxygen would provide VOC emission reductions in VOC control region
1 similar to those obtained in VOC control region 2.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While requiring reformulated gasoline sold in VOC control region 1 to have an RVP of no more than 7.2 psi goes beyond
the minimum requirement stated in section 211(k)(3), section 211(k)(1) authorizes EPA to require emission reductions
in VOC control region 1 of this magnitude because they are achievable considering costs, other air quality and non-air
quality impacts, and the energy implications of such a requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, EPA believes that additional VOC reductions are obtainable if refiners are allowed to meet the RVP and
oxygen standards through averaging. If refiners wish to take advantage of averaging, EPA thus will require their
average RVP for both VOC control regions 1 and 2 to be reduced by 0.1 psi to 7.1 and 8.0 psi, respectively, and the average
oxygen concentration to be increased to 2.1 weight percent oxygen. For additional discussion of the rationale for
the more stringent standard in VOC control region 1 and the increase in stringency of the averaging standards, the
reader is referred to the April 16, 1992 SNPRM.

an E300 are only constrained to the refiner's 1990 baseline levels (aromatics is controlled indirectly to some degree
by the toxics requirement). As a result, there is no assurance under the simple model that oxygenate addition will

A state may make a request for the 2.7 wt% oxygen limit to apply during the non-ozone season when it believes that the
use of higher oxygenate levels would interfere with attainment or maintenance of another ambient air quality standard
(other than ozone) or another air quality problem. This proposal parallels the Regulatory Negotiation Agreement
of August 16, 1991 and EPA's letter to the Renewable Fuels Association dated August 14, 1991.

C. Simple Toxics Emissions Model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 211(k)(3), EPA must at a minimum require the more stringent of either a specified formula fuel or a 15
percent reduction in toxics emissions from that of baseline gasoline. All five of the toxic air pollutants that section
211(k)(10) of the Act specifies for control through reformulated gasoline (benzene, 1,3-butadiene, polycyclic
organic matter (POM), formaldehyde, and acetaldehyde) also fall under the category of VOCs. Exhaust emissions include
unburned benzene and benzene formed from other aromatics during the combustion process. Benzene, an aromatic compound,
is a natural component of gasoline and, as such, is present in evaporative, running loss and refueling emissions (nonexhaust
emissions). However, nonexhaust VOC and benzene emissions data are only available in sufficient quantities under
high ozone test conditions. Therefore, nonexhaust benzene emissions are not considered outside of the high ozone
season. The four other toxic air pollutants subject to control by reformulated gasoline are not present in gasoline
and hence are solely products of combustion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The equations that represent the simple model for air toxics emissions are shown in section 80.42 of the regulations.
The derivation and referenced work is given in the regulatory impact analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Only minor changes were made to the proposed simple toxics model. One change excluded ethane from the exhaust VOC baseline
emissions as discussed below in Section III.D.3. The weight fractions of the various toxics as a function of VOC have
also been adjusted accordingly, resulting in no net change in predicted toxics performance for a particular fuel.
At the request of commenters, EPA has also included the oxygenates tertiary amyl methal ether (TAME) and ethyl tertiary
amyl ether (ETAE) as well as provisions for other oxygenates and mixed oxygenates. Due to their similar chemical makeup,
methyl ethers (such as TAME) and ethyl ethers (such as ETAE) are to be modeled using the same equations as for MTBE and
as for ETBE, respectively. Higher alcohols will be modeled using the same equations as for ethanol. Higher ethers
will be modeled as ETBE for all air toxics, since ETBE was the highest ether for which toxics data were available.

D. Baseline Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Where the performance standard is more stringent than the formula, the Act requires EPA to promulgate standards for
the performance of reformulated gasoline that are relative to emission levels from baseline vehicles using baseline
fuel. In order to determine whether fuels meet the performance requirements of reformulated gasoline under the simple
model, EPA must therefore establish the baseline to which the emission performance of reformulated fuels are to be
compared. The following discussion describes how EPA derived the emission baselines.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before the emission baselines can be determined, the time frame over which fuel performance will be evaluated must
be identified. Section 211(k) of the Act requires control of VOC emissions during the ``high ozone season.'' For the
purposes of this rulemaking, the high ozone season is defined to be June 1 through September 15. This period covers
the vast majority of days during which the national ambient air quality standard for ozone is exceeded nationwide
and is consistent with the period covered by EPA's gasoline volatility control requirements. All gasoline at service
stations must thus comply with the reformulated gasoline requirements during this period. Also in keeping with the
gasoline volatility control rulemaking the ``VOC control Period'' for compliance with the reformulated gasoline
provisions upstream from the service station (necessary to ensure complying fuel is available at the service stations
during the high ozone season) is May 1 through September 15.

3. Definition of Ozone-Forming VOC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The Act requires reductions in emissions of ozone-forming VOCs. This interpretation is consistent with the focus
of Section 211(k) on the areas with the most extreme ozone pollution problem. EPA proposed in April 16, 1992 that methane
would be excluded from the definition of VOC on the basis of its low reactivity in keeping with past EPA actions, but
included all other VOCs including ethane. EPA further proposed, however, that should the Agency modify the definition
of VOC, we might do so for the reformulated gasoline rulemaking as well. As discussed in the February 26, 1993 proposal,
EPA has also modified the definition of VOC to exclude ethane in a separate Agency rulemaking (57 FR 3941). As a result,
the performance of fuels meeting the VOC emission requirements under the simple model are expressed on a non-methane,
non-ethane basis. This change resulted in slight changes to the simple model equations previously proposed, but
the overall results of the simple model are essentially unaffected.

The following table shows the baseline emissions under the simple model which result from the assumptions discussed
above. Since the MOBILE model does not estimate toxics emissions, however, separate data and information was necessary
to determine their baseline emissions. The toxics baseline was developed in essentially the same manner as that proposed
in the April 16, 1992 proposal. An explanation of this derivation can be found in Section II of the RIA.

E. Phase I Performance Standards Under the Simple Model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Section 211(k)(3) directs EPA to require, at minimum, that Phase I reformulated gasoline comply with the more stringent
of two alternative VOC and toxics emission requirements_either a performance standard of a 15 percent reduction
from baseline levels on a mass basis, or compositional requirements specified as a formula in Section 211(k)(3)(A).
The formula effectively defines a set of maximum or minimum fuel parameter specifications. In evaluating which requirement
is more stringent, EPA is to consider VOC and toxics separately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The stringency of the formula is best evaluated by determining the emissions performance of the fuels that would be
certifiable if EPA were to impose the requirements of Section 211(k)(3)(A). A gasoline would meet these requirements
if it (1) had no more than 1.0 volume percent benzene, (2) had no more than 25 volume percent aromatics, (3) had no less
than 2.0 weight percent oxygen, and (4) met the requirements for detergent additives and lead content. The formula
does not specify or limit any additional gasoline properties, and therefore a wide variety of fuels with very different
properties would qualify as complying with the formula. For example, the formula specifies the weight percent oxygen
but does not specify the type of oxygenate. If EPA were to impose the requirements of Section 211(k)(3)(A), then any
approved oxygenate could be used to meet the formula's oxygen requirement, as long as it was blended to achieve the
required weight percent oxygen. The same would be true of sulfur levels, distillation characteristics, olefin levels,
RVP levels, and so on. As long as the formula's requirements were met, the fuel would be certifiable if EPA were to base
its certification requirements on Section 211(k)(3)(A). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To evaluate the emissions performance of the various fuels that would comply with the formula requirements, EPA used
the Phase I complex model. Given the Phase I baseline emission levels, EPA considers the complex model to be the most
appropriate means of evaluating emissions performance since it incorporates the Agency's most recent, complete,
and accurate knowledge of the effects of fuel properties on VOC and toxics emissions. Since many of the fuel parameters
that are not specified for the formula affect VOC and toxics emissions, the various possible formula fuels exhibit
a wide variety of emission performance levels as these unspecified parameters vary. According to the Complex Model,
requirements based on many possible formula fuels would be less stringent than requirements based on the 15 percent
minimum reduction requirements of Section (211)(k)(3)(B). In addition, the lack of specificity of the formula fuel
would make establishment of an equivalent emissions performance standard impossible, since one or more possible
formula fuels would fail to meet any specific standard.

In past proposals, EPA has evaluated the formula fuel by assigning levels for unspecified parameters at their level
in baseline gasoline, as defined in section 211(k)(9)(B) of the Act. However, such an interpretation would not eliminate
the problems described above, since the oxygenate type would remain unspecified. Hence the requirements of a formula
could be met by a range of fuels, each based on different oxygenates, even if unspecified parameters were to be set to
baseline levels, and this range of fuels would exhibit a range of emission performance levels. While the Complex Model
attributes identical effects to oxygen in different chemical forms for most pollutants, it incorporates emission
effects that depend on the type of oxygenate used for nonexhaust benzene, acetaldehyde, and formaldehyde emissions.
EPA therefore ran the complex model for several fuels, varying the type of oxygenate and holding other parameters
not specified by the formula at statutory baseline levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The VOC emission reductions from baseline levels for all such formula fuels were less than 15 percent. EPA therefore
based the VOC emission requirements for Phase I reformulated gasoline on the 15 percent reduction minimum performance
standard, since this standard is more stringent than the requirements of the formula. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For toxics performance, EPA separately evaluated the emissions performance of fuels that met the formula requirements
and contained statutory baseline levels of unspecified fuel properties for VOC control regions 1 and 2, since nonexhaust
benzene emissions would differ in these two regions. EPA also evaluated such fuels with different oxygenate types.
The results are shown in Table II&hyph;3. These results include both summer and winter effects, weighted based on
the share of vehicle miles traveled in each season.

The results indicate that whether a formula fuel (with unspecified fuel parameters at statutory baseline levels)
meets the 15% minimum performance requirement of section 211(k)(3)(B) depends on the type of oxygenate used. If EPA
were to impose the formula requirements of section 211(k)(3)(A), the results presented in Table II&hyph;3 indicate
that not all gasolines which could be certified as reformulated would achieve at least a 15 percent reduction in toxics
mass emissions, even if unspecified fuel properties were set at statutory baseline levels. If EPA were to require
a 15 percent emissions reduction in accordance with section 211(k)(3)(B), however, all fuels would achieve this
minimum level of reductions. EPA therefore believes that the formula requirements of section 211(k)(3)(A) are not
as stringent as the performance standard set forth in Section 211(k)(3)(B). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The minimum performance standard for Phase II is even more stringent than the Phase I standards. EPA has therefore
determined that the performance standard is more stringent than the formula for both VOCs and toxics, for both Phase
I and Phase II. EPA must therefore set its Phase I requirements for both VOCs and toxics to be no less stringent than the
15 percent emission reduction performance standard required by section 211(k)(3)(B). EPA has considered whether
it should require greater reductions in toxics mass emissions than that required by the 15 percent minimum performance
standard. However, the Agency has concluded that more stringent toxics requirements are not cost-effective, as
is discussed more fully in Section VI. Hence EPA has set the Phase I toxic emission performance standard at the minimum
15 percent reduction from baseline levels required by the Act. Compliance with this standard must be demonstrated
using the appropriate emission models throughout Phase I. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the authority of section 211(k)(1), EPA believes that the greater flexibility and reduced cost afforded to
gasoline refiners and importers by an averaging program allow EPA to require a greater reduction in toxics emissions
than is required under section 211(k)(3). As discussed in Section VII, the Agency believes it appropriate, when the
air toxics standard is met on average, that it be 1.5 percentage points more stringent than standards met on a per-gallon
basis. EPA estimates that the approximate 1.5 percentage point margin will be sufficient to recoup any compliance
margin refiners would have otherwise had to maintain to ensure achievement of the toxics requirements in the absence
of an averaging program. In sum, the tighter averaged standard should have the potential to increase the environmental
benefits of the reformulated gasoline program while not increasing the cost of obtaining those benefits. As a result,
the air toxics performance standard when met on an annual average basis is set at a 16.5% reduction from baseline levels.

The Simple Model described in this section is effective beginning January 1, 1995 with the beginning of the reformulated
gasoline program as a means by which fuel producers can certify that their fuel meets the requirements for reformulated
gasoline. The Complex Model described in Section IV will not be required to be used for fuel certification until January
1, 1998.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Until January 1, 1998, refiners who produce reformulated gasoline will have a choice of certifying their gasoline
by using either the Simple Model or the Complex Model. EPA proposed three options for establishing the performance
standards under early, optional use of the Complex Model. Under one option, if a refiner opts to utilize the Complex
Model before January 1, 1998 the reformulated gasoline can have no worse VOC, NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, or toxic emissions performance than would be predicted by the Complex Model for a Simple-Model fuel (minimum 2.0
percent oxygen, maximum 1.0 percent benzene, and maximum RVP of 8.1 psi in Class C areas and 7.2 psi in Class B areas)
having that refiner's average 1990 levels of sulfur, olefins, and T90 (E300). The second option was a variation of
the first, in that refiners producing gasoline for use in only the southern reformulated gasoline areas (VOC control
region 1) could measure their fuel performance against the CAA baseline gasoline as an alternative to their own 1990
refinery baseline. The third option, proposed by EPA in February 1993, would extend the second option to all reformulated
gasoline areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rationales for these options are discussed in detail in EPA's proposals. Many of the comments were also received
prior to the proposals, and as such were addressed there. As a result, the reader is referred back to the proposals for
additional discussion. After considering the comments, EPA has decided to promulgate the first option. First, under
this option each refiner will have to achieve the same reductions, whether they use the simple model or the complex
model. The option to use either model increases refiner flexibility, but will not change the emissions reductions
required for a refiner prior to mandatory use of the complex model in 1998. EPA believes that the reductions required
under the simple model are achievable considering all relevant factors and will continue to be so under the optional
use of the complex model. In fact, the additional flexibility of using the complex model would in some cases make them
even more reasonable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the other two options create an incentive for early use of the complex model by those refiners who would then
have a less stringent performance standard than under the simple model. This would produce on average an increase
in overall emissions for reformulated gasoline compared to average emissions if only the simple model was allowed.
Refiners with individual baselines for sulfur, T90 and olefins that are lower than the CAA baseline would, under the
second and third options, get credit for emission benefits for these parameters, and could use this to justify a less
stringent RVP control than required under the simple model. There would be no parallel disincentive to early use of
the complex model for refiners with higher baselines which would result in an increase in their required reductions.
This imbalance in the expected early use of the complex model could easily lead to an average 1&hyph;2 percentage point
reduction in the average emission performance of reformulated gasoline from 1995&hyph;7 as discussed in section
I of the RIA. Based on this negative environmental impact, and the reasonableness of the complex model performance
standard under the first option, EPA has decided to promulgate the first option described above for early use of the
complex model.

 percentage reductions are calculated from a baseline fuel using the refiner's 1990 baseline levels of sulfur, T&hyph;90,
and olefins. As a result, the reformulated gasolines produced by different refiners (or in some cases, at different
refineries) under this option will likely each meet different percentage reduction standards for VOC, toxics, and
NO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Therefore, the performance of a fungible mixture of complex model gasolines produced by different refiners at different
refineries could not be predicted, nor could be evaluated.

Beginning in 1998, certification of reformulated gasoline using the simple model will no longer be an option, and
all reformulated gasoline will be certified using the complex model. Also beginning in 1998, all refiners and importers
will calculate emissions performance reductions from Clean Air Act average gasoline; individual refiner baselines
will not be relevant to reformulated gasoline. As a result, the difficulties with downstream enforcement and surveys
will be resolved.

EPA received comments from two industry groups representing the refining industry on this issue. Both commenters
stated that EPA should require that ``early-use'' complex model gasolines subject to different baselines be segregated
through the gasoline distribution system. EPA is adopting this suggested approach as the best (and perhaps only)
means of accommodating both the restricted early-use option and downstream enforcement of per-gallon minimums
and gasoline quality surveys. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this approach, gasoline sampled at any point in the distribution system would have known values for VOC, toxics,
and NO

 emissions performance that meet the per-gallon and minimum standards. Today's rule requires that these values must
be included in the product transfer documents for ``early-use'' complex model gasoline, to inform downstream parties
and EPA of the relevant per-gallon and minimum values. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's rule prohibits the commingling throughout the distribution system, including at retail outlets, of ``early-use''
complex model gasoline that is subject to different baselines. One commenter stated that the segregation of this
gasoline should be through the terminal level only. EPA disagrees with this comment because segregation through
the retail level also is necessary in order for gasoline quality surveys to function. Survey samples are taken at retail
outlets, and the survey requires that the relevant per-gallon values for VOC, toxics, and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions performance must be known for each sample. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA realizes that restrictions on commingling of ``early-use'' complex model gasolines constitutes a significant
constraint on the use of this option, because most gasoline used in the United States is transported as a fungible commodity.
As a result, EPA anticipates that before 1998 the complex model will be used only in limited situations. This might
occur where a refiner has a gasoline transportation system that is dedicated from the refinery through the retail
level, or where the cost advantages of using the complex model are sufficiently large to offset the difficulties of
segregation. In spite of these constraints, EPA sees no alternative to requiring segregation controls over ``early-use''
complex model gasoline.

The complex model described in this section has undergone significant changes since it was first proposed in the February
1993 NPRM. These changes have been made in response to three key factors: EPA's improved understanding of the relationship
between fuel characteristics and emissions, EPA's use of more appropriate data analysis methods, and comments received
in response to the February NPRM, a public workshop held on May 25, 1993, and EPA's July 14, 1993 docket submission that
described a number of alternative complex models. The key elements in the complex model being promulgated today are
discussed in this section. This discussion also addresses the major substantive comments received by EPA regarding
the complex model. A more detailed description of the model and its derivation, including a detailed summary and analysis
of comments, can be found in Section IV of the RIA.

As discussed in Section III, EPA is using a July 11, 1991 version of MOBILE4.1 to estimate baseline emissions from light-duty
vehicles for the simple model, assuming a basic inspection and maintenance program. This baseline was developed
in the regulatory negotiation and was at the time the best estimate of the in-use emission performance of 1990 vehicles
from which to ensure that the minimum performance standards required by section 211(k) of the Clean Air Act would be
achieved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since that time the Agency has developed a new version of the MOBILE model, MOBILE5a, for use by the states in demonstrating
compliance with the national ambient air quality standard for ozone. As proposed in the February 26, 1993 proposal,
EPA will use MOBILE5a in conjunction with an enhanced I/M program to establish the emission baseline for Phase II of
the reformulated gasoline program beginning in the year 2000. EPA, however, has decided to retain the MOBILE4.1 and
basic I/M baseline assumption for the simple model during Phase I of the RFG program. Switching to a MOBILE5a baseline
for Phase I would have required reformulated fuels to meet a slightly more stringent RVP standard to maintain the minimum
VOC emissions performance required by the Act. The majority of the VOC emission reductions achieved by RFG are from
nonexhaust emissions; under MOBILE5a, nonexhaust VOC emission reductions are less effective in reducing overall
VOC emissions than are exhaust VOC reductions, while the opposite is true under MOBILE4.1. Thus, in order to provide
refiners with sufficient leadtime to complete the investments needed to meet the requirements of the program, the
baseline for the Simple Model is determined using MOBILE4.1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When replacement of the Simple Model with the Complex Model is required in 1998, the issue again arises as to whether
a more stringent standard should be required by shifting to use of MOBILE5a in determining the baseline. MOBILE5a
clearly provides a more recent estimate of the mobile source VOC inventory than does MOBILE4.1. However, many of the
changes made in MOBILE5a were intended to significantly increase the accuracy of the exhaust emission estimates
while similar changes which would have increased the accuracy of the nonexhaust VOC emission estimate were not incorporated
for various reasons, including the limited time available to revise the MOBILE model. As a result, the proportional
contribution of exhaust and nonexhaust VOC emissions to the in-use VOC inventory may not be any more accurate in MOBILE5a
than in MOBILE4.1 even though MOBILE5a provides a more accurate assessment of the total contribution of mobile sources
to the entire VOC inventory by virtue of its greater accuracy in estimating exhaust VOC emissions. Since it is the relative
proportions of exhaust and nonexhaust VOC emissions and not the overall magnitude of the mobile source VOC inventory
which determines how difficult it will be for refiners to meet the overall VOC standard in 1998, it is unclear whether
MOBILE5a would be more appropriate to use in 1998 than MOBILE4.1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A simple model fuel evaluated using the complex model achieves more than the minimum 15% requirement of the Act using
the MOBILE4.1 baseline exhaust/nonexhaust ratio but less than the 15% requirement using the MOBILE5a baseline exhaust/nonexhaust
ratio. Given the uncertainty in the actual in-use exhaust/nonexhaust ratio during this interim period, it is difficult
to know whether or not the 15% actually would be achieved in-use by a fuel meeting the requirements of the Simple Model.
Using MOBILE4.1 to determine the baseline in 1998 would introduce some risk that the 15% minimum performance requirement
of the Act would not be met in-use by a fuel meeting the requirements of the Simple Model. However, this risk is relatively
small in magnitude (less than three percentage points of emission reduction are at stake) and duration (the risk exists
for only two years). On the other hand, using MOBILE5a to determine the 1998 baseline would result in some risk that
refiners would be required to incur greater costs to achieve a more stringent standard than the minimum required by
the Act. This greater stringency would have the effect of creating a third interim phase to the RFG program.

Given the uncertainty in determining whether a MOBILE4.1-based performance standard or a MOBILE5a-based standard
more accurately reflects the in-use conditions in 1998, the potential disruption to refinery operations (even if
only for a small increase in the stringency of the fuel reformulation requirements), the fact that a more stringent
standard in 1998 was not discussed or envisioned as part of the regulatory negotiation process, and the fact that any
risk to the environment is small and of short duration, EPA does not believe it to be appropriate to base the Phase I complex
model standards on MOBILE5a and require refiners to meet a more stringent performance standard in 1998. As a result,
EPA will retain MOBILE4.1 with basic I/M as the basis for the Phase I performance standards under the Complex Model
in 1998. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, EPA has retained the VOC and NO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 baselines proposed in the SNPRM, including the relevant I/M assumptions, for use with the complex model prior to 2000.
The onset of the Phase II performance standards in 2000 will increase the overall stringency of the standards, and
a new baseline based on MOBILE5A will not, by itself, be the cause of new investment by refiners. By this time, enhanced
I/M programs should be fully operational in nearly all reformulated gasoline areas. Therefore, baseline VOC and
NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emission levels to be used with the complex model in Phase II are based on MOBILE5A's estimate of emissions from light-duty
vehicles and trucks with enhanced I/M. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Baseline estimates of toxics emissions are not available directly from the MOBILE models. The nonexhaust toxics
model bases its estimates of nonexhaust toxics on the RVP and benzene levels of the fuel. Since both of these levels
are specified for Clean Air Act baseline (CAAB) gasoline, EPA has used the nonexhaust toxics model to determine the
baseline nonexhaust toxics emission level. The exhaust toxics baseline has been estimated by multiplying the exhaust
toxics emission level predicted by the complex model for CAAB gasoline by the ratio of baseline exhaust VOC emissions
to the average exhaust VOC emission measurement in the complex model database. Since the five regulated exhaust toxic
pollutants are all classified as VOCs, this adjustment sets the baseline exhaust toxics level equal to the exhaust
toxics levels that would have been observed if the vehicles represented by the complex model database had VOC emission
levels representative of in-use vehicles when tested on CAAB gasoline. No comments were received opposing this approach,
which is discussed in more detail in Section III of the RIA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In evaluating the performance of simple model fuels, EPA has focused its attention on the average refiner. The need
to compensate for differences between individual refinery baselines and the Clean Air Act baseline when the use of
the complex model becomes mandatory has been communicated in past proposals, workshops, and the discussions associated
with the Agreement in Principle. Hence refiners have been given adequate notice that if their baseline fuel produces
higher emissions than CAAB fuel, then they must offset such emissions when the use of the complex model becomes mandatory
in 1998. The four years before use of the complex model becomes mandatory is adequate leadtime for refiners. Refiners
undertaking investments to comply with the simple model requirements have been made aware of these requirements,
and this transition process was inherent in the regulatory negotiation agreement and in prior proposals. EPA recognizes
that the precise emissions impact of individual refiner baselines could not be determined with confidence until
the Complex Model was promulgated. However, refiners were aware of at least one course of action that would satisfy
the requirements of the program under the complex model, namely to alter their baseline fuel to match the Clean Air
Act baseline prior to meeting the simple model requirements.

1. Data Sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The relationship between fuel properties and exhaust emissions is complex and the theory behind such relationships
continues to be developed. As a result, EPA has asked industry, state regulatory agencies, and other organizations
with relevant test data to make their data available to the Agency to ensure that this rule is based on as much relevant
information as possible. The complex model described in the following section is based on data generated from a number
of exhaust emissions testing programs. These programs, their design intent, and their limitations are discussed
in Section IV.A of the RIA. Data from these programs were excluded from EPA's analysis if the data were not based on a
valid FTP measurement cycle, if the vehicle in question did not employ 1990-equivalent emission control technology,
if the vehicles did not exhibit stable, repeatable emissions performance, or if the data were clearly inconsistent
with the bulk of the data available to EPA (based on statistical considerations). In addition, data from programs
that did not measure nonmethane hydrocarbon emissions were not used to develop EPA's exhaust VOC complex model. The
Agency believes its analysis considered all valid, and relevant data on the exhaust emissions effect of fuel modifications
when used in 1990 model year and equivalent vehicles that was available at the time the model was developed.

2. Analysis Method 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Exhaust emissions are affected by both vehicle and fuel characteristics. Since the test programs described above
generally involved different vehicles, different fuels, and in some cases different test procedures, the analysis
required to determine the relationship between fuel properties and emissions is complex. However, EPA believes
that the methods used to develop the complex model considers and addresses these complexities appropriately. EPA
utilized statistical analysis techniques to isolate the effects of fuel modifications on exhaust emissions of VOC,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and toxics from other factors affecting exhaust emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At a series of six public workshops held over the past two years, the Agency presented its views on data sources, analysis
methods, and preliminary emissions models for public review and comment. The Agency also requested other organizations
to share their data, analysis expertise, and emissions models at these workshops. The methods used to develop the
model promulgated today appropriately incorporate the comments and suggestions regarding the analysis process
received at the workshops, as well as other comments and suggestions received from industry, state and federal government
authorities, and other interested parties during the course of this rulemaking. Information regarding the workshops,
public comments and suggestions, and EPA's analysis methods can be found in Docket A&hyph;92&hyph;12. The approach
chosen by EPA to analyze the available data is summarized below and is discussed more fully in Section IV.A of the RIA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the vehicle and the fuel both affect exhaust emissions, EPA's analysis separated exhaust emissions into fuel
components and vehicle components. In all test programs analyzed by EPA, the single most significant determinant
of the level of emissions from a given vehicle on a given fuel was the vehicle itself. Fuel properties exert a much smaller
influence on exhaust emissions than do vehicle characteristics such as emission control system technology, vehicle
mileage, catalyst efficiency, oxygen sensor efficiency, engine size, engine design, vehicle size, fuel efficiency,
vehicle maintenance, etc. To identify the effects of fuel property modifications on emissions, EPA found it necessary
to identify the effect of each vehicle on emissions and separate this effect from the fuel effects. For vehicles used
in more than one test program, EPA found it necessary to determine the vehicle effect separately for each test program
since vehicle effects were observed to change between studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fuel components of exhaust emissions were separated into two main categories. The first category consisted of
the effects of individual fuel parameters. For example, the effect of sulfur on NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions was best modeled by a relationship containing a linear sulfur term (of the form c

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is a constant and S is the sulfur level) and a second-order sulfur term (of the form c
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
S

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is a constant). The second category of fuel terms consisted of interactive effects between two fuel parameters. For
example, EPA's analysis found that the effect of aromatics on hydrocarbon emissions is related to the E300 level of
the fuel. This effect cannot be represented as an aromatics or E300 effect alone but must be represented as an interactive
term of the form c

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the February 1993 proposal, EPA indicated that it planned to make several changes to the method used to develop the
complex model. As discussed in that proposal and in the RIA, fuels can be characterized in terms of a number of different
sets of fuel parameters. EPA used the results of individual fuel studies and its public workshops to select the set
of fuel parameters used to model exhaust emissions in its February 1993 proposal. At that time, the Agency indicated
that it might alter its choice of parameters to represent gasoline distillation characteristics from a temperature
basis (using T50 and T90) to a percent evaporated basis (using E200 and E300, the percentage of the fuel's volume that
evaporates when heated to 200
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F and 300
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F, respectively). For reasons outlined in the February 1993 NPRM and section IV.A of the RIA, EPA has chosen to
make this change and has converted its exhaust emission models to a percent evaporated basis since the NPRM was issued,
removing the T50 and T90 terms from its models in the process. The Auto/Oil Heavy Hydrocarbon and EPA Phase II Reformulated
Gasoline Test Program studies have been added to the complex model database. Finally, EPA has changed the confidence
level required to permit terms to remain in the model to 90 percent, in keeping with the approach used in developing
the simple model. The Agency was not able to determine the influence of the type of aromatic compounds in fuels, specifically
heavy aromatics, on exhaust emissions, and hence such terms have not been included in the complex model at this time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because vehicles can have different emission control systems, the Agency anticipated that fuel modifications would
have different emission effects on different types of cars. To account for these differences, EPA's February 1993
proposal divided vehicles into two ``emitter classes'' (normal and higher emitters) based on their exhaust emission
levels. EPA then subdivided vehicles in each emitter class into ``technology groups'' based on the emission control
technology with which each vehicle was equipped. However, as discussed in the NPRM, EPA was concerned that technology
group distinctions among higher emitters might not be appropriate, since such vehicles' high level of emissions
indicated that their emission control systems were not functioning properly. In addition, the limited quantity
of data for higher emitters made it difficult to identify genuine differences in emissions response between higher
emitters of different technology groups. Many commenters expressed similar concerns. Hence the model promulgated
today does not divide higher emitters into technology group categories but retains such distinctions when analyzing
normal emitters. In response to numerous comments, EPA attempted to reduce the number of normal emitter technology
groups. However, as discussed in section IV.A of the RIA, EPA was unable to identify an appropriate basis for consolidation.
EPA considers its retention of emitter class and technology group distinctions to be justified by the presence of
statistically significant fuel effects specific to individual emitter classes and technology groups in today's
complex model.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time, EPA recognized the validity of comments received from a number of sources that (1) many emission effects
were likely to be consistent across multiple technology groups or across emitter classes, and (2) insufficient data
were available to model many potential terms, particularly interactive terms. The approach used by EPA to construct
the complex model proposed in February 1993 did not incorporate these legitimate concerns. To do so, EPA has utilized
a modified version of the ``unified'' approach advocated by API and other commenters (as described in the RIA) to develop
today's complex model. This modeling approach, the statistical criteria used by EPA in conjunction with this approach,
and the techniques used to simplify the models are discussed in detail in section IV.A of the RIA and are summarized
below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, interactive terms were permitted to enter the models only when sufficient data were available. The model proposed
in the February 1993 NPRM permitted all interactive terms to enter the models, regardless of whether sufficient data
were available to estimate such an effect, and it did not apply statistical criteria to evaluate whether terms added
to the model introduced more risk of inaccuracy in the model than they removed.

Second, preliminary models for higher emitting vehicles were constructed based solely on data from such vehicles.
Only those terms that satisfied EPA's statistical criteria (discussed at length in the RIA) were retained. These
criteria included measures to balance overfitting (introducing too many terms to explain the observed data) and
underfitting (not including terms necessary to explain the observed data). The NPRM model did not include measures
to prevent overfitting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, the entire database was analyzed using the unified approach. The effects of each term on emissions was divided
into two parts: an average effect across all vehicles, and a series of adjustment terms for each technology group and
for higher emitters. Only those terms that satisfied EPA's statistical criteria were retained, with two exceptions.
Higher emitter adjustment terms were retained regardless of statistical significance since they had been found
to be statistically significant when examining the higher emitter data separately. EPA was concerned that failure
to do so might cause genuine higher emitter effects to be ``washed out'' by the greater number of data for normal emitters.
In addition, some overall terms were retained for hierarchy reasons despite low statistical significance. For example,
a linear term for a given fuel parameter (e.g., E300) might not be significant while a squared term for the same parameter
(e.g., E3002) might be significant. Since the mathematical form of the squared terms includes the corresponding
linear effects, the linear term would be retained regardless of significance to preserve the model's hierarchical
structure. The importance of hierarchy was emphasized by a number of workshop participants and commenters, as discussed
in the RIA. The NPRM model included separate terms for each technology group and emitter class and hence did not include
terms to represent the average effect of a fuel parameter across all vehicles. The NPRM model also did not incorporate
hierarchy considerations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourth, outlying and overly influential data were dropped from the database and the model was re-estimated based
on the remaining data. Outlying data consist of observations that differ from the average observed effect by so large
a margin that they are more likely to represent observational error, reporting error, or other measurement artifacts
than genuine phenomena. Outlying data can obscure genuine emissions effects. Influential data consist of observations
that by themselves materially affect the resulting model, i.e., the model would differ materially if they were excluded.
In a database the size of the Complex Model database, individual data points should not have such unusually large effects.
Excluding outlying and influential observations is standard statistical practice. The NPRM model did not exclude
either type of observation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fifth, terms were deleted from the resulting model to avoid overfitting and collinearity problems. Overfitting
occurs when so many terms are included in a regression model that the expected error due to the erroneous inclusion
of a term exceeds the expected error due to not including the term. Collinearity problems occur when the fuel parameters
included in the model are correlated with one another in the fuels tested. For example, the addition of oxygenate to
gasoline causes E200 to increase. The oxygenate-containing fuels in the complex model database tend to have higher
E200 values than fuels without oxygenate. In a sense, one can predict the E200 value of a fuel by knowing its oxygen content.
Hence these two parameters would be considered to be highly collinear. Since regression models are developed under
the assumption that terms are not collinear, the presence of strong collinearities can introduce error into the regression.
Today's complex model takes both collinearity and overfitting into account by using a standard statistical criterion
called Mallow's C
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
p
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 criterion to remove terms which introduce large overfitting and collinearity problems. This approach resulted
in a simpler, more reasonable, and statistically more sound model than had been proposed in the February 1993 NPRM.
It should be noted that high emitter terms forced into the model earlier in the process could be dropped at this stage
of the analysis. Measures were taken to limit collinearity problems in the NPRM model, but overfitting concerns and

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sixth, the contribution of each remaining term to the model's explanatory power was estimated, and those terms whose
contribution summed to less than one percent were deleted (i.e., the retained terms accounted for 99 percent of the
explanatory power of the model) to simplify the form of the model without materially reducing its ability to predict
the emissions impact of fuel modifications. This step was not taken during development of the NPRM model. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the resulting models for each technology group within the set of normal emitting vehicles were consolidated
into a single equation using a random balance approximation. The details of that approximation are given in Section
IV.A of the RIA. This step was not taken during development of the NPRM model. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The results of EPA's modeling efforts confirms the importance of technology group and emitter class distinctions,
as can be seen by examining the differences in the exhaust emission equations for specific normal emitter technology
groups or for normal and higher emitter class categories (as discussed in greater detail in the RIA). Efforts to reduce
the number of technology group categories for normal emitters were not successful. Efforts to subdivide higher emitters
by their emission characteristics such as exhaust hydrocarbon to NO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ratio did not improve the quality of EPA's higher emitter model. However, as discussed above, EPA found it unnecessary
to separate higher emitters by technology group. This modification reflects EPA's belief, supported by preliminary
field information, that one or more emission control components on higher emitters tend to be malfunctioning, which
renders a classification scheme based on vehicle equipment questionable.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As was discussed in the April 1992 and February 1993 proposals, the weight assigned to each technology group or emitter
class for modeling purposes was set equal to its contribution to in-use emissions for each pollutant. The weight assigned
to each emitter class was set equal to its projected contribution to in-use emissions. The weighting factor assigned
to normal emitters was then broken down further by technology group, again according to their projected contribution
to in-use emissions. These estimates and projections are essentially unchanged from the February 1993 proposal,
although minor changes have been made to reflect more complete information about the fraction of 1990 sales accounted
for by each technology group. The rationale for, derivation of, and renormalization of the weighting factors themselves
are discussed in more detail in the RIA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Various commenters indicated that they considered EPA's previously proposed models were too complex. In response,
the Agency has modified its analysis method in several ways. The resulting method, described in Section IV.B.2, results
in exhaust emission models containing two equations for each pollutant instead of as many as sixteen separate equations,
as was the case for the model proposed in February 1993. Each equation also has far fewer terms than the February 1993
equations. However, EPA does not believe that today's less complicated complex model is less accurate than the complex
models presented at public workshops or in the February proposal. This belief is based on the models' comparable explanatory
power (as reflected in their similar R2) and the superior accuracy of today's model in accounting for the emission
effects seen in the vehicle testing programs that comprise the complex model database. Today's VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 models are based on the most accurate of the three sets of models included in EPA's July 14, 1993 docket submittal, while
also taking into account relevant comments regarding specific aspects of the models. Today's toxics models are a
further simplification of the models included in the July 1993 docket submittal in response to comments received
by EPA on its docket submittal. These points are discussed more fully in Section IV.A of the RIA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The specific equations that comprise the complex model can be found in section 80.45 of the regulations for this rule.
Their derivation is discussed in detail in Section IV.A of the RIA. The range of parameter values for which these equations
are valid is discussed in Section D and in Section IV.D of the RIA. As discussed in Section V, refiners are required to
submit data to augment the model if they wish to certify fuels with properties that fall outside this range as reformulated
gasolines.

 C. Nonexhaust Model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nonexhaust emissions are less strongly affected by vehicle design and are influenced by fewer fuel characteristics
than are exhaust emissions. In addition, the theoretical principles involved in nonexhaust emissions (which include
evaporative, running loss, and refueling emissions) are better understood, and nonexhaust emission control technologies
are more consistent across vehicles, than are exhaust emissions and emission control technologies. Since the relationship
between fuel properties and nonexhaust emissions is less complex and better understood than for exhaust emissions,
there was much less need for EPA to generate additional data to evaluate nonexhaust emissions than was the case for
exhaust emissions. EPA was able to base its nonexhaust VOC emission model on data generated from EPA's ongoing nonexhaust
emissions testing program that has been used to develop EPA's MOBILE emission inventory models, specifically the
MOBILE4.1 and MOBILE5.0A models. EPA believes this data to be sufficient to model the relationship between fuel properties
and nonexhaust VOC emissions for the purposes of this rule. Additional information about MOBIL4.1 and MOBILE5.0A
can be found in Dockets A&hyph;91&hyph;02 and A&hyph;92&hyph;12.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is in the process of developing an enhanced model of nonexhaust VOC emissions, based on a more complete set of theoretical
principles and additional test data, that is expected to be more accurate and more widely applicable to oxygenated
fuels than the MOBILE models. A preliminary version of this model was discussed at a public workshop held on August
25, 1992, and materials related to this model have been placed in the docket for this rulemaking. At this time, however,
this enhanced nonexhaust VOC emissions model is not complete and hence is not incorporated in today's complex model.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The nonexhaust VOC model in today's complex model is based on correlations between RVP and nonexhaust VOC emissions
derived from the July 11, 1991 version of MOBILE4.1 for Phase I of the reformulated gasoline program (1995&hyph;1999)
and from MOBILE5A for Phase II (2000 and beyond). This approach is consistent with the definition of baseline emissions
set forth in Section IV.A and is based on the same considerations outlined in that section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To develop the correlations shown below, the MOBILE models were used with temperatures of 69 to 94 degrees Fahrenheit
for Class B areas and 72 to 92 degrees Fahrenheit for Class C areas. As discussed in Section IV.A, a basic inspection
and maintenance program was assumed for Phase I while an enhanced I/M program was assumed for Phase II. In addition,
the presence of Stage II evaporative emissions recovery systems with an overall vapor recovery efficiency of 86 percent
was assumed (as discussed in the SNPRM and NPRM). EPA is in the process of promulgating requirements for onboard refueling
emission controls which may be more effective at controlling refueling emissions than Stage II vapor recovery systems.
However, these requirements did not apply to 1990 model year vehicles and hence cannot be incorporated into the model
for certification purposes. In addition, EPA has chosen not to incorporate the effects of onboard refueling controls
in its evaluation of the effects of reformulated fuels on emissions from the entire in-use vehicle fleet, which includes
vehicles from a number of different model years. This decision was made for several reasons. First, requirements
for onboard refueling controls have not yet been finalized, making evaluation of their impact on in-use emissions
difficult. Second, onboard refueling controls are not expected to be required on all new vehicles until 2000 and are
not expected to be present on the bulk of in-use vehicles for several years after that time. Third, while onboard controls
are expected to be more efficient at controlling refueling emissions than Stage II controls, the difference is not
expected to be large in areas affected by the reformulated gasoline program and will affect only a small portion of
total nonexhaust VOC emissions. Since EPA's analysis of the additional benefits of onboard vapor recovery controls
is not yet available, and since such benefits are expected to be small relative to overall emissions, EPA has chosen
to retain its assumptions regarding Stage II vapor recovery in forecasting the effects of fuel modifications on nonexhaust
VOC emissions from the in-use vehicle fleet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The only toxic air pollutant covered by the reformulated gasoline program that is found in nonexhaust emissions is
benzene, which is a natural component of gasoline. The other four toxic air pollutants listed in section 211(k) are
solely products of fuel combustion and hence are not found nonexhaust emissions. As discussed in the SNPRM, the Agency's
correlation between fuel benzene content and summer non-exhaust benzene emissions is based on results from General
Motors' proprietary model of tank vapors, as confirmed independently by EPA-generated data using a number of fuels.
Both the derivation and verification of the non-exhaust benzene emissions model are discussed more fully in the RIA.
The nonexhaust benzene emission model also depends on the RVP of the fuel, as is the case for the nonexhaust VOC emission
model. The derivation of the nonexhaust benzene and VOC models is discussed more fully in the RIA.

Like all regression models, the complex model is not valid for all possible input values. The range of fuel parameter
values over which the complex model accurately predicts vehicle emissions is given in Table IV&hyph;3. These ranges
are based on the range of data used to develop the models and on comments received by the Agency on this issue. The limits
proposed in the February 1993 were, in some cases, narrower than the range of data used to develop the complex model.
In addition, the limits proposed in the NPRM would have prevented a number of very low emitting fuels from being certified
using the model.

EPA has received a number of comments requesting alterations in the model's range. After considering these comments
and re-evaluating the data on which the complex model is based, EPA has modified the range limits. In some cases, EPA
has chosen to extrapolate the complex model slightly beyond the range for which data were available in order to allow
additional fuels, both conventional and reformulated, to be evaluated using the model without recourse to expensive
and time-consuming vehicle testing. These extrapolations are limited to those parameters whose effects appear
to be well-characterized by the complex model. A detailed discussion of the limits of the available data, EPA's rationale
for extending the valid range of the model for some parameters, and the extrapolation method used to extend the model
can be found in Section IV.D of the RIA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions performance of reformulated gasolines during the winter months as well as during the high ozone season.
Modeling winter emissions performance, however, presented a number of difficulties. First, the data sources described
earlier provided data on emissions performance only under summer conditions and for gasolines with RVP levels typical
of summer gasolines. Second, the RVP levels of fuels included in the complex model database ranged from 7 to 10 psi,
while winter fuels tend to have RVP levels in the 11.5 psi range and are not restricted by other regulations. Hence the
complex model cannot be used directly for fuels with typical winter RVP levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RVP's impact on canister loading and subsequent purging is thought to be the primary cause of its effects on exhaust
emissions. Since data do not exist on the effects of winter fuels on canister loading under winter conditions, the
Agency is not able at this time to model the effects of winter RVP levels on exhaust emissions. To avoid making unsound
or speculative predictions, EPA proposed and is now promulgating a requirement that for purposes of evaluating emissions
effects using the complex model, the RVP of winter fuels be set at the summer statutory baseline RVP value. In effect,
this requirement builds into the model the assumption that the RVP level of winter gasolines has no effect on NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or exhaust toxics emissions. As a result, refiners will not be required to alter the RVP levels of winter gasolines.
Refiners will receive neither benefit nor penalty for changing the RVP of their winter gasolines. To evaluate winter
fuels using the complex model, an RVP value equal to that of summer baseline gasoline (8.7 psi) must be used instead
of the fuel's actual RVP. Doing so effectively removes the contribution of RVP to winter exhaust emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When sufficient data is developed on the emissions impact of winter RVP levels under winter ambient conditions, EPA
will be able to revise the complex model accordingly. Until then, EPA believes it is more appropriate to assume that
RVP levels have winter exhaust emission effects than to speculate about the magnitude of such impacts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its prior proposals, EPA had proposed that winter nonexhaust emissions, including winter nonexhaust benzene
emissions, be considered zero. EPA received a number of comments requesting that both baseline emissions and the
nonexhaust toxics model include winter nonexhaust benzene emissions. This request was based on the belief that the
year-round benzene limits would result in reduced nonexhaust benzene emissions in the winter months. EPA has evaluated
this claim, taking into account temperature ranges and the effects of inspection and maintenance programs on such
emissions. EPA acknowledges the validity of this claim, since winter nonexhaust emissions, including nonexhaust
benzene emissions, are likely to be nonzero under all winter temperature ranges. In the past, the lack of sufficient
data on nonexhaust emissions under winter temperature conditions has prevented EPA from developing reliable, accurate
models of winter nonexhaust emissions. The commenters provided a limited quantity of data on winter nonexhaust emissions
to support their claim. However, the data submitted in support of this claim were based on measurements of nonexhaust
emissions from vehicles with very low nonexhaust emissions. EPA's analysis indicates that these vehicles are not
representative of in-use vehicles. In addition, the chemical composition of the measured nonexhaust emissions
were characteristic of resting losses (losses that occur due to permeation through fuel system components) rather
than of diurnal, hot soak, or running loss emissions. Resting losses are not included in EPA's baseline emission estimates,
so EPA does not consider it appropriate to include resting losses in its nonexhaust emission models. Finally, no data
were submitted on nonexhaust benzene emissions from fail vehicles under winter conditions. Since nonexhaust benzene
emissions from such vehicles will comprise a significant portion of winter nonexhaust benzene emissions, EPA is
concerned that a model based on the submitted data would not provide accurate estimates of such emissions. Given the
theoretical merits of the claim, however, EPA will consider including a model of winter benzene nonexhaust emissions
in the complex model in the future when sufficient data become available.

F. Fungibility
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has long recognized the importance of maintaining a fungible fuel system, in which complying gasolines can be
mixed freely without resulting in mixtures that do not themselves comply with regulatory requirements. Fungibility
is essential to smooth, cost-effective operation of fuel distribution systems such as pipelines. The Agency has
received numerous comments on the need to maintain fungibility. At the same time, the Agency considers it essential
that gasolines certified as reformulated meet all required emission performance levels in the field. In cases where
the effects of a given fuel parameter on emissions are non-linear, it is possible for two complying fuels to produce
a non-complying fuel when mixed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The complex model contains a number of nonlinear terms, which introduces the possibility that gasolines which comply
with this rule's requirements in isolation would not comply if mixed with other complying fuels. EPA has been concerned
with this possibility and has undertaken extensive analyses to determine its likelihood and to develop methods to
cope with its occurrence. EPA's analyses, which have utilized methods that have been supported by a number of organizations,
indicate that the complex model promulgated in today's rule will not create fungibility problems despite its inclusion
of nonlinear terms. This analysis is explained in greater detail in Section IV.F of the RIA.

The complex model promulgated in this rulemaking reflects EPA's best understanding of the relationship between
fuel characteristics and vehicle emissions. However, EPA expects future research to clarify this relationship.
EPA also recognizes that changes in in-use vehicle emission control programs (e.g., I/M programs) will continue
to occur and that these changes may alter the relationship between fuel characteristics and in-use emissions. In
addition, the Agency is concerned that augmentations to the model through vehicle testing (Section V) may, over time,
accumulate to the point that a revised complex model, incorporating the current complex model database and all relevant
information gathered since then, would be beneficial. As discussed in Section V, EPA plans to issue revised complex
models when the Agency deems that sufficient new information is available to warrant such action. Model revisions
will be developed through a formal rulemaking process.

Fuels qualifying as reformulated under the simple model must meet specified benzene, oxygen, and RVP requirements
while also satisfying the toxics performance standard. The RVP requirement differs between VOC control regions,
and the requirements and standards also vary depending on whether compliance is being achieved on a per-gallon or
averaging basis. In addition, levels of other fuel parameters are only specified under the simple model in terms of
deviations from each refiner's baseline fuel. Evaluating the performance of simple model fuels under the complex
model is difficult since fuel properties can vary widely.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, it is possible to evaluate a set of fuels that are representative of expected, typical simple model fuels.
EPA expects most refiners to pursue compliance on average (for all or part of their product slate) in order to maximize
flexibility in day-to-day refinery operations and recoup compliance margins. Given present and projected conditions,
EPA also expects that MTBE and ethanol will be the most commonly used oxygenates during Phase I of the reformulated
gasoline program. The fuels specified in Tables IV&hyph;4 and IV&hyph;5 below include fuels designed to meet the
requirements of the simple model in both VOC control regions and using both oxygenates. The level of olefins, sulfur,
E200, and E300 have been set to Clean Air Act baseline levels, while the level of aromatics has been set at the level necessary
to comply with the toxics requirements of the simple model. Aromatics levels were assumed to be the same for summer
and winter fuels.

 emissions from baseline levels on a per-gallon basis as discussed in the February 1993 proposal or a 1.5% reduction
from baseline levels on average as discussed in Section VII. In addition, as discussed in Section III.E., such fuels
must result in either a 15% reduction in total toxics emissions from baseline levels on a per-gallon basis or a 16.5%
reduction in total toxics emissions from baseline levels on average. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the VOC standards, EPA considers fuels produced to meet the provisions of the simple model to be producible.
Thus, as discussed in the February 1993 proposal, EPA believes it feasible to base the Phase I standards for VOC emissions
on the performance of fuels that meet the Simple Model requirements, provided that this performance is more stringent
than minimum performance required by the Act. EPA considers the fuels whose VOC performances were evaluated in Section
IV.H to be representative of Simple Model fuels. Under the reformulated gasoline program, VOC emissions are controlled
only during the high ozone season. For this reason, the VOC performance standard has been determined by the performance
of the Phase I summer fuels presented in Section IV.H. Since these fuels achieve emissons reductions that equal or
exceed the minimum requirements set forth in the Act, the VOC performance standard during Phase I for fuels certified
under the complex model has been based on the performance of these fuels. Setting the VOC performance standards in
1998&hyph;1999 equal to this VOC performance level, which EPA believes to be a reasonable estimate of the average
performance of fuels produced in 1995&hyph;1997, preserves the integrity of the two-phase program specified by
Congress and is consistent with the Agreement in Principle signed in 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The summer VOC performance of ``typical'' high ozone season simple model reformulated gasolines according to the
complex model is presented in Table IV&hyph;6. In VOC Control Region 1, the simple model fuel reduces VOC emissions
by 36.6 percent for the MTBE-containing fuel (Fuel 1) and 36.8 percent for the ethanol-containing fuel (Fuel 5). Since
the 1998 performance requirements in VOC Control Region 1 are to be based on the performance of typical simple model
fuels, and since Fuels 1 and 5 both satisfy the simple model requirements and are considered by EPA to be representative
of typical simple model fuels, EPA has set its 1998 performance standards in VOC Control Region 1 so as to permit both
of these fuels to meet the 1998 performance standards. In addition, EPA considers Fuel 1 to be more representative
of typical simple model fuels in VOC Control Region 1 since MTBE does not boost fuel RVP levels to the extent that ethanol
does. As was discussed in the April 1992 and February 1993 proposals, EPA believes that per-gallon performance standard
should be set 1.5 percentage points below the averaging performance standard. Hence high ozone season fuels certified
using the complex model during Phase I of the reformulated gasoline program must provide a VOC emission reduction
from baseline levels of 36.6 percent when complying on average and 35.1 percent when complying on a per-gallon basis.
Similarly, high ozone season fuels certified using the complex model during Phase I in VOC Control Region 2 must provide
a VOC emission reduction from baseline levels of 17.1 percent when complying on average and 15.6 percent when complying
on a per-gallon basis. These standards are summarized in Table IV&hyph;7 for both VOC control regions, under averaging
and per-gallon compliance. Note that a negative performance standard signifies a reduction from baseline emission
levels.

In summary, the per-gallon and averaging VOC performance standards under the complex model during Phase I is set by
the performance of the corresponding simple model fuel when evaluated using the complex model. The toxics performance
standard is set at the statutory requirement of a 15 percent reduction from baseline levels for per-gallon compliance
and a 16.5 percent reduction for compliance on average. Similarly, the NO

, toxics, and VOC requirements were discussed. Emission models such as the simple model described in Section III and
the complex model described in Section IV offer several advantages over testing to determine emission effects. First,
models can better reflect in-use emission effects since they can be based on the results of multiple test programs.
Second, individual test programs may be intentionally or unintentionally biased due to vehicle selection, test
design, and analysis methods. Third, fuel compositions tend to vary due in part to factors beyond the control of fuel
suppliers such as variations in crude oil compositions and the inherent variability of refining processes. As a result,
without one or more modeling options, each batch of fuel would have to be tested to ascertain its emission performance.
Such levels of testing are neither desirable (because of the potential for intentional or unintentional bias in vehicle
test programs) nor practical (because of the time and expense involved in vehicle testing). Fourth, models make more
efficient use of scarce and expensive emission effects data than is possible otherwise. For these reasons, EPA believes
that the modeling options outlined above are necessary for the reformulated gasoline program to achieve its environmental
objectives and to minimize the costs of the program.

These emission models, however, reflect currently-available information and hence do not allow refiners to take
advantage of emission benefits derived from new fuel additives or changes in fuel parameters not contained in the
models. To allow for fuel technology development and innovation, the Agency also believes that testing has a role
in certification as a means of supplementing the models. This section contains a detailed discussion of the provisions
EPA is promulgating regarding the conditions under which testing is permitted, the manner in which test results can
be used to supplement the models, and the minimum requirements for vehicle testing programs. As was first outlined
in the February 1993 NPRM, the vehicle testing process described in this section has undergone significant changes
since it was first proposed in the April 1992 SNPRM. These changes have been made in response to changes in EPA's approach
to modeling the relationship between fuel properties and emissions, as described in Section IV, and comments received
in response to the April 1992 and February 1993 proposals. The following discussion addresses the major substantive
comments received by EPA regarding certification of fuels by vehicle testing. A detailed summary and analysis of
comments can be found in Section IV.G of the RIA.

A. Applicability of Testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Vehicle testing is the primary way that the effects of various gasoline formulations on motor vehicle emissions can
be determined. As described above, data from vehicle testing programs forms the bulk of the basis for the simple and
complex models. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that fuel certification through single test programs is inherently less reliable than certification
through a testing-based model. The simple and complex models developed by EPA are based on a far greater amount of testing
than would be available from any single test program. These models incorporate and balance the varying and conflicting
results of numerous test programs. The statistical variation associated with an individual test program may cause
a fuel to show emission effects during testing that would not occur in-use. Therefore, EPA proposes that testing only
be permitted to augment the models for fuel effects that are not covered in the models. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Augmenting the Simple Model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Due to the belief that fuels certified by vehicle testing should be evaluated in conjunction with the most complete
emission model available to more accurately determine the emission benefits of the fuels being tested, EPA proposed
that vehicle testing be permitted to augment the simple model only for the effect of oxygenates on NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions beyond the simple model's oxygen caps. All other testing was to have been performed to augment the complex
model. Based on data collected since the time of the proposal on the effect of oxygenates on NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA no longer believes it appropriate to augment the simple model even in the limited manner described above. Considerably
more data are available in the complex model database regarding the effect of oxygenates on NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions than would be provided by any individual test program. Therefore, testing can only be performed to augment
the complex model. Fuels with oxygen concentrations in excess of 2.7 weight percent must be certified using the complex
model. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Augmenting the Complex Model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA believes that the objective of testing under the complex model should be to evaluate the emission effects of fuels
whose emission effects cannot be adequately represented by the model. Such fuels would include fuels claiming emission
effects from parameters not included in the complex model and fuels containing complex model parameters at levels
beyond the range covered by the model. Without this constraint, it may be possible for a fuel producer to use the statistical
variation associated with testing to claim emission effects through testing which would not be demonstrated in-use,
when tested to a greater degree, or when modeled. For example, a fuel that would fail to meet the VOC requirement by a
small margin when evaluated under the complex model could be tested and shown to meet the VOC requirement due to the
testing error associated with any vehicle testing program. In addition, allowing testing of existing modeled parameters
essentially would make the complex model, and the associated emission performance standards, a fluid target. Fuel
producers would lose the certainty associated with a fixed model and the confidence that their capital investments
will be useful for a fixed amount of time. Therefore, vehicle testing can be used only to determine the emission effects
of parameters not adequately represented by the complex model. The emission effects of the fuel parameter in question
will be determined by combining the emission effects determined through vehicle testing with the emission effects
predicted by the complex model. Furthermore, each testing program can be used to identify the effects of only one new
fuel parameter, unless the changes in other fuel parameters are a natural and inherent consequence of the primary
fuel modification. Without this constraint, EPA believes that accurate determination of the effects of specific
fuel parameters would be more difficult due to the inherent variability in testing programs and the increased opportunities
for gaming.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, fuel suppliers opting to augment the complex model through vehicle testing must examine the extent to
which emissions are affected when fuels certified with the augmented complex model are mixed with other fuels. The
Agency is concerned with two potential problems when different fuels are combined. First, the emission effects of
a parameter, as determined from vehicle testing, may not behave linearly as fuels with one level of the parameter are
mixed with fuels with different levels of the same parameter. The degree to which this process occurs is referred to
in this notice as the parameter's dilution effect. Dilution effects are evident in the complex model proposed in February
1993 and in the model being promulgated today. Second, the emission effects of various fuel parameters may be affected
by the level of other fuel parameters. The degree to which this process occurs is referred to in this notice as an interactive
effect. If such effects are present (as in the complex model proposed in February 1993 and in the complex model being
promulgated today), actual emission performance of the fuel mixture in-use could be worse than emission performance
predicted from the complex model augmented by vehicle testing results. Therefore, the testing process must be structured
so as to identify dilution and interactive effects.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Advance Approval of Test Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Given the number of factors involved in designing a test program, the potential for inappropriate design is high.
EPA wishes to avoid submittal of petitions based on test data from poorly designed programs in order to assure that
the time and money invested in such programs is well-spent and to assure that all augmentations to the model are based
on accurate data from well-designed test programs. Hence EPA will require petitioners to obtain advance approval
from the Agency for their proposed vehicle testing programs. EPA will consider petitions to augment the model only
if based on the results of approved testing programs. Furthermore, EPA retains the discretion to evaluate other data
when evaluating petitions to augment the complex model and when determining the nature, extent, and limitations
of the augmentation. This data may include the existing complex model database, additional vehicle testing programs,
and other augmentation applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners are required to include the following information when submitting a test program plan for approval:
the fuel parameter to be evaluated for emission effects; the number and description of vehicles to be used in the test,
including model year, model name, VIN number, mileage, emission performance, technology type, and vehicle manufacturer;
the methods used to procure and prepare the vehicles for testing; the fuels to be used in the testing program, characterized
as defined in Section V.I.5; the pollutants and emission categories to be evaluated; the methods and precautions
to be used to ensure that the effects of the parameter in question are independent of the effects of other parameters
already included in the complex model; a description of the quality assurance procedures to be used during the test
program, and the identity and location of the organization performing the testing. EPA anticipates and encourages
petitioners to submit the information listed above in stages beginning with the most general and ending with the most
specific in order to streamline the approval process and eliminate wasted effort. EPA will work with petitioners
to remedy unsatisfactory aspects of their proposed testing program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These provisions provide the Agency with greater assurance that petitioners would not selectively report test results
to the Agency that support their petitions. Petitioners would still be able to ``game'' the testing process by pre-screening
vehicles to obtain a test fleet with the desired sensitivity to the proposed parameter. However, such a test fleet
would have to be re-tested as part of the formal test program and hence would be subject to the variability inherent
in vehicle testing, which would tend to reduce the gaming benefits from pre-screening. EPA believes that the risks
and costs associated with re-testing will tend to dissuade petitioners from attempting to manipulate the testing
process in this manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA further requires that the results of all approved testing programs be submitted to the Agency, even if the parameter
in question proves not to provide an emission benefit. The Agency believes this requirement is necessary to ensure
that all available data is at the Agency's disposal when evaluating proposed augmentations to the complex model and
when updating the model itself. EPA does not intend to use this provision to limit legitimate, innovative test programs.
Rather, EPA is only interested in preventing the creation of artificial fuel parameters that claim to be the source
of emission effects which are in reality only normal statistical variability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An example may help clarify the problems that can arise if testing is permitted for such artificial parameters. The
level of C10+ aromatics (aromatics whose molecules contain ten or more carbon atoms) influences a fuel's E200, E300,
and total aromatics levels. A testing program to identify the effects of C10+ aromatics may indicate that an emission
effect from such compounds exists when the effect is actually due to differences in the fuels' E200, E300, and total
aromatics levels or to the inherent statistical variability associated with vehicle testing. A petition for approval
of a test program to identify the effects of C10+ aromatics would be required to identify specific measures to be taken
to isolate the emission effects of C10+ aromatics from those of E200, E300 and total aromatics, all three of which are
included in the complex model. In this example, EPA might require that certain test fuels contain identical levels
of E200, E300, and total aromatics; that more rigorous statistical tests be used to identify genuine C10+ aromatics
effects beyond those already incorporated in the complex model for E200, E300, and total aromatics; that the fuels
used in the test program meet more detailed compositional criteria to ensure their representativeness; or that additional
vehicles and/or fuels be tested. This provision helps assure that the effects observed in vehicle testing programs
are genuine and will occur in-use.

E. Exclusive Rights to Augmentation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's April 1992 and February 1993 proposals discussed the advantages and disadvantages of providing a system of
exclusive rights to model augmentations. EPA has given this matter further consideration, including consideration
of comments regarding exclusive rights. The Agency has concluded that the reasons given in its April 1992 proposal
for not providing a system of exclusive rights are still valid. Hence the regulations governing augmentation of the
complex model through vehicle regulation being promulgated today do not provide for exclusive rights to augmentations.
Each augmentation will be available to any refiner desiring to utilize it, and no restrictions are provided under
this rulemaking for exclusive rights, other than those granted under other legal code (e.g., patent law). The Agency
does not believe adequate authority exists to promulgate exclusive rights provisions under this rulemaking. Furthermore,
as discussed in the April 16, 1992 proposal, there are a number of reasons from economic, administrative, and air quality
perspectives that make open use of model augmentations a desirable public policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To allow interested parties to review and comment on a model augmentation, EPA will publish a description of the augmentation
and its supporting data and information for public comment prior to approving an augmentation for use. In keeping
with the provision of the Act, EPA will take into account any comments received, and act upon any request received for
fuel certification through model augmentation within 180 days of such a request being completed.

F. Duration of Augmentation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its April 1992 proposal, EPA proposed that augmentations would remain in effect until the next subsequent complex
model update was issued. EPA further proposed that if an augmentation had been valid for three or fewer years upon implementation
of the subsequent update to the complex model, then refiners were permitted to continue using the augmentation in
conjunction with the previous complex model for an additional length of time, subject to certain restrictions. EPA
has received a number of comments on this proposal. Today's rule includes a set of limitations on the duration of the
augmentation that incorporate some elements of these comments. These limitations are described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is concerned that fuel suppliers not be allowed to claim emission effects in perpetuity based on the testing
program described in this section due to the smaller degree of statistical confidence in such effects compared to
those included in an updated complex model. The Agency also recognizes the need for fuel suppliers to recoup investments
made to reformulate gasoline, including investments to utilize the emission effects identified through vehicle
testing. Therefore, petitioners will be permitted to use emission effects determined through vehicle testing only
for a limited period of time. In general, this period of time extends until an updated version of the complex model takes
effect. Updates to the complex model will be issued by EPA through a formal rulemaking process at such time that the
Agency determines that sufficient additional data has become available to warrant issuing such an update. Since
some augmentations may be in place for a relatively short period of time before the model is updated, the Agency may
not be able to adequately assess the augmentation. However, if a proposed update to the complex model is issued within
three years of the time at which the augmentation takes effect, then fuel suppliers may be permitted to continue using
the augmentation to determine the emission effects of reformulated gasolines. Specifically, if the Agency does
not formally accept, reject, or modify the augmentation in question for inclusion in the updated complex model, then
the augmentation will remain available until the next update to the model takes effect. If the Agency reviews the augmentation
and either excludes the augmentation entirely or includes the augmentation in a modified form, then the augmentation
will remain available for use in its original form, in conjunction with the complex model for which the augmentation
was issued, to those fuel producers who can demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that they have begun
producing fuels that are certified using the augmentation. In such cases, the augmentation may continue to be used
for five years from the date the augmentation took effect or for three years of fuel production, whichever is shorter.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, augmentations to the model for the effects of a given parameter over a particular
range are permitted only once. Regardless of whether the emission effects of a parameter are included in an updated
model, the augmentation can neither be used nor renewed (even with data from a second identical test program) once
the maximum time period for use of a model augmented with the effects of that parameter has expired. Further testing
is permitted, however, to provide EPA with the additional data needed to include the effect in a future update to the
model.

G. Limits on the Range of an Augmentation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Fuel suppliers will be permitted to claim the emission effects of augmentations only to the extent that the test program
measured the effects of the fuel parameter in question over the range in question. If the parameter is included in the
complex model, then the augmentation will be valid for fuels containing levels of the parameter between the level
tested in the test program and the nearest limit of the complex model (as described in Section IV). If the parameter
is not included in the complex model, then the augmentation will be valid for fuels containing levels of the parameter
between the candidate and baseline levels (i.e., the levels found in Addition Fuels 1 and 3 in Table V.1). This provision
is intended to be consistent with the limits on the application of the simple and complex models as expressed in Sections
III and IV.

H. EPA Approval, Confirmatory Testing, and Fees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the process of reviewing a model augmentation, EPA must confirm the accuracy of the test results. To this end, EPA
intends to monitor the petitioner's test program. The Agency also reserves the right to perform confirmatory testing
to assure the validity of the test results and the emission performance of the reformulated fuel before allowing augmentation
of the model. EPA further reserves the right to collect fees any lawful of an amount sufficient to recoup all costs associated
with such confirmatory testing. EPA anticipates that if any confirmatory testing is performed that it will be of a
limited nature and focused only on those aspects of the test program which are unexpected or contrary to prior test
programs and engineering knowledge. Since EPA has not proposed methods to be used to calculate and collect such fees,
these provisions will be handled through a subsequent rulemaking.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To be certified as reformulated, a gasoline must meet the air toxics and NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emission requirements year-round; the oxygen, benzene, and heavy metal content requirements year-round, and the
VOC emission requirements in the high ozone season. As discussed in Section IV of this notice and Sections III and IV
of the RIA, the Agency does not have sufficient data to model winter exhaust emissions. While differences between
the effects of fuel parameters under summer and winter conditions beyond those discussed in Section IV may exist,
the Agency does not have any evidence to date to suggest that they are significant. Therefore, EPA will apply the exhaust
models developed for summer emissions to winter fuels as well for purposes of determining their air toxics and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions. The Agency is concerned that allowing winter testing for some fuel parameters while modeling the effects
of other parameters based on summer emission data creates the possibility of ``gaming'' the testing process. Fuel
suppliers could use the summer model to determine the effects of parameters that would behave unfavorably under winter
conditions and use winter testing to determine the effects of parameters that would behave favorably under winter
conditions. This possibility may result in fuels being certified for winter use (through a combination of winter
testing and summer modeling) that result in smaller emission reductions in-use than are intended by the Act or than
would occur by using the summer model. Therefore, EPA is at this time requiring that all testing be performed under
summer ambient conditions. As the Agency gathers additional data in the future with which to revise the model, EPA
will consider whether sufficient winter test data exists to permit the development of winter NO

2. Pollutants to be Measured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To the extent testing is performed to augment the complex model, it must be performed to determine the emission effects
on all the pollutants covered by the reformulated gasoline certification requirements, including toxics (carbon
monoxide and carbon dioxide emissions must also be measured to permit validation of test results). Failure to have
such a requirement might result in important emission effects being overlooked and could allow fuel producers to
``game'' the certification requirements by permitting them to utilize the modeling option for one pollutant and
the test results for another pollutant when it would be advantageous. The resulting certified reformulated gasolines
may not meet all of the applicable emission reduction requirements in-use. For example, the model augmented by test
results may indicate that a fuel meets the VOC requirement but fails the toxics requirement, while the model alone
may indicate that the fuel meets the toxics requirement but fails the VOC requirement. Allowing the petitioner to
claim the toxics emission effects predicted by the model while claiming VOC benefits determined through testing
would ignore fuel effects on toxics that may not be addressed by the model. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Testing costs would be significantly reduced if only VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions were measured by testing, and toxics emissions were allowed to be modeled. However, since the testing option
can only be used when the candidate fuel's parameters fall outside of the range of the model, EPA believes that adequate
information seldom would be available to allow toxics emissions from such fuels to be modeled adequately if adequate
information on VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions were not available. If a fuel parameter is expected to affect VOC or NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and is not covered by the model, toxics emissions may very well be affected and should be measured. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be noted, however, measurement of toxics emissions for the fuels used to determine interactive effects
(discussed below in section IV.I.4.) need not be performed. During development of the complex model, EPA found that
interactive effects for air toxics are either statistically insignificant, impossible to discern given the accuracy
and extent of available data, or too small to contribute substantially to the model's explanatory and predictive
power. The complex model being promulgated today contains no interactive terms for air toxics emissions for these
reasons, and hence EPA considers it unnecessary to require testing for interactive effects on air toxics. Specifically,
toxics emissions need not be measured when testing additional Extension Fuels to determine interactive effects
or when testing Addition Fuels 4, 5, 6, and 7, as described in Section V.I.5. However, EPA reserves the right to require
that toxics be measured during vehicle testing programs when evidence exists that adverse interactive effects may
exist for toxics. In particular, EPA reserves the right to require testing for interactive toxics effects if future
revisions to the complex model include such effects.

To better optimize the test program for the particular fuel parameter being evaluated, the Administrator may approve
a request to waive certain pollutant measurement requirements contained in this section. Any such waiver would have
to be obtained in advance of vehicle testing. A request for such a waiver must include an adequate justification for
the requested change, including the rationale for the request and supporting data and information. Such a request
must justify the reason that measurement of certain pollutants clearly is not necessary, and identify those pollutants
for which additional testing may be warranted. For example, a petition might note that reducing the concentration
of a specific high molecular weight aromatic decreased VOC emissions even though the overall concentration of similar
aromatics remained unchanged. The petitioner may be able to justify a reduced need for toxics measurement based on
the results of other studies which show that toxics are proportional to total aromatics rather than to individual
aromatics species. In exchange, additional testing may be justified for VOC emissions to enable a greater degree
of statistical confidence in the test results. As a result, the fuel supplier may be able to present EPA with sufficient
justification to warrant increased testing for VOC emissions and decreased testing for toxics emissions.

3. Exhaust and Nonexhaust Testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
VOC and air toxics emissions occur in both exhaust and nonexhaust emissions. However, EPA believes that the relationship
between fuel characteristics and nonexhaust emissions is known with greater certainty and precision than the relationship
between fuel characteristics and exhaust emissions. Nonexhaust emissions are a much simpler phenomenon to model
than exhaust emissions. Nonexhaust emissions are driven primarily by well-understood principles of physical chemistry
and are modified by devices such as charcoal canisters that are relatively easily modeled. Exhaust emissions, by
contrast, involve combustion and catalysis reactions that are not as well understood theoretically and are much
more difficult to model. In addition, exhaust emissions are estimated directly from the Federal Test Procedure (FTP)
utilizing the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule, while nonexhaust emissions are estimated from both FTP and non-FTP
test cycles in a complex process. Finally, data on nonexhaust emissions is much more extensive and internally consistent
than data for exhaust emissions. For these reasons, EPA is restricting testing to augment the model to exhaust emission
testing. Vehicle testing of nonexhaust emissions will not be accepted by EPA as the basis for augmentations to the
nonexhaust emission model promulgated in today's rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA reserves the right to revise the nonexhaust emission model in the future to reflect new data acquired by the Agency,
with such revisions taking effect after the start of Phase II of the program. In particular, either a new MOBILE model
or ongoing research aimed at modeling nonexhaust emissions as a function of true vapor pressure over a range of temperatures
may provide the basis for a revised nonexhaust model. The nonexhaust complex model being promulgated today relies
on the Reid vapor pressure (RVP) to characterize fuels' nonexhaust emission characteristics. However, RVP is measured
at a fixed fuel temperature (100 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F), while nonexhaust emissions occur over a wide range of fuel temperatures (80 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F to 130 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F). Since different oxygenates alter the relationship between RVP and true vapor pressure at a given temperature
to different extents, EPA believes that a model based on true vapor pressure would be more accurate for fuels containing
oxygenates than a model based solely on RVP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By permitting nonexhaust emissions from a given fuel to be estimated only from models and exhaust emissions to be estimated
based in part on vehicle testing, EPA believes that the accuracy of fuel emission estimates will be enhanced. EPA also
believes that this restriction will focus testing resources on those emission effects which the model predicts with
the least degree of certainty (i.e., exhaust emissions), thereby improving the degree of certainty of emission predictions
over the long run.

4. Eligibility of Fuel Properties for Testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In providing for augmentation of the complex model through vehicle testing, EPA's intent is to provide refiners with
the ability to take advantage of new or ongoing research into the relationship between fuel properties and exhaust
emissions. As discussed elsewhere in this section, however, the Agency believes that the complex model is more accurate
and reliable than any single test program for the parameters included in the model. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, augmentation by testing will be permitted only for certain fuel parameters and for certain levels of those
parameters. Augmentations will not be permitted for fuel parameters that are included and quantified in the complex
model database, regardless of whether they appear in the complex model itself. Such parameters were either not identified
or identified and later rejected during the rulemaking process, which included a series of regulatory negotiation
meetings, public workshops, and public meetings. EPA believes that the opportunities for error far exceed the potential
emission benefits from allowing model augmentations using parameters that did not survive the peer review process.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Augmentation through vehicle testing will be permitted to extend the valid range of the complex model for parameters
already included in the model. The purpose of such testing would be to determine the behavior of the parameter within
this extended range. Augmentations also will be permitted for parameters that neither have been included in today's
complex model nor were measured for the fuels contained in the complex model database. The purpose of testing in this
case would be to determine the behavior of new parameters, including any dilution and interactive effects. The test
requirements differ for these two cases to reflect differences in existing knowledge and environmental risk.

5. Test Fuels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency has three major goals that must be satisfied before accepting an augmentation to the complex model. First,
the augmentation must provide proper credit for fuel modifications. Second, the augmentation must account for dilution
effects properly. Third, the augmentation must account for interactive effects between the parameter being tested
and other fuel parameters properly. EPA believes that these three goals cannot be met without specifying at least
some of the characteristics of fuels to be included in a test program. The remainder of this section describes the basic
characteristics of the fuels required as part of a vehicle test program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fuels required to extend the range of existing complex model parameters.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Three ``extension fuels'' must be included in test programs intended to extend the range of the complex model for a
given parameter to a more extreme level. Extension fuel 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1 would contain the more extreme level of the parameter being extended in order to determine the parameter's effects
on emissions at this more extreme level. Extension fuel 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2 would contain the parameter being extended at levels at or near its current lower limit in the model. Extension fuel

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3 would contain the parameter being extended at levels at or near its current upper limit in the model. These latter
two fuels are necessary in order to estimate the size and significance of squared terms involving the parameter being
extended. For all three fuels, the levels of other complex model parameters are to be set at the levels specified in
Table V.2, which the Agency believes are representative of levels that will be found in typical reformulated fuels.
In addition, all three fuels must be blended from representative refinery streams to the extent practicable. The
three extension fuels must meet the requirements presented in Tables V.1 and V.2 to within the blending tolerances
specified in Table V.4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Complex Model contains interactive effects between the parameter in question and other parameters, two additional
fuels must be tested to quantify the magnitude of any such effect at extended levels of the parameter in question. For
each interacting parameter, the two additional fuels would contain the parameter being tested at levels identical
to that found in Extension Fuel 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The interacting parameter would be present at the levels specified in Table V.1 for Extension Fuels 2 and 3, respectively,
in the two additional fuels in order to quantify the size of the interactive effect over its full range. Other parameters
would be set at the levels specified in Table V.2. It should be noted that since today's complex model includes only
one interactive term (involving aromatics and E300), this situation would arise relatively infrequently.

In Table V.3, Fuel 1 is the candidate fuel, Fuel 3 is the candidate-baseline fuel, and Fuel 2 is a dilution fuel that is
tested to determine whether emissions respond linearly to levels of the candidate fuel parameter. Testing on addition
fuels 1, 2, and 3 will provide the data needed to assess the emission effects of the parameter being tested in isolation.
Three separate levels of the parameter are specified in order to provide data to estimate both linear and squared terms
involving the parameter, while other fuel parameters have been set at levels expected to be typical of in-use reformulated
gasolines. Fuels 4 and 5 are low-emitting fuels with candidate and baseline levels of the parameter in question. Fuels
6 and 7 are the corresponding high-emitting fuels. Testing on these four fuels will provide the data needed to assess
the existence and size of interactive effects between the parameter being tested and other fuel parameters already
included in the complex model. Estimating these effects for very high emitting fuels (addition fuels 6 and 7) and very
low emitting fuels (addition fuels 4 and 5) maximizes the sensitivity of the test program to such effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the parameter being tested is not specified for CAA baseline gasoline, its baseline level must be comparable to
its level in gasoline representative of commercial reformulated gasolines. Petitioners are required to obtain
approval for the baseline level of this parameter from the Agency prior to beginning their vehicle test programs.
Such approval would depend in part on the use of an appropriate basis for determining the properties of ``representative''
commercial reformulated gasolines. The basis for this specification and for the specifications described in Table
V.3 are discussed more fully in section IV.G of the RIA.

Other fuels requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To produce fuels with the parameter values listed above for the extension and addition fuels, the amount and type of
paraffins present in each fuel may require adjustments. These adjustments must reflect the distribution of paraffin
types in representative refinery streams. Two other issues must also be addressed regarding the composition and
properties of extension and addition fuels. First, non-compositional fuel properties such as RVP, E200, and E300
may differ from the values specified in Tables V.2 and V.3 as a natural result of compositional differences among fuels
or as a result of the inherent variability in blending processes. In such cases, the complex model is to be used to compensate
for such differences when evaluating vehicle testing results, as described in section 80.48 of today's regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, EPA also is concerned that variations due to blending may cause fuel parameters not included in the model to
vary among fuels, and such parameters may have significant emission effects not predicted by the model. To minimize
this risk, the properties of the various fuels must match those specified in Tables V.1 through V.3 to within the tolerances
defined in Table V.4. In addition, the extension and addition fuels must be blended from identical refinery streams
to the extent possible. Failure to meet this requirement would reduce the certainty that emission effects found in
vehicle testing are due solely to the parameter being tested. However, if a petitioner can show that it is not feasible
to meet all such tolerances for the petitioner's fuels due either to: (1) Naturally-resulting changes in fuel parameters
arising from changes in the parameter(s) in question or (2) blending technology limitations, EPA will consider modifying
the relevant tolerances. Any such request must come prior to the start of the test program. In such cases, EPA reserves
the right to use the model and relevant data from prior augmentation petitions to adjust for whatever differences
remain among the fuels.

6. Test Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reformulated gasoline program to achieve actual in-use reductions in fuel-related VOC and toxics emissions,
certification test results must correlate with reductions in in-use emissions. No test procedure, however, is completely
representative of all in-use conditions. The range of vehicle uses and operating conditions and the range of geographical
and climatic conditions throughout the country prevent a single test procedure from being entirely representative.
However, EPA has developed or is in the process of developing test procedures which attempt to reflect a broad spectrum
of in-use vehicle operating conditions. These test procedures were used in part to develop the emission factors in
EPA's MOBILE4.1, MOBILE5, and MOBILE5A emission models, which in turn have been used to develop the modeling option
for fuel certification. To maintain consistency between the certification methods, these test procedures also
are to be used for vehicle testing to augment the model.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exhaust emission testing. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Exhaust emissions must be measured through the use of the Federal Test Procedure (FTP) for new vehicle certification
(Subpart B of Part 86 of the Code of Federal Regulations) with modifications to allow vehicle preconditioning between
tests on different fuels and to provide for benzene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and 1,3-butadiene sampling and
analysis. Since POM (the fifth regulated toxic air pollutant) cannot currently be measured accurately and since
no single measurement procedure is generally accepted, its measurement is not required. A detailed description
of the toxics measurement procedures can be found in section 80.55 and section 80.56 of the regulations for this rulemaking.

Fuel parameter measurement precision. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One source of error in testing programs as described in this section is uncertainty in the composition and properties
of the fuels being tested. Since fuel testing is far less expensive than vehicle emission testing, EPA believes it
is highly cost effective to measure the properties of the fuels multiple times to reduce the uncertainty in projected
emissions due to uncertainty in fuel composition. As a result, at minimum, the properties defined in Table V.5 must
be measured a sufficient number of times to reduce the 95 percent confidence interval, as calculated using a standard
t-test, to the tolerances defined in Table V.5.

EPA recognizes that fuels used in vehicle testing may differ significantly in composition in terms of specific chemical
species while appearing to be identically composed in terms of broad chemical families. The Agency further recognizes
that such compositional differences may result in emission effects, and that such differences may confound or be
used to ``game'' testing programs. Therefore, the fuels used in vehicle testing must be blended from representative
refinery streams, and their composition must be fully characterized by gas chromatography or equivalent analysis
methods (following the methodology used in the Auto/Oil study

) and the results submitted to EPA. Petitioners would have the option of either submitting these results for approval
prior to beginning vehicle testing or including these results in their completed petition. However, in either case,
EPA would retain the authority to require modifications to the test fuels to ensure that their compositions are appropriate.
Hence petitioners electing not to obtain prior approval of their fuel compositions would assume the risk that EPA
may require modifications to the petitioner's test fuels upon receipt of the completed petition, thereby invalidating
any testing the petitioner may have completed.

EPA received a number of comments on its fuel specification and measurement precision proposals. Many of these comments

of detergents and octane specifications. A detailed discussion of comments can be found in Section VI.G of the RIA.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To maximize the accuracy and confidence in the results from a test program of the magnitude specified in this section,
it is good practice to ensure that systematic changes in the emission characteristics of the test vehicles do not occur
during testing. Such effects can overwhelm the fuel effects being measured. Therefore, the first fuel tested in any
given vehicle must be retested in that vehicle at the end of the test program. In addition, the order in which fuels are
tested on each vehicle must be randomized to prevent carryover effects from biasing test results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to comments, EPA has decided to remove the requirement for repeat measurements of VOC and NO

repeat measurements and recognizes that removal of the repeat testing requirements will make vehicle testing significantly
less onerous and time-consuming.

1990 Equivalency. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 211(k)(3) of the CAA specifies that the required reductions in VOC and toxics emissions are to be measured
from the emissions of those pollutants from ``baseline vehicles.'' Section 211(k)(10)(A) defines baseline vehicles
as representative model year 1990 (MY&hyph;90) vehicles. However, in order to simplify test vehicle selection and
remain consistent with the practices used to develop the complex model, other model year vehicles may be included
in the test program. Specifically, 1986 through 1989 model year vehicles may be tested if the 1990 version had an engine
and exhaust system that was not different from the earlier model year versions in ways that could affect the emission
performance of the vehicles (i.e., if the model's EPA emission certification data were ``carried over'' through
the 1990 model year

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). EPA retains the right to reject any non-1990 model year vehicle that the manufacturer deems to be different in terms
of emission control technology or engine design from 1990 vehicles made by that manufacturer. The test fleet must
be composed only of light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks, in keeping with the practices followed in developing
the complex model.

Vehicle selection criteria. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another consideration in vehicle selection is the condition of the test vehicles. EPA believes that Congress intended
that the required VOC and toxics emission reductions be achieved not only at certification but also in-use. In order
for this to be true, the test vehicles' condition should be representative of that of in-use vehicles. Therefore,
for the purposes of the reformulated gasoline program, representative vehicles must have emission performances
typical of the in-use emission performance of 1990 vehicles over their lifetime, a technology mix similar to that
of the 1990 model year fleet, and a minimum of 4,000 miles of service to assure break-in of engine and emission control
system components. In addition, the test fleet must contain vehicles with a distribution of VOC emissions similar
to that of in-use vehicles. Emissions of other pollutants tend to respond in a similar manner (e.g., carbon monoxide
and air toxics) or in an essentially uncorrelated manner (e.g., NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order for the emissions effects measured during vehicle testing to reflect the emission effects that will be experienced
by actual in-use vehicles, EPA considers it necessary to control the composition of the test fleet. As discussed in
Section IV, EPA's complex model has identified significant differences in the effects of fuel modifications on emissions
among vehicles from different emitter classes and technology groups. EPA's vehicle fleet requirements are intended
to assure that a sufficient number of vehicles are tested to provide statistical confidence in observed emission
effects, to assure that the vehicles tested are representative of the emission characteristics of in-use vehicles,
and to assure that the vehicles tested have emission control technologies that are representative of emission control
technologies found on 1990 model year vehicles.

In order that the test fleet for exhaust emission testing reflect the distribution in vehicle emission performance

proportion of vehicles in each subfleet is to be set equal to the distribution of vehicle emission performance when
enhanced I/M programs are in place. These proportions are shown in Table V.6, which is based on an EPA analysis

An option had been proposed for comment which would not have separated the test fleet into separate emitter groups
under the assumption that they may not respond differently to fuels. However, EPA's analysis of the complex model
database and the complex model itself indicates that this assumption is invalid. Hence EPA has determined that the
test fleet must contain vehicles from both emitter groups.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assembling a test fleet with the specified emission performance distribution requires vehicles to be obtained with
the desired emission performance. For the reformulated gasoline program, such vehicles must be obtained by randomly
selecting vehicles with the desired emission performance from the in-use fleet and testing those vehicles in their
as-received condition. This method helps assure that the vehicles selected for testing have emission control problems
that are representative of in-use emission problems. EPA had considered allowing normal emitting vehicles with
intentionally-disabled emission control systems to serve as higher emitting vehicles, but no suitable disablement
scheme has been identified and evidence indicating that disabled vehicles would have emission performance representative
of in-use higher emitters has not been found. For these reasons, EPA will not permit higher emitting vehicles to be
created by intentionally disabling normal emitting vehicles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Test vehicles' emission performance will need to be pre-screened to place them in the appropriate emitter group and
to assure the proper emissions distribution within the test fleet. Such prescreening tests must be conducted using
EPA vehicle certification fuel (Indolene) over the Federal Test Procedure since these were the conditions which
were used to generate the data for the in-use emission distribution. Prescreening tests can also be performed using
the Clean Air Act baseline gasoline and/or the I/M 240 test procedure. Results from such tests can be correlated with
FTP test results with Indolene (as outlined in section 80.62 of the accompanying regulations).

Technology Groups. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed in Section IV, the development of the complex model revealed that the emissions effect of fuel modifications
in normal emitting vehicles varied among the engine and exhaust system technologies present in 1990 model year vehicles.
Hence EPA has concluded that the normal emitter test fleet must have a technology distribution that is representative
of the technology distribution present in the 1990 model year fleet. The required distribution is shown in Table V.7.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the technology group criteria of Table V.7, approximately 30 percent of the vehicles selected for each
emitter class sub-fleet must be light-duty trucks (LDTs) to reflect the representation of LDTs in the light-duty
vehicle fleet. EPA believes that the benefits of providing flexibility in determining the selection of LDTs for the
test fleet outweigh the benefits of accuracy achieved by specifying which vehicles from Table V.7 should be LDTs.
However, as is also the case for other design elements of the test program, the distribution of LDTs among the normal
emitter technology groups is subject to EPA approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters objected to the application of this technology group distribution to the higher emitting vehicle
subfleet, as was specified in prior proposals. EPA's experience in developing the complex model, as discussed in
Section IV and the RIA, confirms that higher emitter emissions tend to be much less dependent on vehicle technology
differences than are normal emitter emissions. Therefore, the higher emitting vehicle subfleet need not meet the
technology distribution requirement, though a mixture of vehicle models and manufacturers should still be included.
The higher emitter subfleet also must meet the 1990 model year and light duty vehicle criteria described previously
and, like other elements of proposed testing programs, is subject to EPA approval.

Number of Test Vehicles. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Exhaust emissions are subject to considerable variability due to the complexity of combustion chemistry, engine
behavior, and emission control. As a result, substantial statistical uncertainty typically exists in exhaust emission
reduction estimates based on a single test program. To reduce this uncertainty, an adequate number of vehicles must
be tested for their exhaust emissions. In order to keep statistical uncertainty reasonably low while at the same time
limit the test fleet size to reasonable levels, the test fleet for exhaust emissions must consist of a minimum of 20
vehicles. To maintain adequate statistical confidence in test results, however, the distribution of the test fleet
among the emitter groups must also be defined so as to minimize statistical uncertainty. As discussed in the April
16, 1992 proposal, differences in VOC, NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and toxics emission distributions for in-use vehicles prevents optimization of the size of the emitter groups for
all three pollutants simultaneously. EPA is basing the number of vehicles in each emitter group on their VOC emission
performance, based on the reasons discussed in the April 16, 1992 proposal and on the use of VOC emission performance
to define emitter groups.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The uncertainty associated with VOC emissions is quite complex. The higher emitting vehicles in various test programs
have tended to have significantly greater variability in emission effects than normal emitting vehicles. Hence
to minimize statistical uncertainty, a greater proportion of higher emitters should be tested than would be suggested
by their contribution to in-use emissions. However, EPA believes that pre-screening and stabilization of higher
emitters can reduce their variability to approach that of normal emitters. Therefore, to minimize the statistical
uncertainty in the test program the number of normal and higher emitters in the test fleet should represent the contribution
of each sub-fleet to total in-use emissions. Since the relative contribution of normal and higher emitters to total
VOC emissions is approximately equal (as discussed at length in the RIA), equal numbers of normal and higher emitters
must be contained in any test fleet.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Waiver Provisions for Different Test Program Requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of options were discussed in April 16, 1992 which attempted to simplify or minimize the vehicle test fleet
requirements while still maintaining the statistical confidence in the results of any test program. Based upon EPA's
experience with the programs conducted as part of the complex model development, the test fleet provisions promulgated
here represent the minimum possible if adequate statistical confidence in test program results is to be maintained.
In fact, EPA believes that many petitioners may desire to test additional vehicles in order to improve their study's
statistical power and thereby improve the likelihood that an augmentation petition would be granted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, in some instances petitioners may believe that a more optimal test fleet composition than the one specified
above exists for the fuel parameter being tested. In such cases, petitioners can petition the Administrator to approve
a waiver from certain of the requirements in this section relating to the number of test vehicles and their distribution
among the normal and higher emitter groups. Any such waiver would have to be obtained in advance of the start of the test
program involved. A request for such a waiver must include an adequate justification for the requested change, including
the rationale for the request and supporting data and information. EPA reserves the right to require testing of additional
vehicles beyond the 20-vehicle minimum where such testing is necessary to evaluate emission effects properly.

Weighting of emission test data. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The manner in which the test data is to be analyzed must be consistent with the goal that the emission benefits from reformulated
gasoline be realized in-use, just as is the case for the exhaust emission complex model itself (as discussed in Section
IV). Therefore, augmentation of the models with vehicle testing results must reflect the effects of fuel modifications
on emissions of each exhaust pollutant (VOC, NO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, benzene, 1,3-butadiene, formaldehyde, and acetaldehyde) on 1990 vehicles. The augmentation also must incorporate
differences in these effects for vehicles with different emission control technologies and different emission
levels. The vehicle selection criteria discussed above are intended to satisfy these requirements without requiring
an extremely large test fleet. The results of vehicle test programs will be weighted to reflect the contribution of
each emitter class and technology type to in-use emissions according to the procedure described in Section IV for
the exhaust emission complex model.

Data analysis to extend the range of existing model parameters. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When extending the range of a fuel parameter already included in the complex model, EPA believes that the data generated
through vehicle testing should be combined with the data used to develop the complex model itself. This approach offers
several important advantages. First, it takes full advantage of existing knowledge regarding the effects of the
parameter in question on emissions. Second, it reduces inconsistencies between the complex model and the augmentation,
thereby simplifying certification and enforcement. Third, it reduces the possibility of petitioners deliberately
manipulating the test program to obtain a desired augmentation since the limited data generated by the test program
will be combined with the much more extensive data available in the complex model database.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The analysis process is described in detail in section 80.48 of today's regulations and in Section IV.G of the RIA.
The process requires that the emission effects of the parameter being tested be verified at the extended level while
not permitting emission effects of other parameters to be modified from the effects incorporated in the complex model.
In addition, the augmentation would only apply to fuels with levels of the parameter being tested that fall outside
the range for which the complex model is valid. These safeguards are intended to prevent the results of vehicle testing
from being used to alter aspects of the complex model that a fuel supplier or other organization deems undesirable.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Data analysis to add new fuel parameters. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Vehicle test data for new fuel parameters such as new additives cannot be analyzed in the manner described above for
existing fuel parameters. Vehicle-to-vehicle variability can cause significant differences in vehicle responses
to parameters already included in the complex model from what the complex model would predict. The analysis method
described above would apply these differences entirely to the new parameter, which would allow substantial opportunities
to game the testing and model augmentation process. To minimize the risk of gaming and assure proper representation
of the effects of new fuel parameters, a different analysis process must be used when augmenting the model with a new
fuel parameter. This process is designed to identify the effects of the new parameter itself, including its behavior
upon dilution, as well as any interactive effects between the parameter and existing complex model parameters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The process itself is described in detail in section 80.48 in today's regulations and in Section IV of the RIA. The modeling
process incorporates five techniques to minimize gaming and isolate the actual emission effects of the new parameter
being tested. First, the complex model is used to adjust the emissions performance of the test vehicles on the three
fuels for any differences in fuel parameters other than the one being tested. These adjustments should be minor, since
fuel properties other than the one being tested are required to be nearly identical. Second, the linear and squared
terms for the new parameter are determined based on test data from addition fuels 1, 2, and 3 before interactive effects
are introduced into the augmented complex model based on the results of testing addition fuels 4, 5, 6, and 7. This approach
is used because the direct effects of fuel parameters (represented by the linear and squared terms) are less easily
gamed or obscured than are interactive effects since fewer variables are involved. Third, the statistical criteria
defined in section 80.57 are used to assure that only statistically significant terms are included in the augmentation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourth, the model must include all terms for the pollutant being modeled that are already included in the complex model.
In addition, only the linear, squared, and interactive terms involving the new parameter are permitted to enter the
augmentation. The coefficients for the complex model terms will be fixed at the values established in this rule. By
not permitting the augmentation to change existing complex model terms, the analysis process reduces opportunities
to game to modify complex model effects that the testing organization considers undesirable.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Fifth, augmentations are not permitted for parameters not contained in the complex model but for which measurements
exist in the complex model database. Including such parameters in an augmented complex model is likely to result in
large changes in complex model coefficients due to the interrelationship between fuel properties. Such changes
would complicate enforcement and might introduce fungibility problems that would diminish the in-use effectiveness
of reformulated fuels. Further, EPA's experience in developing the complex model suggests that including such parameters
would introduce collinearity problems and exacerbate the risk of test program gaming. Since such parameters were
considered for inclusion in the complex model but were rejected based on input from affected parties and EPA staff,
EPA has decided not to permit augmentations for such parameters. However, the Agency will consider including such
parameters in subsequent revisions to the complex model. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interactive terms were not permitted to enter EPA's complex models for exhaust toxics, as discussed in Section IV
and the RIA. Hence interactive effects on toxics emissions are not permitted in augmentation petitions, unless the
test program was intended and specificially designed to investigate such effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preceding discussion assumes that the interactive effects identified through testing cannot be traced to a specific
cause. If the cause of the interactive effect can be identified, it may be appropriate to determine a greater beneficial
augmentation due to the parameter in question than the effects identified through the procedure above or to include
an interactive term in the complex model. Therefore, EPA will allow testing of additional fuels to identify the cause
of the interactive effect and the magnitude of the effect for representative in-use fuels (again subject to Agency
approval regarding the appropriateness of the petitioner's definition of representative gasoline). Petitioners
will be required to obtain approval from the Administrator for the proposed additional testing before beginning
such testing. Petitioners will be permitted to claim larger benefits for the parameter in question based on the results
of such tests, subject to the approval of the Administrator.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Clean Air Act (the Act), as amended in November 1990, establishes a more stringent minimum level of control of ozone-forming
VOCs and air toxics emissions from reformulated gasoline beginning in the year 2000 than is required prior to that
date. For the first five years of the reformulated gasoline program (Phase I; January 1, 1995 through December 1999),
Congress established a minimum requirement of 15% reduction of ozone forming VOCs and toxic air pollutants [CA section
211(k)(3)(B)].
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Starting with January 1, 2000 (Phase II), the 15% minimum required reductions are increased to 25%, with the provision
that EPA may increase or decrease this level based on technological feasibility, considering cost, but may not decrease
it below 20% [CA section 211(k)(3)(B)]. The restriction on increases in NO

1. Statutory Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 211(k)(1) requires that reformulated gasoline achieve the greatest reductions possible in volatile organic
compounds (VOCs) and toxics emissions, ``taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reductions,
any nonair-quality and other air-quality related health and environmental impacts and energy requirements. Specifically,
section 211(k)(3)(B) of the Act requires that, in the year 2000 and beyond, ``aggregate emissions of ozone-forming
volatile organic compounds from baseline vehicles
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

compounds from such vehicles when using baseline gasoline
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
9
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.'' Similarly, a 25% reduction in emissions of toxic air pollutants is required. The Act also specifies that the Administrator
may adjust the 25 percent reduction level to provide for lesser or greater reductions based on technological feasibility,
giving consideration to the cost of achieving such reductions. In no case can the required reduction be less than 20
percent. The Act further provides that emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Section 211(c) of the Act allows the Administrator to regulate fuels or fuel additives if ``any emission product of

``except after consideration of all relevant medical and scientific evidence available * * *, including consideration
of other technologically or economically feasible means of achieving emissions standards.'' In addition, EPA must
find that the prohibition ``will not cause the use of any other fuel or fuel additive which will produce emissions which
will endanger the public health or welfare to the same or greater degree than the use of the [regulated fuel/fuel additive].''

2. Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA proposed a range of VOC and toxics performance standards for Phase II reformulated gasoline, covering a variety
of options for setting these standards [see the Notice of Correction for the Proposed Rule 58 FR 17175 (April 1, 1993)].
The proposed VOC standards ranged between 29.7 and 37.7 percent reduction in emissions for VOC control region 1 areas
(Class A and B, the southern areas of the country) based on a baseline fuel with an RVP of 8.7 psi
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and between 26.7 and 34.7 percent reduction for VOC control region 2 areas (Class C, the northern areas of the country)
[58 FR 17178, 17179, 17180 (April 1, 1993)]. These percentage reductions are in comparison to the emissions performance
of baseline vehicles operating on baseline gasoline; the proposed version of the complex model was used to establish
a fuel's emissions performance. In proposing the range of values EPA considered the costs of VOC control, the cost-effectiveness
of the controls, the health and environmental effects, energy impacts, and technological feasibility.

 standards ranged from 0 to 14.8 percent reduction for VOC control region 1 (southern areas) and 0 to 15.4 percent reduction
for VOC control region 2 (northern areas) [58 FR 17178&hyph;9 (April 1, 1993)]. Again, the NO

 emissions performance of a fuel would be determined using the proposed complex model. The range of proposed standards
was based, in part, on different levels of potentially acceptable cost-effectiveness as well as whether the cost-effectiveness
was calculated based on reductions in NO

 standard presented the option of setting a standard for larger VOC reductions. EPA analyzed the cost-effectiveness
of a more stringent VOC standard in connection with a NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standard, and proposed a range of values depending on the target cost-effectiveness level: for southern areas, 29.7&hyph;40.2
percent based on an 8.7 psi baseline RVP (20.7&hyph;33.8 percent reduction based on a 7.8 psi baseline RVP); for northern
areas, 26.7&hyph;37.3 percent reduction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In analyzing potential VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction requirements, EPA looked at two potential cost-effectiveness targets: $5,000/ton and $10,000/ton.
These figures were selected as representative of the range of cost-effectiveness for controls which would be incurred
by many ozone nonattainment areas in achieving attainment. In addition, they reflected higher cost-effectiveness
values than those for any then-existing federal nationwide motor vehicle or motor vehicle fuel control programs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, EPA proposed a toxics emissions reduction standard between 20 and 25 percent. The 25 percent reduction standard
proposed was based on the level specified in section 211(k)(3)(ii) of the Act. In the proposal, EPA recognized that
while on average this level of toxics control was cost effective, it could be highly cost ineffective for some refiners.
The statutory minimum 20 percent reduction standard was proposed as an alternative to allow refiners further flexibility
in meeting the VOC and NO

3. General Comments Received on Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA received several comments recommending a reproposal of the Phase II standards once the complex model was finalized
and EPA could develop a single standard for each pollutant. One comment stated that the construct of the complex model
will have a significant effect on the standards, and it was therefore not possible to comment on the costs or performance
of the Phase II standards as proposed (since they were not based on the final complex model). Others commented that
it was improper to establish standards until the model that predicts benefits exists. EPA does not believe it is necessary
to repropose these standards, since the proposal presented a range of values for the standards and outlined all of
the options that were considered. The final standards were derived based on the final complex model, so the standards
include the effect of the complex model on the emissions reductions predicted. EPA had proposed, and it was agreed
in Reg-Neg, that the Phase II standards would be promulgated with the complex model. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Briefly described below are the factors EPA considered in setting the standards being promulgated today, the methodology
used in determining the cost-effectiveness of fuel controls, and the reasoning used in determining the standards.
The full analysis leading to the final standards is more thoroughly discussed in section VI of the regulatory impact
analysis (RIA) associated with this rulemaking.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In determining the Phase II reformulated gasoline standards, EPA considered the health, environmental, and energy
impacts, as well as the cost and the technological feasibility of reformulating gasoline to attain emission reductions
of VOCs, toxics, and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. EPA's analyses of these factors are discussed briefly below, and in detail in the RIA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Health and Environmental Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the reformulated gasoline program is to reduce motor vehicle emissions of ozone forming VOCs and certain
specified toxic air pollutants in those areas most in need of such reductions. As discussed above, EPA is also reducing
ozone forming NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions from RFG as a part of this rulemaking. EPA measured the health and environmental benefits of the reformulated
gasoline program in terms of the number of tons of VOC, NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and toxics reduced, since the Act specifies mass-based emissions reductions. The benefits of toxics reductions
were further evaluated on the basis of the number of cancer incidences avoided, since this is a common measure of the
effectiveness of toxics control. The reader is directed to section C below for quantified estimates of these reductions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The benefits of ozone reduction will be gained through the reduction of both VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions. Ambient ozone levels and the effect of VOC emission reductions on these levels vary from city to city, making
it difficult to quantify the benefits of the VOC reduction beyond tons of emissions reduced. In general, reductions
in VOC emissions will improve the air quality of most affected areas and thereby reduce the negative health impacts
of exposure to high levels of ozone. Visibility and other environmental measures are also improved through reductions
in emissions of ozone precursors. Similar benefits will be gained through reductions in NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions. The reader is directed to subsection C.2 for further discussion on the health and environmental benefits
of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reducing ozone levels in highly populated urban areas would help to reduce short-term health effects such as impaired
lung function, cough, nausea, chest pain, throat irritation, increased susceptibility to respiratory infection,
and increased sensitivity of asthmatics to allergens (e.g., pollen) and other bronchoconstrictors. Long-term
health effects of exposure to ozone include accelerated aging of the lungs, reduced elasticity of the lungs, scarring
of lung tissue, and permanent reductions in baseline lung function. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the reformulated gasoline program is concentrated in urban areas, some reformulated gasoline will be used
in rural areas as a result of spillover in the distribution system. Reducing ozone levels in rural areas would enhance
agricultural crop yield, currently estimated to be reduced by as much as $2&hyph;3 billion per year by existing ozone
concentrations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
11
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition, lower ozone levels would help reduce damage to forest ecosystems which experience lower tree growth
rate, foliage damage, and increased susceptibility to stress (e.g., insects, disease, drought) caused by current
tropospheric ozone levels.

Reductions in mobile source emissions of the air toxics addressed in the reformulated gasoline program (benzene,
1,3-butadiene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and POM) may result in fewer cancer incidences. A number of adverse
noncancer health effects have also been associated with exposure to air toxics, particularly with higher level exposures
experienced in particular microenvironments such as parking garages and refueling stations. These other health
effects include blood disorders, heart and lung diseases, and eye, nose, and throat irritation. Some of the toxics
may also be developmental and reproductive toxicants, while very high exposure can cause effects on the brain leading
to respiratory paralysis and even death. The use of reformulated gasoline meeting the Phase II standards will likely
help to reduce some of these health effects, as well. A more thorough discussion of the variety of possible non-cancer
effects of concern from exposure to air toxics is contained in EPA's Motor Vehicle-Related Air Toxics Study.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and toxics will require an increase in the amount of energy used at the refinery. An estimate of the energy used depends
on many factors, including how the energy balance is evaluated, the type and source of oxygenate, the refinery configuration,
and the reformulation approach. Determining an exact energy increase associated with reformulated gasoline production
(on the basis of a constant level of gasoline energy produced) is difficult. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As later sections of this document will show, the standards for VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction promulgated today will likely be met largely through reductions in the sulfur content and Reid vapor pressure
(RVP) of the fuel. The process used to remove sulfur from gasoline, hydrodesulfurization, is an energy intensive
process; mainly due to the need for and consumption of hydrogen. The energy impact will depend on the sulfur level of
the crude used by the refinery and the level of sulfur control necessary for that refinery to meet the standards. Reducing
the RVP of the fuel requires removal of the lighter compounds in the fuel, also an energy consuming process. Overall,
it is expected that the energy consumption by refineries in producing Phase II reformulated gasoline will increase
slightly (perhaps a couple percent) over the level of energy used to make Phase I RFG, but the magnitude of this increase
is difficult to measure due to the many variables involved.

3. Technological Feasibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA also considered the technological feasibility of producing fuels to meet the Phase II standards. EPA believes
that the refinery modeling results (from which the fuel parameter control costs were estimated) indicated that it
is technologically feasible to make the fuel parameter changes that were analyzed in developing the standards. The
refinery models utilize only well-developed, demonstrated, commercially available technologies, and are designed
to only model fuels within the limits of these technologies.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
15
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Given the cost incentives created by this rulemaking, in all likelihood new technologies will be developed between
now and the year 2000 which will reduce the costs for certain types of fuel parameter changes. Thus, EPA believes that
the determination of fuel parameter control costs using the results of the existing refinery models is reasonable,
that the costs generated are perhaps conservative, and that the technological feasibility of producing such emission-reducing
fuels is justifiable. This position was supported by many of the comments received. While other commenters questioned
the costs used in developing the proposal (as discussed in subsection 4.b), no comments questioned the technological
feasibility of these refinery configurations.

Because the standards promulgated today will not take effect until the year 2000, and because all the processes needed
to produce complying fuels are already commercially available, EPA does not believe that lead time will be an issue
in achieving the required emissions reductions.

4. Fuel Safety and Driveability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA evaluated safety concerns associated with the use of low RVP fuels and found no significant negative impacts,
as discussed in the RIA. Comments also raised concerns about driveability problems arising from the use of low RVP
fuels. They raised concerns that EPA's analysis in the proposal did not address spring months (the transition time
to the VOC control period), September RVP fuel sold in October, and low RVP gasoline sold in low temperature areas near
nonattainment areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While neither EPA nor any other organization conducted driveability testing at low ambient summer temperatures,
EPA has looked at the actual vapor pressure of fuels currently in production, as documented in the draft RIA.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
16
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Based upon a comparison of actual vapor pressures, EPA believes that 6.5 psi RVP fuel in the summer should have similar
driveability to current winter fuels. At this time EPA believes there should be no significant driveability problems
with gasoline at an RVP level down to 6.5 psi. Until such time as data can be gathered to more fully evaluate the driveability
impacts of low RVP fuels, EPA believes that 6.5 psi may present a practical lower limit below which the existence of
adverse driveability impacts is unknown. Discussions with representatives of both the oil and automotive industries
reflected a similar uneasiness in going below 6.5 psi RVP given the lack of data at lower levels. However, the standards
for Phase II RFG are performance based standards. As a result, flexibility exists for refiners to meet the Phase II
standards, without reducing the RVP of the gasoline below 6.5 psi.

Introduction. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of this discussion, EPA defines cost-effectiveness as the ratio of the incremental cost of a control
measure to the incremental benefit, e.g., tons of VOC or other emissions reduced. Considering cost-effectiveness
allows the Agency to develop a relative ranking of various ozone and toxics control strategies so that an environmental
goal can be achieved at minimum cost. As the cost-effectiveness of an emission reduction strategy increases, it may
be possible to achieve similar, substantial emission control in other ways (e.g., through other regulatory programs)
at the same or lower cost per unit of benefit. EPA therefore considered cost-effectiveness in deciding what VOC, NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and toxics control, if any, to impose beyond the minimum levels required under section 211(k)(3)(B).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter recommended that EPA evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this program separately for small and large
refiners, and also that EPA consider granting small refiners more time to comply with the requirements (as is allowed
by California for California reformulated gasoline). The California reformulated gasoline program requires all
refiners selling gasoline in the state to produce reformulated gasoline, and thus does not afford any flexibility
to refiners, large or small. The federal RFG program, however, does not require 100% production of RFG in any region,
nor does it require that every refiner produce RFG. Hence, small refiners can choose not to produce RFG and instead
supply conventional gasoline if the costs of complying with the program are too burdensome. For those small refiners
electing to produce RFG, the option to select between per gallon and averaging standards, as well as the ability to
set their own baselines, gives them flexibility to meet the standards in the manner that is most cost effective for
them. Furthermore, the enforcement structure is based on a single set of standards for Phase II RFG. Allowing some
refiners to comply with a different set of standards would require additional and more complicated enforcement provisions,
and could jeopardize the fungibility of reformulated gasolines.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
17
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Since EPA believes that the existing program provides sufficient flexibility to small refiners, there is no need
to pursue multiple enforcement programs. See section XV for additional discussion of the impact of this rule on small
refiners.

Many comments were received on the costs used in the proposal. Some of these comments, and EPA's response, are summarized
here, while the RIA contains a complete discussion and analysis of the comments received. Several commenters questioned
the appropriateness of using independent refinery models to generate costs for control of individual parameters.
In addition, they questioned the aggregation of results from regional models to generate national average costs,
and recommended instead using a model from the region likely to realize the highest costs for producing reformulated
gasoline (PADD 1). While using regional models to estimate national average costs requires an acknowledgment of
the inherent limitations in such models, EPA believes that it is appropriate to use them for the purpose of determining
the costs to produce reformulated gasoline. The limitations and assumptions made in using the refinery models and
the results of this analysis are discussed in detail in the RIA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The manufacturing cost of producing gasoline is the sum of the capital recovery cost and the operating costs, adjusted
for changes in the energy content of the fuel (to represent consistent fuel economy). VOC control is mandated only
during the high ozone season, and thus all costs were allocated to the high ozone season in the refinery modeling work.
In contrast to VOC control, toxics control and the benefits from reductions in toxics emissions occur year-round.
Although the costs of toxics control should be determined on an annual basis, EPA used the same costs that were used
for the VOC analysis, since it had been determined in the RIA (and supported by many comments received) that additional
toxics control would be highly cost-ineffective. The level of either VOC or toxics control that is cost effective
is not greatly affected by the accuracy of the costs, due to the magnitude of reductions achieved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some comments received on the proposal raised the concern that this method of determining costs did not accurately
reflect all of the costs of the program, since the ``compliance costs'' for record keeping and enforcement, as well
as costs incurred by pipelines or other entities, were not included. While it is true that ``compliance costs'' will
be incurred as a result of the reporting and enforcement requirements of Phase II RFG, EPA does not anticipate the costs
to be greater than those incurred by the Phase I RFG program. Refiners will already be supplying the information required
by EPA for Phase I, and will continue to do so under Phase II. Hence, there is no additional cost of compliance to add to
the costs of Phase II RFG. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other factors affecting incremental fuel parameter control costs include the amount of reformulated gasoline produced
by the refinery and the effects of fuel parameter changes on fuel economy. Because producing reformulated gasoline
reduces flexibility in refinery operations, the cost of producing such fuels increases with the amount of reformulated
gasoline that is produced in a given refinery. In this analysis, EPA used a scenario of RFG production based on participation
in the reformulated gasoline program by the nine mandated areas, those areas which had opted into the program as of
August 14, 1993 (the close of the comment period on the proposal), the entire Northeast Ozone Transport Region (including
both attainment and nonattainment areas), and all other ozone nonattainment areas. This scenario was chosen to represent
the Phase II RFG program that would result if all eligible areas opted into the program. Since the Ozone Transport Commission
has not announced plans to opt-in to the RFG program, and the only additional nonattainment areas that have opted into
the program since August 14 are those located in Kentucky, the volume of RFG production used for this analysis is overstated
by about 20 percentage points. As a result, the cost estimates are higher than will likely be experienced, since use
of RFG in the entire Northeast would severely limit refinery production in that region, incurring somewhat higher
costs to individual refiners, particularly to those refiners which for economic reasons would choose not to produce
RFG and merely continue producing conventional fuel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA evaluated the costs for incremental control levels for a variety of fuel parameters. This evaluation revealed
that the greater the level of control, the higher the costs of achieving that level. Complete information on the development
of the individual parameter costs is provided in the RIA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments were received questioning the validity of evaluating the cost-effectiveness of Phase II RFG on
a parameter by parameter basis. The recommended alternative was to evaluate the cost of producing a gasoline meeting
the standards for a variety of refinery configurations, and to use this information to determine the cost-effectiveness
of the standard. As explained in the RIA, EPA determined that it was appropriate to evaluate cost-effectiveness on
an incremental basis to properly compare fuel controls to other forms of emission control.

Emissions reductions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_In determining the emission reductions and the associated cost-effectiveness of VOC control, EPA employed a convention
typically used in estimating the benefit of both mobile and stationary source VOC controls. This convention requires
the determination of cost-effectiveness on the basis of annual tons of VOC reduced. Thus, even though VOC emission
reductions required under section 211(k) occur only during the high ozone season, the convention is to calculate
the cost of the fuel parameter control per ton of VOC removed as if the high ozone season emission reductions were spread
over the whole year. Comments were received that questioned the appropriateness of evaluating the cost-effectiveness
on an annualized tons reduced basis rather than on a summer tons reduced basis, since the program is a summer program.
The purpose of applying this convention to the evaluation of Phase II RFG was to allow direct comparison of the cost-effectiveness
of this program with the cost-effectiveness of other VOC control strategies, which is typically calculated on a year-round
basis. The only other appropriate alternative would be to recalculate the cost-effectiveness of all other programs
on the basis of cost per ton of control during the high ozone season, the only time period when emission reductions for
the purposes of ozone control are of any significant value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reductions in emissions of both exhaust and evaporative VOC are determined for a given fuel parameter change using
the complex model. As discussed in earlier sections, the complex model statutory baseline emissions are based on
1990 vehicle technology, and compliance with the Phase II standards is measured relative to these base emissions.
As explained in the RIA, EPA determined that the olefin level specified in the statutory baseline was not representative
of the actual olefin level of gasoline in 1990. Phase I RFG includes no specific limits on olefins, and thus refiners
can meet Phase I standards (under the complex model) by controlling any fuel parameters. However, refiners whose
olefin baseline is significantly higher than the statutory level may need to reduce olefins to meet the no NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 increase requirement, putting them at a competitive disadvantage because olefin control is costly. Hence, using
data from Bonner and Moore modelling as well as fuel surveys from cities across the country, the baseline olefin level
was reevaluated and set at 13.1 vol% for the purposes of determining cost-effectiveness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the standards require reductions for baseline vehicles relative to the emissions from the statutory baseline
fuel, the cost-effectiveness of a given fuel parameter control is measured based on actual, i.e., in-use emission
reductions. For this reason, EPA determined the cost-effectiveness of fuel parameter changes relative to the incremental
in-use emissions. The baseline in-use emissions were determined for 2003, a typical post-1999 year, using MOBILE5a
with enhanced inspection and maintenance (I/M), as discussed in section IV.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
22
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Exhaust and evaporative percent reductions for in-use emissions are determined separately by applying the percent
reduction in emissions predicted by the complex model to the in-use emissions, and then totalled to get total in-use
emissions reductions. The cost, emissions reductions, and cost-effectiveness of incremental changes in fuel parameters
for Phase II RFG is calculated relative to Phase I RFG.

To determine the cost-effectiveness of the toxics standard, EPA employed the convention of basing cost-effectiveness
on the number of cancer incidences avoided. The number of cancer incidences avoided is determined based on the reduction
in emissions of each regulated air toxic. The complex model was used to calculate the annual reduction in both exhaust
and evaporative emissions of each toxic for each fuel reformulation. Each toxic emission has a different unit risk
factor, defined as the number of cancer incidences per year per gram-per-mile-emission per person. Therefore, the
emissions of each toxic pollutant were converted to an estimate of annual cancer incidences using the risk factor
for that pollutant and the population of the participating reformulated gasoline areas. The total cancer incidences
resulting from the total toxics emissions were then calculated by summing the cancer incidences for the individual
toxics.

 The costs and emissions reductions for each parameter change are combined to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness
($/ton) of each level of control, assigning all of the costs to the control of the pollutant of concern (VOC or NO

). Several comments were received regarding this method of establishing cost-effectiveness. One comment suggested
that refiners are likely to reduce parameters to levels lower than the mandated limits to ensure compliance with the
standards. Thus it was suggested that the cost analysis should be based on a marginal increase in the standard to determine
the true cost-effectiveness of the program. EPA's cost-effectiveness analysis is inherently an averaging analysis,
however, since the cost estimates are based on the responses of average regional refineries to changes in fuel composition.
Averaging allows refiners to be high or low for any batch of fuel, as long as their average meets the standard over the
course of the entire compliance period. Measurement error goes both above and below the true values on any given batch
of fuel, but should average zero over the course of many batches. As a result, there is no need for a compliance margin
in setting an averaging standard.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

 Several commenters stated that $5,000/ton was most appropriate, particularly in light of the inaccuracies in the
cost analysis. Some commenters believed that $5,000/ton was too high compared to alternate control strategies,
while others stated that this was reasonable compared to other strategies currently required.

 control programs (see subsections C.1 and C.2 below), EPA believes that a cost-effectiveness benchmark of $10,000/ton
is too high at this point in time and that a cost-effectiveness of approximately $5,000/ton is more appropriate for
the Phase II VOC standard and the accompanying NO

The cost-effectiveness of toxics control was similarly determined as the ratio of the total incremental cost for
the incremental reduction in emissions to the total tons of toxics reduced. The cost-effectiveness of toxics control
was also calculated as the ratio of total costs to incremental reductions in cancer incidences. EPA's proposal did
not include any benchmark limits for the cost-effectiveness of toxics control, but did acknowledge that in most cases
control above the statutory minimum was not cost-effective. This conclusion was supported by the comments received,
and by the final analysis presented here.

 Sulfur can be reduced to a level of approximately 250 ppm at an incremental cost-effectiveness of less than $5,000
per ton, gaining an additional 0.6% VOC reduction, to achieve a total reduction (on average) of 26.1%. RVP could also
be reduced further to 6.5 psi, the level currently considered a reasonable limit for driveability purposes, to obtain
an additional 1.1% reduction (for a total of 27.2%). Incremental changes in fuel parameters other than RVP have only
a marginal effect on VOC emissions and can be very costly; less than an additional one percent reduction would be achieved
at a significantly higher incremental cost of over $10,000/ton VOC. In spite of the uncertainty in the cost estimates
used, the level of VOC control that is cost effective is relatively insensitive to variations in cost due to the fact
that anything other than RVP and the first increment of sulfur control causes the costs to escalate dramatically,
making control of other parameters cost ineffective.

The cost-effectiveness of VOC control in Phase II RFG presented in Table VI&hyph;1 has been compared to the cost-effectiveness
of other stationary and mobile source VOC control strategies. As summarized in the RIA, a review of the estimated cost-effectiveness
of controlling VOC emissions from stationary sources yielded a wide range of values. Many of the existing VOC control
strategies have minimal costs or even result in savings. However, a number of VOC control options have significant
costs associated with them. For example, the estimated cost-effectiveness of reducing emissions from automobile
and light truck coating operations in assembly plants is $1,000&hyph;4,000/ton VOC. Reducing emissions from the
production of pneumatic rubber tires is estimated to cost between $150 and $18,800 per ton of VOC reduced, depending
on the operation to which control is applied. Control of emissions from floating roof tanks used for storage of petroleum
liquids can cost up to $3,700/ton VOC reduced. Reducing emissions from the production of high density polyethylene,
polypropylene, and polystyrene resins can cost between $1,000 and $3,000/ton VOC reduced depending on the level
of control.

to use VOC controlled Phase II RFG only during the time of the year when control is needed (the summer months). Third,
special fuel distribution for RFG will already be in place in these areas; many of the costs of producing and distributing
this new gasoline will have been incurred as a result of the Phase II program. Fourth, EPA has shown (in the RIA and the

Consideration of section 202 motor vehicle controls.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Before controlling or prohibiting a fuel or fuel additive under section 211(c)(1)(A), the Administrator must consider
``other technologically or economically feasible means of achieving emission standards under section [202].''
This has been interpreted as requiring consideration of regulation through motor vehicle standards under section
202 prior to regulation of fuels or fuel additives under section 211(c)(1)(A) [

., 541 F.2d 1, 32 (D.C. Cir. 1976)]. This does not establish a mandatory preference for vehicle controls over fuel controls,
but instead calls for the good faith consideration of motor vehicle standards before imposition of fuel controls
[541 F.2d at 32 n.66]. This reflects Congress' recognition that fuel controls under section 211(c)(1)(A) might logically
involve controls on fuel composition itself, while vehicle standards under section 202 are generally performance
standards, regulating vehicle emissions and not the design or structure of the vehicle. Fuel controls might therefore
lead to greater government involvement in the regulation of the manufacturing process than would be expected from
vehicle controls [541 F.2d at 11 n.13]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress addressed this concern by requiring agency ``consideration'' of vehicle standards under section 202 before
imposition of fuel controls under section 211(c)(1)(A). It is important to note that the Administrator must in good
faith consider such vehicle controls, but retains full discretion in deciding whether to adopt either fuel or vehicle
controls, or both [541 F.2d at 32 n.66]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In evaluating motor vehicle controls under section 202 in this context, the first major point to consider is that EPA
has already imposed more stringent NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to motor vehicle controls under section 202, EPA has recently adopted or proposed other controls aimed
at in-use NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions from mobile sources. The enhanced inspection and maintenance (I/M) rules call for use of these more stringent
I/M procedures starting with 1996 [57 FR 52950, November 5, 1992]. EPA has also proposed standards that would limit
NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions from new large horsepower diesel non-road engines, pursuant to section 213 of the Act [58 FR 28809, May 17,
1993]. While enhanced I/M programs will directly affect the motor vehicle fleet, the non-road engine regulations
are similar to the motor vehicle regulations under section 202 in that they would apply to new non-road engines only,
and therefore involve a certain time before a significant portion of this category of non-road engines is replaced
by new engines certified to meet the NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional mobile source controls, whether under section 202 or under other authority such as described above, may
well be cost effective and reasonable options that EPA might decide to adopt. However, there are certain limitations
imposed by Congress on adoption of more stringent standards (``Tier 2 standards''). For example, Congress spelled
out when and under what conditions EPA may promulgate more stringent NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standards for light-duty vehicles and trucks. Congress required that EPA conduct a study on whether more stringent
standards for light-duty vehicles and trucks should be adopted, and report back to Congress no later than June 1, 1997
[section 202(i) (1), (2)]. Based on the study EPA must conduct a rulemaking to determine whether there is a need for
such further reductions, whether the technology will be available for such reductions, and whether further reductions
in emissions from such vehicles will be cost effective. If these determinations are made in the affirmative, then
EPA would proceed to promulgate emissions standards that are more stringent than the Tier 1 standards [section 202(i)(3)(C)].
If EPA does promulgate more stringent standards, they may not take effect any earlier than model year 2004, and no later
than model year 2006. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is clear from this that EPA has not, at this time, completed the lengthy process for determining whether or not more
stringent standards should be established for light-duty vehicles and trucks under section 202(i). Congress established
a detailed provision spelling out the procedures to follow and the substantive determinations that must be made before
such controls could be adopted. There is no indication, and EPA does not believe, that these mandated procedures and
criteria preclude the exercise of discretion under section 211(c)(1)(A) prior to completion of the rulemaking under
section 202(i). Congress required that EPA consider motor vehicle controls, but did not establish a mandatory preference
for such controls and did not preclude the adoption of fuel controls prior to a decision on Tier 2 motor vehicle standards.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In any case, it is clear that a decision to impose more stringent NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standards for light-duty vehicles and trucks under section 202(i) could not take effect prior to model year 2004.
It would then take several years before a significant portion of the in-use fleet would include vehicles or trucks
certified to a NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standard more stringent than the Tier 1 standard. A similar situation would apply to a more stringent NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standard for heavy-duty engines. The mandatory leadtime and stability provision of section 202(a)(3)(C) would
preclude imposition of more stringent NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standards for heavy-duty engines until model year 2001 at the earliest. It would again take several years before a
significant portion of the in-use heavy-duty fleet contained engines certified to a more stringent NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standard. For non-road engines and vehicles, EPA expects to continue to explore NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 controls. But as with motor vehicles, any new or more stringent NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standards will only apply to new non-road engines, after providing a reasonable period for leadtime. The effect on
in-use emissions is delayed based on the time needed before new non-road engines replace earlier models. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given these circumstances, there are several important reasons why promulgation of a NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction standard for reformulated gasoline is important, whether or not additional vehicle or engine controls
are later adopted by the Agency. First, emissions reductions from the NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 performance standard would start as soon as the standard is applicable, with no delay based on fleet turnover time.
Significant NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emission reductions would be achieved right away, in the summer of 2000, while more stringent light-duty or heavy-duty
standards would not be expected to significantly affect in-use emissions until much later in that decade. Second,
a NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction standard for reformulated gasoline would act to reduce emissions from all mobile sources that use gasoline,
whether on-road or off-road, while section 202 or section 213 standards only act to limit emissions from new engines
or vehicles in that specific category of mobile sources. Third, this fuel control is specifically aimed at areas of
the country that are in nonattainment for ozone, and is limited in time to that part of the year when ozone is of most concern.
Vehicle or engine controls, in contrast, apply to all new engines or vehicles, wherever they are used, throughout
the year. This fuel control thus allows a more narrow regulatory solution aimed at the specific geographical areas
and time periods when control is needed. Fourth, the expected increase in vehicle miles travelled over time leads
EPA to believe that this fuel control is needed to continue to achieve the in-use NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emission reductions necessary for many areas of the country to reach attainment for ozone. Finally, the NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 fuel standard adopted here minimizes any concern there might be that a fuel control would tend to interfere in the production
process by directing refiners on how to make their product. The NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standard is not a fuel recipe, but instead establishes a performance standard, leaving refiners free to produce their
gasoline in any way that achieves the desired reductions.

To reduce the cost to the industry of complying with the Phase I and Phase II RFG standards, EPA had proposed granting
refiners the option of meeting the VOC and the air toxics emission standards on an averaging basis rather than requiring
compliance on a per gallon basis. However, the NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

the costs are derived based on regional refinery models). Hence, EPA has elected to allow both a per gallon and an averaging
standard for NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is set 1.3 percentage points more stringent than the per gallon standard (slightly smaller than the increment for
VOC and air toxics). A minimum per gallon standard (under averaging) will be set at 4 percentage points below the averaging
standard, following the precedent set with the VOC standard for Phase I RFG.

 reduction standards for gasoline sold in areas participating in the RFG program beginning in the year 2000. (The toxics
standard is discussed below in subsection 4.) The standards are shown in Table VI&hyph;3 below. The combination of
fuel parameters on which the standards are based is just one of many fuel formulations which could be used to achieve
the standards. From EPA's analysis of cost-effectiveness, however, it is clear that RVP control and sulfur control
are expected to be the basic fuel parameter changes that refiners will rely on to comply with these standards. At the
same time, it must be stressed that today's standards are performance standards which may be met by the refiner's choice
of fuel parameter controls; EPA is not establishing specifications for fuel composition. Specific issues concerning
these final standards are discussed in the following sections.

 standard, there may be greater flexibility to further control RVP for the purposes of VOC control. As shown in Table
VI&hyph;1, for the purposes of VOC control RVP to 6.5 and sulfur to 250 ppm would achieve a reduction of 27.2% in VOC control
region 2, at an incremental cost-effectiveness of $3,700/ton VOC (or less than $600/ton incremental to the Phase
I reductions). This is nearly the same level of reduction achieved with RVP at 6.7 psi and sulfur reductions to 138 ppm

 standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Various comments questioned basing the VOC standard on a gasoline RVP of 6.5 psi, due to potential driveability problems
with fuels at lower RVPs (which refiners will produce on occasion to meet the average standard). Commenters were concerned
that the VOC standard would reduce the flexibility available to refiners by essentially requiring all RFG to have
an RVP of 6.5 psi. As discussed previously, EPA currently believes that 6.5 psi RVP is a practical limit in the reduction
of gasoline volatility, due to the lack of information at the present time to ascertain whether or not driveability
problems exist below that level. In the absence of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control, EPA believes that adequate flexibility would still exist for refiners to meet a VOC performance standard
based on the control of RVP down to 6.5 psi, since some flexibility still exists in adjusting sulfur and olefin levels.
However, in the context of a NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A fuel meeting the combined requirements of 6.5 psi RVP and 138 ppm sulfur would achieve a VOC reduction of 28.4% (in
VOC control region 2) and a NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction of 6.9%. Standards based on this fuel formulation could severely restrict the flexibility for some refiners,
and pose an undue burden on others. For example, refiners with various parameter levels above the statutory baseline
would need additional VOC control to offset the VOC impact of these parameters. Under the above scenario, these refiners
would be limited in achieving further RVP control, since the ability to further reduce RVP and sulfur and/or increase
olefins would be limited. This would significantly increase the cost-effectiveness of the VOC control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon consideration of these concerns, among other issues, EPA decided to set a VOC standard derived based on a fuel
RVP of 6.7 psi to allow refiners some flexibility to meet the performance-based VOC standard through control of RVP
without the need to go below 6.5 psi. By setting a concurrent NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standard based largely on additional sulfur control, which also achieves some small additional VOC reductions,
refiners will not need to go as low as 6.5 psi to meet the equivalent level of VOC control. The cost-effectiveness of
a 6.8% (on average) NO

 The overall cost of the Phase II reformulated gasoline VOC standards and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standards for Phase II RFG is approximately 1.2 cents per gallon (incremental to Phase I RFG). This value appears to
be reasonable, as the less stringent Phase I reformulated gasoline cost is estimated to be about 3&hyph;5 cents per
gallon, as discussed in section V. EPA does not expect non-production related costs, such as distribution costs,
recordkeeping and reporting costs, etc., to increase relative to Phase I reformulated gasoline. A complete discussion
of the development of these costs is found in the RIA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of today's standards, VOC emissions will be reduced by about 10,000 tons in VOC control region 1 (southern)
areas each summer and 32,000 tons in VOC control region 2 (northern) areas. In addition, southern areas will experience
a reduction of about 8,300 tons NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The emissions reductions experienced in southern areas are smaller than experienced in northern areas due to the
fact that southern areas are already required to use fuels with lower Reid vapor pressures, and thus the emissions
reduction benefits of RFG use in these areas is smaller.

Compliance margin consideration.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters expressed a desire for looser standards to account for compliance margins. The optional provision
for averaging standards allows refiners to meet the standards in the manner which is most cost-effective for their
refinery in exchange for meeting a standard that is considered at least or more stringent as the per gallon standard
plus a compliance margin. The VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction standards have both been based in part on a cost-effectiveness analysis that implicitly is based on an averaging
standard. In that case, a compliance margin becomes much less relevant, if at all, because of the flexibility introduced
through averaging.

production of another type of reformulated gasoline in one or more grades. Distribution problems and complications
already expected with implementation of the reformulated gasoline requirements could increase. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters opposed this option, citing added costs and complications to the distribution system which would
likely result. No commenters appeared to be strongly in favor of it. Hence, the Agency has chosen not to allow local

$5,000/ton would get somewhat greater NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reductions and some additional VOC reductions in southern areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has set the VOC standard based on a level of reduction that would allow flexibility to refiners and would not be too
economically burdensome. Since a NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standard is being set concurrently, EPA set the VOC standard based on a slightly more relaxed RVP than might have been
used if only a VOC standard were implemented, as discussed above in subsection a. One comment on the proposal strongly
opposed lessening the maximum achievable level of VOC reduction to achieve NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reductions. As discussed above, however, roughly the same level of VOC reduction is being achieved with both a NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standard and a VOC standard (basing the standard on a fuel with 138 ppm sulfur and an RVP of 6.7 psi) as would be achieved
if only VOC control were required (basing the standard on a fuel RVP of 6.5 psi and a sulfur level of 250 ppm). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final option proposed by EPA was to set a combined VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standard and allow refiners flexibility in controlling emissions of either. As discussed in subsection C.2 above,
EPA believes it is important to achieve both VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control. VOC control alone would not provide significant ozone reduction benefits in all areas using RFG. The option
of allowing refiners to meet a combined VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control. Refiners would have had a strong incentive to augment the complex model through vehicle testing and push
RVP well below the 6.5 psi level in order to avoid sulfur control (for NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reductions), since RVP control is much less costly. As mentioned previously, EPA has significant concerns about
driveability problems with fuels with RVPs lower than 6.5 psi. Since refiners would be limited in their ability to
cost effectively achieve the combined standards, the reductions achieved through this type of program would be in
question. Hence, EPA has decided not to implement a combined VOC and NO

4. Toxics Standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statute sets the minimum Phase II standard for toxics reduction at 25%, although EPA has the authority to reduce
this to no lower than 20% ``based on technological feasibility, considering cost.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
38
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA proposed both levels of reductions as options for the toxics standard. EPA has looked at the technology required
to attain a 25% toxics standard, and the cost of implementing that technology. EPA expects that the technology implemented
by refiners to comply with the required VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reductions will result on average in a 26% reduction in annual toxics at reasonable costs, as discussed earlier. For
certain refiners with higher baseline levels of various parameters, however, EPA expects that compliance with the
VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standards will not automatically lead to compliance with a 25% toxics standard. For these refiners, additional toxics
control will typically require further benzene reduction or aromatics reduction (if octane can be maintained).
Benzene reductions would impact only emissions of benzene, not 1,3-butadiene, which has been shown to be of greater
cancer-causing risk to the public than the other air toxics.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
39
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (The statutory requirements of section 211(k) requires a focus on reductions in mass emissions of air toxics, not
on a reduction in cancer risk, and therefore does not permit EPA to set the standard based on cancer risk.) Implementation
of the benzene and/or aromatics reduction technology will be expensive and will raise their costs of production,
putting refiners facing this situation at a competitive disadvantage to those refiners who comply with the toxics
standard ``for free'' based on their compliance with the VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standards. In addition, a requirement of additional toxics reductions may also limit refiners' flexibility in producing
reformulated gasoline.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has considered two additional factors in considering the feasibility of requiring this subset of refiners to
pay the costs of implementing additional toxics control technology in order to meet a 25% standard. First, even if
the toxics standard is reduced to 20%, EPA believes that the average toxics reduction across all refiners will still
be above 25% based upon the fuel changes used to comply with the VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standards. Second, the additional toxics control required by this subset of refiners results in very high cost per
cancer incidence avoided. The main control strategies for toxics, benzene and aromatics reductions, are very expensive,
in excess of $100 million/CI. This is well beyond the $1&hyph;10 million/CI which the Agency believes to be achievable
through other programs. Even though a 25% toxics standard is technologically feasible, the unique circumstances
discussed above raise questions about the increased cost to this subset of refiners of implementing additional toxics
reduction technology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these concerns regarding the costs of implementing toxics control technology, EPA is setting the toxics
standard for Phase II RFG in both VOC control regions at 20%. There was general support in the comments received for
the fact that the cost-effectiveness of toxics control beyond a 20% reduction is questionable. No substantive comments
were received opposing the option of setting the standard at the minimum 20% reduction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on today's standards and the analysis summarized in the RIA, about 630 tons of toxics will be reduced in VOC control
region 2 each summer and 370 tons of toxics in VOC control region 1. Emissions of all toxics except formaldehyde will
be reduced. As a result of these emissions reductions, approximately 3&hyph;4 cancer incidences will be avoided
annually nationwide (incremental to Phase I). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VII. Enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 211(k) of the Clean Air Act requires, beginning January 1, 1995, that the gasoline sold or dispensed in certain
ozone nonattainment areas must be certified as reformulated. Gasoline that is not certified as reformulated is classified
as conventional gasoline and must be sold outside these nonattainment areas. Under the enforcement scheme promulgated
today, refiners and importers will be required to designate all gasoline as either reformulated or conventional.
Gasoline designated as reformulated must meet the standards for reformulated gasoline, and conventional gasoline
must meet the anti-dumping standards for conventional gasoline. In addition, refiners and importers will be required
to prepare product transfer documents for all gasoline produced or imported, that identify the gasoline as reformulated
or conventional and specify restrictions as to the time and place where the gasoline may be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Parties downstream of refiners and importers that transport, store, or dispense gasoline are responsible for ensuring
that only reformulated gasoline is used in reformulated gasoline covered areas, and that reformulated gasoline
is used at a time and place consistent with the time and place of use restrictions recited in the product transfer documents.
In addition, downstream parties are responsible for ensuring that reformulated gasoline does not violate the per-gallon
minimum and maximum standards, discussed more fully below.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During calendar years 1995 through 1997, refiners and importers may certify reformulated gasoline pursuant to either
the Phase I simple model standards, or the Phase I complex model (early use) standards. This election must be made separately
for each refinery on a calendar year basis. During calendar years 1998 and 1999, all reformulated gasoline must meet
the Phase I complex model standards, and beginning in 2000, all reformulated gasoline must meet the Phase II complex
model standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule establishes reformulated gasoline standards for oxygen, benzene, toxics emissions performance,
and heavy metals under all models. Standards for RVP, sulfur, T&hyph;90, and olefins are included only under the simple
model, and standards for VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions performance are included only under the Phase I and II complex models. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A refiner or importer electing early use of the complex model during 1995, 1996, or 1997 must determine individual
refinery or importer performance standards for VOC, toxics, and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. These standards are determined by evaluating the following slate of fuel parameter values in the Phase I complex
model: The simple model requirements, per section 80.41(a) or (b), for benzene, RVP and oxygen; the aromatics value
necessary to meet the simple model toxics standard using these values for benzene, RVP and oxygen; the refinery or
importer individual baseline values for E&hyph;300, sulfur, and olefins; and the statutory summertime or wintertime
baseline value for E&hyph;200. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The percent reductions in VOC, toxics, and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions determined using the above fuel in the Phase I complex model are the reformulated gasoline standards for
a refinery or importer electing early use of the complex model. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beginning in 1998, the Phase I reformulated gasoline VOC, toxics, and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standards for a refinery or importer are as specified in section 80.41 (c) and (d). As a result of the individual refinery
or importer baselines under complex model early use, gasoline that is produced under this option at any specific refinery
or imported by any specific importer, may not be fungibly mixed with gasoline that is produced at another refinery
or imported by another importer. This segregation of early use complex model gasolines, and other segregation requirements,
are discussed more fully below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Refiners and importers may elect to meet certain reformulated gasoline standards either on a per-gallon basis or
on average. This election, which must be made separately for each parameter and separately for each calendar year,
applies to all gasoline produced at a refinery by a refiner, or imported by an importer, during a calendar year. Refiners
and importers cannot meet the standard for any single parameter on a per-gallon basis for certain batches and on average
for other batches during any calendar year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A refiner or importer that opts for compliance on average must also meet requirements for gasoline quality surveys.
Standards that may be met on average are RVP, oxygen, and benzene, and VOC, toxics, and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the gasoline quality surveys is to ensure, for example, that RVP averaging by refiners or importers
does not result in a covered area receiving reformulated gasoline that, on average over the covered area, has a higher
RVP than would occur without such refiner or importer averaging. This applies for each parameter subject to refiner
or importer averaging. In the event a gasoline quality survey reveals that the gasoline being used in a covered area
does not meet the per-gallon standard for any regulated parameter, the per-gallon maximum or minimum standard for
that parameter is made more rigorous, and except in the case of oxygen the standard for average compliance is made more
rigorous. With certain limited exceptions, these adjusted standards apply to all gasoline produced at each refinery
that supplied the covered area with the failed survey during the year of the survey failure, or during any year the adjusted
standards apply. These gasoline quality survey requirements also apply to oxygenate blenders that meet the oxygen
standard on average. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule also includes other mechanisms to ensure that refiner or importer averaging will not result in a covered
area receiving reformulated gasoline that, on average, is less ``reformulated'' than would occur absent such refiner
or importer averaging. To meet this goal, EPA established standards for average compliance that are more rigorous
than the standards for per-gallon compliance, and established the per-gallon maximums and minimums that apply to
gasoline meeting the averaged standards. These maximums and minimums limit the range of averaging for the averaged
standards, and the more stringent averaged standards require refiners and importers to further reformulate their
gasoline to meet these standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Refiners and importers may meet the averaged standards for oxygen and benzene through the exchange of credits. Credits
are generated as a result of a refiner producing, or an importer importing, gasoline that on average exceeds the averaged
standards for oxygen or benzene over the averaging period. An oxygenate blender using the averaged oxygen standard
may generate, or use, oxygen credits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule specifies the manner in which credits must be used. Credits must be generated in the same averaging period
as they are used_credits may not be banked for use in a later averaging period; all credit transfers must occur within
fifteen days following the end of the averaging period in which they are generated; and only validly created credits
may be used to achieve compliance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule constrains the use of the averaged standard for oxygen, and the use of oxygen credits in certain circumstances.
Reformulated gasoline subject to simple model standards that is designated for use in the high ozone season_VOC-controlled
reformulated gasoline_must meet both the oxygen standard and the RVP standard separately during the VOC control
period (discussed more fully below). Simple model VOC-controlled gasoline may not be averaged with simple model
non-VOC-controlled gasoline to show compliance with the oxygen standard during the VOC control period. In addition,
reformulated gasoline designated for use in cities subject to the requirements of the oxygenated fuels program during
the oxygenated fuels program control period (or ``OPRG'' gasoline) may not be averaged together with gasoline not
designated for this use for purposes of meeting the oxygen standard on average.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
40
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As a result, only oxygen credits generated from VOC-controlled gasoline subject to simple model standards may be
used to meet the separate oxygen standard for VOC-controlled gasoline; and oxygen credits generated from OPRG gasoline
may only be used to meet the oxygen standard for OPRG gasoline. The mechanisms used to ensure correct accounting under
these oxygen averaging and credit constraints are discussed in a separate section below.

The final rule also includes provisions that regulate the manner in which oxygenates may be added downstream of the
refinery or import facility within the reformulated gasoline program. Oxygenate may only be added to specially formulated
reformulated gasoline blendstock intended for such downstream oxygenate blending (or ``RBOB''). If oxygenate
were added to reformulated gasoline not specially formulated, in most cases the resulting gasoline would not meet
the reformulated gasoline standards. Refiners and importers of RBOB are required to include in the RBOB product transfer
documents the type and amount, or range of types and amounts, of oxygenate that may be blended with each particular
RBOB. RBOB must be segregated from reformulated gasoline, and from other RBOB having different oxygenate requirements,
to the point of oxygenate blending. Distributors may only dispense RBOB to registered oxygenate blenders. Oxygenate
blenders may only blend the specified type and amount of oxygenate with any RBOB, and must meet the standard for oxygen
for all RBOB dispensed to them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Refiners and importers are required to meet the reformulated gasoline standards for RBOB for all parameters other
than oxygen, based on the properties of the reformulated gasoline that will be produced through blending the appropriate
type and amount of oxygenate with the RBOB. As a result, if the incorrect type and/or amount of oxygenate is blended
with the RBOB, the refiner or importer may fail to comply with the non-oxygen standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to ensure that the non-oxygen standards for RBOB are met, refiners and importers may transfer RBOB only to
oxygenate blenders with whom they have a first- or second-hand contractual relationship. This contract must include
procedures intended to ensure proper performance of oxygenate blending. In addition, the refiner or importer must
conduct a quality assurance program over the oxygenate blender's blending operation.

 and assumes that ethanol will be blended with ``any-oxygenate'' RBOB and MTBE will be blended with ``ether-only''

will be that amount necessary for the resulting reformulated gasoline to have an oxygen content of 2.00 weight percent,
or approximately 5.70 volume percent in the case of ethanol, and approximately 10.80 volume percent in the case of
MTBE. These oxygenate blending assumptions are discussed more fully below.

In order to ensure that gasoline produced or imported as reformulated in fact meets the reformulated gasoline standards,
refiners and importers are required to engage an independent laboratory to sample each batch of reformulated gasoline
produced or imported, and to analyze up to ten percent of the samples collected. EPA will direct the independent laboratories
as to which samples to analyze. Refiners producing gasoline using computer-controlled in-line blending may obtain
a waiver from EPA and have the in-line blending records audited in lieu of the independent sampling and testing requirements.
The independent sampling and testing requirement is discussed more fully below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the final rule, refiners, importers, and oxygenate blenders are required to keep specified records that relate
to the production or importation of gasoline, sampling and testing of gasoline, credit transfers, and compliance
calculations. All regulated parties are required to keep copies of product transfer documents, and records of any
quality assurance sampling and testing performed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Refiners, importers, and oxygenate blenders are required to submit reports to EPA that contain information necessary
to demonstrate that standards have been achieved either per-gallon or on average. The periods for reporting are calendar
quarters (January through March, April through June, July through September and October through December). The
quarterly reports are due on the last day of the second month following the end of the quarter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Quarterly reports consist of detailed information describing each batch of reformulated gasoline or RBOB produced
or imported. Additional reporting requirements apply for refiners, importers, and oxygenate blenders who produce
reformulated gasoline or RBOB which meets any of the applicable standards on average. RVP, VOC, and NO

 averaging reports are submitted with the third quarterly report of a given year and cover the high ozone season averaging
period. Oxygen, benzene and toxics averaging reports and credit transaction reports are submitted with the fourth
quarterly report and cover the annual averaging period. Credit transaction and averaging reports are not required
for reformulated gasoline or RBOB which meets all of the applicable standards on a per-gallon basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Refiners, oxygenate blenders, and importers are required to register with EPA by November 1, 1994 or no later than
three months in advance of the first date the party will produce or import reformulated gasoline, whichever is later.
Registration information identifies the refiner, blender, or importer and any facilities at which reformulated
gasoline or RBOB may be produced, and the independent laboratory that will be used to fulfill the independent analysis
requirements. EPA will supply a registration number to each refiner, importer, and oxygenate blender, and a facility
registration number for each refinery and oxygenate blending facility that is identified; these registration numbers
must be used in all reports to EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule includes a requirement that all refiners, importers, and oxygenate blenders must commission an annual
review of the information contained in the reports to EPA, or an ``attest engagement.'' Attest engagements must be
conducted either by a Certified Public Accountant, or by a Certified Internal Auditor, following procedures included
in the final rule. The attest procedures are intended to ensure that all gasoline produced or imported is included
in the reports for either reformulated gasoline or conventional gasoline; that product transfer documents are properly
prepared; that the requirements for downstream oxygenate blending are met; and that in the case of a refiner using
computer-controlled in-line blending, that the blend records support the reported properties of the gasoline produced.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All parties in the gasoline distribution system are required to segregate certain categories of reformulated gasoline
from other categories. These segregation requirements result primarily from the time and place of use restrictions
necessary for reformulated gasoline, and to a lesser extent are necessary for per-gallon minimums and maximums and
gasoline quality surveys in covered areas. In summary form, the segregation requirements are the following. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gasoline subject to simple model standards may not be fungibly mixed with gasoline subject to complex model standards.
In addition, gasoline produced at any refinery or imported by any importer that is subject to the complex model before
1998 must be segregated from complex model gasoline produced at any other refinery or imported by any other importer.
These two segregation requirements, which are limited to the period 1995 through 1997, are necessary in order for
per-gallon minimums and maximums and gasoline quality surveys to properly function. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only gasoline that is VOC-controlled may be used during the high ozone season, which requires the segregation of VOC-controlled
and non-VOC-controlled gasoline in advance of the high ozone season (other than to ``blend up'' storage tanks to the
VOC-controlled standards). Similarly, only gasoline designated for VOC Control Region 1 may be sold in that region,
which requires the segregation of VOC Control Region 1 gasoline from VOC Control Region 2 gasoline. In addition, VOC-controlled
gasoline produced with ethanol may not be mixed with VOC-controlled gasoline produced using any other oxygenate
during the period January 1 through September 15. These segregation requirements are necessary in order for VOC emission
reductions to be achieved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lastly, only gasoline designated as oxygenated fuels program reformulated gasoline (OPRG) may be sold in an oxygenated
fuels program area during the oxygenated fuels control period, which requires the segregation of OPRG gasoline from
non-OPRG gasoline in advance of any oxygenated fuels control period (other than to ``blend up'' storage tanks). This
segregation requirement is necessary so that the extra oxygenate used in oxygenated fuels program cities does not,
through averaging, result in non-oxygenate fuels program cities receiving less oxygen than is required under the
Clean Air Act.

The final rule establishes liability for a number of prohibited activities that may occur downstream of the refinery
or importer, including the following: The sale, dispensation, transportation, or storage of conventional gasoline
represented to be reformulated; the failure of reformulated gasoline to meet the minimum or maximum standards; and
the use of reformulated gasoline in a manner inconsistent with the time and place of use restrictions recited in the
product transfer documents. When such a violation is found, the following parties are presumed liable: The operator
of the facility at which the violating gasoline is found, and each upstream party, other than carriers, that supplied
any of the gasoline found to be in violation. In the case of a facility operating under the brand name of a refiner, that
refiner is also presumed liable regardless of whether the refiner supplied any of the gasoline found in violation.

The remainder of Section V of the preamble discusses major changes from the enforcement provisions that were proposed
in the supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking published at 58 FR 11722 (February 26, 1993). The following portion
of this section also responds to a number of significant public comments on the enforcement provisions contained
in the 1993 proposal. Responses to other significant comments EPA received are contained in a separate ``response
to comments'' document that has been placed in the docket for this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A. California Enforcement Exemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the February 26, 1993, notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), EPA proposed to exempt refiners, importers and blenders
of ``California gasoline'' from certain enforcement provisions in the proposed federal reformulated gasoline
regulations. The Agency generally proposed that ``California gasoline'' would mean gasoline subject to the State
of California's reformulated gasoline regulations that was either produced within the State or imported into the
State from outside the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed California enforcement exemptions were based on the Agency's comparison of the estimated emission
reduction benefits of California's Phase 2 reformulated gasoline program with those anticipated from the federal
phase I reformulated gasoline program, using the federal complex model proposed in the NPRM. The California Phase
2 program establishes standards for eight gasoline characteristics_sulfur, benzene, olefin, aromatic hydrocarbons,
oxygen, RVP, T50 and T90_applicable starting March 1, 1996. EPA's analysis indicated that California Phase 2 gasoline
will have a greater emission reduction benefit than federal reformulated gasoline. This analysis also indicated
that, in the case of VOC, toxic and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions performance, California Phase 2 gasoline has a greater emissions performance reduction than federal
phase I gasoline, compared to Clean Air Act base gasoline. EPA's review also indicated that the California oxygen
``flat limit'' of 1.8 to 2.2% will in practice be equivalent to the 2.0% minimum oxygen content required by the Act.
See 58 FR 11746&hyph;7 (February 26, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency proposed that, effective with the start of California's Phase 2 program, regulated parties would be exempt
from meeting the enforcement requirements dealing with compliance surveys (section 80.69), independent sampling
and testing (section 80.70(c)), designation of gasoline (section 80.70(d)), marking of conventional gasoline
(section 80.70(g)), downstream oxygenate blending (section 80.72), record keeping (section 80.74), reporting
(section 80.75), product transfer documents (section 80.77), and antidumping record keeping (section 80.105)
and reporting (section 80.106).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Between the January 1, 1995, start of the federal program and the March 1, 1996, start of the California Phase 2 program,
EPA proposed a more limited set of exemptions from federal enforcement requirements, specifically the compliance
survey and independent sampling and testing requirements (sections 80.69 and 80.70(c), respectively).

 The numbering of many provisions in the proposed regulations has been changed in the final rules. For example, proposed
&sect;80.69 is now &sect;80.68, proposed &sect;80.70(c) is now &sect;80.65(f), proposed &sect;80.70(d) is now
&sect;80.65(d), proposed &sect;80.70(g) is now &sect;80.65(g), and proposed &sect;80.72 is now &sect;80.69.
Cross-references in the final California enforcement exemption regulation have been revised to reflect these and
other numbering changes in the final reformulated gasoline regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency also proposed a number of restrictions on the applicability of the California enforcement exemptions.
First, the exemptions would not apply to gasoline sold in California and produced at a refinery located within the
United States but outside California. Similarly, the exemptions would not apply to gasoline produced in California
but sold outside that State. Second, the exemptions would not apply to gasoline produced under a two-year (March 1,
1996, through February 29, 1996) extension granted to small refiners under the California regulations. Third, the
exemptions would become null and void (i.e., they would not apply to any California regulated party) if any gasoline
formulation certified by the State using a predictive model or vehicle testing does not comply with the federal reformulated
gasoline standards. Fourth, the enforcement exemptions would cease to apply to a party granted a variance by California
unless EPA granted relief for extraordinary circumstances under section 80.73 of the federal regulations. Fifth,
a regulated party that is assessed a penalty for a violation of either the California or federal reformulated gasoline
requirements would lose its enforcement exemptions. (Such a party could petition the Agency for relief from this
result, for good cause.) Sixth, the California enforcement exemptions would apply only during the time that the federal
phase I program remains in effect (i.e., until the year 2000), subject to extension in a later rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The February 26, 1993, NPRM contains a more detailed discussion of the California reformulated gasoline program,
the Agency's comparison of the emission reduction benefits of the California and federal programs, and the proposed
California enforcement exemption provisions. That notice also includes a detailed rationale for the proposed exemptions
and restrictions. See 58 FR 11747&hyph;11750.

The Agency received several comments on the proposed California enforcement exemptions, all of which were generally
supportive of the regulation. Most of these comments also suggested various modifications and clarifications of
the proposed regulations. In this final rule the Agency is promulgating a revised version of the California enforcement
exemptions regulation, which includes many of the modifications recommended by commenters.

The Agency has re-analyzed the relative emission reduction benefits of the California Phase II reformulated gasoline
program and the federal Phase I program, using the complex model being promulgated today, and has again concluded
that the California program is at least as stringent as the federal program. The analysis also found that fuel meeting
the standards of the California Phase II program has a greater VOC, NO

The proposed exclusion from the enforcement exemptions of small refiners who are granted a two-year extension under
the California program has been dropped from the final rule. The Agency has determined that the emissions performance
of fuels meeting the California reformulated gasoline standards to which these refiners will be subject during the
two-year period, in conjunction with the statewide California sulfur standard, meets or exceeds the performance
required under the Phase I federal reformulated gasoline program, as measured by the complex model (which may be used
to determine compliance with federal standards during this period

The enforcement exemptions have been extended to California reformulated gasoline produced at refineries located
outside of California that produce only California reformulated gasoline and federal conventional gasoline (i.e.,
that do not produce federal reformulated gasoline). The primary rationale for excluding such gasoline, that its
producer would be required to implement all of the federal enforcement provisions for a refinery's non-California
reformulated gasoline, is not applicable to facilities that do not produce federal reformulated gasoline. In order
to assure that such gasoline is in fact shipped to, and sold in, California, section 80.81(g) of the final regulations
now prescribes transfer documentation and record keeping requirements for such gasoline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The compliance survey exemption is extended to all gasoline subject to the California reformulated gasoline regulations
(no matter where produced) and will not be lost by a party who otherwise loses its California enforcement exemptions
(e.g., a refiner who violates federal or state reformulated gasoline regulations or whose gasoline formulation
is found to be less stringent than the federal requirements). The purpose of compliance surveys is to ensure that each
area receiving reformulated gasoline receives gasoline that, on average, achieves the performance that would be
expected if per-gallon compliance was the only available compliance option. The Agency believes that there would
be little purpose served in imposing this requirement on only a small subset of the gasoline sold in California. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exemptions from the following enforcement provisions have been added in the final rule: the parameter value reconciliation
requirements in section 80.65(e)(2); the reformulated gasoline and RBOB compliance requirements in section 80.65(c);
the annual compliance audit requirements in section 80.65(h); and the compliance attest engagement requirements
in subpart F. The Agency believes that these exemptions are consistent with the rationale for the exemptions proposed
in the NPRM.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provision related to withdrawal of the enforcement exemptions on the basis of certification by California of
a gasoline formulation that does not meet the federal reformulated gasoline standards has been modified in several
ways. First and most importantly, the withdrawal will only apply to the refiner, importer or blender of the non-complying
formulation, not to all California gasoline. Second, any party whose gasoline is certified under either the predictive
model or vehicle testing provisions of the California regulations will be required to notify the Agency within 30
days of such a certification and to submit a written demonstration that the gasoline formulation is in compliance
with federal standards. If such a demonstration is not timely submitted, the exemptions are automatically (and immediately)
lost. If a submitted demonstration is determined to be incorrect by the Agency, EPA will notify the party (by first-class
mail)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
45
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that its enforcement exemptions will expire on a certain date. Third, the date on which these exemptions will expire
has been extended to no earlier than 90 days from the date of the EPA notice, to provide additional time for compliance.
The Agency believes that this additional time is needed to comply with all of the many enforcement requirements that
will become applicable if a California exemption is lost. In particular, requirements such as the independent analysis
requirements (section 80.65(f)) and the compliance attest engagement requirements (subpart F) may require the
negotiation of contracts with third parties.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 Because the loss of the enforcement exemption will apply to only a single party (rather than to all producers and importers
of California gasoline), the Agency does not believe that there is a need for a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The effective date for the withdrawal of the enforcement exemptions on the basis of a reformulated gasoline penalty
assessment has been extended to 90 days, and this provision has been revised to make clear that this grace period does
not begin until any interim administrative appeal has been completed. Once a final penalty assessment has been made
by an agency or a district court, the 90-day period will begin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provision related to compliance with standards on average for an averaging period that is partly before and partly
after March 1, 1996, has been clarified. Under the final rule, producers and importers who elect to demonstrate compliance
on average with any federal reformulated gasoline standard
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
46
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 will be required to demonstrate such compliance for two overlapping averaging periods: January 1, 1995, through
December 31, 1995; and March 1, 1995, through February 29, 1996. The proposal could have been interpreted to require
compliance with these standards for a two-month averaging period in early 1996, which would be very difficult for
refiners to meet on average and which was not intended by the Agency.

 In the case of refiners and importers using the simple model, the standards that may be met on average are the RVP, benzene,
oxygen, and toxics emissions performance standards. For parties using the complex model, the standards that may
be met on average are the benzene, oxygen, and toxics and VOC emissions performance standards.

The provision intended to prohibit the averaging of ``very clean'' California reformulated gasoline with ``less
clean'' federal reformulated gasoline has been clarified in the final rule. In addition, it has been made applicable
to producers and importers of all gasoline subject to the California program, not just to refiners and importers located
outside the State (as was proposed). Section 80.81(d) now provides that producers and importers of such gasoline
must exclude the volume and properties of California reformulated gasoline from all conventional gasoline and federal
reformulated gasoline sold elsewhere, for purposes of demonstrating compliance with standards specified in section
80.41 and 80.90. An overall demonstration of compliance for all gasoline (California and non-California) produced
or imported is also still required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exemption from the federal recordkeeping requirements has been modified to require the retention for five years
of records mandated by section 2270 of the California reformulated gasoline regulations (which require retention
for two years). This requirement, along with other enforcement provisions for which an exemption is not being provided,
will provide the Agency with the capability of performing audits of compliance with federal requirements by parties
who produce California reformulated gasoline.

As noted above, more detailed information on the modifications made to the proposed rule and the comments on which
they are based is contained in the separate ``Responses to Comments'' document. That document also responds to comments

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule, in section 80.46, sets forth test methods regarding reformulated gasoline parameters. EPA has carefully
considered all comments concerning proposed test methods and related issues and many of those comments have been
incorporated in the final rule. The test methods are those that provide for the best balance of accuracy, cost effectiveness
and ease of use for competent lab technicians. The final rule generally provides for one regulatory method for each
parameter in order to assure accuracy and to avoid problems with biases between different methods. However, in two
cases (regarding oxygen and aromatics) the regulation provides for an alternative method for industry to use, if
desired, until January 1, 1997, to provide lead time to acquire equipment necessary for the primary test method and
to become familiar with its use. Where American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) methods have been adopted,
any future updated version of the ASTM methods will not automatically be adopted. EPA will use appropriate procedures
if it desires to adopt any updated methods.

1. Test Methodology Overview 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA proposed test methods for the measurement of each of the parameters required in the creation of reformulated gasoline,
and received numerous comments regarding the proposed methods. Most of the comments were quite similar in their overall
character. However, one commenter seemed to summarize the prevailing recommendations quite well. API stated in
part: ``API recommends that EPA observe the following guiding principles regarding laboratory test methods: (1)

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Test methods must be proven
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;. (2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Test methods must be reliable
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;. (3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Test procedures must be suitable for refinery personnel
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;. (4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Test methods must not be unnecessarily costly
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;. (5) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Test method reproducibility must be recognized
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;. (6) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Criteria for adoption of other methods should be developed
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA agrees with most of these criteria. It would be ideal to discover accurate test methods that have been proven reliable
in the industry, that are easy for personnel to operate and have a minimal cost. The new test method for Reid Vapor Pressure
(RVP) set forth in the volatility regulations (40 CFR part 80, appendix E, Method 3) is an example of such a method that
is accurate, easy to operate and is relatively inexpensive. These qualities in the RVP test method have enabled many
downstream parties to incorporate this method into their oversight program under the volatility rule. EPA believes
this improved oversight contributed significantly to the reduction in volatility violations during the 1993 high
ozone season. Ease of operation and cost were considered when EPA adopted this test method. However, it must be recognized
that the most important factors in the choice of the new RVP test method were its accuracy and precision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA would like to prescribe test methods that conform to API's criteria. However, EPA's leading priority must remain
precision and accuracy, even at the expense of other criteria. EPA is always willing to cooperate with industry to
investigate the possibility of easier and less expensive methods if the methods also are accurate and precise. To
do so not only aids industry, but also ultimately assists EPA's purpose of preventing violations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA must follow its policy in maintaining precision and accuracy with regard to any enforcement test tolerances as
well. EPA is determined to achieve the most accurate and precise result that is practical. EPA's purpose in testing
is to ensure relevant standards are being met, and to allow an enforcement action where EPA is able to establish a violation
with reasonable certainty. However, EPA does not have sufficient data at this time from the EPA laboratory to determine
the most precise test tolerances. Interim test tolerances have been established until that data becomes available.
Enforcement test tolerances are discussed more fully below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most commenters requested that EPA allow more than one test method for each parameter. The final rule provides for
one regulatory method for each parameter in order to assure accuracy and to avoid problems of bias between different
methods. Refiners and importers must use the regulatory method, or an alternative method in the case of two parameters
during a limited time period, when testing to meet the mandatory testing requirements of section 80.65(e). In addition,
independent laboratories, when conducting tests to verify the accuracy of the refiner and importer testing, must
use the regulatory method. EPA has learned from its experience with other motor vehicle fuel regulatory programs,
notably volatility, that it is preferable to have one regulatory testing method as opposed to multiple regulatory
test methods for each parameter because of the potential for conflicting results among methods due to bias. However,
in two cases, oxygen and aromatics, where the test methods are relatively new, the regulation provides for optional
alternative methods for refiners and importers to use to meet the testing requirements of section 80.65(e) until
January 1, 1997, providing lead-time for industry to acquire equipment and to become familiar with use of the regulatory
methods. Of course, these alternative methods can likewise be used at any time for defense purposes as long as there
is correlation with the regulatory methods.

EPA proposed to use the ASTM method ES&hyph;15 or the procedure described in 40 CFR part 80, appendices D and E. Comments
favored the use of ASTM ES&hyph;15. However, it was noted that ES&hyph;15 is a temporary emergency ASTM standard and
will expire shortly. ASTM D&hyph;5191 is the permanent standard. It was also noted that this method is suitable for
oxygenated blends. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters requested that EPA also allow the two dry methods set forth in appendices D and E in 40 CFR part 80. These methods
are the manual tank and gauge method, the Herzog analog method, and the Herzog digital method. In addition, a request
was made to include the ASTM D&hyph;5190 method, an alternative mini method. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has decided that RVP must be determined in accordance with the method in 40 CFR part 80, appendix E, Method 3. This
method, very similar to ASTM D&hyph;5191, clearly complies with many of the criteria espoused by API. The method is
simple and inexpensive. Industry has already begun to gear up for this method because of its use in the Phase II Volatility
regulations. It is appropriate to use the same RVP test method for the volatility and reformulated gasoline programs
to prevent confusion and inconsistencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has decided that the method in 40 CFR part 80, appendix E, Method 3 will be the only regulatory volatility test method.
As with the volatility rule, other methods may be used for defense purposes as long as the method used is properly correlated
with the regulatory method. (40 CFR part 80, appendix E, Method 3, Paragraph 9.4). See, 58 FR 14476 (March 17, 1993)
for a more thorough discussion regarding the choice of a single volatility test method.

EPA proposed to use the ASTM method D&hyph;86&hyph;82 as the regulatory test method, and comments were favorable
with regard to this method. It was noted, however, that the method was updated in November 1990. This most recent revision
of this method is ASTM D&hyph;86&hyph;90. One commenter requested that the language be more specific. Another commenter
suggested that a newer method, D&hyph;3710, which is a gas chromatography method, be used. A notation was also made
that the repeatability and reproducibility figures in degrees Fahrenheit in the ASTM method D&hyph;86&hyph;90
were incorrect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has decided that the distillation parameters must be determined in accordance with the ASTM method D&hyph;86&hyph;90.
The regulatory language has been amended to state that the figures for repeatability and reproducibility given in
degrees Fahrenheit in Table 9 in the ASTM method are incorrect, and may not be used. As with all the parameters, there
will be only one regulatory distillation test method. However, other suitable methods may be used for defense purposes
(but not to meet mandatory testing requirements) as long as they are properly correlated with the regulatory test
method. EPA is always interested in the development of alternative methods if they are as accurate and precise as the
regulatory test method. Many of the parameters in reformulated gasoline can be measured by a gas chromatograph with
an appropriate detector. For this reason, it might be appropriate to explore the development of the D&hyph;3710 method
or some alternative gas chromatographic method with an appropriate detector for future use as the distillation test
method.

Benzene. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA proposed to use ASTM method D&hyph;3606 for the regulatory test method, and most commenters were in agreement
with the use of this method. However, commenters noted that other acceptable gas chromatographic methods exist for
the determination of benzene such as D&hyph;4815 (a gasoline oxygenate method) and D&hyph;4420 (an aromatics method).
Comments were made that D&hyph;3606 requires a dedicated chromatograph for benzene in gasoline only. It was also
noted that the D&hyph;3606 results may be affected by interference from the presence of ethanol and methanol. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has decided that the single regulatory method for measuring concentration of benzene will be ASTM method D&hyph;3606&hyph;92.
Due to the possibility of a slight interference from ethanol and methanol in the test results, the method has been amended
by the regulation to require that the instrument parameters be adjusted to ensure complete resolution of the benzene,
ethanol and methanol peaks. As with all reformulated gasoline parameters, EPA has chosen one regulatory test method.
However, it should be noted that the presence of benzene can be tested also by the GC&hyph;MS, the regulatory method
for aromatics testing. With the GC&hyph;MS, there should not be a problem with the presence of oxygenates and a dedicated
chromatograph is not needed. EPA is interested in the possibility of participating with industry in the development
of the GC&hyph;MS method for benzene.

Aromatics. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA proposed to use the Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometry (GC&hyph;MS) method, developed by EPA, for total aromatics
determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most commenters opposed the method proposed by EPA. One commenter recommended delaying selection of a lab test method
until the procedure can be evaluated and completely developed. Commenters also criticized the method for its cost,
the amount of time the method demands, and because industry feels that the method will require highly specialized
staff. One commenter stated that the proposed method was so incomplete that it was not possible to provide detailed
technical comments on it. Most commenters suggested that EPA adopt ASTM method D&hyph;1319, a fluorescent indicator
absorption method. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has decided to adopt the proposed method, the GC&hyph;MS, as the single regulatory method for the determination
of total aromatics. However, because the method is relatively new, leaving industry little time to scrutinize the
method, the final regulations allow use of ASTM method D&hyph;1319&hyph;93 until January 1, 1997 for purposes of
meeting the industry testing requirements under section 80.65(e), provided this method is correlated with the GC&hyph;MS
method. This two year transition period should allow sufficient time for industry to purchase equipment and become
familiar with the new method. In addition, during this time period, it is anticipated that EPA and industry can discuss
any problems that might arise as a result of the new method being promulgated. Moreover, the GC&hyph;MS method has
been rewritten to provide more detail and specificity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is aware that industry is uncomfortable with a newly developed method that has not had the usual round-robin testing
or extensive participation by ASTM. However, EPA believes that the method available, D&hyph;1319, is so archaic
when compared with present day technology, and has such extremely poor accuracy and precision, that it is necessary
to develop a new method. Furthermore, D&hyph;1319 has not been proven effective with oxygenated fuels even though
the updated version does include a multiplication factor to use when oxygenates are present. EPA also believes that
it does not have the choice of leaving the method open until the GC&hyph;MS could be evaluated more thoroughly given
the timing of the final rule. EPA believes the GC&hyph;MS is a dependable, accurate and precise method that, with the
aid of industry, can be applied in the near future to many of the other reformulated gasoline parameters. The eventual
use for several parameters should somewhat offset the initial cost. EPA also believes, based on personal experience,
that the GC&hyph;MS apparatus is readily usable by competent lab technicians with about one week of training. It is
less personnel-intensive and more accurate than the D&hyph;1319 method.

Oxygen and Oxygenates.

EPA proposed to use the GC-Oxygenate Flame Ionization Detector (OFID) method for determining oxygen content. Many
commenters objected to the OFID method due to the fact that ASTM is still reviewing it through round-robin testing
and precision information is not presently known. Commenters were concerned with the laboratory time required and
the high deterioration and replacement rate cost of the cracker reactor. Commenters were also concerned with possible
increased down-time in the laboratory. Most commenters suggested that ASTM method D&hyph;4815, a method used by
industry during the winter oxygenate season, be used for testing oxygenates. Some commenters also suggested the
use of portable Infrared (IR) analyzers because of their low cost and rapid results.

EPA has chosen to use the GC&hyph;OFID method as the single regulatory method for measuring oxygen content and oxygenates.
As with the aromatics determination, EPA felt compelled to develop a new method given the shortcomings of the methods
presently available. However, the ASTM method D&hyph;4815&hyph;93 can be used for the compounds specified in the
method until January 1, 1997 to meet industry testing requirements under section 80.65(e). ASTM method D&hyph;4815
has been used for quite some time, but with the addition of heavier oxygenates, 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
D&hyph;4815 has become increasingly difficult to use. EPA is aware that there has been an attempt to expand the scope
and range of D&hyph;4815 to include heavier oxygenates (as set forth in D&hyph;4815&hyph;93). However, the longer
one has to wait to extract the heavier oxygenates, the more likely it is that hydrocarbons will be drawn out with the
oxygenates, interfering with the test results. In addition, EPA is not satisfied with the accuracy of D&hyph;4815.
The reproducibility and repeatability factors are quite large. Presently, OFID is the only accurate method known
that is capable of testing for oxygenates at all ranges. EPA believes a reliable, accurate and precise method that
is capable of testing for oxygenates at all ranges is required when the reformulated gasoline requirements go into
effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has been using GC&hyph;OFID for four years. During that period, the cracker reactor has required replacement
on only one occasion. EPA has had the opportunity to use various portable IR methods for field screening tests and has
been pleased with the results. However, although these are excellent screening devices, they are not presently at
the stage of development that would allow their use as a regulatory enforcement method.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA proposed to use an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP&hyph;AES) method for sulfur
analysis that was developed at EPA's laboratory. Most commenters were opposed to this method because it is an unproven
technology, because it is very expensive, and because there are no substantial benefits received from this technology
that are not also available through existing methods. It was also thought not to be practical in a refinery environment.
Commenters suggested the use of ASTM D&hyph;4045, ASTM D&hyph;2622, or ASTM D&hyph;4294. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering the comments, EPA has chosen ASTM D&hyph;2622&hyph;92, an x-ray spectrometry method, as the regulatory
sulfur test method. This is a newer version of the same test method that is used for testing sulfur in the low sulfur diesel
fuel program. Industry should already be on-line with this method since the diesel program went into effect on October
1, 1993. The newer version has correction factors to adjust for the interference from oxygenated product.

of this method since there are no other standard methods for olefins from which to choose at this time. Most commenters
pointed out that the method is not as accurate as it should be. Comments were made that the method was updated in 1989
(D&hyph;1319&hyph;89). Comments were made that the method would not detect any oxygenates present, but that the
results can be normalized to determine the amount of oxygen present using multiplications factors.

EPA has chosen the ASTM method 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
D&hyph;1319&hyph;93, Fluorescent Indicator Absorption method (FIA) as the single regulatory method to determine
olefin content. EPA has chosen this method because there are no alternative methods available. EPA believes that
an accuracy greater than is possible with the D&hyph;1319 method is desirable and looks forward to working with industry
to develop a suitable GC&hyph;MS method to detect olefins in the near future. The newest version, ASTM D&hyph;1319&hyph;93,
was chosen because it contains multiplication factors to determine the amount of oxygen present.

3. Enforcement Test Tolerances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has chosen to set forth enforcement test tolerances in the preamble of this regulation for oxygen, benzene, and
RVP, the three parameters that will be subject to enforcement testing for minimum and/or maximum levels under the
simple model. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters suggested that EPA should set enforcement test tolerances for all seven parameters. One commenter stated
the belief that EPA is required by the Clean Air Act to set enforcement test tolerances. Many commenters requested
enforcement leniency downstream so that pipelines, while attempting to stay in compliance, do not force refiners
to produce reformulated gasoline at even lower specifications than the regulations require.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Issues Regarding Whether Enforcement Test Tolerances Are Required.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 There are three specific provisions in the section 211(k) that refer to establishing test tolerances. The first,
section 211(k)(3)(A), establishes a formula fuel as the statutory minimum for VOC and toxic emissions reductions,
if the formula fuel is more stringent than the performance standards found in section 211(k)(3)(B). The formula includes
a minimum oxygen content of 2.0 wt. % ``subject to a testing tolerance established by the Administrator.'' This provision
is inapplicable, however, as EPA has determined that the performance standards in section 211(k)(3)(B) are more
stringent than the formula fuel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, section 211(k)(4)(C) of the Act requires that EPA establish ``appropriate measures of, and methodology
for, ascertaining the emissions of air pollutants (including calculations, equipment, and testing tolerances).''
This provision addresses technical issues regarding measurement or determination of emissions of various air pollutants,
and does not require that EPA establish enforcement test tolerances. Congress most likely expected that individual
vehicle testing by refiners, importers, and EPA would be the basis for quantifying the emissions reductions from
reformulated gasolines, with certification of reformulated gasoline based on such individual test programs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
47
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In using a large data base from several vehicle test programs EPA has exercised the authority provided under this provision,
and has established emissions models that are much more accurate and reliable predictors of emissions performance
than individual vehicle test programs. Variability in test results was accounted for in the modeling process itself,
so that the models include a ``test tolerance'' based on averaging of test results from the vehicle test programs underlying
the emissions models. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
While Congress apparently expected that EPA would in all likelihood establish a vehicle testing program to measure
emissions and certify reformulated gasoline, EPA has instead adopted an emission model that is built on many different
test programs. To the extent ``calculations, equipment, and testing tolerances'' is still relevant in this context,
it is taken to address testing needed to use the model, such as testing of a gasoline to obtain data for input into the
model. The test procedures adopted by EPA typically include provisions designed to address test variability. In
addition EPA's regulations specify test tolerances for various parameters, such as when a refiner and an outside
laboratory measure the fuels parameters, and specify the acceptable range for such parameters in using the model.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has established appropriate test procedures for use with the model, but they measure not air pollution emissions
but fuel parameter values needed to operate the model. 40 CFR 80.46. EPA has, however, established test tolerances
to determine when fuel parameter values are acceptable for use in the model, as well as limits on the range of the parameters
for the model. Where a refiner or importer seeks to augment the emissions model through a vehicle test program, EPA's
regulations also include provisions on testing and calculations, and account for test tolerances through the averaging
of vehicle test results. EPA believes these fully implement any requirement to establish test tolerances in a context
where an emissions model is the methodology to determine air pollutant emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters point to language of various legislators made during the floor debate on the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990. In the floor debate, various Congressmen made general statements on the issue of whether EPA must provide
enforcement tolerances under section 211(k)(4)(C).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
48
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 There is no clear indication in these statements that Congress intended in section 211(k)(4)(C) to mandate changes
in the numerical standards adopted by EPA, or to mandate a regulatory exercise of enforcement discretion. Instead
these floor debate statements are most reasonably read as indicating that EPA should establish reasonable testing
tolerances in the procedures and methodologies adopted to quantify air pollutants for the reformulated gasoline
and anti-dumping programs, so that the regulated community and EPA can measure these air pollutants in a workable,
verifiable manner without undue cost. EPA believes that its regulations fully implement this objective. To the extent
these statements during the floor debate are read to imply that ``testing tolerances'' should be interpreted the
same for purposes of section 211(k)(2)(B) and 211(k)(4)(C), EPA respectfully rejects this interpretation as contrary
to the intent of Congress as expressed in the language of the Act. Furthermore, floor debate quotes are not authoritative
as to the meaning of the Act, especially where such statements are contrary to the language of the Act itself.

is expressly provided for oxygen in new 211(k)(2)(B). Under 211(k)(4)(C), EPA must also establish reasonable testing
tolerances for all other aspects of this program, to minimize cost and make it workable and verifiable in the real world.
EPA is specifically expected to promptly establish such tolerance limits. Similar reasonable tolerances are intended
for the CO program in 211(m).''

The third relevant statutory provision is section 211(k)(2)(B). There Congress tied the testing tolerance requirement
to the level of the standard itself. This provision establishes a minimum oxygen content requirement for the reformulated
gasoline of ``2.0 percent by weight (subject to a testing tolerance established by the Administrator)''. Unlike
section 211(k)(4)(C), which addresses technical issues regarding measurement of air pollutants, this provision
addresses the level of the standard itself and compliance with the oxygen content requirement. EPA interprets this
as requiring establishment of a reasonable testing tolerance for the oxygen content requirement. As in the winter
time oxygenated gasoline program, EPA is establishing this tolerance as 0.30 wt.% oxygen. Unlike section 211(k)(4)(C),
there is no explicit requirement that this tolerance be incorporated into the regulations, and given the nature of
an enforcement testing tolerance EPA is not adopting it as a rule.

The discretionary nature of enforcement test tolerances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above, enforcement test tolerances are not required by the Act except for oxygenate testing pursuant
to section 211(k)(2)(B), and even there, Congress left to EPA's discretion at what level such tolerance should be
set as well as any criteria EPA would use. EPA has carefully considered the many comments regarding test tolerances.
Any test tolerance would involve establishing a policy that the Agency would forego an enforcement action unless,
in testing an enforcement sample, EPA found that a standard was exceeded by a set amount. Other appropriate conditions
could also be required, such as evidence that the regulated party conducted appropriate sampling and testing. Establishing
an enforcement tolerance based on testing or any other factor is a matter solely within the Agency's enforcement discretion,
and is not addressed by section 211(k), except for purposes of the oxygen content requirements of section 211(k)(2)(B).
As described below, EPA has decided to announce its current position on enforcement test tolerances with respect
to several of the emission and content standards specified for reformulated gasoline subject to the simple model.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is aware that as a result of the gasoline volatility regulations at 40 CFR 80.27&hyph;28, many pipelines only accept
gasoline which tests below the RVP standard minus a margin of safety set by the pipelines. In some cases, the margin
of safety set by the pipelines is equal to the reproducibility of the RVP test method. Many commenters expressed concern
that a similar pipeline policy also would apply to the reformulated gasoline maximum/minimum parameters. Likewise,
EPA is concerned about downstream parties who have limited control over the quality of the product received. For example,
gasoline in the custody of a pipeline or terminal may be the product of several commingled refinery shipments. In light
of these concerns, EPA intends to withhold prosecution of downstream parties such as pipelines and terminals, where
proper sampling and testing by the downstream party shows that the product exceeds standard but tests within the tolerance
set by EPA, and where there is no reason to believe that the party caused the gasoline to exceed the standard.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Almost every commenter suggested that EPA use reproducibility for enforcement tolerances. Commenters suggested
that because the comparison of test results from different laboratories is inevitable, it is necessary to incorporate
an appropriate measure of the variability between laboratories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has decided in its discretion to adopt enforcement test tolerances for certain requirements in addition to oxygen
content. As discussed above, the Clean Air Act does not require enforcement testing tolerances for the six reformulated
gasoline parameters other than oxygen (i.e., RVP, distillations, benzene, aromatics, sulfur, and olefins). In
addition, only three fuel parameters (RVP, oxygen, and benzene) have maximum and/or minimum standards under the
simple model. Therefore, these simple model parameters are the only ones likely to involve EPA testing for enforcement
purposes. Although not required to do so, EPA has decided to set forth in the preamble of this Rule testing tolerances
for these parameters, in order to provide regulated entities with information of interest to them regarding EPA's
enforcement program.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In fuels enforcement programs under Title II of the Clean Air Act, EPA generally uses data obtained from its own laboratory
to determine the appropriateness of any testing tolerance. At the present time, however, sufficient data needed
to determine enforcement testing tolerances based on EPA laboratory data are not available. Therefore, EPA is setting
initial test tolerances sufficiently large to assure that any competent laboratory testing a conforming sample
could arrive at results that would indicate that the sample was not in violation. However, EPA may adopt new tolerances
as data on test methods are developed, as technology changes, or as further information becomes available concerning
the precision and accuracy of a particular method, whether established by EPA or by multiple testing protocol. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The test tolerance is only to be used by EPA to determine whether an enforcement action should be brought. It is EPA's
contention that any sample that is over the standard is in violation. However, no enforcement action will be brought
if the sample is over the standard, but within the tolerance. Furthermore, refiners and importers may not use the tolerance
to expand the applicable standard. If the refiner or importer results show the product to be above the standard, then
the product is in violation regardless of whether or not it is within the tolerance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To better establish the most appropriate test tolerances, EPA proposes a joint effort between EPA and industry to
develop a gasoline standard with known properties which could be used by all laboratories for calibration purposes
and for detecting laboratory biases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Benzene.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The initial test tolerance for benzene is 0.21 vol%, but this tolerance value will be modified through a round-robin
testing process that is intended to identify a more appropriate test tolerance for benzene. Under this approach,
the 0.21 vol% initial benzene tolerance will be used only until January, 1996, when the modified benzene tolerance
will apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The process for identifying the new benzene tolerance will involve a round-robin testing program to be carried out
cooperatively by EPA and the American Petroleum Institute (API). This testing program will involve testing by a number
of laboratories selected by EPA and API, in accordance with a round-robin testing protocol that will be developed
jointly by EPA and API. The purpose of the testing program is to identify the lab-to-lab reproducibility that exists
among high-caliber laboratories that follow good laboratory procedures including procedures dealing with quality
assurance and quality control, and where all reasonable steps have been taken to achieve high lab-to-lab correlation.
The testing program generally will follow the round-robin methodology used by the American Society of Testing and
Materials (ASTM). EPA, API, and the laboratories involved also will attempt to improve lab-to-lab correlations,
through use of a gasoline matrix with known, repeatable properties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new tolerance will be determined from the reproducibility standard deviation resulting from the round-robin
in such a way that the Agency can be 95% certain that materials tested at the standard plus the tolerance are in fact over
the standard. The above calculations will be used to establish the tolerance regardless of whether the resulting
value is less than or greater than 0.21 vol%, but the value will not be greater than 0.30 vol% regardless of the results
of the testing program.

The round-robin testing is to be completed by January 1, 1995, statistical analysis of the test results will be completed
by June 1, 1995, the new tolerance will be announced by EPA by July 1, 1995, and the new tolerance will be effective beginning
in January, 1996. In the event the round-robin testing program is not completed by January, 1995, the benzene tolerance
will be 0.03 vol% beginning in January, 1996, provided that the failure to complete the program is through no fault
of EPA. If, however, the testing program failure is EPA's fault, or if the testing program is completed in accordance
with the round-robin testing protocol and the testing data is submitted to EPA by January 1, 1995, the initial 0.21
vol% benzene tolerance will continue to apply beyond January, 1996. If, through EPA's fault, the announcement of
the tolerance is delayed beyond July 1, 1995, the new tolerance will become effective six months following announcement
of the new tolerance, and until then the tolerance of 0.21 vol% will apply.

C. Independent Sampling and Testing Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its 1992 supplemental proposal, EPA proposed that refiners and importers would be required to carry out a program
of independent sampling and testing of reformulated gasoline that is produced or imported. 57 FR 13445. Only refiners
commented on this proposal; without exception, these comments were critical. Nevertheless, EPA has retained the
independent sampling and testing requirement in the final rule, with certain revisions based on comments, for the
reasons contained in the 1992 SNPRM and in today's notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 1992 SNPRM, EPA explained the reasons for the independent sampling and testing requirement. Independent sampling
and testing would flag errors in refiner or importer analysis and allow corrections of either noncomplying product
or of the accounting books kept by these parties. These errors could be caused by mistakes in sample collection, sample
analysis, by bias in the refiner's or importer's sampling and/or testing system, by inadvertent mistake, or by outright
cheating. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, EPA expects that reformulated gasolines will almost always be combined in the fungible gasoline distribution
system after it leaves the refinery, and in many cases such fungible mixing will occur before the gasoline leaves the
refinery or is transferred by the refiner to another party. Once fungible mixing occurs, there is no opportunity to
look behind the refiner's or importer's test result records, except for those limited cases where EPA inspects reformulated
gasoline at the refinery before fungible mixing of the gasoline occurs. This problem is amplified by the averaging
option available for refiners and importers. Once a batch of reformulated gasoline becomes mixed with other batches
from the same or different refiners or importers, EPA is no longer able to test this fungible mixture to determine compliance
with either per-gallon or averaging standards. EPA can then only sample and test for compliance with the maximum and
minimum requirements, and has to rely on the refiner's or importer's records and test results to verify the accuracy
of averaging and credit reports that are submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sampling and testing by EPA would therefore normally be a valid check only for maximum and minimum requirements, and
will not provide a means of verifying whether the individual gasolines contained in a fungible mixture met the reformulated
gasoline per-gallon or average standards when produced. Absent independent sampling and testing, therefore, there
would be little or no means of verifying whether reformulated gasoline met standards, or whether reports of credit
creation are accurate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters on the proposed rule cited a number of reasons the independent sampling and testing requirements should
be revised or not be made final. One commenter stated that independent sampling and testing is unnecessary and redundant
to other enforcement requirements included in the reformulated gasoline program, such as penalties for noncompliance,
the quality assurance sampling and testing defense element, gasoline quality surveys, recordkeeping, and attest
engagements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While these enforcement requirements in the final rule are important, their focus is different from the focus of independent
sampling and testing. Quality assurance sampling and testing is a required showing for most parties presumed liable
for downstream violations that is intended to monitor compliance with the maximum and minimum requirements, and
is not intended to monitor the accuracy of the per-batch properties refiners and importers enter into their records.
The recordkeeping requirements do not play a verification role; records kept by refiners and importers are only as
accurate as the information entered by these parties. The gasoline quality surveys monitor the overall quality of
gasoline being used in a covered area during the survey periods, but the capacity of surveys to detect cheating by refiners
and importers is limited. Surveys will take place in any covered area during only several weeks per year. In addition,
the gasoline used in a covered area is a mixture of the gasolines produced or imported by a large number of refiners and
importers, often hundreds or thousands of miles distant from the covered area. Surveys would not be expected to detect
improper deviations in gasoline properties from the properties reported by one or several of these refiners or importers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The procedures specified for attest engagements were specifically designed to not overlap with the independent
sampling and testing provisions. In any event, in most cases attests would not be capable of detecting errors or cheating
in sample analysis; an auditor only can review the information contained in a refiner's records, and is not able to
collect and analyze samples of gasoline produced months prior to the attest engagement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These and other components of EPA's enforcement program for reformulated gasoline are not able on their own to address
the main focus of the independent sampling and testing program_the accuracy of the individual batch determinations
made by refiners and importers. These determinations must be accurate to achieve compliance with either the per-gallon
or averaging standards. Given the fungible mixing of reformulated gasoline both within a refinery or import facility
and in the gasoline distribution system, EPA is not able to check the accuracy of these individual batch determinations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance with the reformulated gasoline requirements also involves accurately analyzing many more gasoline
components than is required under any of EPA's prior motor vehicle fuel regulations. This additional complexity
both increases the need for refiner or importer accuracy, and makes it that much harder for EPA to check compliance
after gasoline has been fungibly mixed. EPA believes the independent sampling and testing program is a reasonable
response to these circumstances, and draws a reasonable balance between EPA's enforcement needs and the desirability
of maintaining a highly fungible gasoline distribution system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters stated that independent sampling and testing was unnecessary because the fungible gasoline distribution
system, and contractual commitments, will guarantee product compliance. EPA believes that product specifications
will be set by pipelines or gasoline sales contracts for reformulated gasoline, however these specifications are
expected to address only the minimum and maximum requirements and time and place of use restrictions. EPA does not
believe these specifications will focus on whether a particular batch of reformulated gasoline was produced on average
or per-gallon, or on the specific parameter values of the batch, provided the values are within the maximum and minimum
requirements. As a result, gasoline specifications do not obviate the need for independent sampling and testing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters cited cost as a basis for excluding independent sampling and testing from the final rule. One industry
group commented that the costs of independent sampling and testing will be $30 to $40 million per year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes the costs of independent sampling and testing will be significantly smaller than this commenter suggested.
EPA has estimated that the annual costs of this program element will be between $1.9 and $7.8 million per year. A copy
of a memorandum describing EPA derivation of this estimate has been placed in the docket for this rulemaking. EPA believes
that the principal difference between the industry and EPA cost estimates is that the industry assumes it will be necessary
for each refinery to have an independent sampler in place 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. As a result of this assumption,
industry assigns an annual cost of $32 million for sample collection only. This assumption is not justified. While
some high-volume refineries producing a large percentage of reformulated gasoline may require the presence of an
independent sampler much of the time, most refineries will produce a batch of reformulated gasoline less frequently
than every day.

 Industry has estimated that, nationwide, 175 batches of gasoline are produced per day. Only a portion of these will
be of reformulated gasoline, and of these, a portion will be produced through in-line blending and not require independent
sampling and testing. The number of batches per day that will require independent sampling and testing is between
22 and 71. There are about 200 refineries operating in the United States; EPA believes that between 100 and 120 of these
will produce reformulated gasoline (excluding refineries in California that will be exempt from the independent
sampling and testing requirements). As a result, EPA estimates that on average refineries will produce one batch
of reformulated gasoline that requires independent sampling and testing every 1.4 to 5.5 days.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters stated that the costs of independent sampling and testing will be disproportionately high for
small refiners, because their batch sizes are small in comparison to batch sizes for larger refiners, and because
independent labs may not be conveniently located relative to small refineries, requiring sample shipping. It is
true that the per-gallon costs of independent sampling and testing will be larger for a refinery producing reformulated
gasoline in small batches in comparison to the per-gallon costs for a refiner producing larger batches. Nevertheless,
EPA believes this cost difference is insignificant. For a 20,000 barrel batch, a small-sized batch, the per-gallon
cost of independent sampling and testing would be $0.0003; for a 50,000 barrel batch, the per-gallon cost would be
$0.0001.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA anticipates that samples collected at refineries located distant from any reliable independent laboratory
will be shipped to the laboratory, but does not believe such sample shipping is problematic or costly. These conclusions
are based on EPA's experience in conducting gasoline quality inspections throughout the country over at least the
past dozen years, when its inspectors have shipped several thousand samples per year to EPA's laboratory for analysis.

cost of $415 and analysis of 10% of the samples collected at a refinery), or $272.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters stated that the independent sampling and testing requirements will result in delays in the movement of
finished reformulated gasoline due to the time required to resolve test result discrepancies between refiner/importer
laboratories and independent laboratories, or that gasoline found to violate standards through independent sampling
and testing may not be correctable because the gasoline in question will be in the fungible distribution system at
the time the violation is determined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA does not believe these concerns create a basis for excluding the independent sampling and testing requirements.
EPA does not construe the independent sampling and testing provisions to require refiners or importers to hold gasoline
at the refinery or import facility until the independent testing is completed. In the event of a discrepancy between
the refinery/importer test result for a gasoline batch and the independent laboratory test result for that batch,
EPA anticipates the refiner/importer will correct the batch values it claims: if the standard for the parameter in
question is being met on average, the value for that parameter used in calculating compliance would be changed (if
the correct parameter value is within the per-gallon maximum).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the case of gasoline subject to the per-gallon standards, and in the case of the per-gallon minimum and maximum standards,
EPA believes refiners and importers will be able to avoid the situation where, subsequent to the gasoline leaving
the refinery or import facility, the gasoline is discovered to violate these standards. Refiners and importers will
avoid this situation in several ways. First, refiners and importers will have the results of their own tests before
the gasoline leaves the refinery or import facility, and the final rule requires that these tests must indicate the
gasoline meets all standards. Second EPA's experience is that refiners and importers produce gasoline subject to
per-gallon standards with a ``margin-of-safety'' sufficient to ensure tests by others do not indicate the gasoline
fails to meet the standards. Third, with regard to tests pursuant to the independent sampling and testing requirement,
refiners and importers presumably will select only high-caliber independent labs, and will closely correlate with
them, making the possibility of conflicting test results unlikely. Fourth, the independent lab results do not have
to exactly match the refiner- or importer-test results, but rather have to be within a range that is specified in the
final rule. Lastly, test results by regulated parties downstream of the refinery or import facility (e.g., pipelines,
terminals), or by EPA, would not be a basis for concluding gasoline violates a per-gallon minimum or maximum standard
unless the test result exceeds the standard 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
plus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 an enforcement tolerance. Enforcement tolerances are discussed in another section of this preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, in a situation where these mechanisms fail and a refiner or importer learns, through tests by EPA or
others, that a parameter value for a gasoline batch subject to the per-gallon standard violated that standard, or
for a gasoline batch subject to the average standard violated a per-gallon minimum or maximum standard, the refiner
or importer would be expected to correct the violation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters raised concerns over the logistics and safety of non-company employees entering refineries
to collect samples. EPA agrees that in order to comply with the independent sampling and testing requirements, a refiner
or importer will be required to make arrangements with the independent laboratory that address logistics and safety
issues. A refiner or importer would be expected to select as its independent laboratory a company that is able and willing
to commit by contract to collect samples in a manner that minimizes interference with refinery or importer operations_to
collect samples in a timely manner, and comply with company safety requirements. Because refiners and importers
are given the latitude to select their own independent laboratories, EPA believes these parties will be able to identify
and select ones that are satisfactory.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters stated that independent sampling and testing will not be a successful deterrent to willful cheating,
because a cheater can buy off its ``independent'' laboratory. While this type of fraud is always possible, EPA believes
it is considerably more difficult for a refiner or importer intent on cheating to falsify reports when a second company
has to be brought into the conspiracy. Given the consequences if caught, independent laboratories are unlikely to
collaborate with a refiner or importer to falsify reports to EPA. False reporting by a refiner, importer, or independent
laboratory would constitute a criminal violation under 18 U.S.C. section 1001, subject to monetary penalties and
imprisonment, and EPA would expect to seek vigorous prosecution of such a case. In addition, the final rule provides
that any laboratory that fails to comply with the requirements of the rule is subject to debarment or suspension, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the company that operates the laboratory would be made ineligible for any government contracts, and would be precluded
from participating in the reformulated gasoline program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another criticism made of the independent sampling and testing provision is the inconsistency with the requirements
for conventional gasoline, where independent sampling and testing is not required. EPA considered requiring independent
sampling and testing for conventional gasoline, but decided to treat conventional and reformulated gasoline differently
in this regard. EPA believes the profit incentive for cheating is less for a producer of conventional gasoline than
for a producer of reformulated gasoline. Conventional gasoline does not require the new and costly refining procedures
necessary for reformulated gasoline, and will not be sold at reformulated gasoline's price. In contrast to reformulated
gasoline, conventional gasoline is subject to neither time and place of use restrictions nor to per-gallon maximums
and minimums. Moreover, an enforcement program for reformulated gasoline that is more strict than for conventional
gasoline is appropriate given the greater air quality concerns in the areas slated to receive reformulated gasoline.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA considered enforcement approaches to verifying refiner and importer test results for conventional gasoline
that are less burdensome than independent sampling and testing, such as the approaches that were suggested by the
reformulated gasoline commenters and are discussed below. These middle-ground approaches were rejected for the
same reasons they were rejected for the reformulated gasoline program_they simply would not be effective as test
verification mechanisms.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result, EPA concluded that while independent sampling and testing is necessary for reformulated gasoline, these
procedures are not justified for conventional gasoline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters suggested several alternatives to independent sampling and testing. None of these alternatives satisfy
the program needs addressed by independent sampling and testing, however. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters stated that EPA should establish a program of EPA certification of refiner and importer company laboratories,
and participation in round-robin analysis programs, as an alternative to independent sampling and testing. Presumably
independent sampling and testing only would be required where a company laboratory failed to obtain EPA certification.
Commenters cited other federal programs that include the laboratory certification and/or round-robin approach,
including the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) and federal requirements for petroleum
products produced to meet military specifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA does not believe that laboratory certification and round-robin programs would provide sufficient verification
of refiner or importer testing of reformulated gasoline. Programs of this type generally provide information on
the quality of work a given laboratory is capable of performing under optimal conditions; they shed little light on
the quality of the laboratory's day-to-day work which is the main focus of the independent sampling and testing requirement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certification by EPA or another organization would determine if a laboratory has proper equipment and personnel
properly trained as of the date of the certification, but would provide no certainty of the ongoing laboratory operation.
The treatment of round-robin samples by laboratories is predictably special. If a laboratory's continued certification
is contingent on the quality of its analysis of samples received from EPA, the laboratory would be expected to assign
its best personnel to this task, to be particularly careful in the analysis, and probably to repeat the analysis enough
times to be certain a correct result is obtained. The treatment received by round-robin samples may bear little resemblance
to the treatment normal samples receive. Certainly, neither laboratory certification nor round-robin testing
would constitute any deterrent to a willfully cheating refiner or importer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes the other federal programs that use laboratory certification and/or round-robins are inappropriate
precedents for use of these approaches in the reformulated gasoline program. In the case of petroleum products produced
to military specifications, the military presumably receives the products produced and can at that time verify whether
the products meet relevant standards and criteria. This type of after-the-fact verification is not possible for
reformulated gasoline for the reasons that have been discussed. In the case of facilities regulated under the NPDES
program, it is possible to verify whether the levels of pollutants being discharged by the facilities are consistent
with facility-specific permits that have been issued through EPA inspections that include water samples collected
at the facilities. The reformulated gasoline situation is distinguished from the NPDES program because fungible
mixing that often occurs within the refinery or import facility would render EPA inspections ineffective as a reformulated
gasoline test verification mechanism. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters offered other alternatives to independent sampling and testing that would rely on random refinery audits
by independent parties or by EPA, or of verification-analysis by EPA of a representative portion of the samples analyzed
by refiners and importers. EPA rejected these alternatives. The limitations inherent in EPA refinery or import facility
inspections that result from fungible mixing, discussed above, also would apply to audits conducted by independent
parties. A program that would rely on EPA-conducted verification analysis of certain samples that are sent to EPA
by refiners or importers raises the same types of concerns that occur under the round-robin approach. Refiners and
importers would be expected to analyze samples that also are sent to EPA for verification-testing with a level of care
that may bear little resemblance to normal laboratory practices, and this approach would provide small deterrent
to the willful cheater.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other commenters suggested that EPA should rely on EPA-conducted inspections at refineries and at downstream locations,
as in the gasoline volatility program. EPA intends to conduct inspections like these under the reformulated gasoline
program, but does not consider them to be replacements for independent sampling and testing. EPA inspections at refineries
and import facilities will be able to monitor the refiner- or importer-claimed properties for reformulated gasoline
only if product is present at the time of the EPA inspection that has not been fungibly mixed. EPA believes this will
often not be the case. Moreover, the refiner or importer is required to submit reports to EPA stating the claimed properties
of a batch of gasoline only at the conclusion of each quarter, and would know which gasoline EPA sampled during an inspection.
It would be expected that prior to filing its report to EPA, a refiner or importer would verify, and re-verify, its analysis
results for gasoline that had been sampled by EPA. A willful cheater could simply record the correct properties for
gasoline that had been sampled by EPA, while continuing to report bogus properties for the remainder of the gasoline.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Inspections conducted by EPA downstream would almost always be of fungibly mixed gasolines, and as a result would
be valid only for checking compliance with the maximum and minimum requirements; downstream inspections would not
serve as a check on the per-gallon or average properties claimed by refiners and importers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is relevant to note the difference in enforcement that was used under the lead phasedown program, as contrasted
with the enforcement possible under reformulated gasoline. Lead phasedown was similar to reformulated gasoline
in that refiners and importers were required to meet an average standard that applied to gasoline produced or imported.
Unlike reformulated gasoline, however, lead phasedown compliance was based only on the volume of gasoline produced
and the amount of lead used in that production_two categories of information that were easily verified after-the-fact.
Lead usage was verifiable because EPA required all lead manufacturers to report to EPA the amount of lead shipped to
each refinery. EPA could verify the volume of gasoline produced through audits of refinery production documents,
cross checked with refinery sales documents and records from transferees of refinery gasoline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under reformulated gasoline, however, this type of after-the-fact verification of refinery or importer reports
is not possible. In contrast with volume information, routinely determined and kept by all parties to gasoline transactions,
the properties relevant to reformulated gasoline include many that are routinely determined only a single time_by
the refiner laboratory_and are therefore not susceptible to verification and cross checks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that EPA should require independent sampling and testing only for identified violators. EPA
has rejected this option, however, because of difficulties in implementing such an approach. The limitations in
determining refiner or importer cheating in its reports to EPA, discussed above, would make it difficult for EPA to
know or prove any party is a violator in this way. Such refiner-specific imposition of independent sampling and testing
would most properly be based on proof of refiner violations involving improper product testing, but if such violations
could be documented easily, or even with difficulty but reliably, there would be little need for independent sampling
and testing to begin with. It is precisely this difficulty in detecting and documenting testing violations that creates
the need for independent sampling and testing. Violations that are susceptible to reliable documentation, such
as of the minimum and maximum requirements or of the time and place of use restrictions, would not appear appropriate
predicates for imposing independent sampling and testing. Requirements of this type are not the primary focus of
independent sampling and testing. Moreover, if non-testing violations resulted in the imposition of independent
sampling and testing, alleged violators would likely use protracted litigation to avoid the consequence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters made a number of suggestions as to changes that should be made in the independent sampling and testing program
as proposed. One commenter proposed that EPA should require independent sampling and testing only for reformulated
gasoline that meets standards on average, and not for reformulated gasoline that meets standards per-gallon. EPA
rejected this option, however, for the reasons provided below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA could inspect reformulated gasoline produced to meet the per-gallon standard, or fungible mixtures of per-gallon
gasolines, and gain reasonable certainty that the gasolines were produced in compliance with the per-gallon standard.
This is the type of enforcement program used for other gasoline rules with per-gallon standards, such as volatility.
See 40 CFR part 80. In the absence of averaging, this is the type of enforcement program EPA might expect to use for reformulated
gasoline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that most reformulated gasoline found downstream will not be per-gallon gasoline only, however, but
rather is likely to be either averaged gasoline or a mixture of per-gallon and averaged gasoline, and therefore not
susceptible to downstream verification of refiner and importer reports. As a result, the ultimate consequence of
removing the independent sampling and testing requirement from per-gallon gasoline would be the loss of verification
over most refiner and importer reports for per-gallon reformulated gasoline.

One commenter said that EPA should require independent laboratories to use the same test methods as the refinery.
EPA agrees with this suggestion, and has incorporated it in the final rule. As discussed in the test method section
of this Preamble, EPA requires refiners and importers to use the regulatory test methods when meeting the refinery
and import facility testing requirements in order to avoid erroneous test results due to bias among test methods.
For the same reason, the accuracy of test results by independent laboratories would be compromised if independent
laboratories use non-regulatory test methods. The commenter's suggestion is an appropriate solution to this possibility.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter said that EPA should reduce the length of time independent laboratories are required to retain
samples, from the 180-day period in the proposal to 60 days. EPA has retained the 180-day sample retention period to
allow EPA the opportunity to obtain portions of samples after it receives quarterly reports from refiners, importers,
and independent laboratories. EPA recognizes that certain types of analysis results become less reliable as samples
age, but believes there is enough information to be learned from samples older than 60 days to justify the 180-day sample
retention requirement.

Reid vapor pressure is the fuel parameter most susceptible to change due to storage time, because the more volatile
fractions of a fuel sample may be lost if samples are not properly capped and stored at cold temperatures. Even in the
case of RVP, however, EPA's experience with analyses of samples that have been stored for 180 days has been that the
RVP of samples decline only approximately 0.2 psi, which is a change sufficiently small that EPA may continue to use
the samples.

Lastly, one commenter said that EPA should eliminate the requirement that independent laboratories determine certain
information about the gasoline sampled, including the batch volume, storage tank identification, and the grade
of gasoline. EPA proposed that independent laboratories obtain this information as part of the verification process
over refiner or importer reports, and continues to believe it is necessary. For example, the properties of gasoline
produced is only one part of the information necessary for demonstrating compliance; the volume of gasoline produced
with given properties also is necessary. Information on storage tank and gasoline grade is included as a means of confirming
the gasoline sampled and tested by the refiner or importer, and that by the independent laboratory, is the same.

D. Downstream Oxygenate Blending Assumptions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA received various comments on the assumptions refiners and importers may make regarding downstream oxygenate
blending for purposes of calculating the properties of reformulated gasoline blendstock intended for downstream
oxygenate blending (RBOB). Under the proposal, and the final rule, refiners and importers of RBOB are responsible
for meeting all reformulated gasoline standards, except the oxygen standard; downstream oxygenate blenders are
responsible for meeting the oxygen standard for reformulated gasoline produced using RBOB. In order to determine
compliance with the non-oxygen reformulated gasoline standards a refiner or importer must calculate the non-oxygen
parameter values for the reformulated gasoline. To do this, a refiner or importer must include a value for the oxygen
content the RBOB will achieve subsequent to downstream oxygenate blending, because the values of non-oxygen parameters
will differ based upon the type and amount of oxygenate blended downstream.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The impact of blending different oxygenate types and amounts on the non-oxygen properties of RBOB is great. VOC emissions
are dramatically affected by changes in RVP, yet different oxygenates affect RVP very differently; ethanol blended
above about four volume percent (1.5 weight percent oxygen) increases the RVP of the resulting gasoline by 1 psi, while
oxygenates other than ethanol cause very little or no change in RVP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, toxics emissions performance and benzene are strongly influenced by the dilution effect caused by oxygenate
blending, yet different oxygenates must be blended at very different volumes to result in the same oxygen content
in the gasoline produced; to produce gasoline with 2.00 weight percent oxygen, for example, requires 5.4 volume percent
ethanol, or 11.0 volume percent MTBE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA proposed that refiners and importers of RBOB have two options for the oxygen content value used in their calculations
of non-oxygen parameters. A refiner or importer could use the actual oxygenate type and amount blended with the RBOB,
provided the refiner or importer carries out a program of contractual controls and quality assurance sampling and
testing over the downstream oxygenate blending operation. Under the second option, the refiner or importer could
make certain default assumptions regarding the type and amount of oxygenate blended downstream. EPA proposed that
this assumption must be the ``worst case'' assumption with regard to the oxygenate type, and volume (within the oxygen
minimum and maximum requirements).

The worst case assumption for RVP and VOC emissions performance reduction would be ethanol, at the oxygen maximum
level. For toxics emissions performance and benzene, the worst case would be the oxygenate providing the minimum
volume (normally ethanol) at the oxygen minimum level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter suggested that EPA should modify the nature of this default assumption, by allowing refiners to designate
one of two categories of RBOB, ``ether-only RBOB'' and ``any-oxygenate RBOB.'' These categories would have different
assumptions for oxygenate type; ether-only RBOB would be assumed to be blended with MTBE, and any-oxygenate RBOB
would be assumed to be blended with ethanol. Notwithstanding the assumption of MTBE use for purposes of compliance
calculations for ether-only RBOB, any ether could be added downstream to an ether-only RBOB. However, it would be
a violation to add an alcohol to an ether-only RBOB. This commenter stated further that the amount of oxygenate should
be assumed to be that amount necessary to add 2.1 weight percent oxygen, the annual average oxygen level that oxygenate
blenders must achieve for reformulated gasoline produced using RBOB when meeting the oxygen content standard on
average. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has generally adopted this suggestion for the final rule, but in a slightly modified form.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By adopting the approach suggested in the comments EPA is in effect adding an ether-only designation to the any-oxygenate
designation implicit in EPA's proposal. EPA also is modifying to some extent the oxygen content and type assumptions
that refiners must make if they rely on this RBOB designation in determining compliance with the VOC, toxics, and other
non-oxygen content requirements of reformulated gasoline. First, refiners and importers that produce or import
RBOB are required to designate the RBOB as any-oxygenate RBOB, or as ether-only RBOB.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
54
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 These designations are in addition to, but must be consistent with, the specifications for the type(s) and amount(s)
of oxygenate that must be included in the product transfer documents for RBOB. Second, refiners or importers that
do not meet the requirements for a quality assurance program over downstream oxygenate blending, must assume that
ethanol is blended with any-oxygenate RBOB, and that MTBE is blended with ether-only RBOB. For both types of RBOB,
the refiner or importer must assume that the amount used is that amount sufficient for the gasoline produced to have
2.0 weight percent oxygen, or approximately 5.70 volume percent in the case of ethanol and approximately 10.80 volume
percent in the case of MTBE. Refiner or importer oversight of the downstream oxygenate blending operation is not required
if a refiner or importer relies on these ``worst case'' assumptions. However, as noted below, these types of RBOB must
be segregated from one another.

Any oxygenate RBOB must meet all reformulated gasoline standards subsequent to blending with any of the following:

subsequent to blending with any of the following: MTBE, TAME, or ETBE.

EPA believes these assumptions regarding the type of oxygenate used are appropriate. The principal risk to the environment
under the oxygen use assumptions is that an oxygenate blender will blend ethanol with ether-only RBOB, which would
result in reformulated gasoline that probably would support neither the toxics nor benzene properties claimed by
the refiner or importer of the RBOB (due to an insufficient dilution effect), nor, in the case of VOC-controlled gasoline,
the claimed RVP nor VOC properties (due to RVP increases from ethanol). On the other hand, any-oxygenate RBOB will
be formulated for blending with ethanol, and would only improve for all properties if blended with an ether such as
MTBE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several mechanisms will help ensure ethanol is not blended with ether-only RBOB. Ether-only RBOB and any-oxygenate
RBOB must be segregated throughout the distribution system to the point of oxygenate blending. The product transfer
documents will identify ether-only RBOB as such, which will put each person in the distribution network, and the oxygenate
blender, on notice that the RBOB is not suitable for ethanol blending. Absent a highly unusual situation, a distributor
would not be expected to dispense ether-only RBOB into a gasoline delivery truck for splash blending, because ethanol
is the only oxygenate that normally is splash blended in trucks. In addition, it is likely that if ethanol were blended
with VOC-controlled ether-only RBOB, the resulting gasoline will not meet the RVP maximum or VOC emissions performance
minimum requirements, and would be susceptible to detection through EPA inspections or quality assurance programs
conducted by regulated parties.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes the volume assumptions based on 2.0 weight percent oxygen are preferable to the commenter's suggested
2.1 weight percent basis, because there is no reason to believe any particular oxygenate blender will elect to use
the averaged oxygen standard of 2.1 weight percent. In a situation like this involving default assumptions it is appropriate
to adopt a more conservative assumption. Oxygenate blenders have the option of meeting either the oxygen standard
for per-gallon compliance of 2.0 weight percent, or the oxygen standard for average compliance of 2.1 weight percent.
EPA believes the assumption that oxygenate blenders will at least meet the per-gallon standard is appropriate, and
preferable to the proposed ``worst case'' oxygen use assumption of 1.5 weight percent, due to enforcement mechanisms
contained in the final rule that apply to oxygenate blenders, i.e., quality assurance sampling and testing and recordkeeping.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While it is true that any single batch of reformulated gasoline produced by blending RBOB with oxygenate could receive
the per-gallon minimum 1.5 weight percent oxygen, the oxygenate blender must offset any gasoline produced at this
oxygen level with other gasoline produced with oxygen levels greater than 2.1 in order to meet the 2.1 average oxygen
content standard. In addition, EPA believes it is likely that most oxygenate blenders will choose to meet the oxygen
standard on a per-gallon basis, rather than on average. The testing, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements
for an oxygenate blender who elects the average oxygen standard are significantly greater than for an oxygenate blender
who elects the per-gallon standard. Moreover, EPA's oversight experience with the state-enforced wintertime oxygenated
fuels program, which includes the option of meeting that program's oxygen standard either per-gallon or on average,
is that the vast majority of oxygenate blenders have elected the per-gallon option in that program. This precedent
from the oxygenated fuels program is more compelling because the oxygen standard in the oxygenated fuels program
is 2.7 weight percent for both the per-gallon and average options, yet oxygenate blenders for the most part still chose
the per-gallon option. In contrast, under the reformulated gasoline program the average oxygen standard (2.1 weight
percent) is more rigorous than the per-gallon oxygen standard (2.0 weight percent), which is an additional reason
to believe reformulated gasoline oxygenate blenders will choose the per-gallon option. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All oxygenate blenders, including a blender using any-oxygenate or ether-only RBOB and who uses the average oxygen
standard, must follow the oxygen amount instructions contained in the RBOB product transfer documents. These instructions
must specify the minimum oxygen necessary for the resulting reformulated gasoline to meet all per-gallon minimum
and maximum standards. For example, a particular batch of any-oxygenate RBOB may specify 2.0 weight percent oxygen
in order for the resulting reformulated gasoline to meet the 1.3 vol% benzene per-gallon maximum. An oxygenate blender
using the RBOB in this example is required to add a volume of oxygenate that is large enough for the reformulated gasoline
to have a minimum 2.0 weight percent oxygen (e.g., a minimum of 5.4 vol% ethanol), regardless of whether the oxygenate
blender is meeting the oxygen standard per-gallon or on average. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A refiner or importer of RBOB who, in lieu of producing ether-only and/or any-oxygenate RBOB, elects to conduct a quality
assurance program over downstream oxygenate blending operations may use the actual oxygen types and amounts blended
with the RBOB. If such a refiner or importer fails to properly carry out the quality assurance program, however, the
RBOB will be deemed to have been blended with 4.0 vol% ethanol (1.5 wt% oxygen), the ``worst case'' oxygenate type and
amount that is not constrained by ``ether-only'' or ``any-oxygenate'' designations. Under this assumption the
reformulated gasoline would receive a 1 psi RVP boost associated with ethanol (see Section I of the RIA), and the minimum
dilution effect of any oxygenate at 1.5 wt% oxygen (for example, 1.5 wt% oxygen results from 4.0 vol% ethanol, or 8.2
vol% MTBE). This assumption is appropriate in such a situation because it is possible the RBOB could be blended with
ethanol at the 1.5 wt% oxygen minimum. EPA believes it is reasonable to assume the RBOB will be blended with at least
the per-gallon minimum oxygen volume of 1.5 wt% oxygen, because of the requirements imposed on oxygenate blenders,
such as recordkeeping, and mechanisms included in the final rule to ensure compliance with per-gallon minimums,
such as quality assurance sampling and testing by regulated parties and enforcement by EPA.

1. Use of per-gallon and average standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA proposed that refiners and importers would be allowed to decide, on a per-batch basis, which regulated parameters
will be subject to per-gallon standards and which will be subject to average standards. See 57 FR 13444 (April 16, 1992).
For example, under the proposal refiners could decide for any given batch of reformulated gasoline to meet the benzene
per-gallon standard and the toxics emissions reduction standard on average. Under the proposal these elections
could be made separately for each batch of gasoline produced or imported, and separately for each parameter.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA also intended that these per-gallon/average elections could be changed subsequent to the gasoline leaving the
refinery or import facility, so that if gasoline that was intended to meet a particular standard on a per-gallon basis
is discovered, subsequent to shipment, to violate the per-gallon standard, the refiner or importer could change
its accounting records to switch the gasoline batch to the average standard category (provided the gasoline meets
the per-gallon minimum or maximum). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has reconsidered this approach, and now believes that refiners and importers should be allowed to use either the
per-gallon or the average standard for each parameter, but that parties may not use a combination of per-gallon and
average standards for any parameter during any single averaging period. This per-gallon versus average election
must be made separately for each refinery and for each importer or oxygenate blender. Under this revised approach,
for example, a refiner could elect to meet the benzene standard per-gallon and the toxics emissions performance standard
on average for all reformulated gasoline produced at a refinery, but once these elections are made, they would apply
to all reformulated gasoline produced at that refinery for the entire averaging period for these parameters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is making this change from the proposal because it is concerned that under the proposed approach nationwide average
levels for regulated parameters would not achieve the levels of the average standards. For example, the average standard
for benzene is set at 0.95 wt%, because, among other factors, EPA estimates that this level is at least as stringent
as the benzene level that would exist in the absence of averaging. EPA is concerned that under the proposed approach
for electing per-gallon versus average standards the nationwide average benzene levels in reformulated gasoline
would be greater than the 0.95 wt% average standard for benzene. This result would be contrary to the intent of the Clean
Air Act and EPA's goal that averaging should result in average parameter levels that are no less stringent than would
occur in the absence of averaging. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 211(k)(7)(C) of the Act provides that benzene and oxygen credits may not result in average levels for these
parameters that are less stringent than would occur in the absence of using any benzene or oxygen credits. EPA has viewed
this constraint on the use of credits as appropriate to employ for all reformulated gasoline parameters that may be
met on average, including parameters other than oxygen and benzene, that averaging should not result in average parameter
levels that are less stringent than would occur in the absence of averaging. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, section 211(k)(1) of the Act directs EPA to promulgate reformulated gasoline regulations that require
the greatest achievable reductions in VOC and toxics emissions, taking into account cost, health and environmental
impacts, and energy requirements. EPA has concluded that if refiners were required to meet the reformulated gasoline
standards on a per-gallon basis only, that refiners would produce gasoline with properties equal to the standards
plus ``margins-of-safety'' necessary to ensure the gasoline in fact meets the per-gallon standards. EPA also has
concluded that the added flexibility afforded regulated parties through an average VOC or toxics standard results
in the ability by refiners and importers to achieve more stringent standards when met on average than is possible when
standards are met per-gallon, and the magnitude of this greater stringency is at least equal to the margins-of-safety
that would be used with per-gallon standards. As a result, in implementing section 211(k)(1) EPA intends to establish
requirements that will result in reformulated gasoline having VOC and toxics properties that in practice are at least
equal to the per-gallon standards plus the margins-of-safety (which is equal to the average standards). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In implementing these two statutory provisions, EPA intends that reformulated gasoline should have VOC and toxics
emissions performance properties, and benzene and oxygen content properties that, regardless of whether credits
or averaging are used, are in practice at least equal to the more stringent properties refiners would achieve if only
a per-gallon standard were allowed. The level of these more stringent properties is at least equal to the per-gallon
standard plus any ``margin-of-safety'' refiners would employ if only per-gallon standards were included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result, EPA proposed and is adopting standards for average compliance that are more stringent than the standards
for per-gallon compliance. Moreover, the differences between the proposed average and per-gallon standards reflect
EPA's estimates of this per-gallon ``margin-of-safety'' for each parameter. The relationship between margins-of-safety
and average standards is discussed more fully in the 1992 SNPRM, at 57 FR 13457&hyph;13458. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is concerned that if refiners, importers, and oxygenate blenders can elect per-gallon versus average standards
on a batch-by-batch basis, the levels of parameters in practice will not, on average, be approximately at the level
expected if only a per-gallon standard were applied (equal to the per-gallon standards plus the margins-of-safety),
but rather will on average be closer to the per-gallon standards. EPA believes the proposed approach would have this
result because of the ability of refiners and importers to elect to use the per-gallon or the average standards separately
for each batch.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For example, the per-gallon benzene standard is 1.00 vol%, and the average benzene standard is 0.95 vol%. Under the
proposal a refiner could, for each batch of gasoline produced, elect to meet the per-gallon or the average benzene
standard. EPA believes that under the proposed approach most refiners would produce gasoline with the intention
that the benzene level will be very close to, but slightly below, 1.00 vol%. If the refiner's benzene test for any given
batch indicates the benzene level is between 0.95 vol% and 1.00 vol% (which refiners would be able to achieve for most
batches), the batch would be placed in the per-gallon compliance category. If the refiner misses this benzene goal
for any batch, and the refiner's test result indicates a benzene level above 1.00 vol% (1.05 vol%, for example), the
refiner would simply place that batch in the average compliance category, and also produce a corresponding volume
of gasoline in the average category (or change a previously-produced batch to the average compliance category) having
a benzene level sufficiently below 0.95 vol% that the two batches have an average benzene content of 0.95 vol%. The
net result over the annual benzene averaging period would be that the majority of gasoline would be in the per-gallon
compliance category with an average benzene content close to 1.00 vol%, while the minority of gasoline would be in
the average compliance category with an average benzene content of 0.95 vol%. Under this example, the resulting overall
benzene level of the gasoline produced by the refiner would be greater than the approximately 0.95 vol% which EPA would
expect if all reformulated gasoline had to meet the per-gallon benzene standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA announced in its 1992 proposal a clear intention that average standards be allowed in order to increase refiner
and importer flexibility. EPA also made clear its expectation that the ``margin-of-safety'' normally expected
with a per-gallon standard not be lost because of averaging. This change is designed to implement this goal by preventing
the potential unfavorable result from averaging described above. The final rule therefore includes a requirement
that refiners, importers, and oxygenate blenders must elect, for each calendar year and for each parameter, to use
only the per-gallon standard or only the average standard for each regulated parameter. This election must be made
separately for each refinery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this revised approach to averaging, the average parameter levels for the gasoline produced by any refiner would
be approximately the same regardless of whether the refiner elects the per-gallon or the average standards. For example,
a refiner who elects to meet the benzene standard on a per-gallon basis probably will plan to produce gasoline with
benzene levels sufficiently below the 1.00 wt% benzene standard to ensure that, when the production of each batch
is complete, the refiner's benzene test results for each batch will be below 1.00 wt%. EPA estimates that refiners
subject to the per-gallon benzene standard would aim for approximately 0.95 wt% benzene, and as a result the gasoline
produced by such a refiner would have an average benzene level of about 0.95 wt%. In the case of refiners subject to the
average benzene standard, on the other hand, refiners probably would plan to produce gasoline with benzene levels
that exactly equal the 0.95 wt% benzene standard, with the result that the average benzene level for the gasoline produced
by such refiners would be almost exactly 0.95 wt%. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the revised approach for selecting whether to meet standards per-gallon versus average, therefore, the average
parameter values in practice will be at the levels intended by EPA and Congress, and not at the less stringent levels
that would have resulted from the proposed approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has not included a process for refiners, importers, and oxygenate blenders to notify EPA in advance of the per-gallon
versus average standard elections. Rather, parties in effect will make this election when the first batch of reformulated
gasoline is produced or imported each averaging period, because all reformulated gasoline subsequently produced
or imported during the averaging period must follow the lead of the first batch.

Separate oxygen averaging for simple model VOC-controlled reformulated gasoline.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposed regulations published in 1992, EPA proposed that in the case of gasoline subject to the simple model
the oxygen standard would have to be met separately for reformulated gasoline that is designated as VOC-controlled.
The rationale for this category of oxygen averaging was that under the simple model the VOC emissions reductions required
for reformulated gasoline would be deemed met only if the oxygen and RVP standards are each met for gasoline designated
as VOC-controlled. Under that proposal, the gasoline quality surveys to be conducted in cities during the high ozone
season would measure both RVP and oxygen of gasoline; the city would be considered to have passed a VOC survey only if
both the oxygen and RVP levels met the per-gallon standards for these parameters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An industry group commented on this approach to VOC surveys and oxygen averaging. This commenter suggested that the
VOC surveys should be based on a ``simple model'' VOC equation that would take into account both oxygen and RVP. Under
this VOC equation, if the oxygen content found during a survey is below the per-gallon oxygen standard (worse than
the standard), this deficiency may be offset by an RVP level that is below the per-gallon RVP standard (better than
the standard), and vice versa. This commenter went on to suggest that under this approach, there would be no need to
require refiners and importers to separately meet the oxygen standard for simple model VOC-controlled reformulated
gasoline.

Under the 1992 proposal, the separate RVP standard would apply only to simple model VOC-controlled reformulated
gasoline. The manner in which the RVP standard applies to VOC-controlled gasoline under today's rule is the same as
in the proposals. The oxygen standard, on the other hand, would have to be met separately for two categories of reformulated
gasoline under the 1992 proposal: VOC-controlled reformulated gasoline and all reformulated gasoline.

Under the 1992 proposal, for purposes of oxygen averaging, gasoline intended for use in oxygenated fuels program
areas during the oxygenated fuels control periods (or OPRG) could not be averaged together with non-OPRG gasoline.
The reason separate oxygen averaging was proposed for non-OPRG gasoline is to ensure areas not included in the oxygenated
fuels program receive gasoline that meets the 2.0 oxygen content mandated by the Clean Air Act. If OPRG and non-OPRG
gasoline could be averaged together for oxygen purposes, the gasoline in the OPRG areas_where 2.7 weight percent
oxygen is required during the oxygenated fuels control period_could be used to offset gasoline with 1.5 weight percent
oxygen intended for use in non-OPRG areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No comments were received on this proposed treatment of oxygen averaging for gasoline designated as OPRG versus non-OPRG,
and this treatment is unchanged under today's rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the 1993 proposal, EPA adopted the approach to VOC surveys and oxygen averaging suggested by this commenter. EPA
has now reconsidered, and has included in the final rule a requirement for separate oxygen averaging for simple model
VOC-controlled gasoline. The final rule retains the ``simple model'' VOC emissions reduction equation for use in
gasoline quality surveys during the high ozone season, however. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA agrees that the ``simple model'' VOC equation is appropriate for use in the VOC compliance surveys. This is because
the surveys are designed to help ensure that the area in fact receives the VOC reductions required by the simple model
RVP and oxygen per-gallon and averaging standards, where refiners and importers do not need to demonstrate compliance
on average beyond the refinery or importer level. If the surveys show compliance on average with the expected VOC reductions,
then there would not be a need to ``ratchet'' the RVP or oxygen standards. However, the surveys are an enforcement and
compliance tool, and do not replace the simple model standards themselves. Even if the surveys are passed, the separate
RVP and oxygen content standards still apply under the simple model and refiners and importers must comply with them.
Given the inherent limits on the frequency and number of VOC gasoline quality surveys they can not reasonably be treated
as a substitute for the standards themselves. It is reasonable to require that a refiner or importer demonstrate compliance
with the simple model oxygen content standards that apply under averaging. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this view, the purpose of the ``simple model'' VOC equation as used in VOC compliance surveys is to allow a slight
variance in oxygen due to averaging, to be offset by a slight variance in RVP due to averaging, and vice versa. The ``simple
model'' VOC equation is not intended to encourage refiners to employ a strategy of producing simple model VOC-controlled
gasoline well below the oxygen standard, to be offset by gasoline well below the RVP standard. The simple model RVP
and oxygen standards will still apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the complex model separate oxygen averaging is not necessary for VOC-controlled gasoline, because there is
a specific standard for VOC emissions performance that applies to reformulated gasoline. VOC emissions performance
will be used under the complex model gasoline quality surveys.

One industry group commented that there will be no gasoline in the VOC-controlled, OPRG category. EPA disagrees with
this conclusion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VOC-controlled gasoline must be present in terminals in covered areas during the period May 1 through September 15.
The oxygenated fuels control periods for areas that also are included in the reformulated gasoline program begin
on October 1 or later, and last through either January or February, except for the New York City area, which lasts until
April 30. Parties will supply OPRG gasoline to terminals in advance of October 1 in order to ``blend up'' terminals
to the oxygenated fuels standard by that date. If this OPRG gasoline arrives at terminals before September 15 (which
likely will occur), the gasoline also would have to meet the VOC-control standards; the product thus would be in the
VOC-controlled, OPRG category. A similar situation will likely occur in the Spring in New York City, where parties
will supply VOC-controlled gasoline to terminals in advance of May 1 in order to ``blend up'' terminals to meet the
VOC-control standards by that date. This pre-May 1 gasoline thus would also be in the VOC-controlled, OPRG category.

The final rule does not require that each of these categories must separately meet the oxygen standard. Only VOC-controlled
and non-OPRG gasoline must each separately meet the oxygen standard. As a result, the oxygen averaging standards
must be separately met for the following three classes of gasoline:

In order for oxygen credit creation and use to be consistent with the separate classes of oxygen averaging, the creator/transferor
of any credits must identify which of the four categories the credits represent. The user/transferee of credits must
apply the credits to that same category, in order to determine if the oxygen averaging requirements have been met for
the three classes specified above.

Because the actual total for oxygen is, for each class of oxygen averaging, equal to or greater than the compliance
total, Refiner A has met the oxygen averaging standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For gasoline subject to the complex model, there are only two classes for oxygen averaging: non-OPRG, and overall.
In consequence, oxygen credits must be placed into one of only two categories_OPRG, and non-OPRG. With these simplifications,
oxygen credits for gasoline subject to complex model standards would be created, transferred, and use in a manner
similar to the example described above. Because of the differences in oxygen categories for simple and complex gasoline,
however, oxygen credits generated from gasoline subject to the complex model could not be used to achieve compliance
for gasoline subject to the simple model.

for reformulated gasoline. The average standard is set at a level that is equal to the per-gallon standard plus the
``margin-of-safety'' refiners would use to ensure compliance if only a per-gallon standard were allowed. EPA estimates
this ``margin-of-safety'' would be 1.5% in the case of VOC and toxics emissions performance. In the case of NO

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The per-gallon minimum is included in order to cap the averaging range. It is set at a level that is 2.5% less stringent

each covered area receives reformulated gasoline that on average provides the air quality benefits Congress intended
for reformulated gasoline. The relationship between per-gallon and average standards, and the need for per-gallon
minimums and maximums, are discussed in the 1992 SNPRM at 57 FR 13455&hyph;13458.

F. Survey Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Ratchets of Simple and Complex Standards on Survey Failure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the 1992 and 1993 proposals, and under the final rule, refiners, importers, and oxygenate blenders that meet
standards on average must conduct gasoline quality surveys in reformulated gasoline covered areas; in the event
of a survey failure for a parameter, the standards for that parameter are ``ratcheted'' to be more rigorous. Under
the 1993 proposal, and under the final rule, VOC and toxics surveys consist of a simple model portion and a complex model
portion. Also under the 1993 proposal, EPA proposed that in the event of a failure of either the simple or the complex
model portions of a VOC or toxics survey, that both simple and complex model VOC and toxics standards would be ratcheted.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 Surveys for benzene and oxygen include both simple and complex model samples, because the measurements for these
fuel parameters are not dependent on the simple or the complex models. As a result, failure of a benzene survey results
in ratchets of the benzene standard under both the simple and the complex models; and the failure of an oxygen survey
results in ratchets of the oxygen standard under both the simple and the complex models. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One industry group commented on this proposal to ratchet both simple and complex standards, stating that instead
of EPA's proposed approach, a failure of the simple model portion of a survey should result only in a ratchet of simple
model standards, and vice versa. The commenter's concern was that ratchets of both the simple and complex standards,
when only one survey type is violated, would be unnecessary to achieve the surveys' purpose_to ensure gasoline quality
fluctuations due to averaging do not result in gasoline quality in any covered area that is ``dirtier'' than it would
be if all gasoline was certified to the per-gallon standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the exception of simple model VOC and toxics survey failures that occur in 1997, discussed below, EPA generally
agrees with this comment. Deficiencies in gasoline quality that are identified by the surveys are corrected (prospectively)
through ratchets of average and maximum standards that occur only for the class of gasoline (simple or complex) for
which a survey is failed. Survey failures also are prevented through quality assurance measures implemented by refiners
and importers intended to prevent survey failures and ratchets, and such measures probably would not be different
if ratchets occur only for the class of gasoline for which a survey is failed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exception to this ratchet approach in the case of simple model VOC and toxics survey failures in 1997 occurs because
a ratchet of the simple model standard in such a case would not constitute an incentive to refiners or importers to prevent
survey failures of this type. Use of the complex model is mandatory beginning on January 1, 1998; subsequent to this
date, the simple model standards may no longer be used. As a result of this timing, any failure of a simple model VOC or
toxics survey in 1997 would have no consequence if only the simple model standards are ratcheted, because ratcheted
standards become applicable only in the year subsequent to the year of the survey failure. Therefore, unless both
the simple and complex model standards ratchet in the event of a simple model VOC or toxics survey failure in 1997, refiners
and importers will have no incentive to take steps to avoid simple model survey failures in the year before the complex
model becomes mandatory.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule has been modified to reflect this approach to survey ratchets.

2. The (Limited) Intra-Covered Area Averaging Alternative to Surveys 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 211(k)(7) of the Act states that the reformulated gasoline regulations shall provide for granting oxygen
and benzene credits to persons who produce gasoline that exceed the standards for these parameters, providing for
certification of gasoline based on such credits where they are used within the same covered area as they are generated,
and requiring that the use of credits not result in average oxygen or benzene levels that are worse than would occur
if no credit provisions were allowed. This is the statutory basis for including benzene and oxygen credits in the proposals
and in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes these provisions are satisfied by refinery-based averaging combined with compliance surveys, but
also believes they would allow a refiner or importer to meet the reformulated gasoline standards for oxygen and/or
benzene (but not for other parameters) on average if the party is able to demonstrate the gasoline it produces or imports,
and uses within a single covered area, meets the oxygen or benzene standards on average. To the extent section 211(k)(7)
provides for such intra-covered area averaging, it would be allowed without the need for the gasoline quality surveys
that are the general prerequisite for averaging. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to give regulatory effect to this averaging aspect of section 211(k)(7) of the Act, EPA proposed regulations
that would allow intra-covered area averaging without meeting the survey requirements. The proposal would have
allowed this averaging approach for all parameters that may be averaged. The proposal did not, however, include enforcement
mechanisms intended to ensure a party choosing this option does so properly, such as mechanisms to ensure, and document,
the gasoline in question is used only in a single covered area, such as recordkeeping, reporting, or quality assurance
requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA generally has retained this averaging option in the final rule in section 80.67(a)(2), but with several modifications.
The final rule restricts the non-survey averaging option to oxygen and benzene only. This restriction is included
because EPA intends to limit its application only to those parameters included in section 211(k)(7) of the Act. In
addition, EPA has included in the final rule the requirement that any party intending to use the non-survey averaging
option must first obtain approval from EPA through a petition process. The final rule specifies that the petition
must describe in detail the mechanisms the refiner or importer will use to ensure that the gasoline in question is in
fact produced by the refiner or imported by the importer, and is used only within the covered area and in no other attainment
area or covered area. The petition also must describe the recordkeeping, reporting, auditing, and other quality
assurance measures the party will use to document and report the quality of the gasoline used in the covered area.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petition would be expected to address mechanisms to establish with certainty the properties of the gasoline used
in the covered area, and mechanisms to ensure the gasoline delivered for use in the covered area is not transported
by a transferee of the gasoline (e.g., a truck distributor) for use in an adjoining attainment area or in another covered
area. To the extent any of a party's gasoline is mixed with gasoline produced by another refiner or imported by another
importer in the fungible gasoline distribution system, EPA believes the party would have serious difficulty achieving
the product tracking certainties required for intra-covered area averaging. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes this intra-covered area averaging approach will have very limited, if any, application, because it
requires precise tracking of the quality of gasoline that is produced by a single refiner or is imported by a single
importer and used within a single covered area. It was the great difficulty in this type of gasoline tracking, voiced
by refiners and downstream segments of the gasoline distribution system, that gave rise to the general reformulated
gasoline averaging approach included in the final rule_of refinery-level averaging combined with covered area
gasoline quality surveys. Having established mechanisms to accomplish averaging on a nationwide basis, EPA believes
it should sanction separate, intra-covered area averaging only if there is complete certainty the intra-covered
area approach can be carried out successfully and in a manner subject to full enforcement oversight. EPA further believes
the petition-approach included for intra-covered area averaging is the best means of accomplishing this certainty,
without promulgating an additional extensive regulatory scheme.

G. Conventional Gasoline Marker 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's proposed intent to designate the chemical phenolphthalein as the required marker for conventional gasoline
has been subjected to reconsideration on the basis of phenolphthalein field tests conducted using the gasoline pipeline
operated by the Amoco Oil Company in Mandan, North Dakota by the American Petroleum Institute and Amoco. The results
of those field tests suggest that phenolphthalein may not perform to EPA's expectations for reliably distinguishing
conventional gasoline from reformulated gasoline. Specifically, the field tests suggest that phenolphthalein
does not adequately mix with conventional gasoline and may act to contaminate water, metal surfaces and/or other
petroleum products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, EPA has elected not to issue a final rule governing conventional gasoline markers at this time. Instead,
EPA has undertaken further investigation of alternative markers with interested petroleum and chemical companies.
EPA intends to publish a new proposal for the conventional gasoline marker, and to promulgate a final conventional
gasoline marker rule based on this proposal. Interested parties will have the opportunity to comment on this proposal.

H. Responsibilities of Refiners and Oxygenate Blenders
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The introduction to this Preamble section describes the various responsibilities of refiners and oxygenate blenders
under the reformulated gasoline program. Comments were received requesting clarification of the requirements
that would apply in a case where more than one party is involved in a refinery or oxygenate blending operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final regulations define the terms ``refiner,'' ``refinery,'' ``oxygenate blender,'' and ``oxygenate blending
facility.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
60
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The definition of ``oxygenate blender'' includes a party that owns or controls the blendstocks or gasoline used or
the gasoline produced at an oxygenate blending facility. This definition is necessary in recognition of the practice
of blendstock owners to specify the type and amount of oxygenates to be added by another party. Because the blendstock
owner thus exercises control over the blending operation and affects the qualities of the finished gasoline, it is
appropriate to include the product owner within the definition of oxygenate blenders and to impose responsibility
for regulatory compliance on that party with substantial control over the quality of the final product.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 80.2(h) defines refinery as ``a plant at which gasoline is produced.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 80.2(i) defines refiner as ``any person who owns, leases, operates, controls, or supervises a refinery.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 80.2(ll) defines oxygenate blending facility as ``any facility (including a truck) at which oxygenate is
added to gasoline or blendstock, and at which the quality or quantity of gasoline is not altered in any other manner
except for the addition of deposit control additives.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 80.2(mm) defines oxygenate blender as ``any person who owns, leases, operates, controls, or supervises
an oxygenate blending facility, or who owns or controls the blendstocks or gasoline used or the gasoline produced
at an oxygenate blending facility.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of these definitions, there may be situations where more than one person meets the definition of refiner
or oxygenate blender for a single refinery or oxygenate blending facility. For example, at an oxygenate blending
facility there may be one person who owns the RBOB and oxygenate and causes those products to be combined to produce
reformulated gasoline (who also could be a distributor or reseller), another person who owns the gasoline storage
tanks in which the RBOB and oxygenate are combined (who also could be a truck or terminal carrier), and still another
person who operates and controls the blending equipment at the facility on a day-to-day basis. Each of the parties
described in this example independently meets the definition of oxygenate blender for the oxygenate blending facility
described. A similar scenario, with more than one person meeting the definition of refiner, is possible in the case
of a refinery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule provides that each person meeting the definition of refiner or oxygenate blender is independently
responsible that standards and other requirements that attach to a refining or oxygenate blending operation must
be met. This is the same requirement that attaches in other motor vehicle fuel regulatory programs. For example, under
the gasoline lead phasedown program, in cases where the lead phasedown standard is violated as a result of excess average
lead content of gasoline produced, EPA holds each person meeting the refiner definition liable; and under the gasoline
volatility program, in cases where the volatility standard is violated as a result of improper oxygenate blending,
EPA holds each person meeting the definition of oxygenate blender liable.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, as in other motor vehicle fuel regulatory programs, EPA intends to exercise its enforcement discretion
and not seek to hold liable parties meeting a definition in relation to a batch of gasoline that chose to jointly meet
the requirements of the final rule. In practice, therefore, each requirement pertaining to an individual batch of
gasoline must be met only once. For example, the determination of properties, independent sampling and testing,
compliance audits, testing of RBOB, record keeping and reporting requirements, and oxygenate blender quality assurance
programs need not be met separately by each person who meets the refiner or oxygenate blender definition with respect
to a specific batch of gasoline or blendstock. Rather, within the exercise of EPA's enforcement discretion, each
party is individually responsible for ensuring that each requirement is met at least once for any specific batch.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, EPA would exercise its enforcement discretion and not seek to impose liability on a party that meets the
definition of oxygenate blender that does not separately sample and test the gasoline produced or separately submit
reports to EPA relating to a specific batch of gasoline, as long as some party with equivalent standing (an oxygenate
blender) does conduct the required sampling and testing and does file a valid annual report. However, each person
meeting the definition of oxygenate blender in this example is individually responsible that the required sampling
and testing occurs and that the required reports to EPA are submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA anticipates that the people involved in a refining or oxygenate blending operation will discuss among themselves
who will be responsible for each of the regulatory requirements. In most cases, EPA anticipates that the product owner
will take the lead in satisfying requirements, though the allocation of these responsibilities is strictly within
the province of the regulated parties involved. If a refinery or oxygenate blending facility requirement is accomplished
by one person, EPA will consider the requirement to have been accomplished by each person who meets the definition
of refiner or oxygenate blender. If a refinery or oxygenate blending facility requirement is not properly accomplished,
however, EPA will consider the lapse to be a violation by each person who meets the definition of refiner or oxygenate
blender. Similarly, if a standard applicable to the refinery or oxygenate blending facility is not satisfied, EPA
will consider each person who meets the definition of refiner or oxygenate blender to have failed to satisfy the relevant
standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA anticipates that reformulated gasoline and RBOB will be produced exclusively, or almost exclusively, at the
refinery at which the blendstocks are produced from crude oil, due to the complexities inherent in producing reformulated
gasoline and RBOB. EPA believes it will be very difficult for a downstream party to obtain blendstocks with the specific
mixtures of properties such that the blendstocks may be blended together to produce gasoline meeting the standards
for reformulated gasoline or RBOB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, if such downstream blending-refining does occur, all requirements attaching to refiners apply to all parties
meeting the definition of a ``refiner''. Note that, if blendstocks are combined with reformulated gasoline, the
reformulated gasoline standards must be met on the basis of the volume and properties of the blendstocks only and compliance
may not rely on the properties of the reformulated gasoline to which the blendstock is added. In addition the resulting
reformulated gasoline/blendstock mixture must meet all reformulated gasoline standards. In the event any party
attempts downstream blending-refining of reformulated gasoline or RBOB, EPA intends to scrutinize the operation
closely. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters expressed concern that, where the oxygen standard is being met on an average basis, all persons who satisfy
the oxygenate blender definition may not have access to the information necessary to know that this standard is being
met in fact. This issue was of particular concern for oxygenate blenders who are carriers, where the normal business
practice is to blend oxygenate according to the instructions of the product owner-oxygenate blender. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule provides that oxygenate blenders will be held liable, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for reformulated gasoline produced for averaged compliance that is determined to exceed the minimum and/or maximum
standards. The final rule also prohibits the sale, by any person, of gasoline that violates, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a refiners' averaged compliance with the standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Oxygenate blenders have direct control over whether a specific fuel meets the minimum and/or maximum requirements
of the reformulated gasoline program. Blenders have no control over whether that fuel is being produced to comply
with per-gallon or averaged standards. Where gasoline is designated for oxygen compliance on a per-gallon basis,
the blender may take steps to ensure that 2.0 weight percent oxygen is added to each batch of gasoline produced. Where
gasoline is produced to averaged compliance, the blender is precluded from independent knowledge of whether the
average will be met.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA appreciates this dilemma faced by parties downstream of a refiner achieving compliance on average. However,
EPA believes both that the requirements that blenders be held potentially liable for selling averaged gasoline that
fails to meet the averaged standard is necessary and that adequate safeguards are available. Potential liability
is necessary to effectively prevent the sale and distribution of non-complying product by downstream parties which
possess any opportunity to prevent the product from being released into the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, if a carrier-oxygenate blender receives instructions to add less than 2.00 weight percent oxygen to
RBOB (the per-gallon oxygen standard), the carrier should obtain the assurance of the product owner, in writing if
possible, that the reformulated gasoline being produced meets the oxygen standard on average. If a violation of the
average oxygen standard occurs involving gasoline produced by the carrier-oxygenate blender, and the carrier-oxygenate
blender can demonstrate that it made this inquiry in good faith and received an appropriate assurance, EPA will exercise
its enforcement discretion and not hold the carrier-oxygen blender liable for the standard violation unless the
carrier knew, or should have known, the oxygen standard would not be met on average. This type of inquiry and assurance
would be no defense for oxygenate blended outside the per-gallon minimum/maximum standard, however.

1. Prohibitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule contains certain prohibitions that apply to all parties in the gasoline distribution network, that
address the per-gallon minimum and maximum standards for reformulated gasoline and the restrictions related to
the time and place of use for reformulated gasoline. Also prohibited for every party are, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the addition of oxygenate to reformulated gasoline (except reformulated gasoline that is designated for use in an
oxygenated fuels program during the oxygenated fuels control period); the combining of reformulated gasoline produced
using ethanol with reformulated gasoline produced using another oxygenate during the period May 1 through September
15; and (during 1995 through 1997) the combining of reformulated gasolines or RBOBs subject to complex model standards
unless the constituent reformulated gasolines or RBOBs have identical baselines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule also prohibits all parties, other than retailers and wholesale purchaser-consumers, from combining
reformulated gasoline or RBOB subject to simple model standards with reformulated gasoline or RBOB that is subject
to complex model standards during 1995 through 1997. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rational for these prohibitions are discussed separately in the preamble sections dealing with the specific
topics which result in the prohibitions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA received comments on its proposal to prohibit any party from transporting, storing, dispensing, selling, or
supplying reformulated gasoline that does not meet a reformulated gasoline certification. The commenters were
concerned that only gasoline that meets all reformulated gasoline standards would be ``certified,'' and that, as
a result of averaging, parties downstream of the refinery would have no way of knowing if a particular batch of gasoline
was produced to meet standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA agrees with this comment, and has modified the final rule to limit the downstream prohibition involving reformulated
gasoline properties to the per-gallon minimum and maximum standards that apply to all reformulated gasoline, regardless
of whether the gasoline is produced to the per-gallon or average standards.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As a result, downstream parties may determine if any particular gasoline batch meets the per-gallon minimums and
maximums through sampling and testing. Moreover, EPA inspections conducted downstream of the refinery/importer
will monitor compliance with the per-gallon minimums and maximums, and not compliance with the standards that apply
to refiners and importers.

For example, the refiner/importer benzene standard is 1.00 volume percent if met on a per-gallon basis, or 0.95 volume
percent if met on average with a 1.30 volume percent per-gallon maximum. As a result, no gallon of gasoline may have
a benzene content greater than 1.30 volume percent, regardless of whether the gasoline is produced or imported to
the per-gallon or average standard. This 1.30 benzene maximum thus may be enforced against downstream parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's proposal would also prohibit refiners and importers from producing or importing reformulated gasoline that
does not meet reformulated gasoline standards. Several commenters observed that the production alone of reformulated
gasoline or RBOB that fails to meet required standards does not cause environmental harm, because the product may
be corrected before it leaves the refinery. EPA generally agrees with this comment, and has adjusted the regulatory
language to clarify that the prohibition against the production of reformulated gasoline that fails to meet standards
applies only to gasoline that is intended for sale or use. During the course of any inspection at a refinery or import
facility, EPA will rely on the documentation used by a refiner or importer to determine if any particular gasoline
is ``finished'' and therefore is intended for sale or use, or is an ``unfinished'' product for which the refiner or
importer intends additional blending. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the final rule prohibits the manufacture, sale, offering for sale, distribution, dispensing, supplying
offering for supply, transporting or causing the transportation by refiners and importers of finished gasoline
``intended'' for sale or use where such gasoline fails to meet reformulated gasoline standards. This approach is
consistent with EPA's approach under the Lead Phasedown, Fuel Volatility and Diesel Desulfurization Programs.

 The final rule provides that where the gasoline contained in a storage tank at any facility owned, leased, operated,
controlled or supervised by any refiner, importer, oxygenate blender, carrier, distributor, reseller, retailer,
or wholesale purchaser-consumer is found in violation of the prohibitions, most parties involved in the chain of
distribution upstream of the facility found in violation are presumed liable for the violation.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Carriers are presumed liable for violations arising from product under the control and/or custody of the carrier
at the carrier's facility, and for violations at any facility where EPA demonstrates that the carrier caused the violation.
Carriers who meet the definition of refiner or oxygenate blender have the same liabilities and defenses as any other
refiner or oxygenate blender. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule also provides defenses against liability for each person presumed liable. These defenses are discussed
below. For a more detailed discussion of the rationale for the liabilities and defenses established by this rule,
see EPA's proposal at 57 FR 13470&hyph;13473 (April 16, 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that where gasoline in a storage tank is in violation of the regulations, EPA should either narrow
the range of persons presumptively liable or expand the availability of affirmative defenses. The comment is based
on the normal industry practice of commingling products in common storage tanks, the number of fuel manufacturers
that would be involved, the likelihood of commingling, the absence of quantitative thresholds, and the absence of
a requirement that individual parties exercise sufficient control over the contents of the tank. Another commenter
queried what distinguishes this program from other fuels programs which did not impose such presumptive liability.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has had extensive experience in enforcing other motor vehicle fuel programs under 40 CFR part 80, including the
unleaded gasoline and gasoline volatility programs and the recent diesel sulfur program. Each of these other fuels
programs include presumptive liability schemes that are very similar to the presumptive liability scheme proposed
for reformulated gasoline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The liability and defense provisions of this rule are structured similarly to those adopted by EPA in its prior motor
vehicle fuel programs, including the controls on leaded and unleaded gasoline, gasoline volatility and diesel fuel
desulfurization. For those programs, EPA's regulations identify various persons who are presumed liable when violations
are detected at various points in the motor fuel distribution system. For example, 40 CFR 80.28 identifies those persons
responsible for violations of the gasoline volatility regulations when a violation is detected at refiner or importer
facilities (&sect;80.28(a)), at carrier facilities (&sect;80.28(b)), at branded distributor facilities, reseller
facilities, or ethanol blending plants (&sect;80.28(c)), at unbranded distributor facilities and ethanol blending
plants (&sect;80.28(d)), at branded retail outlets or wholesale purchaser-consumer facilities (&sect;80.28(e)),
and at unbranded retail outlets or wholesale purchaser-consumer facilities (&sect;80.28(f)). In general, all
persons who could have caused a violation at a facility are presumed to be liable for the violation detected at the facility.
At branded facilities the refiner is also presumed liable based on their ability to exercise a degree of control at
these facilities. Various affirmative defenses are afforded to persons presumed liable, and in all cases the presumptions
of liability are rebuttable. 40 CFR 80.28(g). The affirmative defenses typically involve showing (1) that the person
did not cause the violation, (2) that they either conducted tests showing the gasoline was in compliance when they
transferred it to the next person in the distribution system, or that they received proper documentation when they
received the gasoline and conducted a sufficient quality assurance sampling and testing program. Additional elements
of an affirmative defense must be shown by refiners when a violation is detected at a branded outlet. A detailed discussion
of the reasons for the gasoline volatility liability defense provisions can be found at 54 FR 11872 (March 22, 1989).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations adopted for the reformulated gasoline program follow this same general structure. For example,
if the gasoline in a storage tank, or at any other point in the distribution system, is found to be in violation of the
requirements, then the following persons are presumed liable: All persons (including carriers) who own, lease,
operate, supervise or control the facility; all persons other than carriers who manufactured, sold, transported,
or dispensed the gasoline found at the facility; carriers who dispensed, transported, supplied or stored the gasoline
where EPA can show they caused the violation; and the refiner or importer whose brand name is displayed at the facility,
if any. They will not be deemed liable if they can show (1) they did not cause the violation, (2) that product transfer
documents indicate the gasoline in question met all relevant requirements, and (3) they conducted a sufficient quality
assurance program. Additional elements must be shown by refiners or importers for violations at branded facilities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rationale for assigning a presumption of liability to all contributors to a batch of noncomplying fuel is that,
as with gasoline volatility and the other motor vehicle fuel programs, EPA is in a particularly poor position to know
who caused a violation that is detected at a point in the distribution system. In the case of a violation found at a retail
station, for example, the retailer often will say it has no control over the quality of the gasoline delivered by the
distributor (or by more than one distributor) and did nothing to cause the violation; the distributor will say it has
no control over the quality of the gasoline provided by the terminal and did nothing to cause the violation; the terminal
will say it only supplies the gasoline received from the pipeline and did nothing to cause the violation, etc. EPA normally
lacks the information necessary to establish the cause of the violation because its inspectors were not present when
the gasoline in question moved through the distribution system; yet EPA has a sample that is, in fact, in violation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast to EPA, the parties responsible for the facility, or for supplying the gasoline contained at a facility
found to be in violation are, collectively, in the best position to determine the cause of the violation. It is these
parties who are presumed liable. The presumption of liability normally has the desired effect of forcing the presumptively
liable parties to cooperate in identifying the violation's cause, which both resolves the issue of liability for
the party or parties actually responsible for the violation and establishes defenses against liability for parties
not responsible. In addition, branded refiners or importers are presumed liable based on the degree of control such
refiners or importers have over gasoline that is sold under their brand name. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The likelihood of commingling, the absence of quantitative thresholds, the degree of control exercised by the branded
parties presumed liable, and the reasonableness of a presumption of liability for parties involved with the production
or distribution of the gasoline discovered in violation is the same for the reformulated gasoline program as it is
for the gasoline volatility and other motor vehicle fuel programs. In both cases, EPA is confronted with a fungible
gasoline distribution system, with various persons either involved with the production or distribution of the noncomplying
gasoline, or exercising some degree of control over the downstream facility where the violation was detected. In
both cases EPA is not reasonably able to locate the cause of the violation, and the regulations reasonably require
the parties involved with the noncomplying gasoline and facility to bear the burden of locating the cause of the violation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has included in the final rule liability for branded importers for violations found at facilities at which that
importers' brand name is displayed. This liability is parallel with the liability presumption that attaches to branded
refiners for violations found at branded facilities. This change from the proposed liability scheme is included
because the absence of liability for branded importers created a potential gap in the regulatory scheme. If any party
meets the definition of a branded importer, it is reasonable that they be treated equally with branded refiners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, EPA does not believe the scope of the liability provisions should be narrowed. The scope of parties presumed
liable is designed to ensure that each party in the reformulated gasoline production and distribution system with
any opportunity to affect the quality of the fuel may be held accountable for noncomplying fuel. Otherwise, the substantial
economic incentives associated with cheating under this program would result in the exploitation of gaps in the scope
of coverage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result, EPA declines to adjust the range of parties presumptively liable for commingled fuels violations or to
adjust the affirmative defenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certain commenters requested clarification of the volume of gasoline a party must contribute to a non-complying
storage tank to create the presumption of liability. EPA's April 1992 proposal would hold each party responsible
for a violation detected at a storage tank, or at any other point in the gasoline distribution system, if the party was
involved with any of the noncomplying gasoline. This would include distributors for the most recent delivery, and
in most cases would also include distributors for the several prior deliveries. See 57 FR 13471 (April 16, 1992). Commenters
requested clarification from EPA as to what was meant by ``several deliveries.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has retained the proposed language that assigns presumptive liability to any party that contributes ``any gasoline''
to the noncomplying gasoline in the batch or storage tank. There is no single 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
volume that would be appropriate in every situation. In addition, there is no single number of deliveries that would
identify the source for all noncomplying gasoline present in the batch or storage tank yielding the noncomplying
sample. EPA will evaluate the issue of non-causation as a result of a small volume contribution to a non-complying
storage tank on a case-by-case basis.

One commenter observed that a downstream party receiving noncomplying product would be obliged to store the product
until the owner of the product determines a solution. The commenter recommended that a party storing nonconforming
product that has been properly re-documented stating its actual characteristics should not be penalized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA generally agrees with this comment. The final rule prohibits, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the distribution, transportation, storage or sale (or offer to sell) of noncomplying product represented as reformulated
gasoline and intended for sale or use in any covered area. EPA will assume, absent countervailing evidence, that all
gasoline found in the United States is intended for domestic sale or use and thus subject to the reformulated gasoline
or anti-dumping rules. Countervailing evidence to overcome this assumption with regard to a specific tank of gasoline
would include a showing of the following: demonstrate that the gasoline is clearly identified as noncomplying product;
that the noncomplying gasoline is segregated from other gasoline; that the storage tank containing the gasoline
has been clearly designated as product unavailable for sale or distribution; that the noncomplying gasoline in fact
has not re-entered the distribution system; and that the gasoline is redirected toward a process of bringing the gasoline
into compliance. A party storing noncomplying gasoline meeting this burden would not be in violation of the prohibitions
contained in today's rule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Carriers. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA received a variety of comments objecting to the imposition of presumptive liability on carriers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters argued that the prohibitions contained in section 211(k)(5) of the Act identify refiners, blenders
and marketers as the regulated parties under the reformulated gasoline and anti-dumping programs, but does not specifically
name carriers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 211(k)(1) authorizes EPA to ``promulgate regulations *&blank;*&blank;* establishing requirements for
reformulated gasoline *&blank;*&blank;*.'' This broad grant of authority is the principal source of authority
for the regulatory structure adopted for the reformulated gasoline program, along with the various specific requirements
and authorizations found in other paragraphs in section 211(k). EPA has determined, in exercising this authority,
that the most appropriate structure for this program is one which provides for the regulation of reformulated gasoline
from its point of production or importation to its eventual transfer to the ultimate consumer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, EPA's experience with various other motor vehicle fuel regulations, promulgated under section 211(c) of
the Act, indicate that this is critical to the success of the program. This is based on the fungible nature of the gasoline
distribution system, the complex interrelationships between the various parties involved in producing and marketing
gasoline, and the large number of different parties that will be involved in bringing reformulated gasoline to the
market. Second, the reformulated gasoline program includes a complex mixture of requirements, involving the regulation
of several different gasoline components as well as the emissions performance of the gasoline. A cradle-to-grave
approach is necessary to ensure that the air quality benefits from this program are actually achieved in use, given
the large number of parties who will have custody or control of a batch of reformulated gasoline, and the potential
that their actions could adversely affect the emissions reductions expected from the reformulated gasoline program.
This could occur, for example, because the quality of gasoline has been changed, or because it has been dispensed or
used at an improper time or place. For these reasons, EPA believes that it is proper to regulate all parties involved
with the production, distribution and sale of reformulated gasoline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time, EPA has assigned different responsibilities to different parties in the production and distribution
system. EPA proposed and has decided to adopt final rules including carriers as a regulated party, and assigning them
responsibilities commensurate with their unique role in the gasoline distribution system. EPA believes this is
a reasonable exercise of its broad grant of authority under section 211(k)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has determined that the regulation of carriers_pipelines, barge operators or truck carriers_is necessary to
accomplish the goal of cradle-to-grave oversight monitoring and enforcement. This determination is based on the
potential for carriers to cause violations of the reformulated gasoline regulation, the need to impose a duty on carriers
to exercise care in transporting or storing reformulated gasoline, and the need for EPA to be able to determine the
source of violations within the program. For example, carriers possess the potential to cause violations of this
program by commingling inappropriate grades of gasoline, delivering conventional gasoline into a covered area,
or by carrying non-VOC controlled gasoline in a storage facility over from a non-VOC control period into a VOC control
period and selling or distributing that product. In each of these examples, the carrier would be directly responsible
for causing the violation. EPA believes that the presumption of liability proposed in the final rule effectively
imposes a duty of care on carriers to avoid these violations. Further, as discussed in the economic analysis accompanying
this final rule, the costs associated with carrier compliance are reasonable and have been designed to provide carriers
with the minimum oversight costs necessary to accomplish the goals of this program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certain carriers argue that Congress did not authorize the regulation of carriers in this program as the prohibition
found in section 211(k)(5) of the Act only applies to refiners, importers, distributors and marketers, but not carriers.
Therefore, it is argued, EPA may not regulate carriers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA disagrees with this argument. First, it misinterprets the prohibitions adopted by Congress in section 211(k)(5).
The statutory prohibitions found in that paragraph are self-effectuating once EPA promulgates regulations establishing
the requirements for certification of reformulated gasoline. Section 211(k)(5) does not limit EPA's authority
to establish various additional regulatory prohibitions, as necessary, in the exercise of EPA's rulemaking discretion
under section 211(k)(1). It also does not limit EPA's authority under section 211(k)(1) to regulate, as appropriate,
the activities of various persons in the gasoline distribution system, including carriers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In any case, EPA believes that carriers are reasonably included in the term ``marketers'' as used in section 211(k)(5).
That term is vague and ambiguous, and EPA reasonably interprets it to include all persons regulated by EPA in the reformulated
gasoline program including carriers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act does not define the term marketer for purposes of section 211(k), and while that term is used in various other
provisions of the Act, it is only defined for purposes of one unrelated provision, section 324 (involving responsibility
for gasoline vapor recovery systems at small volume retail outlets). The term generally appears to indicate a broad
category of persons involved in the gasoline distribution system, a generic phrase with a catch-all meaning. See
sections 211(h)(4), 211(1) and 211(m)(2). As used in those provisions, the scope of the term may be broader or narrower,
depending on how detailed Congress made the list of parties covered by each provision. For example, the long list of
parties referenced in section 211(h)(4) makes it clear that ``marketer'' as used there means an undefined category
of persons other than distributors, blenders, resellers, carriers, retailers, or wholesale purchaser-consumers,
while in sections 211(1) and (m)(2) the term means an undefined category of persons other than refiners. The legislative
history for section 211(k) fails to shed any light on Congress' intent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The generally accepted meaning of the term ``marketer'' is ``one that deals in a market.'' Webster's Ninth New Collegiate
Dictionary (1990). A carrier would reasonably fall within this definition. Given the lack of a clear definition in
the Act for this vague term, the indications that Congress intended it to have a somewhat broad, catch-all meaning,
and the reasons provided above supporting EPA's inclusion of carrier's as regulated parties in the reformulated
gasoline program, EPA has reasonably determined that carriers are included in the term ``marketer'' as it is used
in section 211(k) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Various commenters claimed that it was inappropriate to impose a presumption of liability on carriers, based on their
unique circumstances. They noted that carriers do not take title to or own the gasoline, have contractual obligations
to maintain the integrity of the shipment, only act in accordance with instructions from the product owner, and have
incentives to not tamper with the product, as it would expose them to liability and would prejudice their relationships
with both the shipper and purchaser. Commenters stated that carriers lack any economic incentive to violate the reformulated
gasoline requirements, and any action that does not violate these requirements is only in response to the gasoline
owner's instructions. Commenters also stated that carriers cannot refuse such instructions except for clear violations
of the law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Barge operator-carriers noted that the risk of accidental contamination for barge operator-carriers is virtually
nonexistent due to contract obligations to maintain cargo integrity and the product testing that occurs before and
after shipping. They also argued that the volume of product in a barge-tank would dilute any trace contaminants such
that there was no practical risk of a violation of the reformulated gasoline requirements from contamination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA recognizes that carriers occupy a role that is somewhat unique in the gasoline distribution system. In general,
EPA agrees that there is limited economic incentive for carriers to tamper with the quality of gasoline, in that carriers
do not own the gasoline they ship or store and would not profit by taking advantage of the price differential between
complying and noncomplying gasoline. At the same time, there are still significant opportunities for carriers to
directly cause violations of the reformulated gasoline program. For example, a carrier's delivery territory may
span a boundary between an area requiring reformulated gasoline and an area that may receive conventional gasoline.
Misdelivery of conventional fuel into the reformulated gasoline covered area would be a violation of the prohibitions
of the reformulated gasoline program. Other situations where a carrier can cause a violation include a terminal-carrier
or truck-carrier who mixes conventional gasoline and reformulated gasoline and transfers the resulting gasoline
as reformulated; who mixes reformulated gasoline designated as VOC-controlled with non-VOC-controlled gasoline
and transfers the resulting gasoline as VOC-controlled; who delivers gasoline designated for use in VOC-Control
Region 1 to a retail outlet located in VOC-Control Region 2; who mixes oxygen program reformulated gasoline (OPRG)
and non-OPRG reformulated gasoline and transfers the mixture as OPRG; or who mixes simple and complex model reformulated
gasoline. In these examples, EPA would hold the carrier liable if the carrier improperly delivered the gasoline or
mixed the gasolines that should have been segregated. Note that the gasoline owner in each of these examples also would
be presumed liable for the violation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these circumstances, the presumption of liability assigned to carriers is much more limited than that assigned
to any other regulated party. Like other parties, a carrier is liable for violations that occur at its own facility.
However, unlike other regulated parties, carriers are not liable for violations detected at other facilities, unless
EPA can show that the carrier caused the violation. This is a significant reduction in the scope of the presumption
of liability as compared to the scope proposed for carriers, and reflects EPA's balancing of the unique characteristics
noted by carriers and the need to prevent carriers from adversely affecting the characteristics of reformulated
gasoline. This parallels the presumption of liability for carriers adopted by the Agency in the gasoline volatility
regulations, and approved by the court in

EPA acknowledges that carriers may operate on the instructions of the product owner. In fact, several commenters
suggested that carriers are obligated to not deviate from the owner's instructions regardless of whether those instructions
are consistent with the reformulated gasoline rules.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 has advised EPA that carriers are not obligated to store or transport gasoline in a manner that violates applicable
laws. The ICC view of carrier obligation allows carriers to self-determine which loads they will store or carry. The
ICC also observed that a carrier's obligation to accept tenders is superseded by an obligation to comply with applicable
law, including regulations that implement the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Accordingly, carriers are not placed
in an untenable position by refusing to store or transport gasoline that does not comply with the reformulated gasoline
requirements.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A presumption of liability is necessary in the case of a carrier acting as a refiner or oxygenate blender because in
both cases the carrier plays a significant role in the actions that establish or change the quality of reformulated
gasoline. For example, the practice of splash-blending oxygenates and gasoline in gasoline delivery trucks is a
common form of gasoline blending, and the trucks used for splash blending often are operated by truck carriers. Frequently,
the carrier truck driver directly controls the volumes of gasoline blendstock and oxygenate that are combined in
the truck. In consequence, the carrier is directly responsible for the quality of the finished gasoline in such a splash-blending
operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters observed that in other fuel regulatory programs, carriers acting as refiners or oxygenate blenders are
specifically excepted from presumptive liability for violations determined at facilities downstream from the
refinery or oxygenate blending facility. This is not accurate. Carriers who meet the refiner or oxygenate blender
definition are treated the same under the reformulated gasoline regulations as under other motor vehicle fuel programs.
The definition of a ``refiner'' is consistent throughout EPA's fuel regulatory programs, and in all these programs
a carrier who meets the refiner definition is subject to the same liability as any other person who meets the refiner
definition. Oxygenate blenders are simply a sub-category of refiners who produce gasoline only by oxygenate blending.
As a result, carriers acting as oxygenate blenders are regulated consistently with any other oxygenate blender under
the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Carrier-commenters argued that the owner of the gasoline and oxygenate used in an oxygenate blending operation should
be responsible for meeting the requirements for sampling and testing, compliance record keeping, reporting and
auditing, because only the owner can remedy violations. For the reasons discussed in the refiner and oxygenate blender
section of this preamble, EPA has determined that each person who meets the oxygenate blender definition is individually
responsible for ensuring that the requirements that attach to an oxygenate blending operation are met. However,
as discussed above, carrier-oxygenate blenders and product owner-oxygenate blenders may reach agreements on the
allocation of responsibilities for meeting the oxygenate blending requirements within the scope of EPA's enforcement
discretion.

3. Defenses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule specifies that a regulated party may rebut the presumption of liability by demonstrating (1) that it
did not cause the violation, (2) that the product transfer documents account for all the gasoline in question and indicate
that the product complied with all applicable standards, and (3) that the party conducted an acceptable quality assurance
program of periodic sampling and testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When a non-complying product is found at a facility operating under a refiner's brand name, the refiner must also demonstrate
additional elements for a valid defense. This includes a showing that the violation was caused by a party in violation
of a contractual understanding imposed by the refiner to prevent such action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The defenses available to regulated parties to rebut the presumption of liability are closely patterned after those
adopted for other motor vehicle fuel regulatory programs under 40 CFR part 80, including the gasoline volatility
program. The presumption of liability is rebuttable, including the imposition of vicarious refiner liability for
violations detected at branded facilities. This regulatory structure is fully consistent with the relevant judicial
decisions in this area.

 supra. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, carriers not acting as refiners or oxygenate blenders will not be deemed presumptively liable
for violations found downstream of the carrier facility, unless EPA shows that the carrier caused the violation.
Accordingly, such carriers will not be required to present a defense to such downstream violations. However, where
a violation is found at a carrier's facility, the carrier must meet the defense elements in order to avoid liability.
Note that EPA intends to exercise its enforcement discretion to permit a carrier to rely on a properly conducted quality
assurance program undertaken by the product owner to satisfy the quality assurance program defense element. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter observed that the proposed regulations fail to account for carriers making consecutive deliveries
to reformulated gasoline and conventional gasoline markets. Such carriers may appear to have complying and non-complying
product on board, according to the commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The issue raised by this commenter applies not only to carriers, but potentially to any party who transports gasoline
(e.g., a distributor or reseller). EPA does not consider the transportation of both reformulated and conventional
gasoline in the same vehicle to be a violation provided that the destinations of the different products are proper
and documented, and the products are properly segregated. Obviously, any party in such a situation should use care
that the gasolines are not mixed and are properly delivered.

Various commenters objected to the proposal that refiners would be presumptively liable for downstream violations,

of the Constitution and

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'') and Amoco II. The commenter claimed that the presumption was in practice irrebuttable due to product fungibility
and the very high cost of testing required to avoid liability. The commenter also observed that refiners lack sufficient
control over downstream parties to lawfully impose vicarious liability on the refiner, in part due to the Petroleum
Marketing Practices Act. EPA disagrees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The defense elements established in the final rule set forth reasonably attainable criteria to rebut a presumption
of liability for violations detected downstream of a refinery. The final rule provides that refiners must demonstrate:
(1) That the refiner did not cause the violation; (2) that product transfer documents account for all of the gasoline
found in violation and indicate that the gasoline met relevant requirements; and (3) that the refinery has conducted
a quality assurance sampling and testing program. Where the violation is found at a facility carrying the refiner's
brand name, the refiner must show, in addition, that the violation was caused by: (1) An act in violation of law; (2)
or an action in violation of a contractual obligation imposed by the refiner; or, (3) the action of a carrier or other
distributor not subject to a contract with the refiner but engaged by the refiner for the transportation of gasoline,
despite specification or inspection of procedures and equipment by the refiner reasonably calculated to prevent
such action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Addressing the above defense elements seriatim, EPA believes the information necessary to demonstrate that the
refiner did not cause a violation determined downstream is reasonably within the control of a refiner through review
of its production testing and shipping records. Further, refineries may reasonably provide in contracts with downstream
parties for the refiner to conduct quality assurance sampling and testing at the downstream facility. Such testing
would be limited to determining that maximum/ minimum and other applicable standards are met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Branded refiners, as discussed elsewhere in this preamble, are held to a more stringent standard for establishing
a defense to downstream violations due to the enhanced control such refiners have over branded downstream parties.
First, EPA anticipates that a brand refiner is able to exercise sufficient control over its downstream affiliates
so as to prevent any violation other than one arising from a violation of law (other than a violation of this final rule).
EPA also anticipates that a branded refiner will possess contractual leverage to be able to impose contractual obligations
on downstream parties necessary to assure that violations will not occur under the terms of the contract. Finally,
EPA anticipates that a brand refiner will possess contractual leverage to impose handling requirements on non-brand
carriers or other distributors not subject to the refiner's brand but engaged by the refiner for the transportation
of gasoline, and to allow specification or inspection of procedures and equipment by the refiner reasonably calculated
to prevent such action. As with branded downstream parties, EPA believes that a conservative quality assurance program
will deter violations downstream of the refiner by creating an atmosphere of oversight presence and quality assurance
by the refiner. Further, EPA believes that quality assurance is in the refiner's self-interest in guaranteeing the
quality of its product in the market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that downstream quality assurance requirements might adversely affect the positions of
independent distributors by allowing branded refiners to tighten up on contracts with the independents and force
them out of the market. However, EPA believes that most distributors will conduct quality assurance programs regardless
of any involvement by branded refiners, because of the distributor's potential for liability for violations that
exists independent of the refiner's liability, and because most distributors are concerned about product quality
for reasons that are independent of the reformulated gasoline requirements. As a result, EPA does not believe that
contractual provisions requiring quality assurance imposed by branded refiners constitute a significant additional
burden on distributors. Moreover, the defense provisions related to branded refiners requires contracts only with
branded resellers or retailers. As a result, refiners are not required to impose contractual quality assurance provisions
on distributors who are not identified with the refiner's brand name.

EPA believes that the result of the final rule's liability and defense scheme is that refiners who maintain careful
compliance with this rule and conduct an appropriate quality assurance program over their branded facilities, including
periodic sampling and testing, will not be held inequitably liable for violations caused by downstream parties who
display the refiner's brand name. Because many of these elements of defense call for the refiner to exercise precaution
through normal contractual instruments, EPA anticipates that the cost of these measures will be minimal and consistent
with the costs and expenses experienced in the gasoline volatility and lead phasedown programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rebuttable presumption of liability in the reformulated gasoline program is consistent with the holdings in
Amoco I and Amoco II. The liability provision of the unleaded gasoline regulations that was challenged in Amoco I and
held by the Court to be improper imposed strict vicarious liability on parties upstream of a retail facility at which
a violation had been determined. The Amoco I court held that any presumption of liability must be rebuttable. Amoco
II held that a presumption of refiner liability must be rebuttable for violations resulting from the sale of leaded
gasoline as unleaded by retail facilities owned and leased by the refiner. As a result of the Amoco I and Amoco II decisions,
the unleaded gasoline regulations were revised to allow refiners to rebut a presumption of liability even where the
refiner owned or leased a retail outlet found in violation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All presumptions of liability contained in the reformulated gasoline regulations are rebuttable. As in other 40
CFR part 80 fuels programs (unleaded gasoline, volatility, and diesel sulfur), the final reformulated gasoline
rule provides for more stringent refiner defense elements in the case of a violation at a facility displaying that
refiner's brand name, as opposed to a case where the facility in violation does not display the refiner's brand name.
Nevertheless, the final regulations provide that the refiner in such a brand-name-facility case may rebut a presumption
of vicarious liability by showing that the violation was caused by a party other than the refiner. Accordingly, the
final rule does not create strict vicarious liability by any party, and is consistent with the teachings of Amoco I
and Amoco II. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that a retailer could prove the first retailer defense element (that the retailer did not cause
the violation) only by proving the second retailer defense element (that product transfer documents that meet relevant
requirements account for all gasoline purchased and sold by the retailer), and therefore the element should be deleted.
EPA agrees that one of the most common ways retailers show non-causation is by identifying the source of all gasoline
present at the retail outlet, and showing that this product was represented by the distributor(s) or reseller(s)
to meet all relevant requirements. In enforcing other motor vehicle fuels programs where retailers have often used
this type of evidence to proffer a defense, however, EPA's experience has been that retailers are rarely found to be
ultimately liable unless the retailer made decisions to commingle gasolines in the retail tank that should have been
segregated. It is possible that a retailer's proferring of product transfer documents may be inadequate to establish
a complete defense to an allegation of a violation. For instance, the retailer may have knowledge, independent of
the product transfer documents, that should lead the retailer to understand that the gasoline's qualities are not
as represented on the documents. In such a circumstance, the retailer would be required to show by means other than
the documents that it did not cause the violation. Accordingly, the elements of defense for a retailer may overlap,
and as a result are not redundant. The adequacy of a defense will be determined on a case-by-case basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter objected that a party would have to test gasoline received by the party following each receipt, and test
the gasoline delivered to other parties following each delivery, in order to absolutely prove the party did not cause
a violation for which the party could be presumptively liable. EPA agrees that the most conclusive proof for non-causation
for any possible allegation of liability would be test results of the type described by the commenter. In fact, this
is the type of testing that commonly is carried out by the parties where large volumes of gasoline are involved. Refiners
and importers conduct such testing of the gasoline they produce or import, as do other parties such as pipelines and
terminals when receiving or shipping large-sized batches of gasoline. In situations where the volume of gasoline
received or shipped/delivered is small, EPA does not anticipate that every-batch testing is needed to show non-causation.
EPA believes that parties who deal in small-sized gasoline batches are able to effectively monitor the quality of
gasoline received and shipped/delivered and establish the cause of violations that occur through careful attention
to program requirements, discretion in the selection of business partners, and good quality control practices including
a program of periodic sampling and testing. This belief by EPA is based on its experience in enforcing other motor vehicle
fuels programs.

One commenter stated that the requirement of a quality assurance program in addition to all other testing and audit
requirements, is redundant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that quality assurance sampling and testing is essential so that there is an incentive for parties to
adequately monitor the quality of gasoline received and shipped/delivered. The principal purpose of quality assurance
sampling and testing, in EPA's view, is to alert a party to gasoline quality problems so that the party may correct the
problem and the conditions that caused the problem before EPA documents any violations. Other enforcement mechanisms
that are included in the reformulated gasoline program are important for their own reasons, but EPA does not believe
they eliminate the need for sampling and testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the existence of an adequate quality assurance program is a separate element of the defense to a presumption
of liability because EPA does not feel confident that a party did not cause a violation absent such evidence. For example,
even if one party can show that another party was the apparent or primary cause of a downstream violation, that does
not on its own show that the first party did not also cause the violation. The fungible nature of the gasoline distribution
system could well lead to situations where more than one and perhaps several parties contributed to a violation detected
downstream. Absent a sufficient quality assurance program, production of proper transfer records, and any other
evidence needed to show that the first party did not cause the violation, EPA does not believe that the first party has
properly rebutted the presumption of liability. A quality assurance program, which involves sampling and testing
the gasoline while it is in the hands of a party, is reasonably considered a necessary, minimum element of properly
showing that a party did not cause a violation and thereby rebutting a presumption of liability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Refiners, importers and oxygenate blenders are required to conduct sampling and testing under the regulations,
as well as have independent audits performed. For those parties, the required sampling and testing may well satisfy
the quality assurance element of a defense to presumptive liability and is therefore not redundant. For those parties
it only calls for additional sampling and testing where the required sampling and testing would not be adequate to
satisfy that element of the defense. For all other parties, the quality assurance element of a defense is not redundant
as there is no required sampling and testing for other parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, sampling and testing by parties other than refiners, importers, and oxygenate blenders is not required
by the final rule, but rather is a voluntary defense element only. If a party believes that no violations will occur
as a result of other program requirements, the party could choose to avoid a quality assurance sampling and testing
program. Such a decision would, however, increase the risk of violation attributable to the party. Without a quality
assurance sampling and testing program a party would have scant basis for knowing if the gasoline it receives and ships
or delivers meets standards. In addition, in the event the party's confidence is misplaced and EPA documents a violation
for which the party is presumed liable, the party would be unable to establish a defense against that liability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter requested that EPA define the frequency of sampling and testing that EPA would consider sufficient to
satisfy the quality assurance defense element. Another commenter recommended that EPA should base enforcement
actions exclusively on EPA testing using regulatory test methods and not on oversight sampling and testing by regulated
parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is reluctant to specify the details of a ``sufficient'' quality assurance sampling and testing program, because
the type of program that is sufficient in any situation depends on the particular facts of that situation. In addition,
EPA believes regulated parties are closest to their own operations and are therefore in the best position to judge
the program that is adequate. Typically, such a program should include sampling and testing of a representative sampling
of the gasoline the party receives and ships or delivers; identification of any sample that is in violation of relevant
standards, and for such a sample, correction of the violation and the conditions that caused the violation; and an
increased rate of sampling and testing when conditions indicate an increased likelihood of violations (e.g., violating
samples found). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case where a violation is detected through a party's quality assurance program, and the party corrects both
the violation and the conditions that caused the violation without any involvement by EPA, EPA generally forgoes
any enforcement on the basis of the party's test results. If the party does not follow-up on violations in this manner,
however, EPA may initiate an enforcement action on the basis of the party's test results.

Carrier-commenters objected to the quality assurance sampling and testing defense element as applied to carriers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA recognizes that the term ``carrier'' covers an array of carriage and distribution operations. Pipelines, barge
operations, ship operations, tank trucks, and storage facilities may all meet the definition of a carrier. Each type
of carrier has unique capacities for conducting quality assurance sampling and testing programs. For instance,
pipelines, barge and ship carriers, and storage facilities typically deal with large volumes of gasoline. EPA believes
that these high volume operations already conduct sampling and testing programs during the normal course of business
that normally will satisfy the quality assurance defense element. In fact, commenters observed that barge carriers
typically sample and test loads both before and after shipment to ensure the integrity of their product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The unique circumstances of tank truck carriers have been considered in the final rule. Truck carriers, like other
carriers, will be asked to present evidence of a quality assurance program only where EPA documents a violation at
the carrier's facility.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition, truck carriers may rely on a properly conducted quality assurance program carried out by another party
over the carrier's operation (most likely the product owner). Moreover, quality assurance sampling involving gasoline
delivery trucks may be accomplished using samples collected at retail stations following truck deliveries (discussed
more fully above), providing carriers with additional flexibility in meeting this defense element. It is also relevant
that under the existing gasoline volatility and diesel sulfur programs carriers, including truck carriers, are
required to conduct quality assurance sampling and testing in order to establish a defense for violations. As a result,
the carrier quality assurance defense element in the reformulated gasoline program is merely an extension of the
carriers' current quality assurance responsibilities.

Carriers are liable under two circumstances: when a violation is found at the carrier's facility, and where EPA shows
the carrier caused a violation found elsewhere. The quality assurance defense element would have application only
in the first circumstance, however, because in a case where EPA establishes the carrier caused a violation the carrier
would not be able to establish a defense even if the carrier conduced a quality assurance program.

EPA intends to exercise its enforcement discretion to provide carriers with flexibility to satisfy the quality assurance
sampling and testing defense element if another party, most likely the product owner, carries out an adequate sampling
and testing program over the gasoline stored or transported by the carrier. The product owner is required to conduct
a quality assurance program in order to establish a defense against its own liability, so that an arrangement between
the carrier and the product owner in this regard would be little additional burden for the product owner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Carriers also may seek contractual indemnification from the product owner against liability for violations detected
at the carrier's facility. EPA believes that the traditional allocation of risk through contract is an appropriate
method for carriers to safeguard their interests within the fuel distribution system. Contractual indemnification
combined with a contractual commitment by the product owner to carry out an effective quality assurance sampling
and testing program would provide a carrier with reasonable protection against financial exposure for liability
for violations for which the carrier is not responsible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

EPA has analyzed the costs associated with voluntary carrier sampling and testing. First year per-party costs
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 are calculated to be approximately $2,672 for pipelines, $1,042 for truckers acting as oxygenate blenders, and $517
for other truckers. Costs during 1996 and 1997 are estimated at $2,437, $673 and $480, respectively. Moreover, EPA
assumes that many of these costs will be shared among carriers and the owners of the product. EPA has concluded that
these costs are reasonable given the importance of the quality assurance program to the success of the reformulated
gasoline program.

First year costs include: analyzing RFG regulatory provisions; planning activities; training; field testing for
conventional gasoline marker; sampling and testing for reform properties (though this is partially a customary
and usual business practice by virtue of required testing for RVP and oxygenates for federal and state programs).
Pipelines already routinely test for other properties as well.

4. Alternative Enforcement Options 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters offered alternatives to EPA's proposed enforcement scheme. The alternatives proposed include:
EPA should rely on cease and desist orders; EPA should only presume liability where a violation is found and allow private
contract law to insure the violator against upstream causation; EPA should require willful and knowing negligence
for vicarious refiner liability; and EPA should impose sampling and testing requirements on all tank truck carriers,
even if sampling and testing is already performed by an upstream party for the carrier, to avoid economic advantage
over for-hire carriers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has considered these alternative enforcement schemes and has determined to implement the scheme as proposed
or modified and discussed above. This enforcement scheme is unified, consistent with EPA's enforcement in the gasoline
volatility, diesel sulfur and lead phasedown programs, and focusses enforcement attention at the points in the distribution
system where the pollution forming potential of gasolines may be affected by parties in the manufacturing and/or
distribution process. A stringent compliance oversight and enforcement program, as described in detail in the final
rule and this preamble, is necessitated by the significant financial incentives that exist for parties to not comply.
EPA's experience in the lead phasedown and gasoline volatility programs has been that financial incentives will
result in cheating and that a vigorous enforcement presence will result in diminished incidence of non-compliance.
Accordingly, EPA believes that an enforcement program relying on cease and desist orders alone for encouraging compliance
by parties would not be effective in deterring violations and would fail to remove economic incentives for non-compliance.
Further, EPA believes that reliance on private contract law to insure the violator against upstream causation would
be ineffective in providing for maximum compliance due to the uncertainty of the resolution of contract disputes
and the amenability of such disputes to resolution for reasons other than the interests of compliance with the Clean
Air Act. Also, EPA has determined not to require willful and knowing negligence for vicarious refiner liability due
to the difficulty of establishing knowledge and due to EPA's belief that such a requirement would ease the obligation
of refiners to strictly monitor the quality of their product as it is distributed. Finally, EPA has created a system
of sampling and testing that creates the most thorough oversight scheme necessary while avoiding unnecessary redundancies.
The regulations require each party to conduct sampling and testing at appropriate points in the distribution system.
However, as discussed above, EPA will exercise its enforcement discretion so as to allow parties the flexibility
to jointly assume responsibility for the accomplishment of required testing. This exercise of enforcement discretion
is intended to avoid redundancies. EPA cannot justify the imposition of unnecessary sampling and testing on the regulated
community to alter economic advantages associated with this program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's regulations prescribe the procedures for establishing 1990 baselines for refiners and importers. Compliance
with the anti-dumping standards is measured by comparison to these baselines. In addition, during the period 1995
through 1997, the reformulated gasoline emissions standards are based in part on maximum parameter levels measured
against these baselines. Section 211(k)(8) provides for refiners, blenders or importers to determine individual
1990 baselines predicated on adequate and reliable data. In the absence of such adequate and reliable data, Congress
prescribed a summertime baseline and mandated that the Administrator would establish a wintertime baseline.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule provides mechanisms for establishing accurate and verifiable refinery baselines, while avoiding
options that might provide incentives for the regulated community to ``game'' the baseline-setting process. These
two principles that underlie the baseline-setting mechanisms (accurate, verifiable, and no opportunity for ``gaming'')
serve the environmental purpose of ensuring that the quality of gasoline used in the United States beginning in 1995
is properly compared with the quality of the gasoline used in the United States in 1990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to January 1, 1995, all conventional gasoline marketed in the U.S. will be subject to emission standards
established with reference to an individual baseline. Between January 1, 1995 and January 1, 1998, all reformulated
gasoline marketed in the U.S. also will be subject to standards established with reference to an individual baseline.
The consequence of a baseline-setting mechanism that would result in baselines that, overall, are less stringent
than 1990 average gasoline quality, would be that the environmental benefits intended for reformulated and conventional
gasoline beginning in 1995 would not be achieved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If refiners had the option of presenting the data necessary to establish an individual refinery baseline, or being
assigned the anti-dumping statutory baseline, each refiner's choice would be clear. Each refiner would calculate
whether the individual baseline or the statutory baseline is more stringent for that refiner, and would simply select
the least stringent option. In consequence, if parties were given more than one regulatory option to establish a baseline,
the cumulative effect of each individual refiner's exercise of the baseline-setting option would be that the environmental
benefits intended for reformulated and conventional gasoline would not be achieved. Accordingly, EPA has avoided
providing options within the baseline-setting scheme.

2. Required Individual Baselines_Domestic Refiners 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's final rule provides for a scheme to establish refinery baselines for domestic refiners that avoids giving parties
options, and within this no-option constraint, that uses the best available data in setting baselines. As a general
approach, parties are required to establish individual baselines using actual 1990 data (Method 1). However, EPA
does not anticipate that many domestic refiners will have all the data necessary to establish an individual baseline
based entirely on actual 1990 data. Therefore, where the actual 1990 data is not available, the baseline provisions
provide for the modelling of 1990 parameters (Methods 2 and 3). These models are based on the absence of ``first choice''
1990 data, and require that the affected party provide the ``next best'' data available from production subsequent
to 1990 to establish a modelled accurate baseline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Domestic refiners are not permitted an option to revert to the use of Methods 2 and 3. Rather, refiners are required
to use Method 1 if actual 1990 data is available. If the Method 1 data are not available, refiners are required to use
Method 2, and if Method 2 data are not available, refiners are required to use Method 3. Domestic refiners are not permitted
an option to use the statutory baseline. Domestic refiners are required to use independent commercial auditors to
certify the accuracy and the availability (or non-availability) of data for any of the baseline setting methods,
and to assure the proper application of those methods. This scheme does not give domestic refiners any choice in the
manner in which baselines are set, thus avoiding the potential for ``gaming'' by individual refiners. Moreover,
EPA is easily able to conduct enforcement audits of the baseline submissions of domestic refiners. In consequence,
EPA believes that this scheme will result in the establishment of an accurate representation of the actual U.S. 1990
baseline gasoline fuel properties from domestic refiners. This baseline setting scheme is discussed in detail in
Section VIII of this preamble.

3. Baselines_Importers of Foreign Gasoline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule provides that importers of gasoline must establish an individual baseline using actual 1990 gasoline
characteristics (Method 1). Where actual 1990 data are not available, however, an approach that is different than
the approach used for domestic refiners is necessary. In the absence of actual 1990 data, an importer is required to
use the anti-dumping statutory baseline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Importers are not permitted to use Methods 2 or 3 because often it is simply not technically feasible to model an importer's
1990 baseline from gasoline imported during the years subsequent to 1990, for the following reasons. The foreign
sources and production processes underlying an importer's post-1990 gasoline will have changed for most importers
from those sources and processes underlying the importer's 1990 product. The model Methods are not designed to factor
in such changes. In addition, it is exceedingly difficult to establish the refinery-of-origin of discrete products,
due in part to the fact that foreign gasoline from different foreign refineries often is subject to fungible mixing
prior to arrival at the U.S.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
67
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Accordingly, both the importers and EPA would be unable to verify the accuracy or reliability of an importer's modelled
baseline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

In discussions with representatives of the U.S. Customs Service, EPA has been informed that the Customs Service has
found it is virtually impossible to trace a batch of gasoline from point of entry in the U.S. back to the country of origin.
Country of origin for gasoline is relevant for Customs purposes because import tariffs on gasoline differ depending
on whether the country of origin has most-favored-nation trade status. To the extent the Customs Service is unable
to verify even the country of origin of gasoline, the refinery of origin would be even more difficult to verify. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of the technical infeasibility of the application of Methods 2 and 3 to importers (change of gasoline source-refiners
between 1990 and later years, and inability to track refinery-of-origin generally), and lack of adequate enforcement,
all importers that are unable to produce actual 1990 production values are required to revert to the anti-dumping
statutory baseline. In addition, EPA anticipates that most importers lack the actual 1990 testing data necessary
for establishing a baseline using Method 1. As a result, EPA expects most importers will be assigned the anti-dumping
statutory baseline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA considered giving foreign refiners, as opposed to importers, the option of either setting individual baselines
using Methods 1, 2, and 3, or of being assigned the anti-dumping statutory baseline. This approach is flawed, however,
because of the gaming opportunity it would give foreign refiners. As discussed above, such a gaming opportunity would
result in an overall quality of gasoline in 1995 and thereafter that would fail to achieve the environmental goals
intended for reformulated and conventional gasoline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A foreign refiner with an actual baseline dirtier than the statutory baseline would prefer to continue to produce
to that baseline. However, a foreign refiner with an actual baseline cleaner than the statutory baseline would prefer
to produce to the less stringent statutory baseline. Accordingly, the incentives to game the program would result
in the average quality of gasoline imported to the U.S. being skewed to produce dirtier gasoline than the statutory
baseline. Foreign refiners would collectively exceed the U.S. average gasoline parameters, resulting in dirtier
U.S. air.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA also considered whether it would be feasible to apply the same baseline-setting approach used for domestic refiners
to foreign refiners directly, i.e., that any foreign refiner would be required to establish an individual baseline
using Methods 1, 2, or 3. Under this approach, any foreign refiner, like any domestic refiner, who is unable to establish
the quality of its 1990 US-market gasoline would be barred from supplying gasoline for use within the United States
beginning in 1995. This approach would be consistent with the guiding themes for baseline-setting: That parties
not have options in setting baseline levels, and that within this constraint that the baselines are set using the best
available data. Application of this baseline-setting approach to foreign refiners is problematic, however.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Foreign refiner use of the general scheme using Methods 1, 2 and 3 would require that the foreign refiner must have actual
test data for the portion of its production destined for U.S. markets, or in the alternative, foreign refiners would
have to model the 1990 quality of their U.S. product based on post-1990 gasoline quality data and refinery configuration
information. EPA believes that most foreign refiners lack the information necessary to establish their 1990 U.S.
market gasoline under either Method 1, 2 or 3. Most (if not all) foreign refiners, like domestic refiners, did not collect
adequate data in 1990 to use Method 1. In addition, Methods 2 and 3 generally are inappropriate for use by foreign refiners
for technical reasons, in that Methods 2 and 3 model the quality of overall refinery gasoline production, not the quality
of a portion of refinery production. The overall quality of gasoline from a refinery may bear scant resemblance to
the quality of the portion going to the U.S. market. Accordingly, Methods 2 and 3 normally will not work for refineries
that ship only a portion of their production to the U.S. market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that it is inappropriate to require the use of Methods 2 and 3 baselines when these Methods will not work
properly for some or most foreign refiners, and when the consequence of such a failure would be to bar the foreign refiner
from importing gasoline into the U.S. Therefore, in order to create a non-optional baseline setting approach for
foreign refiners, EPA determined to regulate their gasolines through domestic importers as described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the technical difficulties inherent in applying baseline-setting Methods 2 and 3 to importers and
foreign refiners, and the potential for gaming that would result from optional use of these Methods, EPA is concerned
that it would be unable to carry out a consistently effective compliance monitoring and enforcement program of foreign
refinery baselines set using these Methods, with the result that the accuracy of foreign refinery baselines would
not be ensured.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is a fundamental distinction between EPA's ability to monitor and enforce regulatory requirements that would
apply against domestic as opposed to foreign refiners. Simply put, domestic refiners are subject to the full panoply
of EPA's regulatory jurisdiction and compliance monitoring, while not all foreign refiners desiring to produce
reformulated and/or conventional gasoline may be subject to EPA's regulatory jurisdiction with equivalent certainty.
Compliance monitoring and enforcement are integral to the establishment of accurate and verifiable baselines,
as well as subsequent compliance with standards based on these baselines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reformulated gasoline program compliance monitoring and enforcement scheme consists of several elements designed
in the aggregate to ensure that the environmental goals of the Clean Air Act are met, including, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: baseline-setting audits; mandatory reporting and record keeping; independent laboratory sampling and testing;
tracking of product from point of production to point of distribution; unannounced EPA compliance inspections;
annual attest engagements by certified professionals; and an enforcement scheme comprised of civil penalties,
injunctive relief, and criminal sanctions. Domestic refiners and importers are subject to EPA jurisdiction in each
of these activities; all foreign refiners may not be equally amenable to EPA jurisdiction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Domestic refiners, required to establish individual baselines using actual or inferred 1990 production values
(Methods 1, 2 and/or 3), are required to have baseline parameter determination methodology and resulting values
verified by an EPA-certified auditor. However, foreign refiners, like all foreign corporations and citizens, enjoy
protected status under the laws of their national jurisdiction and are not equally amenable to EPA audits of refiner
baselines.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA has experienced difficulty in other mobile source regulatory programs, including the foreign automotive certificate
of conformity program, in gaining entry to foreign countries to conduct compliance inspections and therefore believes
similar problems could arise under the reformulated gasoline program.

A commenter suggested that diplomatic instruments may be available to mitigate EPA's concerns with access to foreign
refineries for baseline certification and compliance monitoring and oversight. However, EPA has not been presented
with a model instrument that guarantees such access over time. In contrast, EPA does have guaranteed access to domestic
refineries and importers through authority provided in the Act and its implementing regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, EPA is unaware of any current diplomatic instruments which would provide EPA with assurances of oversight

EPA has considered whether one or more foreign refiners may be able to devise a diplomatic instrument sufficient to
guarantee EPA's certified auditors and inspectors access to conduct baseline verification audits and compliance
oversight and enforcement inspections. However, the foreign supply of gasoline (conventional and ultimately reformulated
gasolines) to the U.S. currently depends on imports from numerous foreign sources. EPA believes it unlikely that
all current (or foreseeable future) foreign suppliers of gasoline will be able to provide adequate diplomatic guarantees
for EPA access.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The environmental benefits of the reformulated gasoline program depend on EPA's receipt of accurate and verifiable
reports from regulated parties, and EPA's ability to review the data possessed by the regulated community that underlies
the reports, or in the alternative, EPA's ability to seek civil, criminal and professional sanctions against domestic
corporate officers and professionals engaged in maintaining records or submitting reports and audits to the U.S.
government. However, in the case of foreign refineries, EPA does not have the authority for oversight of the record
keeping and reporting process that is equivalent to EPA's authority over domestic refiners and possible sanctions
are not equally available to ensure accurate reports by foreign parties. Again, EPA believes it unlikely that all
foreign governments desiring to import reformulated or conventional gasoline to the U.S. would either consent or
be able to provide adequate assurance of foreign reporters' amenability to EPA legal process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The integrity of the reformulated gasoline program is also affected by EPA's ability to verify the baseline that applies
to each batch of gasoline produced domestically or imported. The baseline of a gasoline batch establishes the standard
against which compliance for that batch will be measured.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of gasoline produced domestically, baselines are set at the refinery; any gasoline produced at a refinery
and intended for the domestic market is subject to that refinery's baseline. As a result, tracking of gasoline to its
refinery-of-origin is not necessary in the case of domestically-produced gasoline.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If foreign refinery-specific baselines were applied to imported gasolines, however, it would be necessary to identify
the refinery-of-origin for all imported gasoline. This type of identification often would be very difficult or impossible.
At the time gasoline arrives by ship at a U.S. port of entry, the gasoline has no inherent quality that would identify
either the refinery at which the gasoline was produced or the baseline that properly applies to the gasoline. The only
mechanism available for correlating any imported gasoline with the refinery-of-origin is the paperwork that accompanies
the gasoline. EPA's ability to verify the accuracy of such paperwork is extremely limited. Gasoline produced by a
foreign refinery may trade hands or be intermixed with other product several times before entering the United States.
EPA lacks the ability to accurately and readily determine the refinery-of-origin based solely on the documentation
of fuel transactions and shipments through myriad distribution parties and routes outside the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If foreign refinery baselines were allowed, EPA would have no recourse other than to rely on the import paperwork that
is supplied by the importer for purposes of identifying the baseline applicable for imported gasoline. EPA would
have little or no means of detecting, documenting, or proving any cheating in the form of misstating the refinery-of-origin
and thereby the applicable baseline for imported gasoline. EPA would therefore lack the ability to monitor the compliance
of foreign refineries with individual baselines. Accordingly, EPA has determined to abide by its proposal to focus
regulation of foreign gasoline on domestic importers of product over which EPA does enjoy enforcement jurisdiction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Domestic refiners and importers are subject to unannounced compliance inspections by EPA. Foreign refiners, by
virtue of their sovereign protected status, are not equally subject to unannounced inspections. Again, the environmental
and public health benefits arising from an austere compliance monitoring program are not as readily available with
respect to foreign refiners.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Domestic refiners and importers are subject to a panoply of enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance with the
Clean Air Act. EPA may seek civil or criminal penalties or injunctive relief within the U.S. judicial system and be
assured that judgments will be enforced. Judicial remedies are essential to EPA's enforcement of a regulatory program
in which significant economic incentives exist to produce non-complying product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, U.S. judicial jurisdiction may not fully and easily extend to foreign refiners. EPA's ability to exercise
enforcement measures against foreign refiners is uncertain, at best. For example, in an EPA motor vehicle recall
administrative action against a foreign automobile manufacturer, the manufacturer argued EPA lacked jurisdiction
and refused to accept service or comply with administrative discovery requirements in a manner that would not be possible
by a domestic automobile manufacturer. Accordingly, EPA has determined to focus its regulatory authority on domestic
importers of foreign gasoline which are amenable to U.S. legal process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, EPA has considered all proposed baseline-setting alternatives for foreign gasolines to the final rule
and has determined that the rule issued today is necessary to protect the quality of U.S. air and public health. Further,
the baseline setting scheme promulgated today is the least restrictive scheme available to ensure that the goals
of the Clean Air Act are achieved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is aware that the baseline approach adopted today for foreign refiners is the result of EPA's concerns over a variety
of technical and enforcement issues related to the importation of gasoline.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One foreign refiner commenter to the 1992 SNPRM objected to this baseline-setting scheme on the grounds that some
domestic refiners may receive baselines dirtier than the statutory baseline due to their ability to use actual or
inferred 1990 production values, while most importers, and therefore foreign refiners, would be subject to the statutory
baseline and would not enjoy an opportunity to use an individual baseline dirtier than the statutory baseline.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This would occur because it is unlikely that domestic importers that do not own foreign refineries maintained records
of 1990 imported gasoline characteristics adequate to establish an individual baseline. The commenter recommended
that foreign refiners be permitted to establish individual baselines using Methods 1, 2 and/or 3 to establish their
baselines.

 This issue is primarily of concern to foreign refiners whose actual 1990 production characteristics exceed the statutory
baseline.

EPA gave serious consideration to this comment, and in the 1993 SNPRM described the concerns raised by the comment
and the alternatives suggested by the commenter, and invited comment on the issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the 1993 SNPRM several commenters objected to providing foreign refineries with individual baselines
on the grounds that such baselines would promote gaming of the system, thereby reducing the air quality benefits sought
under the Act, and would provide foreign refiners with a competitive advantage. Because foreign refiners do not have
to comply with the reformulated gasoline program's anti-dumping provisions for conventional gasoline sold outside
of the U.S., the commenters alleged that foreign refiners can produce reformulated gasoline at lower overall cost.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other comments were received that supported the granting of foreign refinery baselines, on the grounds that such
baselines would enhance competition among gasoline suppliers within domestic US markets, to the advantage of the
public generally.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes the comments related to any competitive consequences of baselines are irrelevant. As a result, EPA has
rejected all comments relating to competitive concerns, and EPA's decisions regarding the manner in which baselines
are set are not influenced by such considerations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant comments on this issue, EPA has determined to implement the baseline provisions
described above. The detriment to the U.S. environment associated with the potential establishment of inaccurate
refinery baselines by current and possibly future foreign sources of imported gasoline, along with the difficulties
associated with monitoring compliance with the anti-dumping and reformulated gasoline programs, compel the Agency
to require that domestic importers establish individual baselines using Method 1 or that they comply with the anti-dumping
statutory baseline, and to not establish individual baselines for foreign refiners. This scheme is consistent with
the scheme of requiring refiners, domestic or foreign, to measure compliance against an accurate and verifiable
baseline that is based on adequate and reliable data. The approach is also consistent with EPA's intent to avoid the
creation of options within the baseline setting scheme that would allow gaming by the regulated community. Further,
the scheme is consistent with EPA's compliance monitoring and enforcement capacity.

5. U.S. Energy Security

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter suggested that requiring foreign refiners to produce to the statutory baseline would result in a shortfall
of imported gasolines to the U.S. EPA's analysis indicates that gasoline supplies will be unaffected by implementation
of the proposed baseline requirements. This conclusion is based on the likelihood that the baseline proposal would
at most result in a small change in gasoline imports in limited markets, combined with the excess domestic refining
capacity, and the expansion of gasoline volume that will result from the oxygenate use mandated for domestic gasoline.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA concludes that the baseline provisions adopted today pose no significant problem for U.S. energy security.

6. Date the Complex Model Becomes Mandatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter notes that the individual baseline issue is only pertinent to the years during which gasoline may be
produced under the simple model for determining gasoline characteristics. Beginning in 1998, when the complex model
becomes mandatory, the commenter correctly points out, all reformulated gasoline will be required to achieve specified
reductions from the statutory baseline. Accordingly, the commenter observes, individual baselines for foreign
refineries are only critical during the years the simple model is relevant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the refinery/importer individual baseline will continue to be relevant beyond application of the simple
model due to its application to conventional gasoline through the anti-dumping requirements. As a result, if individual
foreign refinery baselines were allowed, the difficulties described above would persist in perpetuity. Accordingly,
the feasibility of the baseline setting scheme established today will have longstanding effect on the viability
of the reformulated gasoline and anti-dumping program.

K. Date Reformulated Gasoline Requirements Begin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 211(k)(5) prohibits the sale or dispensing of conventional gasoline in any covered area beginning on January
1, 1995. In order to implement this timing mandate, EPA proposed that the reformulated gasoline requirements would
apply at all locations beginning on January 1, 1995. EPA now believes that it is necessary for the reformulated gasoline
requirements to apply at facilities upstream of the retail outlet level beginning on December 1, 1994, in order for
facilities at the retail level to have reformulated gasoline beginning on January 1, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the gasoline volatility program (40 CFR 80.27&hyph;80.28), the volatility standards apply at facilities
upstream of the retail outlet level beginning on May 1 of each year, and at all facilities including retail outlets
and wholesale purchaser-consumers beginning on June 1 of each year.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
70
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This regulatory approach provides a one month lead-time during which the gasoline being dispensed at terminals meets
the summertime volatility standard, in order to ``turn over'' the gasoline in retail level storage tanks to meet the
summertime volatility standard before June 1. As a result of this timing requirement for gasoline volatility, almost
all retail outlets achieve the summertime volatility standard by June 1 through the normal cycle of gasoline deliveries.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 The end of the volatility control season each year is September 15 at all facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In contrast to this favorable experience under the gasoline volatility program, during implementation of the diesel
sulfur program (40 CFR 80.29&hyph;80.30) retailers and wholesale purchaser-consumers had significant difficulties
complying with the new requirements at the beginning of that program on October 1, 1993. The diesel sulfur regulations
did not require facilities upstream of the retail level to have low sulfur diesel fuel in place well before October
1, 1993, and many terminals did not meet the low sulfur standard until very shortly before October 1. As a result, a large
number of retail outlets and wholesale purchaser-consumers were not able to obtain low sulfur diesel fuel in advance
of the October 1, 1993 date when all facilities were required to meet the low sulfur diesel standard. In consequence
of this situation in some areas of the country prices of low sulfur diesel fuel rose 30
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=8 f=1 -->
&cent;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 to 40
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=8 f=1 -->
&cent;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 over the cost of high sulfur diesel fuel. As a result, EPA was compelled to grant retailers and wholesale purchaser
consumers additional time after October 1 to come into compliance with the diesel sulfur standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that unless a lead-time is mandated under the reformulated gasoline program, the January 1, 1995 commencement
will result in the same supply difficulties that occurred under diesel sulfur, and retailers and wholesale purchaser
consumers will be unable to meet the reformulated gasoline standards on January 1, 1995. EPA further believes that
a one month lead-time is appropriate for the reformulated gasoline program, because a lead-time of this length has
been successful under the gasoline volatility program. As a result, the final regulations include the requirement
that certain reformulated gasoline requirements must be met by facilities upstream of the retail level beginning
on December 1, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This regulatory provision constitutes a clarification of the proposal that would require all parties, including
retailers and wholesale purchaser-consumers, to meet the reformulated gasoline standards beginning on January
1, 1995. The proposed regulatory timing could only be achieved if upstream facilities began dispensing reformulated
gasoline before January 1, 1995, and that in consequence a lead-time of approximately one month was implicit in the
proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All regulatory requirements for reformulated gasoline apply to gasoline that is produced or imported after December
31, 1994, or any time during 1994 if it is intended for use after January 1, 1995. It is presumed that all gasoline produced
or imported after December 1, 1994 is intended for use after January 1, 1995. These requirements include, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
independent sampling and testing, provisions dealing with downstream oxygenate blending, record keeping, reporting,
and attest engagements. This reach of the reformulated gasoline requirements is consistent with the regulatory
provision contained in the proposal (also included in the final rule at &sect;80.65(a)), that reformulated gasoline
requirements would apply to all gasoline sold, dispensed, stored, transported, produced, or imported on or after
January 1, 1995. EPA thus proposed that gasoline sold or dispensed on January 1, 1995, and that necessarily will have
been produced or imported during 1994, would be subject to all reformulated gasoline requirements.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, for example, all gasoline produced or imported on or after December 1, 1994 will have to be designated as reformulated
or conventional. If it is designated as reformulated it will have to comply with reformulated gasoline standards.
If it does not comply with reformulated gasoline standards, it will have to be designated as conventional, segregated
from reformulated gasoline, and clearly labeled as conventional gasoline and not intended for use in any covered
area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of reporting requirements, EPA intends that no quarterly or averaging reports will be submitted in 1994,
and that the first quarterly report in 1995, that must be submitted by May 31, 1995, will be the first reformulated gasoline
report. As a result, all batch-specific information for gasoline produced during 1994 should be included in the first
quarter 1995 report. A provision is included in the final rule to this effect, at &sect;80.75(a)(3). Similarly, EPA
does not intend that a separate attest engagement must be performed at the conclusion of 1994, but that the 1995 attest
engagement must include all gasoline produced or imported in 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also has included a provision in the final rule, at &sect;80.67(i), to specify the manner in which standards are
met for reformulated gasoline produced to average (as opposed to per-gallon) standards during 1994. Proposed provisions
dealing with averaging did not address this category of reformulated gasoline, because the averaging proposals
only addressed gasoline produced beginning in January 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provision in the final rule specifies that reformulated gasoline that is produced or imported during 1994 but
that is intended to be used in 1995 may meet the reformulated gasoline standards on average, provided that the refiner
or importer satisfies the gasoline quality survey prerequisite during 1995. The provision further specifies that
any such average compliance reformulated gasoline must be grouped with gasoline produced or imported during 1995
for purposes of compliance calculations, as well as reporting. As a result of the requirement that for each parameter
only the per-gallon or only the average standard may be used during each averaging period, the compliance approach
used for each parameter in 1994 (per-gallon vs. average) must also be used for all of 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes this approach for average compliance gasoline produced in 1994 is appropriate, because it represents
the alternative that preserves the opportunity for refiners and importers to meet standards on average for this category
of gasoline, with the smallest regulatory burden for regulated parties and for EPA. EPA considered, and rejected,
the alternative of allowing parties to use only the per-gallon standards during 1994, because of the adverse impact
on flexibility of such a restriction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also rejected the option of requiring that average standards must be met separately for gasoline produced or imported
during 1994.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
71
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA believes there would be no significant environmental consequence of combining 1994-gasoline with 1995-gasoline
for averaging purposes, but that the regulatory burden of separate accounting for 1994-gasoline would be significant.
The simple model standards that will apply for gasoline produced or imported during 1994 are limited to oxygen, benzene,
and toxics emissions performance, because this gasoline will not be VOC-controlled. These parameters are regulated
because of toxic pollution concerns, and have the relatively long averaging period of twelve months because the threat
of toxic pollution is long-term, cumulative in nature. EPA believes that combining the limited volume of 1994-gasoline
with 1995-gasoline is consistent with the long-term averaging approach to toxics generally.

VIII. Anti-Dumping Requirements for Conventional Gasoline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 211(k)(8) of the Act requires that average per gallon emissions of specified pollutants from non-reformulated
(i.e., conventional) gasoline use must not deteriorate relative to emissions from 1990 gasoline, on a refiner
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 basis. Compliance is measured by comparing emissions of a refiner's conventional gasoline against those of a baseline
gasoline. An individual baseline, consisting of fuel parameters and emissions, is developed for each refiner based
on the quality of its 1990 gasoline, although under certain circumstances the individual baseline is the statutory
baseline fuel parameters and emissions. To implement this requirement, EPA is promulgating requirements known
as the anti-dumping provisions for conventional gasoline producers and importers. These requirements apply to
all conventional gasoline producers and importers whether or not they also produce or import reformulated gasoline.

For ease in discussion, the term ``refiner'', as used in this discussion of the anti-dumping program, will hereafter
include refiners, blenders and importers. Where appropriate, blenders and importers will be mentioned specifically.

This section describes the key features of the anti-dumping provisions (excluding the compliance and enforcement
provisions applicable to conventional gasoline which are discussed in Section IX). The requirements discussed
in this section are detailed primarily in &sect;80.90 to &sect;80.93 in the accompanying regulations. This section
also highlights major comments received on EPA's proposals in this area and how this final rule differs from those
proposals. Additional supporting information can be found in Section VII of the associated Regulatory Impact Analysis
(RIA).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 211(k)(8) of the Act requires that EPA promulgate regulations ensuring that, for each refiner, average per
gallon emissions of VOC, CO, NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and toxic air pollutants from its conventional gasoline do not increase over emissions from the gasoline introduced
into commerce by that refiner in calendar year 1990. Emissions are to be measured on a mass basis, and each of the four
pollutants is to be considered separately. Increases in NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions due to oxygenate use may be offset by equivalent or greater mass reductions in the other pollutants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations promulgated today address exhaust benzene, total exhaust toxics and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions from conventional gasoline use. In addition, under the simple model, refiner specific caps are set for
sulfur, olefins and T90. EPA is not promulgating specific requirements for emissions of VOCs or CO, as EPA believes
that the regulations promulgated herein, in conjunction with various other agency regulations and Clean Air Act
requirements, will adequately meet the emissions limits for all four pollutants specified in section 211(k)(8).
A detailed discussion of EPA's reasons for adopting this approach may be found in the Agency's July 9, 1991 proposal
and, in summary, in the RIA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 211(k)(8) authorizes this approach as that provision requires that EPA promulgate regulations ``ensuring''
that conventional gasoline meet certain requirements on a refiner specific basis, but does not mandate that EPA promulgate
regulations for each of the four pollutant categories. This provision therefore provides EPA with the discretion
to fashion a regulatory program that ``ensures'' these results. While a relatively straightforward approach to
this would involve emissions requirements for each of the four pollutant categories, it need not if the regulatory
program otherwise achieves the required result. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the language used by Congress in section 211(k)(8)(A) supports this interpretation, there are several other
provisions in section 211(k) where Congress clearly specified that EPA promulgate various requirements, and such
language is conspicuously missing from section 211(k)(8)(A). See, for example, section 211(k)(8)(D) (``The Administrator
shall promulgate an appropriate compliance period *&blank;*&blank;*''), section 211(k)(1) (``regulations shall
require the greatest reduction in emissions *&blank;*&blank;* taking into consideration *&blank;*&blank;*''),
section 211(k)(2) (``regulations *&blank;*&blank;* shall require that reformulated gasoline comply with paragraph
(3) and *&blank;*&blank;* each of the following requirements *&blank;*&blank;*''), section 211(k)(4)(A) (``The
regulations *&blank;*&blank;* shall include [certification procedures] *&blank;*&blank;*''), section 211(k)(7)
(``The regulations *&blank;*&blank;* shall provide for the granting of an appropriate amount of credits *&blank;*&blank;*'').
While EPA received several comments on the proposed conventional gasoline requirements, no one disagreed with the
above interpretation of EPA's authority under section 211(k)(8)(A).

2. Emission Requirements Prior to January 1, 1998 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to mandatory use of the complex model on January 1, 1998, the requirements of section 211(k)(8) of the Act will
be met by requiring that the annual average exhaust benzene emissions of a refiner's conventional gasoline not exceed
its baseline exhaust benzene emissions. The exhaust benzene emissions due to conventional gasoline can be determined
using the simple model discussed in Section III. Only the effects of fuel benzene and fuel aromatic content on exhaust
benzene are included in this model. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the simple model is used for compliance, the annual average sulfur, olefin and T90 values of a party's conventional
gasoline cannot exceed its baseline values of those parameters by more than 25 percent. These limits will provide
some additional assurance that conventional gasoline emissions of toxics and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 will not rise prior to use of the complex model. EPA does not expect the levels of these parameters in conventional gasoline
to naturally increase due to the reformulated gasoline program, since the simple model for reformulated gasoline
simply caps these three fuel parameters at their baseline levels and does not require their reduction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A refiner may also use the complex model for determining compliance prior to its mandatory use. Because all of the fuel
parameters affecting exhaust benzene emissions are part of the model (benzene, aromatics, RVP, sulfur, olefins,
E300, E200, and oxygen) there is no need for separate ``caps'' on fuel parameters as associated with the simple model.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A refiner's baseline exhaust benzene emissions are determined by evaluating the refiner's baseline fuel parameter
values in the model chosen by the refiner for compliance. At the end of a compliance period, the average fuel parameter
values of a refiner's conventional gasoline over that period are evaluated in the same compliance model used to determine
the refiner's baseline emissions. The resulting emission values are then compared to the baseline emission values
to determine if the party is in or out of compliance with the anti-dumping requirement. While there was general support
for the regulatory approach taken by EPA, several commenters suggested specific revisions to the emissions requirements.
EPA's responses are discussed in the RIA. However, none of the comments caused EPA to change its proposed requirements,
and all of the above provisions are being promulgated essentially as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA had proposed that while a refiner may choose to use either the simple model or the complex model prior to January
1, 1998, it must use the same model for both the reformulated gasoline and the anti-dumping programs. Several commenters
disagreed with this last restriction. EPA is, however, promulgating this requirement as proposed because the anti-dumping
and reformulated gasoline provisions are inherently tied together. The specific model used to certify reformulated
gasoline will affect which fuel components are likely to be dumped. To avoid incentives to dump, the effect of these
components on conventional gasoline emissions should be evaluated on the same basis as the reformulated gasoline
emissions. Otherwise, incentives will exist to shift dirty components to conventional fuel areas using whichever
model predicts the lowest emissions increase due to those components. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Emission Requirements Beginning January 1, 1998 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Beginning January 1, 1998, the requirements of section 211(k)(8) of the Act shall be met by requiring that the exhaust
toxic emissions and the NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions of a party's conventional gasoline not exceed that party's baseline exhaust toxic and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions. Compliance with this requirement shall be determined using the complex model described in Section IV.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exhaust toxics emissions requirement under mandatory use of the complex model includes all five pollutants defined
in section 211(k)(10)(C) as toxics. These are exhaust benzene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, 1,3-butadiene and
POM. Benzene emissions occur in both exhaust and nonexhaust emissions, and accordingly, section 211(k)(10)(C)
does not limit the toxic air pollutant benzene to exhaust benzene. However, as stated, EPA is only promulgating regulations

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Compliance under section 211(k)(8) of the Act is measured against an individual baseline (comprised of individual
baseline fuel parameter and emission values) which is determined for each refiner if sufficient data exist from which
to determine a baseline representative of that refiner's 1990 gasoline. Additionally, the Act states that if no adequate
or reliable data exist regarding the gasoline sold by a refiner in 1990, the refiner must use the statutory baseline
gasoline fuel parameters
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Requirements for producers of gasoline and/or gasoline blendstocks.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 No adverse comments were received on the proposal that a refinery which primarily produces gasoline blendstocks
from crude oil (including crude oil derivatives) and mixes those blendstocks to form gasoline be subject to baseline
determination using any, or a combination of, the three data types described below in paragraph 3. The requirements
are being promulgated essentially as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Likewise, no adverse comments were received regarding the proposal to exempt (from the anti-dumping requirements)
those entities which produce and/or supply gasoline blendstocks to refiners and blenders, but do not produce gasoline.
Hence EPA is not promulgating anti-dumping requirements for such entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Requirements for purchasers of gasoline and/or gasoline blendstocks.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As proposed in April 1992, refiners who exclusively purchase blendstocks and/or gasoline and mix these purchased
components to form another gasoline (i.e., blenders) must use Method 1-type data (as described in paragraph 3 below).
Lacking sufficient Method 1-type data, the blender shall have the anti-dumping statutory baseline as its individual
baseline. Most who commented on this issue suggested that blenders should be allowed the same opportunities as refiners
to use 1990 and post-1990 gasoline and blendstock data. Otherwise, a blender may have to ``reformulate'' its conventional
gasoline. Commenters also stated that this provision penalized blenders for not sampling their 1990 fuel when there
were no such requirements. As discussed in the proposal, EPA does not believe that use of blendstock data or post-1990
gasoline or blendstock data would allow an accurate portrayal of a blender's 1990 production. Additional comments
are discussed in the RIA; however, none led to a change in the proposed requirements for blenders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Requirements for importers of gasoline.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 On April 16, 1992, EPA proposed that those who imported gasoline into the U.S. in 1990 must use Method 1-type data (as
described in paragraph 3). Lacking sufficient Method 1-type data, the importer would have the anti-dumping statutory
baseline as its individual baseline. An importer who did not import gasoline into the U.S. in 1990, but who does so after
1994, would also have the anti-dumping statutory baseline as its individual baseline. EPA proposed that if a U.S.
importer is also a refiner and imported 75 percent or more of the 1990 gasoline production of a refinery into the U.S.
in 1990, it could determine a baseline for that refinery using the three data types described in paragraph 3 below.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most commenters agreed with EPA's overall proposal concerning importers. Some felt, however, that the ``75 percent''
criteria was self-selecting_only those importer/refiners with higher baseline emissions relative to the statutory
baseline would choose to develop an individual baseline. Those importer/refiners with relatively low baseline
emissions would use the statutory baseline, and thus dumping could result, since they would be complying with a baseline
which was less stringent than one based on their own 1990 gasoline quality. EPA agrees that ``dumping'' could occur,
but expects it to be minimal since few importing refineries are likely to meet the ``75 percent'' criteria. Nonetheless,
EPA is requiring that all importers which are also refiners utilize Method&blank; 1-, 2- and 3-type data to determine
the individual baselines of their refineries which meet the 75 percent criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter claimed that location, not percent of production imported, dictates enforceability. However, EPA
believes that enforcement of a non-domestic refinery is governed less by location and more by the willingness of the
company and/or country to open its refinery for compliance visitations. Another commenter specifically stated
that Canadian refineries should be treated the same as domestic refineries for the purpose of establishing baselines.
As stated, EPA believes that it will be relatively easy to accurately determine the quality of the gasoline produced
in 1990 at a refinery outside of the U.S., for sale to the U.S., if a significant amount (i.e., 75 percent) of the production
of the refinery came to the U.S. Independent of where the refinery is located, if less than this amount was imported,
it will be more difficult to combine information on refinery operations and blendstock and gasoline data (i.e., Methods
2 and 3-type data) and allocate such information so as to establish the quality of the refinery's 1990 gasoline which
was sent to the U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters felt that an importer should be allowed to use all available 1990 and later data to establish a baseline
and have its baseline verified by an auditor. However, as stated in the proposals, EPA believes that significant dumping
could occur if post-1990 data is allowed since that data may not represent the importer's 1990 gasoline. EPA is thus
promulgating this essentially provision as proposed.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Requirements for exporters of gasoline.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA's proposals did not explicitly discuss whether gasoline exported from the U.S. in 1990 would be included in individual
baseline determinations. However, because exported gasoline did not contribute to pollution in the U.S. in 1990,
a producer of gasoline exported from the U.S. in 1990 shall not include the exported gasoline properties or volumes
in its baseline determination. A refiner which exports all of its future gasoline outside of the U.S. is not subject
to the anti-dumping requirements.

3. Types of Data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Introduction.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As discussed in the July 9, 1991 proposal, EPA is concerned that use of the statutory baseline parameters in lieu of
determining an individual baseline could have severe competitive effects. At the same time, EPA realizes that there
likely will be insufficient directly measured 1990 fuel parameter data available from which to determine representative
individual baseline parameters. Thus, in order to make the best use of available data in developing representative
individual baselines, EPA is specifying the types of data and calculations that may be used in the baseline determination.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposals, three methods (Methods 1, 2 and 3) were described for refiners to use to determine their baseline
parameter values. Method 1-type data consists of a refiner's measured fuel parameter value and volume records of
its 1990 gasoline. As discussed in the RIA, Method 1-type data can be from 1990 production or 1990 shipments as long
as no data is double counted and all available production and shipment data are used in the baseline determination.
Method 2-type data consists of a refiner's 1990 gasoline blendstock composition data and 1990 gasoline and blendstock
production records. Method 3-type data consists of a refiner's post-1990 blendstock composition data and 1990 gasoline
and blendstock production records. For both Methods 2 and 3, these provisions apply to those blendstocks used in the
production of gasoline within the refinery. Under certain circumstances, Method 3-type data may consist of post-1990
gasoline composition data as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No major comments were received negating the appropriateness of utilizing these three methods or data types. A few
minor comments were submitted which are addressed in the RIA. Several commenters did request that EPA allow combinations
of Methods 1, 2 and 3-type data to be used in baseline determination, in order to improve the use of available data and
thus develop more accurate and representative 1990 individual baselines. EPA agrees that a more representative
baseline will result if a combination of higher and lower levels of data is used rather than excluding the better data
(i.e., Method 1) due to it being inadequate by itself. EPA had proposed that the different types of data must be used
in a hierarchical order, i.e., Method 1-type data has to be used first, and if insufficient Method 1-type data was available
for a given fuel parameter, Method 2-type data would be used, etc. EPA is modifying the proposals to allow baseline
parameter values to be determined using a combination of the methods, or data types, if necessary, although the same
hierarchy must be maintained. Thus, insufficient Method 1-type data may be supplemented with Method 2-type data
and, if data were still lacking, the available Method 1 and 2-type data would be supplemented with Method 3-type data.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Inclusion of gasoline blendstock.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Although not specified in the proposals, EPA is requiring that gasoline blendstock which becomes gasoline (per 40
CFR 80.2(c)) solely upon the addition of a specific type and amount of oxygenate, be included in the baseline determination.
Unless evidence is provided which indicates that such blendstock was blended with oxygenate other than ethanol or
less than 10.0 volume percent ethanol, or was not further modified downstream, the refiner shall assume that said
blendstocks were blended with ten (10.0) volume percent ethanol. This requirement provides some assurance that
baseline emissions are not artificially low due to selective inclusion or exclusion of such blendstock. Requiring
that the blendstock be assumed to have been blended with a specific amount of ethanol (unless otherwise shown) will
result in a more stringent baseline than if the blendstock were assumed blended with a lower volume of ethanol, a different
oxygenate or not further modified. Hence, the burden of proof of actual disposition of such product is on the refiner.

Method 3 additional information. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order that the fuel parameter values obtained with Method 3-type data adequately represent the 1990 values of those
parameters, EPA proposed that the refiner must provide detailed documentation of its 1990 and post-1990 refinery
operations, including comparing 1990 and post-1990 operations, intermediates and products, and other aspects
of refinery operations which would cause its post-1990 gasoline to differ from its 1990 gasoline. For instance, if
post-1991 data is used, appropriate adjustments must be made for the refinery operational changes that occurred
due to the 1992 volatility rules and the oxygenated fuels program, two situations which could cause post-1990 operations
to differ from 1990 operations. The required documentation will assist the baseline auditor in its verification
and EPA in its review of the refiner's baseline submission. This provision is being promulgated as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA proposed to allow post-1990 gasoline data to be used to estimate 1990 baseline parameters under certain circumstances.
In addition to requiring the same detailed documentation of 1990 and post-1990 operations as above, in the February
26, 1993 proposal, EPA specified that the volumetric fraction of each blendstock in post-1990 gasoline must be within
ten (10.0) percent of the volumetric fraction of the same blendstock in 1990 gasoline. For example, if a refiner's
1990 gasoline contained 30 volume percent reformate, post-1990 gasoline data may be used in the baseline determination
as long as it contained 27.0&hyph;33.0 volume percent reformate and provided all other blendstocks also conformed
to these requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA received many comments stating that the use of post-1990 gasoline data was more accurate, and less costly, than
using post-1990 blendstock data. EPA agrees, and is allowing the use of gasoline data under certain circumstances,
as discussed below. Commenters also suggested that verification of differences and similarities between 1990 and
post-1990 operations and the resulting gasoline should be left to the baseline auditor rather than compared to specific
criteria. While the auditor will verify the comparison of 1990 and post-1990 operations, etc., all issues verified
by the auditor will also be reviewed by EPA. In addition to the technical reasons discussed below, specifying such
criteria (i.e., the ``10 percent'' criterion) will ensure the uniformity of both auditor and EPA evaluations and
verifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in the RIA, unless post-1990 blendstock fractions are sufficiently similar to 1990 blendstock fractions,
adjustments for differences will have to be made at the blendstock level, making any gasoline data moot. Larger differences
than 10 percent in large streams such as reformate could affect overall aromatic levels by up to 3 volume percent, which
is clearly significant. For smaller streams, however, a 10 percent change could be insignificant. Therefore, EPA
is expanding its criteria by allowing post-1990 gasoline blendstocks to meet the larger of (1) the 10 percent criterion,
or (2) be within two absolute volume percent of the blendstock volumetric fraction in 1990 gasoline. As discussed
in the RIA, this means of utilizing post-1990 gasoline should adequately cover typical fluctuations in both large
and small volume blendstocks without unduly sacrificing accuracy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Post-1990 gasoline data for which a single 1990 blendstock does not meet either of the blendstock fraction requirements
cannot be used in the baseline determination. However, EPA also received comment that many refiners would not be able
to use post-1990 gasoline data, even with the expanded criteria, simply due to butane utilization changes from 1990.
Because butane, and thus RVP, were reduced after 1990 due to volatility controls, and because RVP reductions reduce
emissions, EPA is exempting butane from the blendstock requirements for using post-1990 gasoline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

E200 and E300. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although not previously included among the fuel parameters for which baseline values are required to be determined,
EPA is now requiring that baseline values be determined for the fuel parameters E200 and E300, the percent evaporated
at 200 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F and 300 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F, respectively. Although these two fuel parameters replace T50 and T90, respectively, in the complex model,
T90 baseline values are still required to be determined for use prior to mandatory complex model use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA expects E200 and E300 values to be determined directly from gasoline or blendstock data, even if distillation
information has to be regraphed. If such a determination is not possible, E200 and E300 values may be estimated from
otherwise acceptable T50 and T90 data using the equations specified in the regulations. Thus, this addition will
not void any data collected under the proposed criteria.

Anti-dumping statutory baseline. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As mentioned earlier, in some cases a blender or importer may not be able, or be allowed, to develop an individual baseline
from its own data. In that case, the refiner or importer would have the statutory baseline as its individual baseline.
Although the compliance period for conventional gasoline is annual (as discussed in the proposals and as described
in section IX), emissions determined using the complex models are determined on a summer and winter basis. Thus, there
are separate anti-dumping summer and winter baseline fuel parameters, which are the statutory summer baseline specified
in the Act, and the winter baseline determined by EPA as required by the Act. Few comments were received concerning
the proposed annual average statutory baseline (which is a weighted average of the statutory summer and winter baselines,
as discussed in the proposals). None of the comments led to a change in the annual average baseline fuel parameter values.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sampling requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the February 26, 1993 proposal, EPA proposed minimum sampling requirements in order to ensure that enough gasoline
or blendstock samples were taken from which to develop a representative baseline. Namely, for Method 1-type data,
at least half of the batches (by number of batches, not volume), or shipments if not batch blended, in a calendar month
shall have been tested for a particular parameter. For Methods 2 and 3-type data, at least weekly sampling of continuous
blendstock streams and, if blendstocks are produced on a batch basis, sampling of at least half of the batches of each
blendstock produced in a month is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many refining industry commenters protested this proposal claiming that they had sampled based on the April 16, 1992
proposal requiring ``sufficient'' sampling, and that EPA's more specific requirement could void data collected,
and the time and money spent. EPA agrees that the sufficient frequency of sampling may vary according to circumstance
(such as the degree of variation in operating conditions), and is modifying its latest proposal by accepting, under
certain circumstances, data which does not meet the requirements specified above. However, if less than the minimum
data is used, the refiner must document, and the auditor verify, why the data is less than the minimum requirements
and why it is sufficient in quantity and quality to use in the baseline determination. EPA retains the right to reject
use of less than the minimum data if the documentation is incomplete or the justification not technically sound. In
all cases,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
75
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 all available samples must be analyzed and the results used in baseline determination if more than the minimum number
of samples are available.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 In instances where a sample was mislabeled or improperly tested or where an analysis results in a value which is significantly
different from expected values based on operating conditions, etc., the result may be excluded from the baseline
calculation. However, all instances of such exclusion must be documented and verified by the auditor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Additionally, EPA is promulgating its proposal to require at least three months worth of both summer and winter data.
As discussed in the RIA, this requirement ensures that the collected data covers the typical changes in gasoline composition
which occurs across seasons. Although not explicitly stated in the proposal, to better distinguish between summer
and winter, summer months shall consist of any month in which gasoline was produced to meet the federal summer volatility
requirements. It is not necessary for such low volatility fuel to be produced for the entire month. Winter months are
any months which could not be considered summer months.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Post-final rule data collection. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Few comments were received on the February 26, 1993 proposal that if a refiner collects data after promulgation of
these regulations, the data must be collected no later than the end of the third month of the first three full months
during which summer gasoline is produced by the refiner following promulgation of the final rule. EPA is modifying
this provision slightly, requiring only that proof must be given that additional data was needed and indeed was collected
after today.

Negligible parameter values. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 26, 1993, EPA proposed to exempt refinery streams from testing for one or more specific parameters if a
stream contains negligible amounts of those parameters. The affected fuel parameters are benzene, aromatics, olefins
and sulfur. EPA also proposed threshold criteria for each fuel parameter, i.e., the amount of the fuel parameter in
a stream at or below which the parameter would be considered negligible. EPA has changed the values of some of the threshold
criteria based on comment. Specifically, the benzene threshold value was reduced and the sulfur threshold value
increased. A full discussion of these changes can be found in the RIA; the actual values are also listed in &sect;80.91.
Oxygen was added to the list of parameters that may be considered negligible under certain circumstances. Other than
those modifications, the requirements are being promulgated as proposed.

Test methods. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters were concerned that the test methods they had used to analyze samples would be invalid because they
were not the same as the required test methods being promulgated today for reformulated gasoline. EPA had proposed,
on April 16, 1992, that sampling and measurement techniques used to determine baseline parameters must yield results
which are equivalent to the results obtained per the techniques and methodologies specified for the reformulated
gasoline program. However, because of constantly evolving test methods, in addition to the fact that the final regulations
concerning reformulated gasoline test methods will only be known today, it would be inappropriate to disallow data
because it was not tested according to certain methods when there were no requirements to do so. Nonetheless, EPA is
concerned that the test methods used be adequate. In a modification of the proposal, EPA will accept data determined
using methods other than those required under the reformulated gasoline program, upon petition and approval, as
long as the methodology or technique was a standard industry-accepted measurement technique at the time the measurement
was taken. If data to be used in the baseline determination was, somehow, obtained via a more accurate test method prior
submission of the baseline to EPA, it may be acceptable. The baseline auditor will verify that the techniques used
to determine the baseline data meet the requirements discussed above. Although not previously discussed, EPA is
allowing oxygen content, as well as oxygenate volume, to be determined from oxygenate blending records. The composition
of the oxygenate, with regard to the other required fuel parameters, must still be determined.

Closely integrated gasoline producing facilities. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on earlier comments, on February 26, 1993 EPA proposed to allow blending facilities (or terminal operations)
to be included in a refinery's baseline determination if a closely integrated relationship could be shown between
the refinery and the terminal. EPA also requested comments as to what criteria would constitute ``closely integrated''.
Many commenters supported allowing a single baseline for such a situation. Requiring 60&hyph;75 percent of a blending
facility's blendstocks to have come from a single refinery was suggested for defining a closely integrated refinery-terminal
relationship. EPA is promulgating the proposal with the requirement that at least 75 percent of the blendstock received
at the terminal in 1990 must have come from the associated refinery. EPA believes this is a reasonable number, as explained
in the RIA, considering that oxygenates and butane, among others, are blended into gasoline after the refinery, while
constituting much less than 20 percent of gasoline by volume. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of an aggregate refiner baseline, as discussed in paragraph 6.d, a terminal or terminals may be included
in the aggregate baseline if each terminal received at least 75 percent of its blendstock from one or more of the aggregated
refineries with which it is associated. For instance, the 75 criteria is satisfied if the terminal received 25 percent
of its 1990 blendstock from refinery A and 50 percent from refinery B, refinery A and B being part of an aggregate baseline.
Alternatively, it may also have received the entire 75 percent from either refinery A or B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although not previously proposed, some comments were received regarding other types of closely integrated facility
relationships. EPA is thus allowing a single individual baseline to be determined for two or more refineries (or sets
of gasoline blendstock-producing units) which are geographically near each other but are not within a single refinery
gate, and whose 1990 operations were significantly interconnected. The burden is placed on the refiner to show that
its two facilities are ``significantly interconnected''. In this case, the two facilities will have a single set
of baseline parameter values and associated emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters suggested that U.S. refiners with import operations also be allowed to develop a single baseline
covering their refining and importing operations. EPA rejected this suggestion because it would be difficult for
EPA to track a fuel's production location before the fuel is or was imported, particularly when considering 1990 production.
Also, allowing such a situation would amount to trading between foreign and domestic refineries, which was not mandated
nor intended by Congress.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Seasonal weighting. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the February 26, 1993 proposal, EPA proposed that a refinery's own production volumes of summer and winter gasoline
(based on RVP) be used in the weighting of data on a summer and winter basis. This change from the previous proposal received
a lot of support, and is being promulgated as proposed on February 26, 1993. As discussed in paragraph 6.a, the 1990
annual baseline volume is the larger of the gasoline volume produced in or shipped from the refinery in 1990. Thus,
a refinery's own baseline volumes of summer and winter gasoline (either on a produced or shipped basis) shall be used
for weighting the summer and winter anti-dumping emissions and sulfur, olefins and T90 values. As proposed, all volume
which is not summer volume is considered winter volume.

Grade weighting. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 26, 1993, EPA proposed that average fuel parameter values be determined first for each grade of gasoline
produced, and the resulting values weighted by the fraction of each grade sold in the period over which the value is
determined. Based on comments, the proposal has been modified and, for this final rule, ``grade'' shall mean each
traditional grade of gasoline produced in the refinery in 1990, e.g., regular, midgrade, and premium, not each different
integer octane number. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Equations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The equations have been modified slightly from the February 1993 proposal to require that specific gravity be included
in the determination of baseline sulfur and oxygen contents. Because both of these fuel parameters are determined
on a weight basis, and because gasoline and blendstocks vary, sometimes significantly, in weight-to-volume ratio,
correct accounting of such terms must include a weight-to-volume conversion. Additionally, separate average baseline
fuel parameter values must be determined for summer and winter, as discussed previously.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Oxygen in the baseline. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the April 16, 1992 proposal, EPA discussed several methods of accounting for oxygen in the baseline determination.
Several commenters suggested that the baseline be determined on a nonoxygenate basis so as not to penalize those who
``reformulated'', i.e., produced cleaner gasoline, early. Others supported including only the positive difference
(i.e., an increase in oxygen use) between 1990 and post-1994 oxygenate use. Others suggested variations_excluding
it in the baseline but including it in compliance, and including it as is in both the baseline and compliance calculations.
Others argued that oxygenate used in conventional gasoline designated for areas for CO reduction purposes should
not be considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The anti-dumping provisions of section 211(k)(8) are based on a comparison of 1990 and post-1994 emissions, and use
of an oxygenated baseline for compliance determination would be the most appropriate baseline. EPA is therefore
requiring baseline fuel parameter values to be determined on an oxygenated basis. Section 211(k)(8)(C) of the Act
also requires that increases in NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions, due to conventional gasoline oxygenate use, be offset by reductions in the other three pollutants. As
stated earlier, significant VOC and CO reductions will occur even without the reformulated gasoline rulemaking.
To ensure that an increase in NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions is not associated with the use of oxygen, EPA is allowing refiners to choose to use either an oxygenated or
nonoxygenated baseline when determining NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions. Compliance would be measured on the same basis. Under this provision, a refiner could choose to switch
from a nonoxygenated to an oxygenated baseline, beginning with the next averaging period. The initial choice to use
an oxygenated baseline, or the switch from a nonoxygenated to an oxygenated baseline is, however, permanent. EPA
expects a refiner to operate its refinery to its advantage, and thus it is not likely to make such decisions (of whether
to use a nonoxygenated or an oxygenated baseline for NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 purposes) lightly. Additionally, Congress intended that the anti-dumping program compare a refiner's 1990 emissions
with its post-1994 emissions, based on its fuels' actual average composition, i.e., its actual oxygenated baseline
or oxygenated compliance value. EPA is allowing refiners to use a nonoxygenated or an oxygenated baseline when determining
NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions in order to fulfill the provision that NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 increases due to oxygenates be offset. However, to minimize unnecessary administrative complications due to every
refiner potentially changing its baseline NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 value annually, EPA is allowing only the one-time change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining the nonoxygenated parameter values from the oxygenated values, only the physical dilution and distillation
effects of the oxygenate shall be considered. Adjustments to refinery operations that would have been different
had oxygenates not been used (i.e., octane) shall not be included because many potential adjustments are possible.
For instance, if a refiner's actual (oxygenated) baseline aromatics were 30 volume percent and actual oxygenate
use was 5 volume percent, the nonoxygenated baseline aromatics value would be 31.6 volume percent, or 30/(100%^5%).
While it is likely that reformer severity may have been higher had oxygenates not been used (thus resulting in perhaps
even a higher aromatics baseline value) such operational effects due to oxygenate use shall not be considered because
they cannot be known with certainty. Additionally, while the oxygen content and the effects of oxygenate volume on
parameters will be excluded from the nonoxygenated baseline determination, the total gasoline volume (including
actual 1990 oxygenate use and the volume of oxygenate assumed or shown to have been blended with gasoline blendstock
as discussed in paragraph 3.b) will be used to determine the individual 1990 baseline volume.

 emissions to be evaluated on a nonoxygenate basis in the first place is so as not to penalize refiners whose emissions
increase due to oxygenate use. It is possible that restricting baseline volumes by excluding oxygenate volumes could
penalize some refiners. Thus, it would be inappropriate for EPA to restrict the applicability of the individual baseline
to the nonoxygenated gasoline volume.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA proposed criteria for allowing a work-in-progress (WIP) adjustment on April 16, 1992. In the February 26, 1993
proposal, EPA expanded the proposed criteria in several areas. A WIP adjustment allows the refiner to modify its baseline
volumes and fuel parameter values (which affect emissions) to account for the WIP. A more detailed discussion of the
rationale and background concerning WIP adjustments may be found in the RIA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments reiterated a concern expressed in the regulatory negotiation discussions that a WIP adjustment
should be a limited exception, structured so that few refiners would qualify. EPA agrees that the criteria for a WIP
adjustment should be fairly stringent, as the adjustment was intended only for those for whom a significant investment
had already been made in order to comply with another government mandate. Additionally, a broad program of adjustments
could indicate that EPA exceeded its equitable discretion under Alabama Power, as discussed in the RIA. Nonetheless,
most commenters supported allowing WIP adjustments for significant differences between unadjusted and WIP-adjusted
values of exhaust benzene emissions, exhaust toxics emissions, NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions, sulfur, olefin or T90, instead of just exhaust benzene emissions as proposed in April 1992. A few commenters
suggested reducing the threshold comparison criteria (between WIP-unadjusted and adjusted values) of 5 percent
for emissions and 25 percent for sulfur, T90 and olefins. EPA agreed with the substance of these comments and is reducing
the thresholds between WIP and non-WIP values. A discussion of the proposed and final threshold criteria is presented
in the RIA. EPA's final threshold values under this requirement are that WIP-unadjusted and adjusted emissions values
must differ by 2.5 percent, and sulfur, olefins and T90 values by 10 percent. Again, only one of the thresholds has to
be met in order to meet this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few comments were received regarding the requirement that the WIP be associated with other regulatory requirements,
specifically, the type of the regulatory requirement that would be acceptable to EPA. EPA is clarifying this, and
WIP based on a legislative or regulatory environmental requirement enacted or promulgated prior to 1/1/91 will be
deemed as meeting the ``associated with other regulatory requirement'' criterion.

This language was included to ensure that the WIP was completed in a timely manner, since the WIP was ostensibly being
done to comply with a regulatory requirement. Less than timely completion would indicate that the regulatory requirement
was not a driving factor in initiating the WIP. However, EPA is not promulgating such a completion requirement because
if the WIP project was not completed in a timely manner, the refiner is likely to be losing money since it cannot produce
a certain fuel or meet certain emission requirements, etc. The contractual requirement discussed below will ensure
that the refiner was committed to the WIP project. Additionally, EPA is specifying that an adjustment will only be
allowed for WIP projects involving installation or modification of one or more gasoline blendstock- or distillate-producing
units in the refinery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated, EPA also proposed (and is promulgating) that WIP shall include projects under construction in 1990 and
projects for which contracts were signed prior to or in 1990 such that the refiner was financially committed to permanently
changing refinery operations. Clarification was requested as to what types of contracts would be considered to have
committed the refiner to the WIP. EPA believes that the contracts should have committed the refiner to purchasing
materials and construction of the WIP. As such, a process engineering design contract does not commit the refiner
to actually implementing the WIP and would not be considered a WIP contract under this provision. Other suggestions
included allowing WIP adjustments for work not necessarily associated with a regulatory requirement, including
WIP which would have a beneficial effect on a refinery's overall environmental performance. Again, WIP adjustments
were intended to apply only to specific situations, i.e., those relatively costly projects undertaken for mandated
environmental betterment. Thus, it would not be appropriate to expand the criteria (as suggested) for qualifying
for a WIP adjustment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 26, 1993, EPA proposed allowing either the ``10 percent'' criteria from the April 16, 1992 proposal or
a $10 million minimum cost of the WIP to satisfy the capital-at-risk criteria. Some commenters suggested that the
requirements be more stringent_one suggested a threshold value of $50 million. Others suggested reducing the threshold
value to $5 million (possibly a more appropriate value for small refiners) or 5 percent, or eliminating any ``dollar''
amount because no one should be penalized because its investment fails to meet arbitrary time or cost criteria. EPA
believes that such criteria must be specified in order to prevent a proliferation of adjustments for other than true
hardship cases. Additionally, the proposed criteria are fairly stringent requirements, and more stringent requirements
could threaten the viability of some refiners. EPA could have relaxed the criteria, i.e., set a lower dollar amount.
However, as stated, the WIP provision was included to provide relief for those projects that would significantly
financially impact the refiner, and not for inconsequential modifications. Thus either the ``10 percent'' criteria
or the $10 million criteria will be allowed to satisfy this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many comments and suggested language were received concerning EPA's February 26, 1993 proposal that a WIP adjustment
would simultaneously cap a refiner's anti-dumping emissions and sulfur, T90 and olefin values at five (5) percent
over the corresponding statutory baseline values. Most commenters opposed such simultaneous caps. EPA also proposed
that a refiner whose WIP-adjusted baseline emissions exceeded 105 percent of anti-dumping statutory baseline emissions
did not have to reduce its emissions further (to 105 percent of the anti-dumping statutory baseline) if its WIP-adjusted
baseline emissions were less than its pre-WIP baseline emissions. EPA believes though that some limit on the adjustment
must be included to minimize environmental harm. The limit must apply to all who are allowed a WIP adjustment. Thus,
EPA is limiting WIP increases in baseline exhaust benzene, exhaust toxics and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions and sulfur, olefins and T90 values to the larger of (1) the unadjusted individual baseline value of each
emission or fuel parameter or (2) 105 percent of the corresponding anti-dumping statutory baseline value. Note that
sulfur, olefins and T90 are only constrained when compliance is determined using the simple model. When compliance
is determined using the complex model, the WIP-adjusted values of these three fuel parameters are not subject to the
caps. Given EPA's discretion in even granting WIP adjustments, EPA believes this provision provides an acceptable
balance between allowing WIP adjustments and ensuring that increases in emissions over 1990 levels are minimized.

Baseline adjustment for extraordinary circumstances.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the February 26, 1993 proposal, EPA requested comments on allowing the baseline fuel parameters, volumes and emissions
of a refinery to be adjusted due to the occurrence of specific extraordinary or extenuating circumstances which caused
its 1990 gasoline production to be different than it would have been had the circumstance not occurred. Many commenters
felt that baseline adjustments should be allowed for the proposed situations as well as for others. One commenter
stated that every site is unique, thus baseline adjustments should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Still others
suggested that EPA allow adjustments only for small refiners, or for several other specific circumstances. Several
commenters, however, felt that no extenuating circumstance baseline adjustment should be allowed. Among the reasons
cited for not allowing adjustments were: competitive inequities; Congressional intent to account for 1990 only;
difficulty in defining extenuating circumstances; use of this provision as a method of voiding work-in-progress
requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While EPA's policy objective is not to establish a broad adjustment program, EPA is allowing adjustments for specific
extenuating circumstances. Allowable circumstances include unforeseen, unplanned downtime of at least 30 days
of one or more gasoline blendstock producing units due to equipment failure or natural cause beyond the control of
the refiner, or for nonannual maintenance (turnaround) downtime which occurred in 1990. These types of adjustments
reflect instances where the 1990 baseline truly deviated from the otherwise expected baseline (historic and future),
had the incident not occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is also permitting baseline adjustments for certain refiners which produced JP&hyph;4 jet fuel in 1990. As discussed
in the RIA, EPA believes that it has authority to allow such adjustments due to the discretion afforded EPA by Congress.
Additionally,

 gives EPA ``case-by-case discretion'' to grant variances or even dispensation from a rule where imposition of the
requirement would result in minimal environmental benefit but the would extremely burden a regulated party. While
the anti-dumping requirements, in general, apply to all conventional gasoline whether or not reformulated gasoline
is also produced, under the criteria mentioned above, no ``dumping'' will occur since no reformulated gasoline will
be produced by such refiners. Congressional intent with regard to the anti-dumping program will be met while not unduly
burdening those that meet the specified criteria.

 so as to reduce the combined burden of JP&hyph;4 phaseout and the anti-dumping requirements on their operations.
In some cases, if no relief were granted in this area, the viability of a refinery could be at stake. EPA is also allowing
baseline adjustments for multi-refinery refiners as long as each of the refineries meets all of the specified criteria.

As discussed in paragraph 6.d, a refiner with more than one refinery may determine an aggregate baseline, i.e., a conventional
gasoline compliance baseline, which consists of the volume-weighted emissions or fuel parameters, as applicable,
of two or more refineries.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
JP&hyph;4 production must have also constituted a significant portion of a refiner's 1990 production in order for
a significant burden to exist. In its February 1993 proposal, EPA requested comment on what minimum portion of a refinery's
1990 production JP&hyph;4 should have constituted for the circumstance to be extenuating, and several different
ratio options were suggested by commenters, as discussed in the RIA. As discussed in the RIA, EPA is requiring that
the ratio of the refinery's 1990 JP&hyph;4 production to its 1990 gasoline production must equal or exceed 0.5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the adjusted emission baselines of those approved for JP&hyph;4 adjustments are likely to be higher than their
actual 1990 baselines (primarily due to increased benzene and aromatics) EPA expects minimal negative environmental
affects. Because the number of refineries meeting the criteria is expected to be small and the total production of
all such refineries is also small, less gasoline is affected by any baseline adjustments than if the criteria were
less stringent. In this situation, EPA believes that any negative environmental effects resulting from the allowed
adjustments are justifiably balanced by the reduced burden on qualifying refiners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although EPA is allowing baseline adjustments for the specific circumstances described above, it in no way means
this to be a precedent to allow adjustments for actual or so-called extenuating circumstances now or in the future.
The language of the Act does not allow EPA to broadly permit baseline adjustments. Additionally, a baseline is neither
unrepresentative of 1990, nor incalculable, because of post-1990 changes in crude availability, fuel specifications,
fuel markets, etc. Congress certainly knew that such changes could affect baseline determinations, yet in creating
the anti-dumping requirements it did not require EPA to consider such factors in determining baselines. In fact,
no direction was given to account for two mandated fuel changes, Phase II volatility control and lead phaseout. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is likely that circumstances for which baseline adjustments are not allowed may negatively affect some refiners.
However, every refiner will be subject to future changes in markets, fuel quality requirements, etc., all of which
will affect the refiner's gasoline quality and ability to comply with its anti-dumping baseline. Thus, except in
extreme cases, baseline adjustments due to post-1990 changes which affect refiners would not be practical (due to
the myriad circumstances which may exist) nor necessarily fair, and are definitely not supported by the language
of the Act nor the intent of Congress. EPA is appropriately not providing for such adjustments.

Inability to meet these requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although not previously discussed, EPA realizes that many unique circumstances will arise regarding the baseline
determination. As such, if a refiner or importer is unable to comply with one or more of the requirements specified
for baseline determination, it may be allowed to accommodate the lack of compliance in a reasonable, technically
sound manner. It must petition EPA for such a variance, and the alternative must be verified by the baseline auditor.
The petition may or may not be approved by EPA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The individual baseline volume of a refiner which utilizes Methods 1, 2 and or 3-type data to determine its baseline
fuel parameters shall be the larger of the total volume of gasoline produced in or shipped from the refinery in 1990,
excluding volumes exported. This provision is added because 1990 shipments and production could differ. As discussed
in the RIA, while 1990 gasoline shipments actually contributed to emissions, data is available (by Methods 1, 2 or
3) on 1990 gasoline production. The difference between the shipped and produced gasoline is expected to be negligible
with respect to baseline determination. Volumes of oxygenates blended into gasoline at the refinery and oxygenate
assumed or shown to have been blended into gasoline downstream of the refinery, as discussed in paragraph 3.b, shall
be included. The baseline volume shall be determined after all adjustments, such as for work-in-progress or extenuating
circumstances, have been performed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The individual baseline volume of a blender utilizing only Method 1-type data or having the anti-dumping statutory
baseline as its individual baseline shall be also the larger of the volume of 1990 gasoline produced in or shipped from
the refinery (blending facility). The individual baseline volume of an importer utilizing only Method 1 or having
the anti-dumping statutory baseline as its individual baseline shall be the total volume of gasoline imported into
the U.S. in 1990.

Limitations on applicability of individual baselines.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the April 16, 1992 proposal, EPA proposed to limit the applicability of a refiner's or importer's individual baseline
to a certain portion of its post-1994 conventional gasoline production or imports and apply the anti-dumping statutory
baseline parameter values to the volume in excess of this amount. This excess amount would reflect the portion of the
post-1994 growth in gasoline production over 1990 volumes that is attributed to conventional gasoline. The refiner
or importer would comply with the production weighted average of the two resulting baseline emission figures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of the commenters agreed that the increase in conventional gasoline production over this baseline volume should
be subject to the statutory baseline. However, commenters disagreed as to whether the increase should be determined
relative to actual production or relative to capacity. In addition to agreeing with the proposal, those favoring
production as the basis cited the difficulty in determining gasoline refining capacity. Those favoring capacity
as the basis commented that if baselines are applied on a production basis, conventional gasoline production could
be limited below capacity and reduce the capability to supply conventional gasoline to some markets. Also, commenters
claimed that factors such as the Persian Gulf war and the phaseout of JP&hyph;4 jet fuel made 1990 production unrepresentative
of normal industry refining activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While EPA agrees that 1990 production may have been unrepresentative of normal operations in some ways, it believes
that some unusual circumstances occur every year and the limitation of individual baselines to 1990 production,
as described above and in the RIA, is the better choice for minimizing emission increases and market distortions.
Thus EPA is promulgating this requirement as proposed except that baseline volume shall be based on 1990 gasoline
shipments rather than production. Gasoline shipments better reflect volumes actually in the market in 1990. For
a refiner, its 1990 total volume would be its 1990 actual gasoline shipments, including adjustments to account for
WIP or extenuating circumstances, and including oxygenate volume.

Baseline emissions determination.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Every refinery must develop a set of individual baseline parameters, volume and emissions. Prior to 1/1/98, compliance
with baseline emissions must be determined using either the simple or complex model equations for exhaust benzene.
In the case of the simple model, only fuel benzene and fuel aromatics are considered_VOC changes which may affect benzene
emissions are not considered. Beginning 1/1/98, compliance with baseline emissions must be determined using the
complex model for total exhaust toxics and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in Section IV, there are separate complex models from which to determine summer and winter emissions.
As such, average baseline fuel parameters must be determined separately for summer and winter. Conventional gasoline
baseline emissions (and sulfur, olefins and T90 values) will first be determined separately, on a summer and winter
basis, using summer and winter fuel parameter values (except that average winter RVP will be 8.7 psi, as discussed
in the RIA). The summer and winter emissions (and sulfur, olefins and T90 values) will then be weighted by the respective
summer and winter baseline volumes to determine annual average baseline emissions (and sulfur, olefins and T90 values).
Compliance is determined in a similar manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As also discussed in Section IV, there are two complex models_one for use prior to 2000 and one for use in 2000 and beyond.
As such, every refinery will have two sets of baseline total exhaust toxics and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions_one set applicable prior to 2000, and one in 2000 and beyond. Note that baseline fuel parameter values and
volume do not change, only the emissions determined from those parameters. In the case of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, it is likely that every refinery will actually have four potential baseline NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions (see discussion in paragraph 5.e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters were also concerned about the effect of future revisions to the complex model on 1990 baseline emissions
and future compliance, particularly should additional fuel parameters be added to the model. In the event of revisions
to the complex model, EPA will promulgate additional regulations which will consider the impact on conventional
gasoline, including consideration of lead time, cost and other factors.

Conventional gasoline compliance baselines. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Clean Air Act refers to gasoline sold by a refiner, blender or importer (section 211(k)(8)(A)), but does not specify
an averaging unit for baseline determination nor whether gasoline and the resulting emissions should be treated
on a refinery or refiner basis, thus authorizing EPA to adopt the most appropriate method of complying with the anti-dumping
requirements. EPA considered three possible options for baseline determination_refinery basis, refiner basis,
or some combination of the two. During the regulatory negotiation, it was agreed that EPA would propose allowing a
refiner to elect to establish an individual baseline. In the April 1992 proposal, EPA proposed that refiners could
choose either refiner-wide averaging or refinery-by-refinery averaging, but not a combination of the two. This
was to avoid situations where multi-refinery refiners could game the system and potentially gain a significant competitive
advantage over single-refinery refiners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although, as stated, EPA expressed concern about multi-refinery refiners' having an advantage over single-refinery
refiners, few commenters agreed with EPA's April 1992 proposal. Of those that did agree, some suggested that all refineries
should be required to comply with their individual baselines, to minimize any advantages for multi-refinery companies
over single refinery companies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, most of the comments received on this issue claimed that EPA had not interpreted this provision correctly
from the Agreement-in-Principle. The agreement, according to the commenters, allowed refiners to decide how to
aggregate their refineries' baselines. Some suggested that if aggregations are only allowed as proposed, compliance
with the simple model, complex model and/or anti-dumping requirements would be difficult. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon further consideration of this issue, EPA is allowing refiners to choose to have one or more individual refinery
conventional gasoline compliance baselines and one or more ``refiner'' baselines (i.e., more than one grouping
of two or more refineries to form a compliance baseline). Because the decision to group or not group refineries is a
onetime decision, and because a refiner's total emissions will be conserved, the possibility of gaming will be reduced.
When two or more refineries are grouped for the purpose of having a single conventional gasoline compliance baseline,
the refineries shall be considered ``aggregated'', and the resulting baseline shall be an ``aggregate'' baseline.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aggregate baselines are determined by volume-weighting the baseline emissions and sulfur, olefin and T90 values
of the aggregated facilities. If aggregated, all NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 baselines in an aggregate must be determined either on a nonoxygenated or an oxygenated basis, using the corresponding
nonoxygenated or oxygenated baseline parameters. The choice of whether a refinery has its own individual baseline
or is part of an aggregate baseline is a one-time decision, i.e., refineries cannot be re-aggregated annually. Also,
an individual baseline (including both parameter and emission values) must be calculated for each refinery, whether
that refinery will be part of an aggregate baseline or not. This is required because reformulated gasoline compliance
under either the simple model or early use of the complex model is on a refinery basis. Also, individual baselines must
be known in the event that a refinery is sold or shut down, or other reason why the baseline would need to be recalculated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also proposed to require individual refinery baselines for refineries located in specific isolated geographic
areas where localized dumping was occurring. EPA is retaining this proposal in the final rule. Few comments were received
on this issue and are addressed in the RIA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Baseline recalculation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its April 16, 1992 proposal, EPA proposed certain instances when baselines would have to be recalculated. Few adverse
comments were received. In the case of a refinery which is shut down after 1990, EPA had proposed that an aggregate baseline
which contained the shutdown refinery would not change unless the shutdown refinery was sold. However, upon further
consideration, EPA believes that it is more appropriate, and more consistent with the other recalculation requirements,
to remove a shutdown refinery's contributions to an aggregate baseline. EPA is thus promulgating this requirement
with the other proposed requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the February 26, 1993 proposal, EPA expanded on the qualifications and responsibilities of the baseline auditor
which each refiner or importer must utilize to verify its baseline. Refiners and importers utilizing the anti-dumping
statutory baseline, if so allowed, are not required to have a baseline auditor.

1. Auditor Qualifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA proposed specific criteria for determining the independence and technical capability of the auditor (and where
applicable, the auditor's organization and/or certain persons working with or for the auditor). A few commenters
suggested minor changes in the proposed criteria as discussed in the RIA, and some of these recommendations are incorporated
in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also proposed that the auditor retained by a refiner or importer may also have developed the baseline for the same
refiner or importer as long as all other auditor qualification requirements were met. Several commenters who addressed
this issue agreed that the auditor should be allowed to also be the baseline preparer, mostly from a cost savings point-of-view.
Other commenters pointed out that the independence of the review would be lost. While this may diminish to some extent
the value of an independent audit, the cost and time savings are relevant considerations. In balancing these concerns,
EPA is allowing the auditor to also have prepared the baseline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Auditor Certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA proposed two options by which potential auditors could be approved by EPA as qualified to audit baselines. One
option involved precertification by EPA; under this option, a statement of the auditor's qualifications would be
submitted to EPA. EPA would officially certify an auditor, or if no comment were received from EPA within a specified
time, the auditor would be considered certified by default. The other option required the refiner or importer to ensure
that the auditor is qualified, and to provide a qualification statement for the auditor with the baseline submission.
In this case, the auditor would not be pre-certified by EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most commenters agreed with allowing both options. One commenter thought that EPA should notify auditors of approval
rather than letting them be certified by default, and that they should be pre-certified. EPA believes that, in most
cases, it will respond in some form, not necessarily approval or disapproval, prior to the end of the allowable time
period. In the proposal, EPA allowed the auditor to be certified by default after 30 days. However, EPA now believes
that it should not allow an auditor to be certified by default until 45 days after application or today's date, whichever
is later, because of possible delays, e.g., mail delivery, in receiving an auditor's qualification statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA had also proposed that within thirty (30) days of hiring a baseline auditor or today's date, whichever is later,
each refiner and importer must inform EPA of the name, organization address and telephone number of the auditor hired.
EPA now believes this information is not critical and thus is eliminating this requirement. This information is only
required in the baseline submission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

3. Auditor Responsibilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The major issues raised by commenters concerning auditor responsibilities was whether the auditor was to verify
the baseline determination or recalculate the baseline itself. EPA agrees that the auditor should independently
verify the baseline determination, and is not required to develop a second baseline determination. However, the
auditor must take whatever action is necessary to ensure that all baseline submission requirements are fulfilled.
EPA is also requiring that a refiner's baseline submission include a statement prepared and signed by the primary
analyst stating that, to the best of its knowledge, it has thoroughly reviewed the sampling methodology and baseline
calculations, and that they meet the requirements and intentions of the rulemaking, and that it agrees with the final
baseline parameter and emission values listed in the baseline submission. EPA is not requiring auditors to submit
(to EPA) an audit plan prior to beginning the baseline verification process.

1. Timing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Few comments were received concerning the timing of baseline submissions, and EPA is promulgating its requirements
that baselines be submitted to EPA within 6 months of today's date and that baselines determined using data collected
after today be submitted to EPA by September 1, 1994. EPA will consider petitions for an extension of these deadlines,
however, submitters should take note that late submissions could cause delays in receiving EPA decisions on approval
of their baselines. EPA is promulgating such timing requirements in order to give the industry sufficient time to
generate and audit individual baselines. EPA is well aware of the need for expeditious review of submitted baselines,
and encourages submission of baselines as soon as possible after today.

2. Petitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In many situations in the baseline determination, a refiner or importer is required to petition EPA in order to be allowed
to account for a variance from a requirement. In other situations, the refiner or importer is required to ``show''
that it meets certain criteria. In either of these situations, approval will be given by the Director of the EPA's Office
of Mobile Sources, or designee. As will be discussed below, all petitions must be included in the baseline submission_in
fact, in most cases, baseline calculations have to be determined both with and without the requested variance, since
the outcome of the request would be unknown. Although not previously proposed, EPA is allowing petitions and ``showings''
to be submitted prior to the baseline submission deadline although an early decision on the request is not guaranteed.
Nonetheless, the baseline submission must be submitted by the applicable deadline, whether or not EPA has decided
to approve or disapprove the request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

3. Submission Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on comments to its proposals, EPA has determined that a number of its proposed baseline submission requirements
were not pertinent to a baseline determination. EPA is thus requiring that, at minimum, the information described
in &sect;80.93 be included in the baseline submission. Information on crudes and refinery unit operations is still
required because EPA may wish to evaluate baseline submissions using a refinery flow simulation system. EPA plans
to develop a sample baseline submission document which should be available soon after today. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although not previously required in the baseline submission, the blendstock-to-gasoline ratio for each calendar
year 1990 through 1993 must now be included. The blendstock-to-gasoline ratio is discussed further in Section IX,
and is defined in &sect;80.102. Determination of this ratio is also subject to auditor verification, as is the entire
baseline submission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA may require submittal of more extensive data if such data is required to aid EPA in its review of the baseline submission,
or if discrepancies in any part of the baseline submission are found. Additional information that may be useful to
EPA in its evaluation of the baseline submission may be included, at the refiner's discretion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is slightly expanding the content required in the statement signed by the chief executive officer which is included
in the baseline submission. The statement must state that the data submitted is the extent of the data available for
the determination of each of the required baseline fuel parameter values, that sampling methodology and baseline
calculations meet the requirements and intentions of the rulemaking, and that the final baseline parameter and emission
values listed represent its 1990 gasoline, to the best of his or her knowledge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a refiner or importer desires that certain information in the baseline submission not be publicly available, it
must a assert a claim of confidentiality, as discussed below, and include this request in the baseline submission.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Baseline Approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA will approve baselines and upon approval publish, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the standards for each applicable gasoline producing or importing facility of a refiner, blender or importer. Because
a party's baseline will become its standard for compliance with the anti-dumping and early reformulated gasoline
requirements, EPA believes the standard should be publicly known, and as discussed below, there are no compelling
reasons not to publish such information. Additionally, such standards are not entitled to confidential treatment
(40 CFR 2.301(e), special confidentiality rules applicable to Clean Air Act cases). Thus, upon Agency approval of
a baseline, the baseline exhaust benzene, exhaust toxics and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions values and 125 percent of the baseline sulfur, olefins and T90 values shall be published. This information
is required on a refinery or facility basis because the reformulated gasoline requirements are on a refinery-basis,
and because this information needs to be known in the event a refinery changes owners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While EPA previously proposed that it would publish baseline parameter values by refinery, it now believes that no
substantive comments could result from publishing such information because of the complexity of the baseline determination.
Additionally, EPA realizes that certain aspects of the baseline determination must necessarily remain confidential
in order to prevent serious, negative competitive effects. Thus EPA is allowing any person or organization providing
information to EPA in connection with the determination of a baseline, including establishing a baseline or investigating
possible baseline discrepancies, to assert that some or all of the information submitted, except the baseline emissions
or parameter values which are the standard for a refiner, refinery or importer, is entitled to confidential treatment
as provided in 40 CFR part 2, subpart 2. Such confidential information shall be clearly distinguished from other information
to the greatest extent possible, and clearly labeled ``Confidential Business Information.'' Information covered
by a claim of confidentiality will be released by EPA only to the extent allowed by procedures set forth in 40 CFR part
2, subpart B. Failure to submit a claim of confidentiality with submission of the baseline, however, may lead to release
of information by EPA without further notice to the submitter (40 CFR 2.203 (a) and (c)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most comments on this topic addressed the publication of individual baseline information. Several commenters suggested
publishing a refiner's or importer's anti-dumping index (ADI), a ratio of the individual baseline emissions to the
statutory baseline emissions. However, there is little difference between this value and the actual value if the
statutory baseline emissions are known. Another suggestion included providing such information only upon request.
Again, there is little difference between ``on request'' and publishing such information at one time. One commenter
stated that no where in the statute was publication of baseline data required. While that is true, EPA must release
the standards (and any other non-CBI information) upon request, and there are benefits from publishing them, e.g.,
citizen suit enforcement, more information to the general public about EPA's standards, better deterrence to noncompliance.
Commenters did not provide any clear or compelling reason for not publishing the standards, and there are benefits
from publishing them, as discussed. Additional comments, which did not affect the final rule, and EPA responses can
be found in the RIA.

IX. Anti-Dumping Compliance and Enforcement Requirements for Conventional Gasoline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule implements section 211(k)(8) of the Clean Air Act which provides that beginning January 1, 1995, average
per gallon emissions of specified pollutants from non-reformulated or conventional gasoline use must not deteriorate
relative to emissions from 1990 gasoline on a refiner or importer basis. This could occur, for example, if fuel components
or properties that cause harmful emissions and that are removed from or limited in reformulated gasoline, are ``dumped''
into conventional (non-reformulated) gasoline. As a result, the ``anti-dumping'' program limits the emissions
of specified pollutants from conventional gasolines, and under certain circumstances from blendstocks (based
on EPA's authority under section 211(k)(c) of the Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule differs from the earlier proposals primarily in the area of blendstock accounting. These changes are
discussed in greater detail below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Refiners and importers must establish individual 1990 baselines in order to compare the emissions characteristics
of gasoline they produced or imported in 1990 with the emissions characteristics of conventional gasoline produced
or imported in 1995 and later. See section VIII for a discussion of the methods required for development of an individual
baseline. The baseline for refiners who were not in business in 1990, and in certain cases for other importers and refiner-blenders,
is the statutory baseline found at &sect;80.91(c)(5) of the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Refiners who operate more than one refinery have the option of demonstrating compliance with the anti-dumping provisions
for each refinery separately, or the refiner may group its refineries and show compliance for each group separately
provided that each refinery's performance is accounted for either separately or as part of a refinery group. The refiner's
refinery-grouping election may not be changed after the initial election. Blendstock tracking and accounting as
discussed below, must be determined in accordance with the same refinery grouping as chosen for compliance purposes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule has three separate sets of compliance standards for determining compliance with the anti-dumping
requirements, however, only one set applies to a refiner or importer at any one time. These are the Simple Model standards
and Optional Complex Model standards, that apply in 1995, 1996, and 1997; and the Mandatory Complex Model standards
that apply in 1998 and thereafter. All three sets of standards require refiners and importers to average certain properties
of conventional gasoline and demonstrate compliance with prescribed standards, which in some cases are actual fuel
properties and in others are emissions products calculated from specific fuel properties.

Under the Simple Model standards, a refiner or importer is required to demonstrate on an annual basis that average
exhaust benzene emissions of conventional gasoline do not exceed the refiner's or importer's 1990 compliance baseline
for exhaust benzene emissions, and that average sulfur, olefins and T90 each do not exceed 125% of the refiner's or
importer's 1990 average levels for each of these parameters. Under the Optional Complex Model standards, annual
average levels of exhaust benzene emissions, volume weighted for each batch as determined under the applicable model,
may not exceed the refiner's or importer's 1990 average exhaust benzene emissions calculated in the same manner.
Under the Mandatory Complex Model standards, annual average levels of exhaust toxic emissions and NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions calculated in the same manner. Refiners and importers are required to determine the emissions performance
for each batch of gasoline in either the applicable summer or winter model based on whether or not the batch has been
designated to comply with EPA volatility requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule provides that in 1995, 1996, and 1997, refiners and importers may determine compliance based on either
the Simple Model standards or the Optional Complex Model standards, at their option. However, a refiner that produces
reformulated gasoline under the Simple Model must use the Simple Model anti-dumping standards, and a refiner that
produces reformulated gasoline under the optional complex model must use with the Optional Complex Model anti-dumping
standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Refiners and importers are required to include the following products, which are produced or imported during each
averaging period, in anti-dumping compliance calculations: conventional gasoline; non-gasoline petroleum products
if required under the blendstock accounting provisions (discussed below); and gasoline blending stock which becomes
conventional gasoline upon the addition of oxygenate (discussed below).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, oxygenate that is added to a refiner's or importer's gasoline or blendstock downstream of the refinery
or import facility may be included in the refiner's or importer's compliance calculations only if the refiner or importer
is able to demonstrate with certainty that the oxygenate has been added to that party's gasoline. Provisions are included
in the final rule for the manner in which refiners and importers must make this demonstration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Oxygenate blended downstream may be counted by a refiner or importer if the refiner or importer demonstrates that
it performed the oxygenate blending. In addition, the oxygenate may be counted if the blending is conducted by a blender
with whom the refiner or importer has a contract that specifies procedures intended to ensure proper blending, and
the refiner or importer monitors the downstream blending operation through audits, inspections, and sampling and
testing of the gasoline produced at the blending operation. These downstream oxygenate blending provisions are
discussed more fully below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Refiners and importers also have the option of determining compliance for exhaust NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 performance is determined in the same manner. Refiners and importers may elect to switch one time under certain conditions
which are discussed more fully in Section VIII of the Regulatory Impact Analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Enforcement of the anti-dumping standards under this rule consists of a combination of mechanisms to monitor compliance
with the regulations, including: refiner/importer sampling and testing of gasoline produced or imported; record
keeping; reporting; annual audits by refiners and importers; and Agency audits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule specifies the manner in which penalties will be determined for violations of the anti-dumping requirements
of the final rule. These penalty provisions include calculations of the number of days of violation, and presumptions
regarding the properties of gasoline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the anti-dumping requirements in the final rule, certain refiners are also required to account for blendstocks
that are produced. The principal policy reason for imposing blendstock tracking and accounting is that, unless proscribed,
certain refiners will have an incentive to transfer blendstocks based on the differences in baselines that will exist.
These differences thus could result in the transfer of the ``production'' of gasoline from a refinery with a more rigorous
baseline to another refinery with a less rigorous baseline, through the transfer of blendstocks. This transfer-of-blendstocks
concern is described more fully below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Refiners and importers are required to establish a baseline of the volume of certain specified blendstocks
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
80
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 produced and transferred to others, relative to the volume of gasoline produced (the ``blendstock-to-gasoline
ratio''). This baseline is established by determining, for each calendar year 1990 through 1993, the volumes of blendstocks
produced and transferred, the volumes of gasoline produced, and calculating the annual and four-year average blendstock-to-gasoline
ratios. Refiners may include in baseline calculations only those volumes of blendstocks for which the refiner is
able to demonstrate the blendstock was used in the production of gasoline. This baseline blendstock-to-gasoline
ratio must be established using the baseline auditing procedures described in &sect;80.93.

The blendstock tracking requirements apply only to certain blendstocks that have properties that are ``dirtier''
than the 1990 Clean Air Act average fuel parameters for anti-dumping. Use of the term ``blendstock'' also means that
tracking applies only to non-gasoline petroleum products that are used in the production of gasoline (see 40 CFR 80.2(s)).
As a result, refiners and importers are not required to track non-gasoline petroleum products where the refiner or
importer can demonstrate these products are used for a purpose other than gasoline blending.

Beginning in 1995, refiners are required to determine the blendstock-to-gasoline ratio for each calendar year compliance
period. This compliance period ratio is then compared with the baseline ratio. During each year 1995 through 1997,
the annual compliance period ratio is compared with the largest ratio of the individual annual baseline ratios. Beginning
in 1998, the compliance period ratio will be the running four-year average of the annual ratios,

 In 1998, the compliance period ratio consists of the average of the ratios for 1995 through 1998; in 1999, the compliance

In the case of both the annual comparisons before 1998, and the average comparisons beginning in 1998, if the compliance

the refiner, unless certain exemptions are met or the refiner has been granted a waiver by EPA.

 For example, if the largest baseline annual ratio for a refinery is 5%, and the 1995 ratio for that refinery is 10%, this
increase would be 100%, and special blendstock accounting would be required for that refinery unless exempted for
other reasons.

In a case where special blendstock accounting is required, the refiner must include the properties of all blendstocks
produced in its compliance calculations for the two subsequent averaging periods. In addition, the refiner must
notify any recipients of such ``accounted-for'' blendstocks that the downstream party may not include the properties
in that party's calculations. The second and subsequent times that the compliance period ratio exceeds the ten percent
threshold, special blendstock accounting is required for the four years subsequent to the second exceedance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule includes a provision that allows a refiner to petition for a waiver from special blendstock accounting
in a case where the volume of blendstock produced is the result of extreme or unusual circumstances which are clearly
outside the control of the refiner and could not have been avoided, such as fire, accident, or natural disaster. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Blendstock tracking is limited under the final rule. Refiners with an annual compliance period blendstock-to-gasoline
ratio of three percent or less are exempt from special blendstock accounting, regardless of how the compliance period
ratio compares with the baseline ratio. This exemption is included because, in such a circumstance, there are limited
environmental effects, and the party has a limited ability to gain economic advantage from transferring production
to a less rigorous baseline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule also excludes from the blendstock tracking and accounting requirements blendstocks that are exported,
transferred to a refiner for use as a refinery feedstock, or are transferred between refineries that have been aggregated
under a common baseline. Also excluded are transfers for other than gasoline blending purposes, e.g., transfers
of product for use in a chemical process, because such other-than-gasoline-blending use renders the product non-blendstock
by definition. Such transactions are not indicative of an attempt by a refiner to gain an improper baseline.

A. Blendstock Accounting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's 1991 Notice Of Proposed Rulemaking for the anti-dumping program proposed compliance based on the properties
of finished gasoline only and did not address accounting for blendstocks. Commenters on this Notice stated that the
proposed anti-dumping regulations would create the opportunity for certain refiners to avoid the normally-applicable
baseline through the transfer of gasoline blendstocks to another refiner with a more lenient baseline. This opportunity
derives from the fact that the 1990 individual baseline for a large percentage of the refiners is more stringent than
the 1990 average. According to the commenters, a refiner who operates a refinery with such a more-stringent-than-average
baseline could effectively achieve an easier baseline by shifting blendstocks produced at that refinery to another
refinery with a less stringent baseline. Gasoline could then be ``produced'' at the blendstock-transferee refinery
using blendstocks produced at the blendstock-transferor refinery. This strategy could be accomplished, for example,
through the transfer of blendstocks to a refiner-blender who would use the statutory average baseline, such as a new
business. Commenters stated concern that refiners using this strategy would achieve a significant competitive
advantage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA agreed with these concerns, and in the 1992 Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposed requirements
on the methods of accounting for gasoline blendstocks. This blendstock accounting proposal was included to limit
the adverse environmental effects of such production transfers, by ensuring that each refiner meets the anti-dumping
standards using the baseline that properly applies to the refiner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to avoid the baseline-shifting possibility, EPA proposed that refiners would be required to either include
in the refinery compliance calculations all blendstocks produced at a refinery, or the products would be prohibited
for subsequent use in blending gasoline. Under this proposal, refiners would be required, with certain exceptions,
to chemically mark un-accounted-for products to ensure they are not used by downstream parties for gasoline blending.
This proposal included provisions intended to ensure that blendstock would be included in anti-dumping compliance
calculations by only one refiner, and prohibitions intended to prevent the use of marked petroleum products in gasoline
production. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters on the 1992 proposal objected to the blendstock accounting/marking scheme because of its impact on the
refining industry. Commenters raised concerns regarding the liability scheme and the paperwork requirements associated
with the accounting and the marking of blendstocks. Commenters also contended that the marking of blendstocks would
be disruptive to the chemical industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to these comments, EPA proposed a significantly revised blendstock accounting mechanism in the 1993
Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. This proposal eliminated the requirement that refiners account-for
or mark blendstocks and eliminated the prohibitions and liabilities associated with the use of marked blendstock.
Under this revised mechanism, refiners would be required to monitor the volume of certain blendstocks produced at
each refinery relative to the volume of gasoline produced. If for any year the proportion of a refinery's production
that is blendstock (the ``blendstock-to-gasoline ratio'') increased relative to the refinery's baseline blendstock-to-gasoline
ratio by ten percent or more, with certain exceptions the refinery would be required to account for all blendstocks
produced at the refinery during the year of the failure, or in the alternative any blender-recipient of blendstock
produced at that refinery would be required to use the refinery's baseline when accounting for such blendstock during
the year of the failure.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposal, a refiner would be exempt from special blendstock accounting if the refiner's blendstock-to-gasoline
ratio for any compliance year is three percent or less, regardless of how the increase compares with the baseline ratio.
Blendstock tracking would be required only for refiners having a 1990 baseline more stringent than the anti-dumping
statutory baseline. These provisions were designed to limit the blendstock accounting provisions to those circumstances
where there is likely to be an environmental problem. This also would help to avoid unnecessary costs and burdens on
the regulated community. In any case where EPA can show that a refiner transferred blendstocks in order to evade a more
stringent baseline, however, the special blendstock accounting would be required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations would require refiners to track only specified blendstocks that have properties that are
``dirtier'' than normal anti-dumping baseline properties; a list of such blendstocks was included. In addition,
tracking would not be required under the proposal for petroleum products the refiner could establish are used for
non-gasoline-blending purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA received substantial comments on the blendstock accounting mechanism included in the 1993 proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments addressed the manner in which the compliance period blendstock-to-gasoline ratios are compared
to the baseline ratios. Several commenters said that the blendstock-to-gasoline ratio for any annual averaging
period should be compared to the largest single-year ratio during the baseline period, and not to a multi-year averaging
period as proposed. This change is necessary, according to one commenter, because refinery equipment is shut-down
for maintenance during normal refinery operations (or a refinery equipment ``turnaround''), and that such turnarounds
often will result in increased blendstock shipments from a refinery. An industry group commenter further stated
that most refinery equipment goes through a maintenance turnaround every four years. Other commenters suggested
that the possibility of triggers due to erratic blendstock-to-gasoline ratios should be solved by enlarging the
ten percent ratio threshold.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA agrees with the concerns raised by these comments, and has modified the manner in which blendstock-to-gasoline
ratios are compared in the final rule. During 1995 through 1997, the annual compliance period blendstock-to-gasoline
ratio is compared to the largest one-year ratio during the baseline period. Beginning in 1998, however, because of
data availability due to the implementation of the reformulated gasoline regulations the compliance period ratio
is a running average consisting of the average of the current year's ratio and the ratios from the three previous years.
This four-year compliance period ratio is compared to the similar four-year baseline ratio. EPA believes this approach
to evaluating blendstock-to-gasoline ratios responds to the concerns raised by the commenters, and will minimize
if not eliminate the chance that the ten percent threshold will be exceeded because of maintenance, turnarounds and
other like events that do not indicate a transfer of production to achieve a less stringent baseline. For example,
any increase in blendstock sales volume during the compliance period that is due to refinery equipment turnaround
should be matched by blendstock sales volume during the baseline period that also is due to a turnaround. Beginning
in 1998 the comparison of four-year averages should further dampen any unusual, short-term deviations from the normal
proportion of refinery sales that is blendstock.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes comparing the blendstock-to-gasoline ratio of a four-year compliance period with a four-year baseline
period provides the best indication of a refiner's overall approach to blendstock production, because of its correlation
with the normal period of refinery equipment turnarounds. During the first three years of the program when a four-year
compliance period is not possible, however, the approach of comparing each compliance year's blendstock-to-gasoline
ratio with the largest single year's ratio during the baseline period is the best alternative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes the one-year ratio comparison approach is inferior to the four-year ratio comparison approach as a long-term
program mechanism, because under the one-year approach there is the potential for refiners to have large blendstock-to-gasoline
ratios in each year that are not due to normal refinery operations, yet these ratios would be acceptable if smaller
than the largest one-year ratio from the baseline period. The final rule nevertheless includes the one-year approach
for 1995 through 1997, because refiners will be required to include 1995 through 1997 blendstock ratios in their 1998
four-year average ratio. Any refiner who has produced excess blendstock in order to ``game'' the one-year comparison
approach during the first three program years is likely to fail the more appropriate four-year comparison in 1998.
EPA believes the likelihood such a refiner would violate the ten percent threshold and incur the consequent blendstock
accounting requirements will constrain refiner gaming of this type.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has retained the ten percent blendstock-to-gasoline ratio trigger in the final rule, however, because a trigger
at this level is appropriate for the like-time-period comparisons used in the final rule. With the promulgated approach,
EPA believes that blendstock sales increases in excess of the trigger are only likely to occur in cases where a refiner
attempts to improperly gain use of a less stringent baseline.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments focused on the two options proposed for special blendstock accounting, the first option with the
refiner accounting for the blendstock and the second option with the downstream refiner-blender using the baseline
of the blendstock producer-refiner. These commenters stated that refiners using the refiner-accounting option
would have difficulty if it became apparent late in the year that the ratio threshold would be exceeded, because the
required adjustment must reflect the total volume of all blendstocks produced and sold during the entire year. These
commenters stated that the refiner-accounting option also would be difficult to implement because downstream refiner-blenders
of the blendstock, who would have included blendstock received during the year in compliance planning, would have
to recalculate compliance with the refiner-accounted blendstock excluded. Similar timing and complexity concerns
were expressed in the case of a refiner who selected the option of shifting the refiner's baseline to blendstock recipients.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA agrees with these comments, and has modified the final rule as a result. In any case where the blendstock-to-gasoline
threshold is exceeded, special blendstock accounting is required beginning in the subsequent averaging period.
This change will avoid the timing and complexity problems of requiring refiners and downstream blendstock recipients
to recalculate compliance retroactively for the compliance period during which the threshold is exceeded. In addition,
EPA has rethought the option of allowing refiners to pass the refiner baseline to blendstock recipients, and has excluded
this option from the final rule. EPA believes that the burden of special blendstock accounting should fall on the refiner
that produces the excess blendstock, and such parties should not be allowed to pass the accounting responsibility
to downstream parties. EPA proposed the option of allowing refiners to pass the refiner-baseline to downstream blender-refiners
in order to allow more flexibility in meeting the anti-dumping requirements. EPA now believes that this flexibility
advantage is outweighed by countervailing considerations, including the complexity that results from this option,
the equity in placing the blendstock accounting responsibility only on the refiner who has control over the volume
of blendstocks that is produced, and the inequity that could result if a refiner imposed a more stringent baseline
on downstream blender-refiners.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter expressed concern that the reason EPA proposed blendstock accounting measures was to prevent new blender-refiners
from entering the market in order to correct a perceived ``loophole'' in the proposed rules, and that such market manipulation
by EPA is inappropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA agrees that the anti-dumping program should not preclude new blenders from entering the market, and does not believe
that the final regulations have such a result. Any refiner who enters the market beginning in 1995 will have the same
regulatory requirements as refiners who were in business before that date. They of course will have the statutory
baseline and not a baseline that is more stringent than the statutory baseline. A new refiner would therefore not be
subject to the blendstock accounting requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has implemented the following changes in the final rule in response to comments: (1) The gasoline portion of the
compliance period blendstock-to-gasoline ratio has been expanded to include all gasoline produced, including
reformulated gasoline and RBOB, because a comparison to conventional gasoline alone would more likely cause the
trigger to be exceeded and not represent true incidences of dumping; (2) straight run naphtha has been excluded from
the list of applicable blendstocks that are included in the blendstock portion of the blendstock-to-gasoline ratio,
because properties of this product are cleaner than the anti-dumping statutory baseline; and (3) feedstocks, exported
blendstocks, and blendstocks transferred between refineries that are aggregated for compliance purposes are excluded
from the blendstock portion of the ratio, as they are not indicative of a transfer of production to avoid a more stringent
baseline.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA proposed that refiners would be exempt from special blendstock accounting if the compliance period blendstock-to-gasoline
ratio is three percent or less, regardless of how this ratio compares with the baseline ratio. One commenter stated
that EPA should either reduce the three percent threshold for this exemption, or eliminate the exemption altogether.
The commenter claimed that refiners could produce primarily dirty blendstocks (e.g., benzene) within the three
percent limit for sale into the downstream market, which would result in environmental degradation. This commenter
further stated that with the three percent exemption, only approximately fifteen percent of refiners would be required
to monitor the blendstock-to-gasoline ratio under EPA's proposed scheme. This commenter also stated that the blendstock
tracking provisions should apply to all refiners and not only to parties with more-rigorous-than-statutory baselines,
because all parties have the opportunity to sell dirty blendstocks into the downstream market.

EPA disagrees with the concern raised by this comment. Any party who combines blendstocks to produce conventional
gasoline, or who combines blendstocks (other than oxygenate) with conventional gasoline, is considered to be a ``refiner''
under the anti-dumping regulations, and is required to meet all anti-dumping standards and requirements. Moreover,
such a blender-refiner is required to meet anti-dumping standards only on the basis of the volume and properties of
the blendstock used, and may not include in compliance calculations the volume and properties of any gasoline used
in blending. Any blender-refiner must, therefore, offset any ``dirty'' blendstocks used with sufficient ``clean''
blendstocks to meet the anti-dumping standards on average. Most downstream blender-refiners will be subject to
the anti-dumping statutory baseline.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes these requirements on blender-refiners will limit the opportunities for refiners to produce and sell
``dirty'' blendstocks. In addition, because any ``dirty'' blendstocks must be offset with ``clean'' blendstocks
the gasoline produced will cause no environmental degradation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA does not agree with the comment that all refiners could gain an advantage from shifting blendstocks regardless
of their baseline. Only refiners with a baseline more-stringent-than-statutory could shift blendstocks to another
refiner with the average baseline and thereby circumvent the anti-dumping requirements. For a refiner with a less-stringent-than-statutory
baseline, the statutory baseline is more stringent. As a result, blendstock shifted by such a refiner to another refiner
with the statutory baseline would have to meet standards as measured against a more stringent baseline. A refiner
with a less-stringent-than-statutory baseline similarly would not be able to circumvent the baseline provisions
merely by shifting blendstock to another refiner with an even less stringent individual refinery 1990 baseline,
because the volume of gasoline that may be produced against the individual refinery 1990 baseline is limited to the
second refiner's 1990 equivalent gasoline volume.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Compliance for any gasoline produced in excess of the 1990 equivalent gasoline volume is measured against the Clean
Air Act statutory baseline. In consequence, if blendstocks are shifted by one refiner to another with a more lenient
baseline, in effect the shifted blendstock must meet standards measured against the statutory baseline.

B. Inclusion of Oxygenate in Anti-Dumping Compliance Calculations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Oxygenates are included in the set of products that may be included in anti-dumping compliance calculations under
certain conditions, because the oxygenate used in the production of conventional gasoline alters the results of
the anti-dumping compliance calculations. As a result, where a refiner or importer is able to establish that oxygenate
is in fact added to gasoline or blendstock produced or imported by that party, it is appropriate to allow the refiner
or importer to include the oxygenate in compliance calculations. This approach to oxygenate use under anti-dumping
is consistent with the proposals, but the final rule clarifies the manner in which parties must demonstrate that oxygenate
is in fact used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the SNPRM 92 and SNPRM 93, EPA proposed that the inclusion of oxygenate volume in compliance calculations by refiners
and importers would be optional, except as required in the calculation of other exhaust emission products under the
applicable model. These proposals did not, however, specify the manner in which the oxygenate use showing must be
made. EPA believes the provisions included in the final rule dealing with the oxygenate use showing during compliance
periods is necessary in order to ensure conventional gasoline emissions are accurately reported.

EPA proposed that any refiner or importer who elects to include oxygenate in its compliance calculations would be
required to include oxygenates in its 1990 baseline as well. Under the final rule, however, refiners and importers
are required to include oxygenate in anti-dumping baselines whether or not oxygenate is included in compliance calcuations.
The baseline-setting process, including the treatment of oxygenate, is discussed in preamble section VIII.

Oxygenate blenders are not required to demonstrate compliance with anti-dumping standards because the blending
of oxygenate has only a positive effect on the quality of gasoline or blendstock with which oxygenate is blended with
regard to the properties or emission products regulated under anti-dumping.

Under 40 CFR 80.2(ll), an oxygenate blending facility is ``any facility (including a truck) at which oxygenate is
added to gasoline or blendstock, and at which the quality or quantity of gasoline is not altered in any other manner
except for the addition of deposit control additives.'' Under 40 CFR 80.2(mm), an oxygenate blender is ``any person
who owns, leases, operates, controls, or supervises an oxygenate blending facility, or who owns or controls the blendstock
or gasoline used or the gasoline produced at an oxygenate blending facility.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Oxygenate blenders are regulated under the anti-dumping provisions, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 to the extent the oxygenate they blend is used in the compliance calculations of the refiner or importer who produces
or imports the base gasoline used by the oxygenate blender. In this situation, the oxygenate blender is required,
with regard to this oxygenate blending, to maintain records and to allow EPA inspections.

Oxygenate that is blended at a refinery or import facility would be included in compliance calculations as a matter
of course because the oxygen (along with all other gasoline constituents) would be reflected in the batch analyses
conducted of the gasoline using samples collected before the gasoline left the refinery or import facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements that must be met in order for refiners and importers to be allowed to claim oxygenates which are blended
downstream are similar to the requirements relating to reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygenate blending
(RBOB) in the reformulated gasoline program. The thrust of these requirements is that the refiner or importer must
show that the oxygenate claimed was in fact added to the refiner's or importer's gasoline. This could be shown if the
refiner or importer is able to demonstrate that it blended the oxygenate while the gasoline (or gasoline blendstock)
is still owned by the refiner or importer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the downstream blending is carried out by a person other than the refiner or importer, in order to include the oxygenate
in its compliance calculations the refiner or importer must have a contract with the downstream blender which mandates
procedures that are necessary for proper blending. In addition, the refiner or importer must monitor the downstream
blending operation in a manner reasonably calculated to ensure the oxygenate use claimed by the refiner or importer
is accurate. Such monitoring must include audits, inspections, and sampling and testing of gasoline produced by
the downstream blender. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions that must be included in the contract with the oxygenate blender are those which the refiner or importer
believes are necessary to ensure the oxygenate claimed by the refiner or importer is in fact added. At a minimum, the
contract should provide for the inspections, sampling and testing, and audits by the refiner or importer over the
oxygenate blending operation, as well as any quality assurance measures the refiner or importer feels the oxygenate
blender should carry out. The contract also could specify the technical manner in which oxygenate is blended, if necessary
to support the refiner's or importer's oxygenate use claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inspections and periodic sampling and testing oversight requirement is intended to ensure any oxygenate-use
claims by a refiner or importer are supported by the actual oxygenate blending that occurs. The sampling and testing
must be of the gasoline that is produced at the oxygenate blending operation, using base gasoline that was produced
or imported by the refiner or importer. If the volume percent oxygenate found through sampling and testing is inconsistent
with the refiner's or importer's claimed oxygenate volume, the refiner or importer must resolve the inconsistency
in order to include the oxygenate in its compliance calculations. EPA believes the sampling and testing should be
unannounced, should occur at different times during the portion of the averaging period when oxygenate is blended,
and that the overall frequency is dependent on the situation. The sampling and testing should increase in frequency
as the oxygenate volume increases, with oxygenate blenders who are less sophisticated, or where the refiner has any
reason to question the oxygenate blending operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Inspections by refiners and importers should be calculated to determine if the oxygenate blender is complying with
the procedures included in the contract with the oxygenate blender, such as quality assurance by the blender. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that audits must occur at least annually, and more frequently if there is any reason for the refiner or
importer to question the oxygenate blending operation. EPA further believes that audits must include, at a minimum,
review of records that reflect the types and volumes of oxygenate purchased and used by the downstream blender to ensure
they are consistent with the refiner's or importer's claims. In a case where the oxygenate blender is using base gasoline
that is produced or imported by more than one refiner or importer, the audit must distinguish the oxygenate blended
with the different refiner's or importer's base gasoline. In a case where the base gasoline is fungibly mixed with
gasolines from other refiners or importers prior to its receipt by the downstream blender, the audit must account
for the portion of the fungible mixture that is the gasoline produced by the refiner or imported by the importer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of the complexities inherent in tracking gasoline through the fungible distribution system, EPA believes
in most cases it will be impracticable for refiners or importers to effectively monitor downstream oxygenate blending
with gasoline that is shipped fungibly, and as a result the refiner or importer normally would be precluded from including
the oxygenate in compliance calculations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In any case where the downstream oxygenate use claims by a refiner or importer are not supported by the inspections,
sampling and testing, or audits, or where EPA is able to establish that the oxygenate use claims by the refiner or importer
are incorrect, the refiner or importer would not be allowed to include the oxygenate in compliance calculations.
If the error is discovered subsequent to the conclusion of an averaging period, moreover, the refiner or importer
would be required to recalculate its compliance calculations for the averaging period 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

with the anti-dumping standards.

 Base gasoline meets the gasoline definition where the gasoline has the properties of gasoline that also is sold for

to produce 89.6 octane gasoline, and 87 octane gasoline is commonly sold for use without oxygenate blending. 87 octane

 For example, 85 octane blendstock_a ``sub-octane'' blendstock_is sometimes produced with the intention that with

Potentially there are ``sub-octane'' blendstocks that become gasoline solely through the addition of oxygenate
and that have octanes that are lower than the octane of any gasoline sold anywhere in the United States. Such a product
would not meet the definition of gasoline, but would be a blendstock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA nevertheless believes that the refiner or importer who produces or imports ``sub-octane'' base gasoline product,
rather than the oxygenate blender, should include the product in its compliance calculations for several reasons.
First, the emissions performance of such products is determined primarily through its basic properties and not by
the addition of oxygenate. Second, to the extent that a refiner or importer produced or imported ``sub-octane'' base
gasoline in 1990, thus contributing to the quality of the gasoline pool in 1990, such product should be part of that
refiner's or importer's conventional gasoline pool in 1995. Third, the refiner or importer of such product is likely
to be more sophisticated than oxygenate blenders in defining the quality of conventional gasoline necessary to meet
the requirements of the anti-dumping program, and in meeting the range of anti-dumping requirements that apply to
refiners. Oxygenate blenders, who often are truck splash blender-distributors, are not required to meet anti-dumping
standards (for reasons discussed above), but placing the responsibility of accounting for ``sub-octane'' base
gasoline on oxygenate blenders would result in these parties becoming ``refiners'' who are subject to the full scope
of anti-dumping requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, if refiners and importers who produce or import ``sub-octane'' blendstock could avoid including this product
in their compliance calculations, the anti-dumping enforcement requirements would have to be expanded to include
complex (and expensive) product tracking and accounting mechanisms designed to ensure product of this type ultimately
is accounted for, and is included in the compliance calculations of only a single party. EPA believes, therefore,
that it is appropriate for the refiners and importers of ``sub-octane'' blendstocks to include such products in their
compliance calculations under the anti-dumping program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This requirement for refiners and importers to include sub-octane ``blendstock'' in compliance calculations is
consistent with, but less far-reaching than, the proposal contained in the 1992 SNPRM that refiners and importers
would be required to account for all blendstock produced or imported.

D. Compliance Calculations for Blendstock That Is Blended With Gasoline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the SNPRM 93, EPA proposed that parties who produce gasoline solely by combining different blendstocks could determine
compliance on the basis of the properties and volumes of the blendstocks without performing a full analysis of the
final blends. This compliance determination approach also was intended to apply to parties who add blendstocks to
finished gasoline which has been included in another party's compliance calculations. Under this proposal, refiners
and importers would insert the properties and values of the blendstocks into the equations for the complex and simple
model standards. EPA now believes this compliance calculation approach is appropriate only for simple model standards,
but not for complex model standards because blendstocks have parameters that are outside the range of the complex
model. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This approach is included in the final rule for refiners and importers subject to the simple model because a blender-refiner
can calculate the volume-weighted averages of sulfur, T&hyph;90, olefins, and exhaust benzene using blendstock
analyses only.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For example, consider a blender-refiner who has the anti-dumping statutory baseline, which for olefins is 10.6 vol%.
The simple model anti-dumping standard for olefins is no greater than 125% times 10.8, or 13.50 vol%. In this example
the blender-refiner used two blendstocks during the averaging period, 10,000 gallons of light FCC naphtha which
the blender-refiner sampled and tested and determined to contain 39.8 vol% olefins. The blender-refiner also used
25,000 gallons of reformate that through the blender-refiner's sampling and testing was determined to contain 1.0
vol% olefins. The blender-refiner in this example determined the annual average olefin content of its blendstock
by calculating the volume-weighted average olefin content of these two blendstocks, or (10,000 * 39.8) plus (25,000
* 1.0) divided by 35,000, or 11.8 vol% olefins. Because 11.8 vol% is less than the 13.25 vol% olefin standard, the blender-refiner
in this example would meet the anti-dumping olefin standard. Annual averages for the blender-refiner for sulfur,
T&hyph;90, and exhaust benzene under the simple model would be calculated in a similar manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that compliance with complex model standards cannot be determined using the volume-weighted properties
of blendstock as described above, because such an approach would not provide meaningful results for exhaust benzene,
or toxics or NO

 emissions performance. EPA has, however, included a method in the final rule for calculating compliance under the
complex model in the case of blendstock that is added to gasoline whereby compliance is determined on the basis of blendstocks
blended with gasoline. This results in a calculation method that is consistent with the technical limitations inherent
with the complex model. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this calculation method, the blender-refiner determines the fuel parameters of the blendstock or blendstocks
that are to be added to a base gasoline, by testing a representative sample of each blendstock. The blender-refiner
then calculates the properties of the gasoline that would result if the blendstock or blendstocks were blended, in
the volume-ratio used in the blending operation, with a gasoline having parameters that are equal to anti-dumping
baseline applicable to the blender-refiner, except that properties measured on a weight or ppm basis, such as sulfur,
must be corrected for the specific gravities of the products blended. In most cases, the anti-dumping statutory baseline
would be the applicable baseline for blender-refiners. This mathematical calculation thus models the fuel parameters
of the gasoline that would result if the blendstock in question were in fact blended with gasoline having properties
equal to the blender-refiner's baseline in the volume-ratio used in the blending operation. The emissions performance
(exhaust benzene, or toxics or NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions performance) of the mathematically-created gasoline is determined through the appropriate complex
model, as is the emissions performance of the blender-refiner's baseline gasoline. The emissions performance effect
of the blendstock is calculated by subtracting the emissions performance of the blender-refiner's baseline gasoline
from the emissions performance of the mathematically-calculated gasoline. The anti-dumping standard is met if
the volume-weighted emissions performance for all blendstock used in blends during the averaging period is equal
to or less than zero.

The blender-refiner determines the properties of the blends that would result if these blendstocks were blended
at these rates with gasoline having properties equal to the anti-dumping statutory baseline. In the case of aromatics,
the calculation would be the following:

All other parameters required for the complex model would be calculated in a similar manner to create a list of calculated
parameters except for the determination of RVP for ethanol blends. Because of the high RVP of ethanol and its non-linear
blending characteristics, gasoline blends with at least 1.50% ethanol by volume should be entered into the appropriate
complex model with an assumed RVP 1.0 psi greater than that of the base gasoline and other blendstocks. Below 1.50%
ethanol concentration, the RVP of the base gasoline and blendstock should be unchanged for calculation purposes
in the complex model. These parameters are then applied to the complex model to generate the values of the exhaust benzene,
toxics and NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 211(k)(6) of the Act allows certain areas to opt into the reformulated gasoline (RFG) program. Thus, such
areas may choose to participate in the RFG program, unlike the nine areas with the highest ozone design values which
are required to participate.

Vermont and portions of other areas in Pennsylvania and New Hampshire have formally requested to opt-in to the reformulated
gasoline program, although the designated areas in these states are categorized as unclassified/attainment. Because
of statutory limitations, attainment areas will not be allowed to opt-in to the program, with a limited exception
given to some areas in established ozone transport regions as authorized by section 184 of the Act. The reader is referred
to the RIA for further discussion of the statutory limitations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other ozone nonattainment areas that are not listed herein may also opt-in to the reformulated gasoline program as
permitted by section 211(k)(6), under constraints such as sufficient lead-time domestic fuel availability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several key issues were brought to EPA's attention in the form of comments, and EPA's response is summarized below.
More detailed discussion of these opt-in issues can be found in Section IX of the Final Regulatory Impact Analysis
(RIA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenter inquiries pertained to opting out of the reformulated gasoline program. Once an area has opted
into the reformulated gasoline program, the issue arises whether it may, at a later date, decide to opt out of the program.
While EPA is currently considering opt-out provisions, section 211(k) does not give EPA the authority to develop
an opt-out procedure. Thus, EPA is not including any opt-out provisions in this rulemaking, but may pursue a separate
action in the future that would allow states to opt-out of the RFG program, provided sufficient notice is given. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its April 1993 NPRM, EPA requested comment on whether to permit areas to opt-in to only Phase I (1995&hyph;99) of
the RFG program, and not require them to receive Phase II RFG starting in 2000. Several commenters supported allowing
states to opt-in to Phase I only, but cited a number of concerns regarding the logistics of producing and distributing
Phase I and Phase II reformulated gasolines concurrently. Because of these potential fuel proliferation problems
(i.e., many types of fuels available or required in the marketplace at one time), as well as enforcement problems and
weak statutory authority (which is discussed further in the RIA), EPA will not allow nonattainment areas to opt-in
to only Phase I. Opt-in areas must be willing to commit to the change to Phase II RFG in the year 2000. As discussed above,
EPA may undertake a separate action which would give opted-in areas the opportunity to opt-out of the RFG program.
In this case if a state desired to maintain the Phase I RFG standards beyond the year 1999, the state could promulgate
its own regulations requiring this. Such a program would have to be enforced by the state, however, and would also have
to be approved by EPA as part of the State Implementation Plan review process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed briefly above, some of the comments received by EPA included a request that attainment areas be permitted
to opt-in to the RFG program. The Act does not allow participation by attainment areas into the reformulated gasoline
program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also received suggestions that it modify the opt-in application procedure to allow more lead time for refiners.
EPA feels that its existing application procedure for opt-in and its lead time provisions are adequate, and do not
require revision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, one commenter suggested that opt-in should be allowed only after a nonattainment area has adopted Stage
II controls and enhanced inspection and maintenance. EPA favors giving eligible areas freedom to opt-in to the RFG
provisions, and will not require that areas first implement Stage II controls and enhanced inspection and maintenance.

 standard for Phase II reformulated gasoline (see Section VI above) will be required in all current and future opt-in
areas. As discussed in the Section VI of the RIA, NO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control is believed to be necessary to ensure that all opt-in areas realize a reduction in ozone levels. Since future
opt-in areas are likely to be similar to some current reformulated gasoline areas (including current opt-in) in terms
of geographical location, meteorological conditions, and other factors affecting ozone formation, it is reasonable
to assume that future opt-in areas will similarly benefit from NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standard to the same areas as the reformulated gasoline standard is considered to be the most appropriate and cost
effective manner in which to achieve ozone benefits through fuel reformulation. Since refiners will already be producing
reformulated gasoline controlling both VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the addition of new areas to the reformulated gasoline program will only require an increase in the volume of RFG produced
and will not pose any leadtime problems.

XI. Federal Preemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Whenever the federal government regulates in an area, the issue of preemption of State action in the same area is raised.
The regulations proposed here will affect virtually all of the gasoline sold in the United States. As opposed to commodities
that are produced and sold in the same area of the country, gasoline produced in one area is often distributed to other
areas. The national scope of gasoline production and distribution suggests that federal rules should preempt State
action to avoid an inefficient patchwork of potentially conflicting regulations. Indeed, Congress provided in
the 1977 Amendments to the Clean Air Act that federal fuels regulations preempt non-identical State controls except
under certain specified circumstances (see, section 211(c)(4) of the Clean Air Act). EPA believes that the same approach
to federal preemption is desirable for the reformulated gasoline and anti-dumping programs. EPA, therefore, is
issuing today's final rule under the authority of sections 211 (k) and (c), and promulgate under section 211(c)(4)
that dissimilar State controls be preempted unless either of the exceptions to federal preemption specified by section
211(c)(4) applies. Those exceptions are sections 211(c)(4) (B) and (C). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As raised in some of comments received by the Agency, the Regulatory Negotiation agreement was not intended to modify
the provisions of section 211(c)(4)(B). Under this provision, once the State of California has received a waiver
under section 209(b) of the Clean Air Act, it has the ability to regulate fuels and fuel additives without the need for
a waiver under section 211 of the Clean Air Act. In accordance with the intent of Congress in enacting sections 209(b)
and 211(c)(4)(B) of the Clean Air Act, California has used, and EPA understands will continue to use, these provisions
to design a program to meet its unique needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the limited federal preemption promulgated here appropriately balances the utility and efficacy
of uniform national rules with States' needs to address their unique pollution problems.

XII. Environmental and Economic Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Environmental Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 211(k) of the Clean Air Act indicates that the primary purposes of reformulated gasoline are to reduce ozone-forming
VOC emissions during the high ozone season and emissions of toxic air pollutants during the entire year. Reductions
in VOCs are environmentally significant because of the associated reductions in ozone formation and in secondary
formation of particulate matter, with the associated improvements in human health and welfare. Reductions in emissions
of toxic air pollutants are environmentally important because they carry significant benefits for human health
and welfare primarily by reducing the number of cancer cases each year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Phase I Reformulated Gasoline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Beginning in 1995, reformulated gasoline certified during Phase I of the program must achieve a nominal emissions
reduction of 15 percent for VOCs, 16.5 percent for air toxics on average, and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions are not allowed to increase beyond levels evident in baseline gasoline. EPA expects simple model fuels
to meet these Clean Air Act standards. As discussed in the section IV, high ozone season fuels certified using the complex
model during Phase I of the reformulated gasoline program in VOC control region I must provide a VOC emission reduction
from baseline levels of 36.6 percent when complying on average and 35.1 percent when complying on a per-gallon basis.
Similarly, high ozone season fuels certified using the complex model during Phase I in VOC Control Region 2 must provide
a VOC emission reduction from baseline levels of 17.1 percent when complying on average and 15.6 percent when complying
on a per-gallon basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency projects that VOC emission reductions for Phase I of reformulated gasoline will be approximately 90&hyph;140
thousand tons during the summer period for the ``nine cities'' and the other areas that have currently opted into the
program. Assuming a one year exposure to both the baseline and controlled level of toxic emissions, the number of cancer
incidences is estimated to decrease by approximately 16 (assuming enhanced I/M in place) or 24 (assuming basic I/M
in place) incidences per each year that the program is in place, in the nine cities and the opt-in areas (refer to section
V of the RIA for an explanation and methodology of these numbers). These reductions will naturally increase to the
extent that other areas opt into the program.

2. Phase II Reformulated Gasoline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Beginning in the year 2000, reformulated gasoline certified on average must meet a VOC emission reduction standard
of 27.4 percent in VOC control region 2 and 29.0 percent in VOC control region 1, as well as a toxic emission reduction
standard on average of 21.5 percent. In addition, a NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emission reduction standard of 6.8 percent on average is required for Phase II of reformulated gasoline. The Agency
projects that under Phase II, there will be 3&hyph;4 fewer incidences of cancer per year, summertime VOC emissions
will be reduced by approximately 42,000 tons, and summertime NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions will be reduced by approximately 22,000 tons in the nine cities and other areas currently opted into the
RFG program (incremental to Phase I).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Phase I Reformulated Gasoline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Due to the required addition of oxygenates to gasoline and to refinery processing changes that will be needed to reduce
fuel benzene and RVP levels and to meet the VOC, NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and toxic emission standards, the cost of producing reformulated gasoline certified under Phase I, is expected to
increase by approximately 3&hyph;5 cents per gallon in 1995 above the cost of conventional gasoline. We project annual
costs of $700 to $940 million for both those areas mandated to be part of the program and those that have chosen to opt-in.
Additionally, there will be costs due to testing, enforcement and recordkeeping. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Phase II Reformulated Gasoline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed in Section VI, The overall cost of the Phase II reformulated gasoline VOC standards and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standards for Phase II RFG is approximately 1.2 cents per gallon (incremental to Phase I RFG) during the VOC control
period when the more stringent VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standards are in effect. There should be no additional cost during the non-VOC control period, since only the toxics
standard changes, and there is not expected to be a cost for year-round toxics control above that required for Phase
I RFG. In addition, EPA does not expect non-production related costs, such as distribution costs, recordkeeping
and reporting costs, etc., to increase significantly relative to Phase I reformulated gasoline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The environmental and economic impacts of the reformulated gasoline program are described in more detail in the Section
V and VI of the Final Regulatory Impact Analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
XIII. Public Participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the reformulated gasoline rulemaking, EPA encouraged and welcomed full public participation in arriving
at its final decisions and developing its final rule. EPA met with representatives of the automobile, petroleum,
and oxygenate industries as well as environmental and citizen organizations. Their concerns and ideas were considered
in the development in this final rule for reformulated gasoline. Public workshops to discuss and resolve a variety
of issues on several aspects of the reformulated gasoline program were sponsored by the Agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, EPA solicited, reviewed, and considered written comments on all aspects of its three previous proposals
and Phase II correction notice. All comments received by the Agency are located in the EPA Air Docket, Dockets A&hyph;91&hyph;02
and A&hyph;92&hyph;12 (See

XIV. Compliance With the Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980 requires federal agencies to examine the effects of the reformulated
gasoline regulation and to identify significant adverse impacts of federal regulations on a substantial number
of small entities. Because the RFA does not provide concrete definitions of ``small entity,'' ``significant impact,''
or ``substantial number,'' EPA has established guidelines setting the standards to be used in evaluating impacts
on small businesses
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
95
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. For purposes of the reformulated gasoline regulations, a small entity is any business which is independently owned
and operated and not dominant in its field as defined by SBA regulations under section 3 of the Small Business Act.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency has found that the reformulated gasoline and anti-dumping regulations may possibly have some economic
impact on a substantial number of small refiners. However, these regulations may not significantly affect gasoline
blenders, terminal operators, service stations and ethanol blenders under the same EPA criteria. Small business
entities are not required by the Clean Air Act to manufacture reformulated gasoline. Since most small refiners are
located in the mountain states or in California, which has its own (more stringent) reformulated gasoline program,
the vast majority of small refiners are unaffected by the federal reformulated gasoline requirements. Furthermore,
all businesses (both large and small) maintain the option to produce conventional gasoline to be sold in areas not
obligated by the Act to receive reformulated gasoline or those areas which have not chosen to opt into the program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All refiners will be affected by the anti-dumping requirements, which are less stringent than those for the reformulated
gasoline portion of the program. The anti-dumping regulations affecting conventional gasoline are not expected
to disproportionately impact small refiners of conventional gasoline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, all refiners have the option to use either the simple or complex model during the first years of the reformulated
gasoline program. Refiners have greater flexibility under the complex model than under the simple model (which focuses
primarily on volatility control) in choosing the least-cost method of compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The component of the reformulated gasoline program most likely to unfavorably impact small entities is the fundamental
necessity that reformulated gasoline meet more stringent emission standards and thus processing requirements.
The Agency is unaware of any alternative options which might relieve the regulatory burden on small entities while
simultaneously maintaining the program benefits required by the statute. Exempting small refiners from the reformulated
gasoline regulations would result in the failure of meeting CAA performance standards, which is illegal. All reformulated
gasoline is required to meet the same performance and compositional standards. Additionally, enforcement of a reformulated
gasoline program (with exemptions or less stringent standards for some fuel producers), in-use, would be virtually
impossible to enforce due to the inherent nature of the fungible gasoline distribution system in existence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite the inability to exempt small businesses from the requirements of the reformulated gasoline program, EPA
has made accommodations where possible. One example of the versatility embedded in the reformulated gasoline regulations,
by EPA, is the flexibility available to all refiners, both small and large, to choose to have one or more individual
refinery conventional gasoline compliance baselines and one or more ``refiner'' baselines (i.e., more than one
grouping of two or more refineries to form a compliance baseline). Another example of the flexibility of the regulations
is the ability to produce reformulated gasoline on a per gallon or averaging basis. Also, certain small refiners who
produced JP&hyph;4 jet fuel in 1990 may be able to adjust their baselines so as to reduce the compliance burden. It is
worthy to note that although EPA has received several comments which claim that the reformulated gasoline regulations
will result in closing the small business entities affected by this rule, convincing evidence supporting this claim
has not been submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 604 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, EPA has prepared a regulatory flexibility analysis
which includes a comprehensive justification for the determination briefly reviewed above, as well as a summary
and assessment of the issues raised by public comments on the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. The complete
analysis is contained within the Regulatory Impact Analysis which has been placed in the docket for this rulemaking:

XVI. Administrative Designation and Regulatory Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory
action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order
defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communitites; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory
action'' because the Administrator has determined that reformulated gasoline will cost well in excess of $100 million
per year and therefore should be classified as a significant regulatory action. As such, this action was submitted
to OMB for review. Changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations will be documented in the public
record: EPA Air Docket A&hyph;92&hyph;12. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) for the reformulated gasoline program has been prepared and placed in Public Docket
No. A&hyph;92&hyph;12 to accompany this EPA notice of final rulemaking. A draft version of the Regulatory Impact
Analysis was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review as required by Executive Order 12866.
Written comments from OMB and EPA response to those comments have also been placed in the public docket for this rulemaking.
EPA has made subsequent updates and revisions to the draft version pertinent to the use of the simple model. A final
version of the analysis is available in the docket cited above.

XVIII. Notice Regarding Registration of Reformulated Gasolines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is in the process of establishing new requirements for the registration of motor vehicle fuels and fuel additives
(F/FAs) as authorized by sections 211(b) and 211(e) of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
96
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal was published on April 15, 1992 (57 FR 13168). Pursuant to court order, EPA is scheduled to issue the final
rule on or before April 29, 1994. The new registration regulations would supplement existing requirements and would
apply to all F/FAs designated for registration, including reformulated gasoline and oxygenated gasolines. This
new rule would require manufacturers of designated F/FAs to conduct certain tests and submit information regarding
the composition and the potential health and welfare effects of the emissions produced by such F/FAs. Consistent
with statutory requirements, for products registered prior to the promulgation of the F/FA final rule the proposal
would allow a period of three years for the submission of certain data required by the rule. Under this proposal, manufacturers
of designated F/FAs not registered prior to the promulgation of the F/FA final rule would be required to submit the
requisite information prior to registration. This would mean that products not registered at the time of promulgation
of the final F/FA testing rule would not be allowed to be registered and sold until EPA receives the requisite health
effects information. In view of this proposed provision, EPA is advising manufacturers of reformulated gasoline
and oxygenated gasolines to promptly register their products (or update their current gasoline registrations)
so they can enter the marketplace and make use of the three-year time window allowed by the statute to conduct the required
tests. The purpose of this section is to provide some guidance to fuel producers on the registration process.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 211(a) registration of designated fuels and fuel additives is required as a precondition to introduction
into the marketplace. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To make the registration process more flexible and convenient, current registration procedures allow a fuel producer
to include in the original registration a list of additives that might be used in the marketed fuel, along with the applicable
range of concentration-in-use for each alternative. Manufacturers are also allowed to revise existing fuel registrations
to accommodate expected changes in their formulations. These provisions allow fuel producers to respond quickly
to fluctuations in price, availability, and other market or technical factors when they formulate their fuel products.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with this current practice, EPA will permit fuel producers to register their oxygenated gasoline formulations
(including reformulated gasoline) by simply revising their existing gasoline registrations to include the pertinent
oxygenating compound(s). Fuel producers who are uncertain about their future fuel formulations could potentially
list an unlimited number of oxygenates which they might, under some conceivable circumstances, blend into gasoline.
However, EPA would generally advise against the strategy of including every possible alternative oxygenate. The
fact that, for the sake of convenience, registrations are permitted to be modified to cover oxygenated gasolines
does not mean that all potential formulations which fit under this broad compositional umbrella will necessarily
be considered equivalent to a single fuel product. In fact, the F/FA final rule is expected to consider each gasoline/oxygenate
blend as a different formulation. Thus, fuel producers would be responsible for the testing of each gasoline/oxygenate
blend covered by the respective fuel registration. Furthermore, oxygenated compounds that are listed but not tested
within the allotted time period (i.e., three years) could not be used by the manufacturer. Thus, in determining which
oxygenate compounds to include in the registration, each producer should carefully consider the tradeoff between
the additional flexibility which a comprehensive list of potential oxygenates might provide and the additional
testing responsibility which might result.

Method A. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) The initial study of this method used a three component internal standard using the following calculations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The calibration points are constructed by calculating an amount ratio and response ratio for each level of a particular
peak in the instrument's calibration table. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The amount ratio is the amount of the compound divided by the amount of the internal standard for a given level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) The response ratio is the response of the compound divided by the response of the internal standard at this level.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) The equation for the curve through the calibration points is calculated using the type fit and origin handling
specified in the instrument's calibration table. In the initial study the fit was a second degree polynomial including
a forced zero for the origin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) The response of the compound in a sample is divided by the response of the internal standard to provide a response
ratio for that compound in the sample. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(G) A corrected amount ratio for the unknown is calculated using the curve fit equation determined in paragragh (f)(1)(ii)(E)
of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(H) The amount of the aromatic compound is equal to the corrected amount ratio times the Amount of Internal Standard.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(I) The total aromatics in the sample is the sum of the amounts of the individual aromatic compounds in the sample. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(J) An internal standard solution can be made with the following compounds at the listed concentrations in volume
percent. Also listed is the Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number (CAS), atomic mass unit (amu) on which the
detector must be set at the corresponding retention time if used in the selective ion mode, retention times in minutes,
and boiling point in 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C. (Other, similar, boiling point materials can be used which are not found in gasoline.) Retention times are
approximate and apply only to a 60 meter capillary column used in the initial study. Other columns and retention times
can be used.

(K) At least two calibration mixtures which bracket the measured total aromatics concentration must be made with
a representative mixture of aromatic compounds. The materials and concentrations used in the highest concentration
calibration level in the initial study for this method are listed in this paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(K). Also listed is
the Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number (CAS), atomic mass unit (amu) on which the detector must be set for
the corresponding retention time if used in the selective ion mode, retention times in minutes, and in some cases boiling
point in 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C. The standards are made in 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (iso-octane), [540&hyph;84&hyph;1]. Other aromatic
compounds, and retention times may be acceptable as long as the aromatic values produced meet the criteria found in
the quality assurance section for the aromatic methods.

(E) The total aromatics is the sum of all the percent normalized aromatic amounts in the sample. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) This method allows quantification of non-aromatic compounds in the sample. However, correct quantification
can only be achieved if the instrument's calibration table can identify the compounds that are responsible for at
least 95 volume percent of the sample and meets the following quality control criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Quality assurance. (i) The performance standards will be from repeated measurement of the calibration mixture,
standard reference material, or process control gasoline. The uncertainty in the measured aromatics percentages
in the standards must be less than 2.0 volume percent in the fuel at a 95% confidence level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the bias of the standard mean is greater than 2% of the theoretical value, then the standard measurement and
measurements of all samples measured subsequent to the previous standard measurement that met the performance criteria
must be repeated after re-calibrating the instrument. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Replicate samples must be within 3.0 volume percent of the previous sample or within 2.0 volume percent of the
mean at the 95% confidence level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Alternative test method. (i) Prior to January 1, 1997, any refiner or importer may determine aromatics content
using ASTM standard method D&hyph;1319&hyph;93, entitled ``Standard Test Method for Hydrocarbon Types in Liquid
Petroleum Products by Fluorescent Indicator Adsorption,'' for purposes of meeting any testing requirement involving
aromatics content; provided that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Introduction; scope of application. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) The following single-column, direct-injection gas chromatographic procedure is a technique for quantifying
the oxygenate content of gasoline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) This method covers the quantitative determination of the oxygenate content of gasoline through the use of an
oxygenate flame ionization detector (OFID). It is applicable to individual organic oxygenated compounds (up to
20 mass percent each) in gasoline having a final boiling point not greater than 220 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C. Samples above this level should be diluted to fall within the specified range. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The total concentration of oxygen in the gasoline, due to oxygenated components, may also be determined with
this method by summation of all peak areas except for dissolved oxygen, water, and the internal standard. Sensitivities
to each component oxygenate must be incorporated in the calculation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) All oxygenated gasoline components (alcohols, ethers, etc.) may be assessed by this method. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The total mass percent of oxygen in the gasoline due to oxygenated components also may be determined with this method
by summing all peak areas except for dissolved oxygen, water, and the internal standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Where trade names or specific products are noted in the method, equivalent apparatus and chemical reagents may
be used. Mention of trade names or specific products is for the assistance of the user and does not constitute endorsement
by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A sample of gasoline is spiked to introduce an internal standard, mixed, and injected into a gas chromatograph (GC)
equipped with an OFID. After chromatographic resolution the sample components enter a cracker reactor in which they
are stoichiometrically converted to carbon monoxide (in the case of oxygenates), elemental carbon, and hydrogen.
The carbon monoxide then enters a methanizer reactor for conversion to water and methane. Finally, the methane generated
is determined by a flame ionization detector (FID).

(ii) Take a glass sample container and its PTFE faced rubber septum sealing cap. Transfer a quantity of an oxygenate
to the sample container and record the mass of the oxygenate to the nearest 0.1 mg. Repeat this process for any additional
oxygenates of interest except the internal standard. Add oxygenate-free gasoline to dilute the oxygenates to the
desired concentration. Record the mass of gasoline added to the nearest 0.1 mg, and determine and label the standard
according to the mass percent quantities of each oxygenate added. These standards are not to exceed 20 mass percent
for any individual pure component due to potential hydrocarbon breakthrough and/or loss of calibration linearity.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Inject a quantity of an internal standard (such as 2-butanol) and weigh the contents again. Record the difference
in masses as the mass of internal standard to the nearest 0.1 mg. The mass of the internal standard shall amount to between
2 and 6 percent of the mass of the test sample (standard). The addition of an internal standard reduces errors caused
by variations in injection volumes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Ensure that the prepared standard is thoroughly mixed and transfer approximately 2 Ml of the solution to a vial
compatible with the autosampler if such equipment is used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) At least five concentrations of each of the expected oxygenates should be prepared. The standards should be as
equally spaced as possible within the range and may contain more than one oxygenate. A blank for zero concentration
assessments is also to be included. Additional standards should be prepared for other oxygenates of concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Based on the recommended chromatographic operating conditions specified in paragraph (g)(7)(i) of this section,
determine the retention time of each oxygenate component by analyzing dilute aliquots either separately or in known
mixtures. Reference should be made to the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) registry number of each of the analytes
for proper identification. Approximate retention times for selected oxygenates under these conditions are as follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Prior to analysis of any samples, inject a sample of oxygenate-free gasoline into the GC to test for hydrocarbon
breakthrough overloading the cracker reactor. If breakthrough occurs, the OFID is not operating effectively and
must be corrected before samples can be analyzed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Prepare gasoline test samples for analysis as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Tare a glass sample container and its PTFE faced rubber septum sealing cap. Transfer a quantity of the gasoline
sample to the sample container and record the mass of the transferred sample to the nearest 0.1 mg. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Inject a quantity of the same internal standard (such as 2-butanol) used in generating the standards and weigh
the contents again. Record the difference in masses as the mass of internal standard to the nearest 0.1 mg. The mass
of the internal standard shall amount to between 2 and 6 percent of the mass of the test sample (standard). The addition
of an internal standard reduces errors caused by variations in injection volumes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Ensure that this test sample (gasoline plus internal standard) is thoroughly mixed and transfer approximately
2 mL of the solution to a vial compatible with the autosampler if such equipment is used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) After GC/OFID analysis, identify the oxygenates in the sample based on retention times, determine the peak area
of each oxygenate and of the internal standard, and calculate the relative area response factor for each oxygenate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Monitor the peak area of the internal standard. A larger than expected peak area for the internal standard when
analyzing a test sample may indicate that this oxygenate is present in the original sample. Prepare a new aliquot of
the sample without addition of the oxygenate internal standard. If the presence of the oxygenate previously used
as the internal standard can be detected, then either: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The concentration of this oxygenate must be assessed by the method of standard additions; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) An alternative internal standard, based on an oxygenate that is not present in the original sample, must be utilized
with new calibration curves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Calculate the relative mass response factor (R
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
mo
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and the calibration equation in paragraph (g)(6)(viii) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(viii) If the mass percent exceeds the calibrated range, gravimetrically dilute a portion of the original sample
to a concentration within the calibration range and analyze this sample starting with paragraph (g)(7)(iii) of this
section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ix) Report the total weight percent oxygen as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Subtract the peak areas due to dissolved oxygen, water, and the internal standard from the total summed peak areas
of the chromatogram. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Assume the total summed peak area solely due to one of the oxygenates that the instrument is calibrated for and determine
the total mass percent as that oxygenate based on paragraph (g)(7)(vii) of this section. For simplicity, chose an
oxygenate having one oxygen atom per molecule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Multiply this concentration by the molar mass of oxygen and divide by the molar mass of the chosen oxygenate to determine
the mass percent oxygen in the sample. For example, if the total peak area is based on MTBE, multiply by 16.00 (the molar
mass of atomic oxygen) and divide by 88.15 (the molar mass of MTBE). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The performance of individual laboratories may indeed be

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is recommended that control charts be utilized to monitor

 For reference purposes, a single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory study of repeatability was conducted on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 27 replicates at each of five concentrations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for each oxygenate. The variation of MTBE analyses as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measured by standard deviation was very linear with respect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to concentration. Where concentration is expressed as mass 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent, over the concentration range of 0.25 to 15.0 mass 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent this relationship is described by the equation:

 The relationship of standard deviation and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration for methanol between 0.27 and 1.07 mass 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent was very linear and is described by the equation:

 Based on these relationships, repeatability for

the selected oxygenates at 2.0 and 2.7 mass percent oxygen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were determined to be as follows, where repeatability is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined as the half width of the 95 percent confidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interval (i.e., 1.96 standard deviations) for a single

 Spiked samples shall be prepared by adding a volume of a standard to a known volume of sample. To ensure adequate method
detection limits, the volume of the standard added to the sample should be minimized to 5% or less of the volume of the
sample. The spiked sample should be carried through the same sample preparation steps as the background

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters included in the complex emission model set forth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in &sect;80.45 fall outside the range of values for which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complex emission model is deemed valid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) To augment the complex emission model described at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;80.45, the following requirements apply: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The petitioner must obtain prior approval from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator for the design of the test program before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beginning the vehicle testing process. To obtain approval, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the petitioner must at minimum provide the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information: the fuel parameter to be evaluated for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission effects; the number and description of vehicles to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be used in the test fleet, including model year, model name, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle identification number (VIN), mileage, emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance (exhaust THC emission level), technology type, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and manufacturer; a description of the methods used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procure and prepare the vehicles; the properties of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuels to be used in the testing program (as specified at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;80.49); the pollutants and emission categories intended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be evaluated; the precautions used to ensure that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects of the parameter in question are independent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects of other parameters already included in the model; a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
description of the quality assurance procedures to be used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the test program; the statistical analysis techniques 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be used in analyzing the test data, and the identity and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
location of the organization performing the testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Exhaust emissions shall be measured per the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of this section and &sect;80.49 through &sect;80.62. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The nonexhaust emission model (including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaporative, running loss, and refueling VOC and toxics 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions) shall not be augmented by vehicle testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The Agency reserves the right to observe and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitor any testing that is performed pursuant to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The Agency reserves the right to evaluate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality and suitability of data submitted pursuant to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of this section and to reject, re-analyze, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise evaluate such data as is technically warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Upon a showing satisfactory to the Administrator, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Administrator may approve a petition to waive the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of this section and &sect;80.49, &sect;80.50(a), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;80.60(d)(3), and &sect;80.60(d)(4) in order to better optimize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the test program to the needs of the particular fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameter. Any such waiver petition should provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information justifying the requested waiver, including an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable rationale and supporting data. Petitioners must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtain approval from the Administrator prior to conducting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing for which the requirements in question are waived. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administrator may waive the noted requirements in whole 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or in part, and may impose appropriate conditions on any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such waiver. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) In the case of petitions to augment the complex 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
model defined at &sect;80.45 with a new parameter, the effect of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the parameter being tested shall be determined separately, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for each pollutant and for each emitter class category. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the parameter is not included in the complex model but is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represented in whole or in part by one or more parameters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the model, the petitioner shall be required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate the emission effects of the parameter in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
question independent of the effects of the already-included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters. The petitioner shall also have to demonstrate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the effects of the already-included parameters independent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the effects of the parameter in question. The emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance of each vehicle on the fuels specified at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;80.49, as measured through vehicle testing in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with &sect;80.50 through &sect;80.62, shall be analyzed to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the effects of the fuel parameter being tested on emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
according to the following procedure: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(i) The analysis shall incorporate the vehicle testing data from the extension fuels specified at &sect;80.49(b),
the vehicle testing results used to develop the model specified at &sect;80.45, and vehicle testing results used
to support any prior augmentation requests which the Administrator deems necessary. A regression incorporating
the following terms shall be fitted to the natural logarithm of emissions contained in this combined data set: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) A term for each vehicle that shall reflect the effect of the vehicle on emissions independent of fuel compositions.
These terms shall be of the form D

i
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is a dummy variable which shall have the value 1.0 for the ith vehicle and the value 0 for all other vehicles. Vehicles
shall be represented by separate terms for each test program in which they were tested. The vehicle terms for the vehicles
included in the test program undertaken by the petitioner shall be calculated based on the results from all three fuels
specified at &sect;80.49(b)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Existing complex model terms that do not include the parameter being extended and their coefficients, including
those augmentations that the Administrator deems necessary. The centering values for these terms shall be identical
to the centering values used to develop the complex model described at &sect;80.45. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Existing complex model terms that include the parameter being extended. The coefficients for these terms shall
be estimated by the regression. The centering values for these terms shall be identical to the centering values used
to develop the complex model described at &sect;80.45. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 complex models do not contain a squared term for the parameter being extended, such a term should be added in a stepwise
fashion after completing the model described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(A) through (C) of this section. The coefficient
for this term shall be estimated by the regression. The centering value for this term shall be identical to the centering
value used to develop the complex model described at &sect;80.45. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) The terms defined in paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(C) and (D) of this section shall be evaluated against the statistical
criteria defined in paragraph (e) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The model described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section shall be developed separately for normal-emitting
and higher-emitting vehicles, as defined at &sect;80.62. Each emitter class shall be treated as a distinct population
for the purposes of determining regression coefficients.

Statistical criteria. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The petitioner shall be required to submit evidence with the petition which demonstrates the statistical validity
of the regression described in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, including at minimum: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Evidence demonstrating that colinearity problems are not severe, including but not limited to variance inflation
statistics of less than 10 for the second-order and interactive terms included in the regression model. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Evidence demonstrating that the regression residuals are normally distributed, including but not limited
to the skewness and Kurtosis statistics for the residuals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Evidence demonstrating that overfitting and underfitting risks have been balanced, including but not limited
to the use of Mallow's C

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The petitioner shall be required to submit evidence with the petition which demonstrates that the appropriate
terms have been included in the regression, including at minimum: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Descriptions of the analysis methods used to develop the regressions, including any computer code used to analyze
emissions data and the results of regression runs used to develop the proposed augmentation, including intermediate
regressions produced during the stepwise regression process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Evidence demonstrating that the significance level used to include terms in the model was equal to 0.90. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The complex emission model shall be augmented with the results of vehicle testing as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The terms and coefficients determined in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section shall be used to supplement the complex
emission model equation for the corresponding pollutant and emitter category. These terms and coefficients shall
be weighted to reflect the contribution of the emitter category to in-use emissions as shown at &sect;80.45. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the candidate parameter is not included in the unaugmented complex model and is not represented in whole or in
part by one or more parameters included in the model, the modification shall be accomplished by adding the terms and
coefficients to the complex model equation for that pollutant, technology group, and emitter category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the parameter is included in the complex model but is being tested at levels beyond the current range of the model,
the terms and coefficients determined in paragraph (d) of this section shall be used to supplement the complex emission
model equation for the corresponding pollutant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The terms and coefficients of the complex model described at &sect;80.45 shall be used to evaluate the emissions
performance of fuels with levels of the parameter being tested that are within the valid range of the model, as defined
at &sect;80.45. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The emissions performance of fuels with levels of the parameter that are beyond the valid range of the unaugmented
model shall be given in percentage change terms by 100-[(100+A)&times;(100+C)/(100+B)], where: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) ``A'' shall be set equal to the percentage change in emissions for a fuel with identical fuel property values to
the fuel being evaluated except for the parameter being extended, which shall be set equal to the nearest limit of the
data core, using the unaugmented complex model. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) ``B'' shall be set equal to the percentage change in emissions for the fuel described in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of
this section according to the augmented complex model. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) ``C'' shall be set equal to the percentage change in emissions of the actual fuel being evaluated using the augmented
complex model. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) EPA reserves the right to analyze the data generated during vehicle testing, to use such analyses to determine
the validity of the augmentation petition, and to use such data to update the complex model for use in certifying all
reformulated gasolines.

(h) Duration of acceptance of emission effects determined through vehicle testing: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the Agency does not accept, modify, or reject a particular augmentation for inclusion in an updated complex
model (performed through rulemaking), then the augmentation shall remain in effect until the next update to the complex
model takes effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the Agency does reject or modify a particular augmentation for inclusion in an updated complex model, then the
augmentation shall no longer be able to be used as of the date the updated complex model is deemed to take effect, unless
the following conditions and limitations apply: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The augmentation in question may continue to be used by those fuel suppliers which can prove, to the Administrator's
satisfaction, that the fuel supplier had already begun producing a fuel utilizing the augmentation at the time the
revised model is promulgated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The augmentation in question may only be used to evaluate the emissions performance of fuels in conjunction with
the complex emission model in effect as of the date of production of the fuels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The augmentation may only be used for three years of fuel production, or a total of five years from the date the
augmentation first took effect, whichever is shorter.

Measurement methods for benzene and 1,3-butadiene. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Sampling for benzene and 1,3-butadiene must be accomplished by bag sampling as used for total hydrocarbons determination.
This procedure is detailed in 40 CFR 86.109. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Benzene and 1,3-butadiene must be analyzed by gas chromatography. Expected values for benzene and 1,3-butadiene
in bag samples for the baseline fuel are 4.0 ppm and 0.30 ppm respectively. At least three standards ranging from at
minimum 50% to 150% of these expected values must be used to calibrate the detector. An additional standard of at most
0.01 ppm must also be measured to determine the required limit of quantification as described in paragraph (d) of this
section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The sample injection size used in the chromatograph must be sufficient to be above the laboratory determined limit
of quantification (LOQ) as defined in paragraph (d) of this section for at least one of the bag samples. A control chart
of the measurements of the standards used to determine the response, repeatability, and limit of quantitation of
the instrumental method for 1,3-butadiene and benzene must be reported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) As in all types of sampling and analysis procedures, good laboratory practices must be used. See, Lawrence, Principals
of Environmental Analysis, 55 Analytical Chemistry 14, at 2210&hyph;2218 (1983) (copies may be obtained from the
publisher, American Chemical Society, 1155 16th Street NW., Washington, DC 20036). Reporting reproducibility
control charts and limits of detection measurements are integral procedures to assess the validity of the chosen
analytical method. The repeatability of the test method must be determined by measuring a standard periodically
during testing and recording the measured values on a control chart. The control chart shows the error between the
measured standard and the prepared standard concentration for the periodic testing. The error between the measured
standard and the actual standard indicates the uncertainty in the analysis. The limit of detection (LOD) is determined
by repeatedly measuring a blank and a standard prepared at a concentration near an assumed value of the limit of detection.
If the average concentration minus the average of the blanks is greater than three standard deviations of these measurements,
then the limit of detection is at least as low as the prepared standard. The limit of quantitation (LOQ) is defined as
ten times the standard deviation of these measurements. This quantity defines the amount of sample required to be
measured for a valid analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Other sampling and analytical techniques will be allowed if they can be proven to have equal specificity and equal
or better limits of quantitation. Data from alternative methods that can be demonstrated to have equivalent or superior
limits of detection, precision, and accuracy may be accepted by the Administrator with individual prior approval.

(DNPH) impregnated cartridges or impingers filled with solutions of DNPH in acetonitrile (ACN) as described in &sect;&sect;86.109
and 86.140 of this chapter for formaldehyde analysis. Diluted exhaust sample volumes must be at least 15 L for impingers
containing 20 ml of absorbing solution (using more absorbing solution in the impinger requires proportionally more
gas sample to be taken) and at least 4 L for cartridges. As required in &sect;86.109 of this chapter, two impingers or
cartridges must be connected in series to detect breakthrough of the first impinger or cartridge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In addition, sufficient sample must be drawn through the collecting cartridges or impingers so that the measured
quantity of aldehyde is sufficiently greater than the minimum limit of quantitation of the test method for at least
a portion of the exhaust test procedure. The limit of quantitation is determined using the technique defined in &sect;80.55(d).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Each of the impinger samples are quantitatively transferred to a 25 mL volumetric flask (5 mL more than the sample
impinger volume) and brought to volume with ACN. The cartridge samples are eluted in reversed direction by gravity
feed with 6mL of ACN. The eluate is collected in a graduated test tube and made up to the 5mL mark with ACN. Both the impinger
and cartridge samples must be analyzed by HPLC without additional sample preparation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The analysis of the aldehyde derivatives collected is accomplished with a high performance liquid chromatograph
(HPLC). Standards consisting of the hydrazone derivative of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde are used to determine
the response, repeatability, and limit of quantitation of the HPLC method chosen for acetaldehyde and formaldehyde.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Other sampling and analytical techniques will be allowed if they can be proven to have equal specificity and equal
or better limits of quantitation. Data from alternative methods that can be demonstrated to have equivalent or superior
limits of detection, precision, and accuracy may be accepted by the Administrator with individual prior approval.

(a) Candidate vehicles which conform to the emission performance requirements defined in paragraphs (b) through
(d) of this section shall be obtained directly from the in-use fleet and tested in their as-received condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Candidate vehicles for the test fleet must be screened for their exhaust VOC emissions in accordance with the provisions
in &sect;80.62. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) On the basis of pretesting pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the test fleet shall be subdivided into two
emitter group sub-fleets: the normal emitter group and the higher emitter group. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Each vehicle with an exhaust total hydrocarbon (THC) emissions rate which is less than or equal to twice the applicable
emissions standard shall be placed in the normal emitter group. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Each vehicle with an exhaust THC emissions rate which is greater than two times the applicable emissions standard
shall be placed in the higher emitter group.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The test vehicles in each emitter group must conform to the requirements of paragraphs (d)(1) through (4) of this
section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Test vehicles for the normal emitter sub-fleet must be selected from the list shown in this paragraph (d)(1). This
list is arranged in order of descending vehicle priority, such that the order in which vehicles are added to the normal
emitter sub-fleet must conform to the order shown (e.g., a ten-vehicle normal emitter group sub-fleet must consist
of the first ten vehicles listed in this paragraph (d)(1)). If more vehicles are tested than the minimum number of vehicles
required for the normal emitter sub-fleet, additional vehicles are to be added to the fleet in the order specified
in this paragraph (d)(1), beginning with the next vehicle not already included in the group. The vehicles in the normal
emitter sub-fleet must possess the characteristics indicated in the list. If the end of the list is reached in adding
vehicles to the normal emitter sub-fleet and additional vehicles are desired then they shall be added beginning with
vehicle number one, and must be added to the normal emitter sub-fleet in accordance with the order in Table A:

(i) Improperly created credits may not be used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieve compliance, regardless of a credit transferee's good 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
faith belief that it was receiving valid credits; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) No refiner, importer, or oxygenate blender may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
create, report, or transfer improperly created credits; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Where any credit transferor has in its balance at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the conclusion of any averaging period both credits which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were properly created and credits which were improperly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
created, the properly created credits will be applied first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to any credit transfers before the transferor may apply any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credits to achieve its own compliance.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the case of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any reformulated gasoline that is intended to be used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beginning January 1, 1995, but that is produced or imported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to that date: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Any refiner or importer may meet standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in &sect;80.41 for average compliance for such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline, provided the refiner or importer has the option of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meeting standards on average for 1995 under paragraph (a) of

Compliance survey option 1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to satisfy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the compliance survey requirements, any refiner, importer, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or oxygenate blender shall properly conduct a program of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance surveys in accordance with a survey program plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which has been approved by the Administrator of EPA in each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covered area which is supplied with any gasoline for which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance is achieved on average that is produced by that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refiner or oxygenate blender or imported by that importer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such approval shall be based upon the survey program plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meeting the following criteria: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The survey program shall consist of at least four 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveys which shall occur during the following time periods: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one survey during the period January 1 through May 31; two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveys during the period June 1 through September 15; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one survey during the period September 16 through December 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
31. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The survey program shall meet the criteria stated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in paragraph (c) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In the event that any refiner, importer, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oxygenate blender fails to properly carry out an approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey program, the refiner, importer, or oxygenate blender 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall achieve compliance with all applicable standards on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per-gallon basis for the calendar year in which the failure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurs, and may not achieve compliance with any standard on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an average basis during this calendar year. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement to achieve compliance per-gallon shall apply 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ab 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initio 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to the beginning of any calendar year in which the

sample that violates the benzene per-gallon maximum plus any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benzene enforcement tolerance but meets other per-gallon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum and minimum standards would be excluded from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benzene survey, but would be included in the surveys for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters other than benzene). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Any sample from a survey that violates any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard under &sect;80.41, or that constitutes evidence of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violation of any prohibition or requirement under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart D, may be used by the Administrator in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement action for such violation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Each laboratory at which samples in a survey are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyzed shall participate in a correlation program with EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ensure the validity of analysis results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) (i) The results of each simple model VOC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey shall be determined as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) For each simple model sample from the survey, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VOC emissions reduction percentage shall be determined based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon the tested values for RVP and oxygen for that sample as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applied to the VOC emissions reduction equation at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;80.42(a)(1) for VOC-Control Region 1 and &sect;80.42(a)(2) for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VOC-Control Region 2; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The VOC emissions reduction survey standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to each covered area shall be calculated by using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the VOC emissions equation at &sect;80.42(a)(1) with RVP=7.2 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OXCON=2.0 for covered areas located in VOC-Control Region 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and using the VOC emissions equation at &sect;80.42(a)(2) with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RVP=8.1 and OXCON=2.0 for covered areas located in VOC-Control Region 2; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The covered area shall have failed the simple 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
model VOC survey if the VOC emissions reduction average of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all survey samples is less than VOC emissions reduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey standard calculated under paragraph (c)(8)(i)(B) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The results of each complex model VOC emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction survey shall be determined as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) For each complex model sample from the survey, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VOC emissions reduction percentage shall be determined based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon the tested parameter values for that sample and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate methodology for calculating VOC emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction at &sect;80.47; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The covered area shall have failed the complex 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
model VOC survey if the VOC emissions reduction percentage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average of all survey samples is less than the applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per-gallon standard for VOC emissions reduction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) (i) The results of each simple model toxics

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Carry out the independent analysis requirements specified in &sect;80.65(f); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Determine properties of the RBOB which are sufficient to allow parties downstream from the refinery or import
facility to establish, through sampling and testing, if the RBOB has been altered or contaminated such that it will
not meet the applicable reformulated gasoline standards subsequent to the addition of the specified type and amount
of oxygenate; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Transfer ownership of the RBOB only to an oxygenate blender who is registered with EPA as such, or to an intermediate

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Method 3-type data. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) Method 3-type data shall consist of post-1990 gasoline blendstock and/or gasoline quality data and 1990 blendstock
and gasoline production records, specifically the measured fuel parameter values and volumes of blendstock used
in the production of gasoline within the refinery. Blendstock data shall include volumes purchased or otherwise
received, including intracompany transfers, if the volumes were blended as part of the refiner's or importer's 1990
gasoline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In order to use Method 3-type data, the refiner or importer must do all of the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Include a detailed discussion comparing its 1990 and post-1990 refinery operations and all other differences
which would cause the 1990 and post-1990 fuel parameter values to differ; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Perform the appropriate calculations so as to adjust for the differences determined in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A)
of this section; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Include a narrative, discussing the methodology and reasoning for the adjustments made per paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B)
of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) In order to use post-1990 gasoline data, either of the following must be shown for each blendstock-type included
in 1990 gasoline, excluding butane: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The post-1990 volumetric fraction of a blendstock is within (+/^)10.0 percent of the volumetric fraction of that
blendstock in 1990 gasoline. For example, if a 1990 blendstock constituted 30 volume percent of 1990 gasoline, this
criterion would be met if the post-1990 volumetric fraction of the blendstock in post-1990 gasoline was 27.0&hyph;33.0
volume percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The post-1990 volumetric fraction of a blendstock is within (+/^)2.0 volume percent of the absolute value of the
1990 volumetric fraction. For example, if a 1990 blendstock constituted 5 volume percent of 1990 gasoline, this criterion
would be met if the post-1990 volumetric fraction of the blendstock in post-1990 gasoline was 3&hyph;7 volume percent.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) If using post-1990 gasoline data, post-1990 gasoline blendstock which left a facility and which could become
gasoline solely upon the addition of oxygenate shall be included in the baseline determination, per the requirements
specified in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.

Closely integrated gasoline producing facilities. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each refinery or blending facility must determine a set of baseline fuel parameter values per this paragraph (e).
A single set of baseline fuel parameters may be determined, upon petition and approval, for two or more facilities
under either of the following circumstances: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Two or more refineries or sets of gasoline blendstock-producing units of a refiner engaged in the production of
gasoline per paragraph (b)(1) of this section which are geographically proximate to each other, yet not within a single
refinery gate, and whose 1990 operations were significantly interconnected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A gasoline blending facility operating per paragraph (b)(3) of this section received at least 75 percent of its
1990 blendstock volume from a single refinery, or from one or more refineries which are part of an aggregate baseline
per &sect;80.101(h). The blending facility and associated refinery(ies) must be owned by the same refiner.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Baseline adjustments for 1990 JP&hyph;4 production. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) Baseline adjustments may be allowed, upon petition and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval (per &sect;80.93), if a refinery produced JP&hyph;4 jet fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in 1990 and meets all of the following requirements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The refinery is the only refinery of a refiner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such that it cannot form an aggregate baseline with another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refinery (per paragraph (f) of this section) or all of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refineries of a refiner produced JP&hyph;4 in 1990 and each of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the refineries also meets the requirements specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraphs (e)(7)(i) (B) and (C) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The refinery will not produce reformulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline. If the refinery produces reformulated gasoline at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any time in a calendar year, its compliance baseline shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revert to its unadjusted baseline values for that year and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all subsequent years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The ratio of the refinery's 1990 JP&hyph;4 production 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to its 1990 gasoline production equals or exceeds 0.5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Fuel parameter and volume adjustments shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made by assuming that no JP&hyph;4 was produced in 1990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) All adjustments due to 1990 JP&hyph;4 production must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be accompanied by: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Unadjusted and adjusted fuel parameters, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions, and volumes; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

exited the refinery, in 1990, unchanged shall not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in determining the refinery's baseline volume. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If a refiner is allowed to adjust its baseline per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraphs (e)(5) through (e)(7) of this section, its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual baseline volume shall be the volume determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after the adjustment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The individual baseline volume for facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deemed closely integrated, per paragraph (e)(1) of this

section, shall be the combined 1990 gasoline production of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the facilities, so long as mutual volumes are not double-counted, i.e., volumes of blendstock sent from the refinery

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the blending facility should not be included in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
blending facility's volume. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The baseline volume of a refiner, per paragraph

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Individual baseline emissions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) Individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual average baseline emissions (per &sect;80.90) shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined for every refinery, refiner or importer, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) For each individual summer or winter baseline fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameter value (determined per paragraph (e) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section) which is outside of the complex model conventional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline valid range for that parameter (per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;80.45(f)(1)(ii)), the complex model range is extended only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for such fuel parameters, in both baseline and compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complex model emissions determinations, and only for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable summer or winter models. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Facilities deemed closely integrated, per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (e)(1) of this section, shall have a single set of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual average individual baseline emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Aggregate baselines (per &sect;80.101(h)) must have the

NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions of all refineries in the aggregate determined

baseline fuel parameters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Geographic considerations requiring individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conventional gasoline compliance baselines.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) Anyone may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petition EPA to establish separate baselines for refineries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
located in and providing conventional gasoline to an area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a limited gasoline distribution system if it can show 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the area is experiencing increased toxics emissions due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to an ozone nonattainment area opting into the reformulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline program pursuant to section 211(k)(6) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If EPA agrees with the finding of paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f)(4)(i) of this section, it shall require that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
baselines of such refineries be separate from refineries not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
located in the area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If two (2) or more of a refiner's refineries are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
located in the geographic area of concern, the refiner may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aggregate the baseline emissions and sulfur, olefin and T90 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
values of the refineries or have an individual baseline for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one or more of the refineries, per paragraph (f)(3) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section.

Baseline recalculations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Aggregate baseline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exhaust emissions (per &sect;80.90) and baseline sulfur, olefin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and T90 values and aggregate baseline volumes shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recalculated under the following circumstances: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A refinery included in an aggregate baseline is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entirely shutdown. If the shutdown refinery was part of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aggregate baseline, the aggregate baseline emissions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aggregate baseline sulfur, olefin and T90 values and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aggregate volume shall be recalculated to account for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removal of the shutdown refinery's contributions to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aggregate baseline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A refinery exchanges owners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) All aggregate baselines affected by the exchange 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be recalculated to reflect the addition or subtraction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the baseline exhaust emissions, sulfur, olefin and T90 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
values and volumes of that refinery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The new owner may elect to establish an individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
baseline for the refinery or to include it in an aggregate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
baseline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) If the refinery was part of an aggregate of three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or more refineries, the remaining refineries in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aggregate from which that refinery was removed will have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new aggregate baseline. If the refinery was part of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aggregate of only two refineries, the remaining refinery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will have an individual baseline.

this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An auditor may be an individual or organization, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and may utilize contractors and subcontractors to assist in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the verification of a baseline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

may for such gasoline meet this sampling and testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement by collecting and analyzing a representative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sample of the blendstock used subsequent to each receipt of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any refiner or importer may, prior to analysis, combine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
samples of gasoline collected from more than one batch of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline or blendstock (``composite sample''), and treat such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
composite sample as one batch of gasoline or blendstock 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided that the refiner or importer: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Meets each of the requirements specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(f)(1) The refiner or importer blendstock accounting requirements specified under paragraph (e) of this section
shall not apply in the case of any refiner or importer: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Whose 1990 baseline value for each regulated fuel property and emission performance, as determined in accordance
with &sect;&sect;80.91 and 80.92, is less stringent than the anti-dumping statutory baseline value for that parameter
or emissions performance; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Whose averaging period blendstock-to-gasoline ratio, calculated according to paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this
section, is equal to or less than .0300; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Who obtains a waiver from EPA, provided that a petition for such a waiver is filed no later than fifteen days following
the end of the averaging period for which the blendstock-to-gasoline ratio percentage change threshold is exceeded.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2)(i) EPA may grant the waiver referred to in paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of his section if the level of blendstock production
was the result of extreme or unusual circumstances (e.g., a natural disaster or act of God) which clearly are outside
the control of the refiner or importer, and which could not have been avoided by the exercise of prudence, diligence,
and due care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Any petition filed under paragraph (f) of this section shall include information which describes the extreme
or unusual circumstance which caused the increased volume of blendstock produced or imported, the steps taken to
avoid the circumstance, and the steps taken to remedy or mitigate the effect of the circumstance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section, any refiner or importer that
transfers applicable blendstock to another refiner or importer with a less stringent baseline requirement, either
directly or indirectly, for the purpose of evading a more stringent baseline requirement, shall include such blendstock(s)
in determining compliance with the applicable requirements of this subpart.
