SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document invites comments on a proposal to temporarily reduce the supply plant shipping requirement of the Tennessee
Valley Federal milk order (Order 11) for the months of March through July 1994. The proposed action was requested by
Armour Foods Ingredients Company (Armour), which operates a proprietary supply plant pooled under Order 11. Armour
contends the action is necessary to prevent the uneconomical movement of milk and to ensure that producer milk associated
with the market in the fall will continue to be pooled in the spring and summer months.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule
on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified
that this proposed action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
Such action would tend to ensure that dairy farmers would continue to have their milk priced under the order and thereby
receive the benefits that accrue from such pricing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is issuing this proposed action in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed action has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended
to have a retroactive effect. If adopted, this proposed action will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations,
or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), provides that administrative
proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler
subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any
obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of the order
or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing,
the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district
in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review
the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the
entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 and the
provisions of &sect;1011.7(b) of the order, temporary revision of certain provisions of the order regulating the
handling of milk in the Tennessee Valley marketing area is being considered for the months of March 1, 1994, through
July 31, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All persons who wish to send written data, views or arguments about the proposed revision should send two copies of
them to the USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, room 2968, South Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington,
DC 20090&hyph;6456, by the 7th day after publication of this document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The period for filing comments is limited to 7 days because a longer period would not provide the time needed to complete
the required procedures before the requested revision is to be effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All written submissions made pursuant to this document will be made available for public inspection in the Dairy Division
during regular business hours (7 CFR 1.27(b)).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Statement of Consideration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed revision would reduce from 40 to 30 percent the supply plant shipping requirement for the period of March
through July 1994. The Tennessee Valley order requires that a supply plant ship a minimum of 60 percent of the total
quantity of milk physically received at the supply plant during the months of August through November, January, and
February, and 40 percent in each of the other months. The order also provides authority for the Director of the Dairy
Division to increase or decrease this supply plant shipping requirement by up to 10 percentage points if such a revision
is necessary to obtain needed shipments of milk or to prevent uneconomic shipments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Armour states that it would have to make uneconomical shipments of milk to meet the 40 percent supply plant shipping
requirement to continue its pool status. Additionally, the proponent states that the 40 percent requirement could
jeopardize the continued association of producers who have supplied the Order 11 market in the fall. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Armour anticipates that marketing conditions in 1994 will mirror those in 1993, when the shipping percentage was
also reduced. It expects milk supplies to be adequate to meet the Class I needs of the market.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
These proposed regulations implement amendments to section 721 of title VII of the Defense Production Act of 1950
(the ``DPA''), as added by section 5021 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, relating to mergers,
acquisitions, and takeovers of U.S. persons by or with foreign persons, and as amended by section 837 of the National
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993. That amendment requires that the President or his designee undertake
an investigation under section 721 of certain acquisitions which could result in control of U.S. persons by foreign
government controlled entities. It also expands the factors the President must consider in making a determination
under section 721, modifies the existing congressional reporting requirement under section 721, and requires that
any designee of the President under section 721 share with any other designee a copy of an assessment made in a particular
case of the risk of diversion of a defense critical technology.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These proposed regulations implement only those provisions relating to mandatory investigations, and also make
a few technical and conforming changes to the existing regulations. The statutory amendments pertaining to the factors
for Presidential decisionmaking and report sharing, which do not directly affect the behavior of parties filing
under section 721, were deemed sufficiently straightforward not to require any implementing regulations.

The collections of information provided for in this proposed rule have been submitted to the Office of Management
and Budget for review in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)). Comments on the collections
of information should be sent to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget,
Paperwork Reduction Act Project (1501&hyph;0121), Washington, DC 20503, with copies to the Office of International
Investment at the address noted above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The collection of information provided for in this proposed rule is in section 800.402. Thus far, the regulations
have requested parties filing a notification under section 721 to provide 10 copies of the notification. However,
the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States has been expanded by Executive Order 12860 of September 3,
1993, to include three additional members: the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Assistant
to the President for Economic Policy, and the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy. The regulations
have accordingly been amended to request that three additional copies of the notifications be provided by parties
making a filing under section 721, for a total of 13 copies. The regulations have also been amended to request more information
pertaining to foreign government control to assist the Committee in implementing the amendment to section 721 pertaining
to mandatory investigations of certain acquisitions involving such control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information collected pursuant to these regulations is required by the Committee to assist it in determining
whether to investigate mergers, acquisitions, and takeovers of persons involved in interstate commerce in the United
States by or with foreign persons for possible threats to the national security, as required by section 721 of the Defense
Production Act. This information will be used to determine the extent and nature of foreign control, as well as the
national security implications of the transactions at issue. The likely respondents are individuals and businesses.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These regulations implement amendments to section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. App. 2170)
(``DPA''). Section 709 of the DPA (50 U.S.C. App. 2159) provides that the regulations issued under it are not subject
to the rulemaking requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553). Notwithstanding this exemption,
section 709 of the DPA was amended by section 136 of the Defense Production Act Amendments of 1992 (P.L. 102&hyph;558)
to require any regulation issued under the DPA to be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for at least thirty days to provide for public comment. This requirement subjects this proposed rule to the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The impact of this proposed rule on small entities is expected to be insignificant. This proposed regulation imposes
additional informational requirements on entities controlled by foreign governments. Most businesses affected
by this rule will likely be large businesses, because these are the most likely to be controlled by a foreign government.
Accordingly, it is certified that the proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities.

Discussion of the Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 837(a) of the Defense Authorization Act creates for the first time a mandatory investigation provision under
Exon-Florio. There are three points worth noting about this provision. First, this provision is limited in application
to certain types of acquisitions. Specifically, the acquirer in question must be a foreign government controlled
entity, or an entity acting on behalf of a foreign government. Furthermore, the acquisition must be one which ``could
result in control of a person engaged in interstate commerce in the United States 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
that could affect the national security of the United States
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' (emphasis added). Thus, even where the other specified criteria are met, this provision does not mandate an investigation
for cases that could not ``affect the national security of the United States.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, for purposes of determining whether the acquisition results in foreign government control, CFIUS is applying
the same functional test for control as provided in section 800.204.

that the foreign party acquiring control might take action that ``threatens to impair the national security,'' the
criterion for undertaking an investigation of transactions involving government controlled entities is that there
could be an effect on the national security.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``foreign government'' has been broadly defined for purposes of these proposed regulations to include any
government or body exercising governmental functions, and includes but is not limited to national as well as various
regional and local levels of government. It is important to note that the definition is not limited to the particular
levels of government that are specified in the proposed regulation, and that other governmental bodies, including
supra-national entities such as the European Union (including its component parts), are covered by this regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of the mandatory investigation provision, the proposed regulations define the term ``engage in'' as
used in the phrase ``seeks to engage in any merger, acquisition or takeover *&blank;*&blank;*'' to mean ``seeks to
acquire control through.'' The purpose of this regulation is to clarify that the mandatory investigation provision
would not be triggered in cases where a foreign government controlled entity is a passive participant in an acquisition
by a foreign person. The Committee believes that this reading is supported by the legislative history, and particularly
floor statements made by members of Congress who sponsored this particular amendment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This document dismisses a Notice of Proposed Rule Making issued in response to Buckley Broadcasting Corporation
of Maine requesting the substitution of Channel 265B1 for Channel 265A at Westbrook, Maine, and modification of the
license for Station WYNZ to specify the higher class channel. See 58 FR 38547, July 19, 1993. Saga Communications of
New England, Inc., the current licensee of Station WYNZ, has filed an application seeking to take advantage of the
Commission's new rules permitting an upgrade in facilities by the application process rather than the rule making
process (BPH&hyph;930818IC). See FM Channel and Class Modification by Application, 58 FR 38534, July 19, 1993. With
this action, this proceeding is terminated.

southwest to avoid short-spacing conflicts with Station WLZA&hyph;FM, Channel 241C2, Eupora, Mississippi, and
with a rule making proposal (RM&hyph;8336) to allot Channel 240C3 at Harrisburg, Arkansas. The coordinates for Channel
241C3 are North Latitude 34&hyph;38&hyph;56 and West Longitude 90&hyph;26&hyph;39.

This proposed rule would provide a comprehensive revision of the acts prohibited on the National Forest System enforced
by personnel of the Forest Service. These proposed revisions respond to emerging law enforcement issues, the enactment
of new laws, and the promulgation of new rules that have occurred since the subject rules were last revised. The intent
of these rules is to adequately protect National Forest System resources, the public who uses the National Forest
System, and the employees who administer it. Public comment is invited.

In order to carry out the agency's statutory mission, it has long been necessary to promulgate rules setting forth
those acts that are prohibited on the National Forest System. These rules are integral to Forest Service efforts to
protect resources, facilities, employees, and the public. The primary authority for the Secretary to promulgate
such rules is found at 16 U.S.C. 551. Violators of these rules can be punished by imprisonment for a term not to exceed
six months and are subject to a range of fines as a result of the enactment of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984
(18 U.S.C. 3559, 3571).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both Federal and State laws apply to the national forests (16 U.S.C. 480), that is, both Federal and State criminal
and civil jurisdiction apply to persons within the national forests. Generally, State enforce State laws, while
Federal officers enforce Federal laws and regulations. In most cases, the Forest Service enforces laws and regulations
relating to its resource protection responsibilities. Some prohibitions established in certain State laws may
also be appropriate subjects of Federal regulation. There are several Forest Service prohibited acts that rely on
the existence of a particular State law for definition, for example, 36 CFR 261.13(i) prohibits the operation of any
vehicle off Forest Development, State or County roads ``in violation of State law established for vehicles used off
roads.'' Thus, in some instances, an act or omission by a national forest visitor may be regulated by both Federal and
State governments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Forest officers cooperate fully with State, local, and other Federal agencies in executing their responsibilities
related to the National Forest System. With the enactment of the Cooperative Law Enforcement Act in 1971 (16 U.S.C.
551a), the Forest Service has entered into reimbursable agreements with some State and local agencies (usually a
county sheriff's office) for the protection of persons and their property on the National Forest System where the
existence of forest attractions and facilities account for an extraordinary amount of visitor use. These agreements
provide an avenue to assist local jurisdictions that are impacted by these attractions. During the past several years,
however, it has become evident that reimbursement through the Cooperative Law Enforcement program cannot alone
provide the level of protection that should be afforded the public in Forest Service recreation areas. For example,
when a forest visitor is victimized by theft of personal property or an assault and the local enforcement authority
is unable to respond, there are often trained and equipped Forest Service law enforcement personnel in the immediate
area at the time of the incident. These victims are often assisted by Forest officers who initiated what action they
can, given the current scope of the prohibitions.

Need For Revision of Rules
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Departmental Regulation 1512&hyph;1, the Forest Service has reviewed 36 CFR Part 261_Prohibitions
and 36 CFR Part 262_Law Enforcement Support Activities to determine their current applicability in view of new and
changing laws, conditions, and other factors affecting the management of the National Forest System, employees,
and the general public. By letter of September 8, 1987, the Chief of the Forest Service asked each Regional and Washington
Office staff unit to review the current rules and to make suggestions on any needed revisions. This Service-wide review
has revealed a need to revise the rules in order to more effectively respond to recent changes in laws, regulations
and policy, and emerging law enforcement issues.

Protection of Forest Users and Visitors
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Without exception, Forest Service regions cited an inadequate regulatory basis for conducting law enforcement
activities in certain areas when State and local authorities are unable to provide law enforcement services associated
with violations of State or local law occurring on the National Forest System. This situation occurs as a result of
a number of factors, one being the inability of small local law enforcement agencies to respond quickly to all but the
most violent of crimes against users (murder, rape and other assaults). Many local law enforcement agencies find
that their limited personnel, the distant location of Forest Service areas, and the seasonal nature of use these areas
receive are impediments to rapid response to crimes committed on the National Forest System. When State and local
law enforcement units cannot respond promptly, and trained and equipped Forest officers are at a location where persons
need help or encounter criminal activity affecting those persons, the Forest Service should be in a position to render
emergency assistance. Because Forest officers generally cannot enforce State laws, the agency needs rules which
will make certain State crimes violations of Forest Service regulations. The authority provided by 16 U.S.C. 551
allows regulating occupancy and use even if such regulation is not necessary for the protection of forest resources
(

463 F.2d 615 (10th Cir. 1972)). To prohibit, for example, the theft of visitors' personal property is a reasonable
regulation of the use of the forests and should help to keep visits to the national forests enjoyable.

Felony Case Prosecution Requests

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There is a need to incorporate certain statutes contained in the Federal Criminal Code into agency rules to facilitate
enforcing such statutes as misdemeanors rather than as felonies. This will help reduce agency felony case prosecution
requests presented to the U.S. Department of Justice as well as provide for a speedier resolution of certain cases.
Examples of these kinds of cases include intimidation and impersonation of Forest Service employees, use of controlled
substances, unauthorized use of Forest Service computer systems, and thefts of certain government property or resources.

Section-by-Section Analysis of Proposed Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would amend two parts of Chapter II of Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations: Part 261_Prohibitions,
and Part 262_Law Enforcement Support Activities. A section-by-section discussion of the changes proposed to each
part follows.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Part 261_Prohibitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart A of this part sets forth acts and omissions that are prohibited throughout the National Forest System. Subpart
B grants authority to Regional Foresters and Forest Supervisors to issue orders and regulations prohibiting certain
acts in specific areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart A_General Prohibitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 261.1&blank;Scope
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section establishes when the prohibitions of the subpart apply. The punctuation in paragraphs (a)(1) through
(a)(4) would be revised to make clear that the conditions set forth in &sect;261.1(a) are in the alternative (i.e.
that all conditions need not apply, just any one of them).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(3) currently provides that the rules of the subpart apply to an act or omission that affects, threatens,
or endangers persons using the National Forest System or Forest development roads or trails or persons engaged in
the protection, maintenance, or administration of such. As written, the rule protects Forest Service employees
only when they are engaged in their duties and does not apply to situations where Forest Service employees are threatened
or intimidated during ``off-duty'' hours as a result of an action taken while they were on duty. This situation can
be remedied by revising paragraph (a)(3) to refer in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) to threats to or endangerment of persons
engaged in or on account of the performance of official duties including the administration of the National Forest
System.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing paragraph (a)(4) would be revised to clarify that these regulations apply within the boundaries of those
components of the National Trails System or the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System that are administered by the
Forest Service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new paragraph (a)(5) would be added to provide the agency a means of protecting personal property of forest users
in the absence of a response by local law enforcement agencies. At present, if a forest user has personal property stolen
or damaged (for example, an ice chest or sports equipment) the Forest Service must rely on State or local law enforcement
personnel to investigate and charge the person responsible. However, in many cases, local law enforcement agencies
do not have the resources to investigate these cases in a timely manner, and while the Forest Service has authority
to investigate the case, it presently has no basis in its regulations for charging a person with misdemeanor theft.
This is understandably a source of frustration to forest visitors victimized by theft, especially when trained and
equipped Forest officers may be in the area where the theft or incident occurred and are able to identify the person(s)
responsible. This addition to the rule would bridge this gap in law enforcement in those cases where local law enforcement
agencies cannot respond in a timely manner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) of existing &sect;261.1 exempts certain activities allowed for by statute that otherwise may be a violation
of this part. The paragraph currently cites The Wilderness Act of 1964 and the Mining Law of 1872. The provisions of
other laws which would also apply are not included. The paragraph would be revised to make clear the agency's intent
to exempt from the prohibitions of this part any activity that is conducted in compliance with other regulations set
forth in chapter II.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new paragraph (c) would be added to make clear that the existence of these rules does not prevent the Federal Government
from proceeding with necessary criminal action codified in Federal statutes rather than under these regulations.
This revision is necessary to comport with the fact that the United States Department of Justice determines when the
Federal Government should pursue criminal sanctions under Federal statute.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new paragraph (d) would be added to clarify that unless intent is stated in specific provisions, strict liability
applies to these regulations. The prohibited acts set forth in 36 CFR part 261 are offenses in the nature of neglect
where the law requires care, or are offenses in the nature of inaction where the law imposes a duty (

471 U.S. 419, 426 (1985)). Thus, for example, a prohibition of unauthorized livestock on national forest land without
regard to whether a person intended to place such livestock there would tend to ensure that a person exercises diligence
to prevent resource damage. A person should know that the use of Federal lands is subject to stringent regulation,
and that action or inaction in violation of such regulations can cause irreparable harm to the public or the land and
its resources.

This section currently states the penalty for violating these rules in the words of 16 U.S.C. 551: ``Any violation
of the prohibitions of this part (261) shall be punished by a fine of not more than $500 or imprisonment for not more than
six months or both *&blank;*&blank;*.'' However, the enactment of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, as
amended, established categories of offenses based on the maximum amount of imprisonment for each offense (18 U.S.C.
3559). Offenses with a maximum term of six months of imprisonment, such as those offenses covered by these regulations,
are now considered ``Class B Misdemeanors'' (the subject rules were formerly classified as petty offenses, 18 U.S.C.
3559(a)(7)). The statutory language of 18 U.S.C. 3571 prescribes a range of fines for Class B Misdemeanors depending
on specific circumstances associated with the violation. The proposed revision to this section reflects this statutory
change and provides for an exception by including the words ``unless otherwise provided'' which, for example, would
apply to the enforcement of the collection of fees authorized by the Land and Water Conservation Act (36 CFR 261.15).
A failure to pay such a fee is an infraction, which allows for a range of fines pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3571 but does not allow
for imprisonment of the offender.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``Alcoholic beverage'' would be added to clarify which beverages are intended to be covered in the prohibition
against possession and use of alcoholic beverages at 36 CFR 261.58(bb). In the absence of a definition in this section,
the Forest Service has relied on defining alcoholic beverage by reference to State law. The intention was to prohibit
possession of all forms of alcoholic beverages when provided by an order; yet in some states, the definition of alcoholic
beverages does not include beer and wine. This inconsistent treatment of ``alcoholic beverage'' in the present rule
can be remedied by defining alcoholic beverages as ``beer, wine, distilled spirits, and any other beverage defined
as such by State law.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``Computer'' would be added to clarify the type of machines covered under two new proposed rules in 36 CFR 261.9.

The term ``Contraband'' would be added to support a proposed revision at 36 CFR 261.4(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``Controlled substance'' would be added so that possession of drugs may be handled through a United States
Magistrate judge by the issuance of a violation notice, rather than by proceeding under the simple possession statute
at 21 U.S.C. 844, which requires either the filing of a complaint or information, or indictment by a Federal grand jury.
The definition is the same as that used at 36 CFR 1.4.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The terms ``Endangered species,'' ``Threatened species,'' and ``Sensitive species'' would be added to implement
the rules at 36 CFR 261.9 (a) and (b). The current rule refers to these terms, but does not provide definitions. The proposed
rule defines Endangered species and Threatened species as those species designated as such by the Secretary of the
Interior or the Secretary of Commerce. The proposed definition for Sensitive species is the same as in the Forest Service
Manual, section 2670.5.

The terms ``Guiding'' and ``Outfitting'' would be defined to indicate to the public and the courts the intended prohibited

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As currently written, this section prohibits interference with a Forest officer, interference with a volunteer
or human resource employee, and the giving of a false report to a Forest officer. It is proposed to revise the section's
heading to read ``Interfering with agency functions'' for clarity and brevity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing paragraph (a) would be revised to combine the two ``Forest officer'' and ``volunteer'' interference rules
currently found at paragraphs (a) and (c) into a single prohibition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing paragraph (b) would be revised for clarity.

and maintain order during firefighting, law enforcement, or other operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new paragraph (d) is proposed to prohibit the impersonation of Forest officers, volunteers, or human resource program
enrollees. At present, the only option available to the agency is to prosecute an impersonation as a felony (18 U.S.C.
912). The proposed regulation would provide the opportunity, where appropriate, to treat these cases as misdemeanors,
rather than to proceed under felony statutes.

Section 261.4&blank;Disorderly Conduct
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed changes to &sect;261.4 result from situations encountered by Forest officers, usually in developed
recreation areas, that require immediate attention such as breach of the peace or other illegal activity which, if
not resolved, threatens the health, safety, rights, or enjoyment of forest users. Usually, Forest officers encounter
these situations due to the unavailability of State or local authorities to patrol recreation areas. Often Forest
officers are the only recognized authority with law enforcement responsibilities that the public may encounter.
In other cases where State authorities do perform patrols, they may not be in a given location when law enforcement
action must be taken, requiring Forest officers to initiate action until the State or local authority can arrive.
The above scenarios are occurring routinely in some Forest Service recreation areas, and while the agency has the
authority to regulate activity of this nature, it has no current regulations on which to support actions being taken
by employees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The section heading would be revised to read ``Public behavior'' to encompass the broader area of prohibited conduct
included in the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing paragraph (a) would be revised to include the words ``or any other violent behavior'' in addition to prohibiting
``fighting.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing paragraph (b) currently prohibits ``offensive, derisive or annoying communication.'' The proposed revision
of this paragraph is a narrower approach, identifying with more specficity the types of language or action that is
prohibited and adding the element of intent to cause, or knowingly or recklessly creating the risk of, public alarm,
nuisance, jeopardy or violence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing paragraph (c), which prohibits making ``statements or other actions directed toward inciting or producing
imminent lawless action'' would be removed, as this provision would be covered in revised paragraph (b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new paragraph (c) is proposed to prohibit the possession, selling, cultivation, dispensing, or bartering of controlled
substances, alcoholic beverages, or contraband if such acts are a violation of State or Federal law. While the Forest
Service has the authority to investigate controlled substance violations under the National Forest System Drug
Control Act of 1986, as amended, and make arrests under that Act, it may not be practical to prosecute all as felony cases,
such as the possession of small amounts of controlled substances intended for personal use. Therefore, the agency
proposes to establish a rule which provides for a misdemeanor penalty. Alcoholic beverages have been included as
the agency is currently without a rule prohibiting underage consumption or possession of alcoholic beverages in
violation of State or Federal law on the National Forest System. Forest Service regions report continuing problems
in both developed and undeveloped areas pertaining to large ``keg'' parties and other parties where underage alcoholic
consumption is occurring. In many cases, State and local officers are unavailable to take the necessary enforcement
actions in order to protect other forest users who are affected by this problem. The rule would also prohibit the possession
of contraband (i.e. where the very possession of an item is illegal, as defined by either State or Federal law). Some
examples of included items would be certain animal parts or unregistered automatic weapons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new paragraph (e) would be added prohibiting ``being under the influence of any controlled substance or alcoholic
beverage,'' if it is a violation of either State or Federal law. This would be a companion rule with the proposed new
paragraph (c) and is needed for the same reasons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, new paragraphs (f) and (g) would be added to allow for federal prosecutions of persons who victimize forest
visitors or other persons and their property on the National Forest System.

One change is proposed to this section. As written, paragraph (b) prohibits the firing of tracer or incendiary ammunition.
The wording of the paragraph requires that a Forest officer must prove that a person actually ``fired'' the ammunition,
something that is very hard to do. Accordingly, this prohibition would be expanded to prohibit the possession of tracer
or incendiary ammunition as well. The possession of tracer or incendiary ammunition on the National Forest System
can be harmful to persons as well as resources and is clearly not within the public interest. If persons are prohibited
from possessing such ammunition, there is less likelihood of it being fired.

Paragraph (c) currently prohibits removing timber or other forest product except to a place designated for scaling.
As some forest products are recorded by means other than scaling, a proposed revision to this paragraph would clarify
that it is prohibited to remove such products except to a place designated for scaling or other means of recording by
a forest officer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d) currently prohibits the marking of trees or other forest products to be cut or removed in a manner similar
to that employed by Forest officers. This paragraph would be revised to prohibit the counterfeit marking of trees
to be left uncut on a timber sale. During the past 2 years, at least one Forest Service region has encounter numerous
markings of ``leave'' trees on timber sales that were never marked by Forest Service personnel. Investigation or
later communication to the agency by the person(s) claiming responsibility revealed that these markings were made
to hamper Forest Service timber sales efforts by trying to confuse timber sale purchasers as to which trees could be
cut and which trees were to be left. Where this has occurred, Forest officers have had to re-mark portions of timber
sales incurring additional agency costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (e), which prohibits the removal or hauling of timber or other forest products unless it is properly identified
by the terms of a special use authorization or contract, would be revised for clarity by removing the word ``hauling''
and adding in its place the words ``transporting'' and ``possessing.'' The revision is needed to better define the
offense and to make clear that possession of forest products without the proper identification as required by a special
use authorization or timber sale contract is prohibited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new paragraph (i) is proposed to prohibit ``altering, adding, moving, or removing any stamp, brand, paint, timber
sale boundary marker or tag, or other identification on any tree *&blank;*&blank;* previously marked or surveyed
by a Forest officer *&blank;*&blank;*.'' This addition is needed due to the increasing number of cases where legitimate
brands, paint, and timber sale boundary markers have been altered, moved, or removed. In pursuing such cases, the
agency has discovered that the current rules do not adequately address this practice.

Paragraph (a) currently prohibits ``placing or allowing unauthorized livestock to enter or to be in the National

, 835 F.3d 223 (9th Cir. 1987)), the court stated that the inclusion of the words ``placing'' and ``allowing'' required
the government to prove that the livestock owner meant to violate this rule intentionally. This interpretation is
not consistent with the agency's intent; therefore paragraph (a) would be revised by removing the words ``placing''
or ``allowing'' to make clear that unauthorized livestock are prohibited without regard to whether a person intended
to place or allow such livestock on National Forest System lands.

Paragraph (a) currently prohibits the ``hunting, trapping, fishing, catching, molesting, killing, or having in
possession any kind of wild animal, birds, or fish'' to the extent that Federal or State laws are violated. Under the
proposed rule, this paragraph would be expanded to include the words ``transporting, buying, selling, bartering,
or offering to buy'' wild animals, birds, or fish to cover additional activities prohibited by State or Federal laws
which Forest officers routinely encounter in the field. The revision would also add ``shellfish'' to the existing
rule, as there are several large shellfish beds on the National Forest System in Washington State, and these are not
protected under the current rule.

The heading of this section would be revised to read ``Property administered by the Forest Service'' to clarify that
the prohibitions apply to United States Government property rather than to the personal property of a forest visitor.
In addition, the introduction to the section would be revised to state: ``Except as provided by special use authorization,
contract, approved plan of operations, or Federal law or regulation, the following are prohibited *&blank;*&blank;*.''
This revision is proposed so these authorizing documents only have to be stated once in the section, rather than in
each paragraph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing paragraph (a) would be revised and combined with existing paragraph (b) and expanded to prohibit ``disturbing,
damaging, excavating, diggings, removing, transporting, possessing, buying, selling, bartering, or offering
to buy, sell, or barter any natural feature or other property of the United States.'' By incorporating this change
into part 261, the agency will be able to cite persons for property violations as misdemeanors rather than as felonies
under the United States Criminal Code (18 U.S.C. 641 and 1361) when appropriate.

Existing paragraph (c) would be revised and combined with existing paragraph (d) and redesignated as paragraph (b).
The paragraph would also include a corollary addition of the words ``disturbing, damaging, excavating, digging,
removing, transporting, possessing, buying, selling, bartering, or offering to buy, sell, or barter any plant that
is classified as a threatened, endangered, or sensitive species.'' This revision would replace the terms ``rare''
and ``unique'' with the term ``sensitive'' in order to reflect a change in agency terminology since adoption of the
current rule (Forest Service Manual, section 2670.5). Plants that once were identified as ``rare'' or ``unique''
have been placed on ``sensitive'' plant lists established and maintained by each Regional Office of the Forest Service.

Existing paragraph (e) would be redesignated as paragraph (d) and revised by adding the words ``without permission''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four new provisions are proposed for this section. A new paragraph (f) would prohibit the possession, duplication,
or use of Forest Service locks and keys without authorization. All Forest Service regions are experiencing significant
problems with the unauthorized use of these items. The only remedy currently available is under the provisions of
18 U.S.C. 641, which requires the agency to prove that an actual theft of government property has occurred. These kinds
of cases can best be handled as misdemeanors rather than as felonies; therefore, inclusion in part 261 of a prohibition
on unauthorized possession, duplication, and use of Forest Service locks and keys is appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New paragraph (g) and (h) are proposed to parallel, as misdemeanors, a relatively new computer fraud law found at 18
U.S.C. 1030. The statute requires that unauthorized access must ``affect the use of the government's operation *&blank;*&blank;*
of a computer.'' The statute also did not provide for prosecution under a misdemeanor charge. The addition of paragraphs
(g) and (h) in part 261 would allow the agency to initiate action where there has been unauthorized use regardless of
the effect of the use on the government's operation of a computer, and would provide a means for prosecution of such
use as a misdemeanor. The definition of ``computer'' proposed for inclusion in &sect;261.2 is the same as in 18 U.S.C.
1030.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The addition of paragraph (i) would provide a prohibition against performing an action or failing to perform an action
in violation of any restrictive covenants or deed reservations associated with scenic easements. There are many
instances when there are blatant, but minor, violations of a scenic easement (e.g. installation of signs, use of unauthorized
paint colors, etc.) which can be resolved more efficiently through the issuance of a citation rather than through
the initiation of a lawsuit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, new paragraph (j) is proposed to make it clear that removal of minerals or mineral materials from the National
Forest System is prohibited unless done in compliance with laws and regulations. To be in compliance, a person may
need to obtain an approved plan of operations or operating plan in accordance with 36 CFR part 228, subparts A, C, or
E, 36 CFR part 292, subpart D, or a permit or lease issued by the Department of the Interior in accordance with 43 CFR chapter

Paragraph (d) would be revised to remove the prohibition against the discharge of a firearm across or on a Forest development

against any discharge has created a significant problem in several Forest Service regions as a ``Forest development
road'' includes closed roads, traffic service level ``D'' roads, and other similar roads that have little or no vehicular
use. Because of the limited traffic, hunting along these roads is not considered to be a safety problem. The proposed
revision would add a prohibition against the discharge of a firearm from a vehicle and then make clear that the current
prohibition against discharging a firearm ``in any manner or place whereby any person or property is exposed to injury
or damage as a result of such discharge or use,'' applies to any location in the National Forest System.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragrph (k) would be revised to change the term ``operating plan'' or ``plan of operations.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the preceding amendments, six new provisions are proposed for this section. A new paragraph (n) would
prohibit the payment of any ``product, permit, fee or service'' by a check backed by insufficient funds. Several Assistant
United States Attorneys have recommended this addition, as the only current remedy for such practices is to pursue
them through State courts, which has not been efficient. There have been documented instances where the same user
of a group-fee area or campsite, knowing that the agency is unable to initiate an effective collection action, has
written bad checks two and sometimes three years in a row.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new paragraph (o) would prohibit anyone from charging or collecting fees from persons using the National Forest
System, unless the charge or collection is permitted by Federal law, regulation, or special use authorization. In
the past few years, there have been an increasing number of cases where private individuals were successful in obtaining
``payments'' from unsuspecting forest users for such things as rafting, using four-wheel-drive roads, and walking
across areas under special use authorization, none of which required payment of a fee. This rule is needed to protect
the public from unlawful fees by providing a means for prosecuting those engaging in such schemes.

A new paragraph (p) would be added to provide for the prosecution of a failure to display an authorizing document when
it is required by the document to do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new paragraph (q) would prohibit ``outfitting or guiding'' on the National Forest System without a special use authorization
or in violation of Federal or State law. This proposal was probably the addition most widely requested by the Forest
Service regions. Considerable problems have existed in the enforcement of the requirement that outfitting and guiding
be conducted under special use authorization due to the lack of a definition for the two activities. The approach taken
in the proposed rule is to define ``outfitting and guiding'' at 36 CFR 261.2 and then to prohibit these activities without
a special use authorization at 36 CFR 261.10. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new paragraph (r) would be added to prohibit the undertaking of any activity in violation of the requirements of a
scenic easement. This is a companion rule to the proposed 36 CFR 261.9(i) and is being promulgated for the same reasons
outlined in that paragraph.

Existing paragraph (a) would be revised to add the terms ``contract'' and ``approved plan of operations'' to the list

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new paragraph (e) is proposed to establish a rule prohibiting the operation of a vehicle in violation of State laws,
posted signs, or traffic devices. Although local authorities are relied on, when possible, to enforce traffic regulations,
there are many times when it is not possible or practical to obtain their help, making Forest Service enforcement necessary.
For example, reckless driving is a matter that needs immediate action when it is spotted by a trained and properly equipped
Forest officer to ensure safe travel for other road users. Since State laws are applicable to Forest development roads,
they could be enforced by Forest officers, when necessary, through adoption of this proposed prohibition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The language proposed for new paragraph (f) currently appears at 36 CFR 261.54(f), which prohibits ``operating a
vehicle carelessly, recklessly, *&blank;*&blank;* or in a manner or at a speed that would endanger or be likely to
endanger any person or property.'' The paragraph would be removed from subpart B, amended to clarify this is a strict
liability offense, and made a part of subpart A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new paragraph (g) would require the use of seatbelts, if provided by the manufacturer, for occupants of vehicles
traveling on Forest development roads. The prohibition would support State laws which require the same, while ensuring
safety and consistency by relying on a single rule that would apply throughout the National Forest System. Seatbelt
laws vary from State to State. For example, some states exempt the passengers of certain classes of vehicles from mandatory
seatbelt usage, while others, exempt certain passengers. In many areas on the National Forest System, a Forest development
road can cross State boundaries. In these situations, reliance on some State seatbelt statutes could lead to inconsistency
and confusion. This provision will ensure the protection afforded by seatbelts throughout the National Forest System
regardless of individual State laws.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing paragraph (g) would be revised and redesignated as (f). The paragraph would contain the same language as
proposed for 36 CFR 261.12(f). The revision, as proposed for this section, would provide a consistent approach in
the treatment of careless and reckless driving throughout the National Forest System. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing paragraph (h) would be revised and redesignated as (g). The revision would better define the current prohibition

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One additional provision is proposed for this section. Many States have passed special registration requirements

of a vehicle without displaying a license plate or the proper registration, if it is required by State law.

A new paragraph (r) would be added to prohibit the informal reservation or ``staking-out'' of camping units by third
parties. Unless campsites are specifically designated for advanced reservations, they are intended to be occupied
on a first-come, first-served basis. The ``staking out'' of campsites has become a continuing problem as recreational
use of National Forest System lands increases and is one that visitors often bring to the attention of Forest officers
for resolution.

protection of certain animal populations or biological communities, management activities, or public health and
safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) currently states ``threatened, endangered, rare, unique, or vanishing species of plants, animals,
birds or fish.'' The proposed revision would remove all the categories which are currently listed and be revised to
include simply ``plants, animals, birds, fish or shellfish.'' This revision is needed as the current listed categories
are too narrow to provide effective protection to certain species of animals during different times of year. For example,
the agency may wish to close a sensitive elk calving area during a specific time of year, but are currently unable to
do so because elk are not ``threatened or endangered, etc.'' The proposed revision would remedy this situation.

Three changes are proposed to this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) currently prohibits the use of any type of vehicle upon the issuance of an order. This rule would be revised
by adding the words ``or possessing'' to the current text. In many cases, local county ordinances prohibit the possession
of certain types of vehicles on lands either adjacent to or within a sensitive area, for example, the possession of
tracked vehicles or modified off-road vehicles within a special wildlife or waterfowl habitat nesting area. The
addition would allow a Regional Forester or Forest Supervisor to issue a specific order that prohibits the possession
of a certain class of vehicle, if needed to be consistent with a Forest Land and Resource Management Plan or to support
a local ordinance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) currently prohibits using a road for commercial hauling without a permit or written authorization
upon the issuance of an order. The rule would be revised by adding the words ``or other commercial activities'' to the
current text. Authorization for commercial use of Forest development roads should not be limited to hauling a product;
other commercial use such as transporting heavy equipment should also be subject to this requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, paragraph (f), which prohibits careless or reckless driving, would be removed because, as previously noted,
it is proposed to make this a general prohibition in &sect;261.12.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (m) allows for the issuance of an order to prohibit the ``discharge of a firearm, air rifle, or gas gun.''
Under the proposed rule, this paragraph would be revised to read ``discharging or possessing a firearm, air rifle,
gas gun, or other device capable of causing injury to persons or wildlife or capable of causing property damage.''
For example, the addition of the prohibition against ``possessing'' is necessary for wildlife protection at certain
times of the year on different national forest units and for public safety in areas of higher visitor use or when property
would be easily damaged by firearms and other devices shooting projectiles. The addition of ``or other device'' is
necessary to support the inclusion of devices, such as starter pistols and crossbows, which can cause serious bodily
harm or death if used. And finally, the addition of ``capable of causing injury to persons or wildlife or capable of
causing property damage'' is necessary to specify more precisely the type of device to which the prohibition would
apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (bb) would be revised to adopt the new definition of ``alcoholic beverage'' proposed at 36 CFR 261.2.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new paragraph (dd) would be added to prohibit the storage of personal property in any area outside of a national forest
developed recreation site when prohibited by an order. Similar to the problem within developed recreation sites
addressed by proposed &sect;261.14(r), is the ``staking out'' of popular sites by users several weeks in advance
of when they are to be occupied for hunting or other activities. Often, other users desiring to camp in the same area
are unable to do so because of this activity. This rule is proposed for Subpart B, because of the site-specific nature
of the problem and the need for flexibility to prescribe different lengths of time for each area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new paragraph (ee) would be added to enable a Regional Forester or Forest Supervisor to issue an order prohibiting
the possession, storage, or use of glass food or beverage containers. The rule is proposed in light of serious safety
hazards presented by broken glass in heavily used beaches and swimming areas and the need to prevent injuries from
cuts to persons recreating in these areas.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing &sect;262.1 would be redesignated as &sect;262.2.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing &sect;262.2, which governs the purchase of information in furtherance of investigations, would be revised
and combined with &sect;262.3, which governs the purchase of evidence. This revision is proposed in response to requests
of several Forest Service regions for a payment scale for purchase of information and evidence that reflects the gravity
of the offenses investigated, such as violations of the National Forest System Drug Control Act of 1986, as amended.
For example, amounts that Special Agents could be authorized to pay for information or evidence would be raised from
$200 and $400 respectively, to $500 for a single transaction, with other increases or changes proposed for the employees
so listed. Existing paragraph (b) in both sections, which states that payments cannot be made for the investigation
of petty offenses, would be removed. The agency's authority to make payments for evidence and information was affirmed
in a decision of the Comptroller General dated April 29, 1971 (CG&hyph;B&hyph;172259) and allows for payment to further
any criminal investigation, otwithstanding the classification of the offense.

The title of this subpart would be revised to read ``Administrative Impoundments and Removals.'' This change would

animals or personal property on the National Forest System. Criminal law enforcement procedures associated with
impoundments and property seizures made pursuant to arrests and searches are not covered by the regulations and are
contained in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for the United States District Courts and the Forest Service

Paragraph (d) would be revised to allow the Forest Service to use un-redeemed or abandoned personal property if it

in the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 484(m)) and at 41 CFR part 101&hyph;48.
In many cases, the conversion of un-redeemed personal property to Government property can provide a substantial

This section currently provides for the removal of vehicles or other objects which create either an ``impediment
or hazard to the safety, convenience, or comfort of other users of the National Forest System.'' The rule would be revised
to include a vehicle or other object ``which has been left in such a manner that it impairs or may result in the impairment
of any area of the National Forest System or other areas under Forest Service control.'' The revision is needed in light
of increasing problems associated with the abandonment of automobiles or other large objects left as junk in popular
undeveloped recreation areas on the National Forest System.

Regulatory Impact

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under USDA procedures and Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review.
It has been determined that this is not a significant rule. This rule will not have an annual effect of $100 million or
more on the economy nor adversely affect productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety,
nor State or local governments. This rule will not interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency nor raise
new legal or policy issues. Finally, this action will not alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user
fees, loan programs, or the rights and obligations of recipients of such programs. Accordingly, this proposed rule
is not subject to OMB review under Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, this proposed rule has been considered in light of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.),
and has been determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities as defined by that Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12630 for the Evaluation of Risk and Avoidance of Unanticipated Takings directs all agencies to evaluate
whether certain proposed agency actions present a risk of effecting a taking of private property. Section 2(a)(3)
of the Order exempts law enforcement actions from the requirements of the Executive Order. Since this proposed action
involves additions, and technical and administrative changes, to prohibitions of activities on or affecting National
Forest System land and resources, visitors, and employees, section 2(a)(3) applies and further analysis under the
Executive Order is unnecessary.

Regulatory Reform: Less Burdensome or More Efficient Alternatives
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture is committed to carrying out its statutory and regulatory mandates in a manner that
best serves the public interest. Therefore, where legal discretion permits, the Department actively seeks to promulgate
regulations that promote economic growth, create jobs, are minimally burdensome, and are easy for the public to understand,
use or comply with. In short, the Department is committed to issuing regulations that maximize net benefits to society
and minimize costs imposed by those regulations. This principle is articulated in President Bush's January 28, 1992,
memorandum to agency heads, and in Executive Orders 12291 and 12498. The Department applies this principle to the
fullest extent possible, consistent with law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has developed and reviewed this regulatory proposal in accordance with these principles. Nonetheless,
the Department believes that public input from all interested persons can be invaluable in ensuring that the final
regulatory product is minimally burdensome and maximally efficient. Therefore, the Department specifically seeks
comments and suggestions from the public regarding any less burdensome or more efficient alternative that would
accomplish the purposes described in the proposal. Comments suggesting less burdensome or more efficient alternatives
should be addressed to the agency as provided in this notice.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule will not result in additional paperwork not already required by law or approved for use. Therefore,
the review provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507) and implementing regulations at 5 CFR
part 1320 do not apply.

Environmental Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would set forth the acts that are prohibited on the National Forest System. This rule, in and of itself,
will not have environmental effects that need to be addressed in compliance with the National Environmental Policy
Act procedures. Section 31.1b of Forest Service Handbook 1909.15 (57 FR 43180; September 18, 1992) excludes from
documentation in an environmental assessment or impact statement ``rules, regulations, or policies to establish
Service-wide administration procedures, programs, processes, or instructions.'' The agency's preliminary assessment
is that this rule falls within this category of actions and that no extraordinary circumstances exist which would
require preparation of an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement. A final determination will
be made upon adoption of the final rule.
