The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) proposes to amend its regulations to reflect that agency heads must ensure
that employees and applicants for employment at their agencies are notified of the recently enacted provisions in
the Hatch Act Reform Amendments of 1993, which prohibit individuals from requesting, making, transmitting, accepting,
or considering political recommendations in effecting personnel actions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In the Hatch Act Reform Amendments of 1993, Public Law 103&hyph;94, Congress amended section 3303 of title 5, United
States Code, to expand and strengthen the existing prohibition against political recommendations, i.e., recommendations
based on party affiliation, in examinations and appointments. Section 3303 originally applied to examination for,
or appointment to, positions in the competitive service. It prohibited examining and appointing officials from
accepting or considering congressional recommendations of applicants, except for recommendations about their
character or residence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 3303, as amended, expands the scope of the prohibition by including employees as well as applicants, and covering
the excepted service and career Senior Executive Service as well as the competitive service. Although section 3303
still prohibits agency officials from considering or accepting political recommendations, it also prohibits them
from soliciting and requesting these recommendations. It further specifies that an agency official who receives
a political recommendation must return the recommendation to the person who sent it with a notation that the recommendation
violates section 3303.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The previous version of the law focused its prohibition on agency officials, and did not prohibit Senators and Congressmen
from making recommendations. The amended version prohibits Senators, Congressmen, congressional employees,
elected State and local officials, political party officials, and other individuals or organizations from making
or transmitting political recommendations. It also prohibits employees and applicants from soliciting or requesting
political recommendations, and prohibits agency officials from soliciting, requesting, considering or accepting
such recommendations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where the previous law was limited to examinations and appointments, the amended version includes personnel actions
as well. Section 3303, as amended, defines ``personnel action'' as any action described in 5 U.S.C. 2302(a)(2)(A)
(i)&hyph;(ix), including appointments, promotions, disciplinary or corrective actions, details, transfers,
reassignments, reinstatements, restorations, reemployments, performance evaluations, and decisions concerning
pay, benefits, or awards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amended version permits agencies and agency officials to consider statements of recommendation under limited,
narrowly drawn circumstances. Recommendations may be considered if they result from an agency request and consist
solely of an evaluation of the work performance, ability, aptitude, and general qualifications of the employee or
applicant, or if they relate solely to the character and residence of an individual. Recommendations consisting
of statements requested by authorized Government officials to determine whether an individual meets security or
suitability standards, or furnished under a law or regulation authorizing consideration of the statement with respect
to a specific category of positions also are permitted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where section 3303 previously did not provide for remedial action for violations, it now authorizes agencies to take
adverse action to enforce its provisions. Moreover, the amended version specifies that violations of its prohibitions
are prohibited personnel practices. Finally, the United States Postal Service is excluded from the amended version
because it is subject to similar requirements in 39 U.S.C. 1002.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3303, as amended, specifically authorizes OPM to promulgate regulations requiring agency heads to ensure
that employees and applicants receive notice of its provisions. Therefore, OPM proposes to amend part 300 by adding
a new Subpart H_Notification Requirements Relating to the Statutory Prohibitions on Political Recommendations
in Personnel Actions. Section 300.801 of the new Subpart H states that agency heads must ensure that applicants and
employees are notified of the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 3303, as amended. Section 300.802 lists strategies for issuing
notifications, but it also specifies that the list is not exclusive and gives agency officials the discretion to consider
and implement other means of notification.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The OCC, the Board, the FDIC and the OTS (collectively ``the agencies'') are issuing this proposed rule to implement
the portions of section 305 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) that require
the agencies to revise their risk-based capital standards for insured depository institutions to ensure that those
standards take adequate account of concentration of credit risk and the risks of nontraditional activities. The
intended effect of this proposed rule is to ensure that the agencies take adequate account of concentration of credit
risk and the risks of nontraditional activities in assessing an institution's capital adequacy. The proposed rule
amends the risk-based capital standards by explicitly identifying concentration of credit risk and certain risks
arising from nontraditional activities, as well as an institution's ability to manage these risks, as important
factors in assessing an institution's overall capital adequacy.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The risk-based capital standards tailor an institution's minimum capital requirement to broad categories of credit
risk embodied in its assets and off-balance-sheet instruments. These standards require institutions to have total
capital equal to at least 8 percent of their risk-weighted assets.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Institutions with high or inordinate levels of risk are expected to operate above minimum capital standards.

Section 305(b) of FDICIA, (12 U.S.C. 1828 note) requires the agencies to revise their risk-based capital standards
for insured depository institutions to ensure that those standards take adequate account of interest rate risk,
concentration of credit risk and the risks of nontraditional activities. This proposed rule addresses concentration
of credit risk and the risks of nontraditional activities. Rulemakings regarding interest rate risk are being issued
separately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Advance notices of proposed rulemaking issued by the agencies with respect to section 305 requested comment through
a series of questions on possible approaches to defining, measuring and incorporating these risks in the risk-based
capital standards. Comments received in response to the notices are summarized in the following discussions of each
risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, each agency addresses capital adequacy through a variety of supervisory actions and considers the risks
of credit concentrations and nontraditional activities in taking those varied supervisory actions.

Summary of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies received 107 responses to the advance notice of proposed rulemaking on concentration of credit risk,
with some duplication among agencies. In response to the question of what factors should be used in defining concentrations,
most commenters agreed that borrower, industry, geography, collateral and loan type are relevant factors to define
concentration risk. There was less consensus on which of these factors is the most significant or how to apply these
factors in determining concentrations. Some commenters suggested using a narrow definition for concentrations
to make any rule the agencies might adopt easier to implement and less burdensome to the industry. Others suggested
caution in defining concentrations given data limitations and differences in the way definitions are applied by
institutions in managing risk.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Few commenters offered specific guidance as to an appropriate objective formula to assess capital for concentration
risk. However, many commenters indicated that determinations should be performed on a case-by-case basis because
of the high variability in type and riskiness of concentrations among institutions. Regarding the general levels
of capital appropriate for concentrations, some commenters suggested requiring higher than minimum capital ratios
for affected institutions, while others suggested reducing reported capital to reflect the additional risk. Other
commenters indicated that concentration risk should be viewed in the context of all other factors affecting the capital
adequacy of the institution, including the size of the allowance for loan losses, profitability, liquidity, and
internal controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters were concerned that proposed regulations might be overly burdensome or provide incentives for institutions
to engage in activities such as out-of-territory lending that, while adding to diversity, also add to an institution's
overall risk. Some commenters were also concerned that new regulations might place the banking industry at a competitive
disadvantage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Approach
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most institutions, large and small, can identify and track large concentrations of credit risk by individual or related
groups of borrowers. Many institutions are also able to identify concentrations by either industry, geography,
country, loan type or other relevant factors. However, because of practical and theoretical problems, there is no
generally accepted approach to identify and quantify the magnitude of risk associated with concentrations of credit.
In particular, definitions and analyses of concentrations are not uniform within the industry and are based in part
on the subjective judgments of each institution using its experience and knowledge of its specific borrowers, market
area and products. For these reasons, it is not feasible at this time to quantify the risk related to concentrations
of credit for use in a formula-based capital calculation. However, techniques do exist to identify broad classes
of concentrations and to recognize significant exposures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The volatile and unpredictable nature of the timing and magnitude of losses associated with concentrations suggests
that the effective tracking and management of such risk is important to ensuring the safety and soundness of financial
institutions. Moreover, the agencies believe that institutions with significant levels of concentrations of credit
risk should hold capital above the regulatory minimums. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With these considerations in mind, the agencies propose to take account of concentration of credit risk in their risk-based
capital guidelines or regulations by amending the standards to explicitly identify concentrations of credit risk
and an institution's ability to manage them as important factors in assessing an institution's overall capital adequacy.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to reviewing concentrations of credit risk pursuant to section 305, the agencies also may review an institution's
management of concentrations of credit risk for adequacy and consistency with safety and soundness standards regarding
internal controls, credit underwriting or other relevant operational and managerial areas to be promulgated pursuant
to section 132 of FDICIA (12 U.S.C. 1831p&hyph;1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In implementing regulations concerning concentration of credit risk, the agencies recognize the need to ensure
that any treatment does not inadvertently create false incentives or unintended consequences that might decrease
the safety and soundness of the banking and thrift industries or unnecessarily reduce the availability of credit
to potential borrowers. For example, while portfolio diversification is a desirable goal, it may also increase an
institution's overall risk if accomplished by lending in unfamiliar market areas to out-of-territory borrowers
or by rapid expansion of new loan products for which the institution does not have adequate expertise. In addition,
to the extent certain loan products, geographic areas or borrowers are perceived to fit into generic designations
of concentrations, credit availability to certain groups of borrowers might be severely limited, despite the creditworthiness
of individual borrowers, or the neutral or beneficial impact a single credit might have on the overall risk of the institution's
portfolio. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another consideration in evaluating credit concentrations is the ``Qualified Thrift Lender'' test that requires
thrifts by statute to hold 65 percent of their assets in qualifying categories. This requirement necessarily ``concentrates''
a thrift's portfolio in certain types of assets. OTS does not intend to implement section 305 in such a way as to penalize
thrift institutions for fulfilling this obligation.

C. Risks of Nontraditional Activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Summary of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies received 69 comment letters on nontraditional activities, with some duplication among the agencies.
Many commenters believed that it would be very difficult to create a definitive list of activities that should be considered
nontraditional. Some commenters indicated that the risks of nontraditional activities depend on both the activity
and the institution involved, and thus that each depository institution should be addressed on a case-by-case basis
through the examination process. It was also observed that, while the activities themselves might be new or nontraditional,
the risks of these activities can be segmented into components (e.g., credit risk, interest-rate risk, operating
risk) that are normally associated with traditional banking activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters also raised concerns that explicit capital requirements for nontraditional activities might affect
the competitive balance between insured depository institutions and non-bank financial firms such as securities
firms. In particular, concern was raised that restricting new activities could limit the ability of banks and thrifts
to compete with non-bank competitors, or alternatively restrictions might unduly discourage depository institutions
from undertaking otherwise prudent initiatives. Some commenters also indicated that capital standards imposed
for an activity should be parallel to standards imposed on non-banks that compete in the same activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters expressed concern about the potential risks that arise from inexperience when a smaller or less-
sophisticated institution first embarks on a new business venture, while others believed that the activities undertaken
by the larger and more experienced institutions present greater risks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Approach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
New developments in technology and financial markets have introduced significant changes to the banking industry,
and in some cases have led institutions to engage in activities not traditionally considered part of their business.
Both in the risk-based capital regulations and guidelines adopted by the agencies in 1989, and in subsequent revisions
and interpretations, the agencies have adopted measures to take adequate account of the risks of nontraditional
activities under the risk-based capital standards. Thus, to the extent that section 305 constitutes a mandate to
the agencies to make certain that risk-based capital standards are kept current with industry practices, the agencies
have been acting consistently with section 305. Furthermore, in keeping with section 305, the agencies will continue
their efforts to incorporate nontraditional activities into risk-based capital.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies propose to take account of the risks posed by nontraditional activities by ensuring that, as members
of the industry begin to engage in, or significantly expand their participation in, a nontraditional activity, the
risks of that activity are promptly analyzed and the activity is given appropriate capital treatment. Moreover,
the agencies recognize that an institution's ability to adequately manage the risks posed by nontraditional activities
affects its risk exposure. Therefore, the agencies also propose to amend their risk-based capital standards to explicitly
identify the management of nontraditional activities as an important factor to consider in assessing an institution's
overall capital adequacy.

D. Biennial Review of Risk-Based Capital Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 305(a) of FDICIA requires the agencies to review their capital standards biennially to determine whether
those standards are sufficient to facilitate prompt corrective action under section 38 of FDICIA, 12 U.S.C. 1831o.
As part of any such review, the agencies expect that they will consider the asset coverage of the risk-based capital
standards, including in particular the coverage of concentrations of credit and nontraditional activities. The
agencies, though, do not intend to wait until the next biennial review should a nontraditional activity evolve rapidly
in the industry; rather, such products will be promptly reviewed for proper treatment under risk-based capital.
Similarly, as new developments in identifying and measuring concentration of credit risk emerge, potential refinements
to risk-based capital standards will be considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, to the extent appropriate, the agencies will issue examination guidelines on new developments in nontraditional
activities or concentrations of credit to ensure that adequate account is taken of the risks of these activities.

F. Regulatory Flexibility Act Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each agency has concluded after reviewing the proposed regulation that the regulation, if adopted, will not impose
a significant economic hardship on small institutions. The proposal does not necessitate the development of sophisticated
recordkeeping or reporting systems by small institutions nor will small institutions need to seek out the expertise
of specialized accountants, lawyers, or managers in order to comply with the regulation. Each agency therefore hereby
certifies pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)) that the proposal, if adopted,
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OCC and the OTS have determined that this proposed rule does not constitute a ``significant regulatory action.''
This proposed rule will amend the risk-based capital guidelines to clarify that the agencies may impose additional
capital requirements above the minimum capital leverage and risk-based capital requirements where an institution
has significant concentration of credit risk or risks from nontraditional activities. This proposed rule is consistent
with the current practice and policies of the agencies and is required by section 305 of FDICIA.

The risk-based capital ratio focuses principally on broad categories of credit risk, although the framework for
assigning assets and off-balance-sheet items to risk categories does incorporate elements of transfer risk, as
well as limited instances of interest rate and market risk. The framework incorporates risks arising from traditional
banking activities as well as risks arising from nontraditional activities. The risk-based ratio does not, however,
incorporate other factors that can affect an institution's financial condition. These factors include overall
interest-rate exposure; liquidity, funding and market risks; the quality and level of earnings; investment, loan
portfolio, and other concentrations of credit risk; certain risks arising from nontraditional activities; the
quality of loans and investments; the effectiveness of loan and investment policies; and management's overall ability
to monitor and control financial and operating risks, including the risks presented by concentrations of credit
and nontraditional activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to evaluating capital ratios, an overall assessment of capital adequacy must take account of those factors,
including, in particular, the level and severity of problem and classified assets. For this reason, the final supervisory
judgement on a bank's capital adequacy may differ significantly from conclusions that might be drawn solely from
the level of its risk-based capital ratio.

2. Section 325.3(a) is amended in the fourth sentence by adding ``significant risks from concentrations of credit
or nontraditional activities,'' immediately after ``funding risks,'' and by adding ``will take these other factors

The risk-based capital ratio focuses principally on broad categories of credit risk; however, the ratio does not
take account of many other factors that can affect a bank's financial condition. These factors include overall interest
rate risk exposure; liquidity, funding and market risks; the quality and level of earnings; investment, loan portfolio,
and other concentrations of credit risk; certain risks arising from nontraditional activities; the quality of loans
and investments; the effectiveness of loan and investment policies; and management's overall ability to monitor
and control financial and operating risks, including the risk presented by concentrations of credit and nontraditional
activities. In addition to evaluating capital ratios, an overall assessment of capital adequacy must take account
of each of these other factors, including, in particular, the level and severity of problem and adversely classified
assets. For this reason, the final supervisory judgement on a bank's capital adequacy may differ significantly from
the conclusions that might be drawn solely from the absolute level of the bank's risk-based capital ratio.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The NCUA Board on November 15, 1993, voted to change NCUA's fiscal year and NCUSIF's insurance year to coincide with
the calendar year effective January 1, 1995. This change requires the NCUA to amend its regulations dealing with operating
fees and insurance assessments to conform to the calendar year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently under &sect;701.6 of NCUA's Rules and Regulations, an operating fee is assessed on federal credit unions
based on a fiscal year of October 1 to September 30. This section must be changed to reflect the change to the calendar
year. Further, the operating fee assessed as a result of a conversion or merger will now be based on the calendar year
and those sections must be changed to delete references to the former fiscal year and reflect the new calendar year.
12 CFR 701.6(b) (2) and (3). The change will result in a transition quarter that begins on October 1, 1994 and ends on
December 31, 1994 for which no operating fee would be assessed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently under &sect;741.11 of NCUA's Rules and Regulations, an insurance premium and one percent deposit are assessed
for all federally insured credit unions based on an insurance year of July 1 through June 30. 12 CFR 741.11(b)(1). This
definition must be amended to reflect the change to the calendar year. Further, the due dates for the deposits and premiums
must be changed from January 31 to a date as set by the NCUA Board in order to coincide with the calendar year. 12 CFR 741.11
(c), (d) and (g).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires the NCUA to prepare an analysis to describe any significant economic impact
any regulation may have on a potential number of small credit unions (primarily those under $1 million in assets).
Preliminary analysis concerning the effect the proposed rule will have on small credit unions indicates that no significant
economic impact will result if the rule is promulgated in final form by the NCUA Board. The proposed rule simply repeats
the preexisting requirements of federal credit unions to pay operating fees and federally insured credit unions
to pay one percent deposit and insurance premiums with the only modification being the dates when these fees and premiums
must be paid. Therefore, the NCUA Board has determined and certifies under the authority granted in 5 U.S.C. 605(b)
that the proposed rule, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small credit
unions. Accordingly, the NCUA Board has determined that a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12612 requires NCUA to consider the effect of its actions on state interests. The proposed regulation
dealing with insurance premiums applies to all federally insured credit unions. However, it makes no substantive
changes except to change the dates for certain filings and assessments of fees. The NCUA Board has determined that
this amendment is not likely to have any direct effect on states, on the relationship between the states, or on the distribution
of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government because federally insured credit unions are
currently required to pay an insurance premium.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would allow certain passive businesses to be eligible for SBA financial assistance under both
the SBA's development company and 7(a) business loan programs if the real estate (or personal property) it holds would
be used by an eligible small business concern in which any owner of at least 20 percent of the passive business owns at
least 20 percent of the small business concern. The proposed rule would eliminate many requirements and restrictions
which presently limit the use of real estate holding entities in SBA's business loan and development company programs.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 120.101&hyph;2(e) of SBA's regulations (13 CFR 120.101&hyph;2(e) (1993)) provides that a real estate holding
entity (known as an alter ego) may be eligible as an applicant for financial assistance under the SBA business loan
program if it is organized and operated for profit as a corporation, partnership or individual proprietorship. It
must be in the business of owning and leasing property to an operating small business concern for the latter's exclusive
use. There must be an identity of ownership in the borrower and the small business concern. The regulation also contains
a complicated description of certain familial relationships which qualify as identical for purposes of ownership
interest. The regulation also requires as collateral for the assistance that: (1) The applicant pledge the lease
between it and the operating concern, (2) the operating concern must be a guarantor or coborrower on the loan, and (3)
the owners of the operating concern must guarantee the loan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 108.8(d) of the regulations governing SBA's development company program (13 CFR 108.8(d) (1993)) allows
a real estate holding entity (known as an alter ego) to be eligible for a loan made pursuant to that program if, among
other requirements, it is a business organized for profit, the ownership interests in the holding entity and the small
business concern to which it leases the property are identical except for the complicated exceptions with respect
to selected family owners, the collateral for the assistance includes an assignment of the lease between the holding
entity and the small business, and the small business guarantees the loan or is a co-borrower. In addition, there is
a provision which covers the possibility that the operating concern could sublease part of the property to a third
party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These detailed requirements and restrictions are confusing and burdensome for the public. Numerous interpretations
and guidelines have failed to eliminate inconsistent treatment by SBA of applicant holding entities from program
to program. The public has become frustrated by some of the subtle distinctions between the two programs with respect
to these real estate holding entities, and the SBA servicing of loans which have been made to them has added to the general
confusion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SBA recognizes that valid business reasons (such as estate planning or tax purposes) may exist for an operating small
business concern to spin off into an affiliate the real estate on which the operating concern operates its business,
and SBA wants to provide assistance in such situations where possible. The Agency, at the same time, wants to ensure
that it will not finance purely passive investments in real or personal property. The holding entity regulations
were initially promulgated fifteen years ago to accomplish this intent, but the changes, revisions and amendments
to the regulations have caused confusion, inconsistency and frustration by the public and SBA personnel.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Therefore, the Agency is proposing to simplify the present regulations by eliminating many of the above referenced
limitations and restrictions. This proposed regulation, if enacted in final form, would eliminate the inconsistency
which is inherent under the present rules, and it would greatly assist potential small business applicants which
seek SBA financial assistance through their real estate holding affiliates. The Agency will no longer refer to the
real estate holding entity as an alter ego, but will consider it to be the passive business.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It must be reiterated that SBA does not intend under this proposal to finance a passive business or investment property
which requires no active involvement by the business owners. A passive business would be an acceptable and eligible
applicant under these proposed regulations because it is a holding entity affiliated with an otherwise eligible
small business concern.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this proposal, a passive business applicant would be eligible if the real estate (or personal property) it holds
would be used by an eligible small business concern and at least one 20 percent owner of the passive business also owns
at least 20 percent of the small business concern. Under this proposal, a trust could qualify as an eligible passive
business if the grantor or trustee of the trust owns at least 20 percent of the small business concern, or if a beneficiary
of at least 20 percent of the trust assets has at least a 20 percent ownership in the small business concern. This ownership
requirement would identify the passive business with the operating business for SBA regulatory purposes. The proposed
regulation does not require that there be more than one 20 percent owner of both entities or that the principals control
either entity. As long as one person is a 20 percent owner in both entities that would be sufficient to make an entity
the eligibility passive business affiliate of the small business concern since that person would be considered to
be a principal in both entities. Alternatively, if members of the same family (father, mother, son, daughter, wife,
husband, brother or sister) meet the 20 percent ownership requirement in both the passive business and the small business
concern they would be considered to be the same principal for SBA purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both the passive business and the small business concern would be required to be obligated on the vote evidencing the
assistance, and any person who has a 20 percent ownership interest in both entities would provide a personal guarantee
to support the SBA financial assistance. Proprietors, partners, officers, directors and owners of 20 percent or
more in either entity would also be subject to the collateral provisions set forth in &sect;120.103&hyph;2(c) of
the SBA regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this proposed rule, SBA would eliminate the present requirement in the business loan program that the passive
business must only be a proprietorship, partnership or corporation in order to accommodate SBA's policy that a trust
can be an eligible passive business if it otherwise comports with the requirements of this regulation. It would eliminate
the present convoluted and complicated provisions which detail the listed family members who can hold ownership
interests in the passive business and small business concern in varying percentages of ownership. It would also eliminate
the present requirement which mandates that non-family owners have complete identity of interests. The purpose
of these proposed changes is to simplify the rules and to ensure that SBA financial assistance remains available for
a legitimate passive business affiliate of an eligible small business concern when the affiliate holds real estate
or personal property leased to the small business concern and utilized for business purposes. SBA has proceeded in
its business assistance programs on the assumption that a principal owns at least 20 percent of a business and, under
&sect;120.103&hyph;2(c) of its regulations, SBA generally requires a proprietor, partner, officer, director,
or 20 percent owner to execute a personal guarantee as collateral for the assistance. This requirement would apply
to such enumerated persons in either entity. Prudent standards of banking practice will continue to dictate the rules
in providing SBA financial assistance to eligible passive businesses. In addition, SBA would evaluate on a case by
case basis whether the small business concern must make use of all the real property subject to the lease immediately
after execution or whether it could sublease part of the property for an interim period of time. SBA does not want to
interpose itself into the details of the arrangements, so long as the Agency is assured, pursuant to the statutory
provisions, that the financial assistance will be repaid.

(6) For purposes of this paragraph (d), a person is a ``principal'' if he or she is the legal or beneficial owner of at
least 20 percent of both the passive business and the small business concern to which the passive business intends
to lease real or personal property. If the passive business exists in the form of a trust, the trust's grantor or trustee
would be a ``principal'' if he or she owns at least 20 percent of the small business concern, and a beneficiary of at least
20 percent of the trust's assets would be a ``principal'' if he or she owns at least 20 percent of the small business concern.
If members of the same family (father, mother, son, daughter, wife, husband, brother or sister) meet the 20 percent
ownership requirement in both the passive business and the small business concern they would be considered to be the

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard proposes to change regulations governing the operation of the State Road 402, Max Brewer bridge, at
mile 878.9, at Titusville, Florida, by permitting the draw to remain closed during different periods. This proposal
is being made to synchronize the existing closed periods with the periods of peak vehicular traffic. This action should
accommodate the needs of vehicular traffic, while still providing for the reasonable needs of navigation.

Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This bridge presently opens on signal except that from 6:15 a.m. to 7:15 a.m. and 3 p.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through
Friday, except federal holidays, the draw need not open. NASA, whose employees commute to and from the John F. Kennedy
Space Center across the bridge, requested a 30 minute increase in the morning closed period extending from 6 a.m. to
7:30 a.m. This change was requested to ensure continuous uninterrupted flow of highway traffic during the heaviest
daily commuter traffic periods. The bridgeowner, Brevard County, concurred with this proposal.

Discussion of Proposed Amendment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A Coast Guard analysis of highway traffic showed the bridge is used almost exclusively by commuter traffic (90% flow
in one direction) for about an hour each morning and afternoon. The drawbridge is opened frequently due to its substandard
clearance (9 feet closed), especially during the fall and spring vessel migration periods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Holding conditions for vessels near the bridge are considered adequate to allow vessels to safely wait for a bridge
opening during the commuter closed periods. A review of the traffic data indicates there has been a change in the timing
and density of commuter traffic which requires an earlier morning closure period. In addition, the data shows there
has been a reduction in the volume of afternoon commuter traffic which would allow a change in the closure periods without
requiring an increase in the length of time vessels are required to wait for an opening.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal is not considered a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not significant
under the Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040, February 26, 1979). The
Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary.
We conclude this because the proposed rule exempts tugs with tows.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Small Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal, if adopted, will have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are
not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small
Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the proposed rule exempts tugs with tows, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal,
if adopted, will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Collection of Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501
et seq.).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Federalism
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposal under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and has determined that this proposal does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.

Environment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.g.(5)
of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, promulgation of operating requirements or procedures for drawbridges is
categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available
in the docket.

 Comments on the proposed rule were to be received on or before January 28, 1994 (a 30 day comment period). The comment
period is reopened until March 3, 1994. This extension of the comment period is consistent with Executive Order 12866,
which states that ``each agency should afford the public a meaningful opportunity to comment on any proposed regulation,
which in most cases should include a comment period of not less than 60 days.'' Reopening the comment period until March
3, 1994 will provide the public slightly more than the suggested 60 days.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would affect health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and competitive medical plans (CMPs) that
contract with HCFA to furnish health care services to Medicare beneficiaries and to receive payment on a risk basis.
These HMOs and CMPs would no longer be required to absorb the expense of furnishing a new or additional benefit if all
the following conditions apply:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The benefit was established by a national coverage decision (NCD);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cost of furnishing the service would be significant and was not taken into account in calculating the per capita
rate to be paid by HCFA during the current calendar year;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NCD was not published until on or after the date of the announcement of the current calendar year's per capita rate
of payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule is necessary to implement section 4204(c) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, commonly referred
to as ``OBRA '90,'' which is effective for calendar years beginning on or after January 1, 1991.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the amendment is to encourage HMOs and CMPs to contract on a risk basis by ensuring that the actual scope
of services covered under the contract would not change significantly during the year.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
 The intention of the Congress, at the time the Medicare law was enacted in 1965, was that Medicare would provide health
insurance to protect the elderly (and later, the disabled) from the substantial costs of acute health care services,
principally hospital care. The law was designed generally to cover services ordinarily furnished by hospitals,
skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), and physicians licensed to practice medicine. The Congress understood that
questions as to coverage of specific services would invariably arise and would require a specific decision by those
administering the program. Thus, it vested in the Secretary the authority to make those decisions (section 1862(a)(1)(A)
of the Act). Section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Act authorizes Medicare payment for items or services that are determined
to be reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury or to improve the functioning of
a malformed body member. While the Congress provided for the coverage of services such as inpatient hospital care
and physicians' services, coverage for these services is prohibited unless they are ``reasonable'' and ``necessary.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have interpreted section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Act to exclude from Medicare coverage those medical and health care
services that are not demonstrated to be safe and effective. Medicare contractors (that is, fiscal intermediaries,
carriers, and Utilization and Quality Control Peer Review Organizations (PROs)) are charged with the responsibility
of ensuring that payments are made only for services that are covered under Medicare Part A or Part B. Therefore, in
adjudicating a Medicare claim or conducting utilization and quality review, they must determine whether a service
that has been furnished to a Medicare beneficiary is included in the scope of Medicare benefits and, if it is, whether
it is ``reasonable'' and ``necessary'' for the particular medical condition of this particular patient.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``national coverage decision'' (NCD) refers to a coverage decision that we make and issue as national policy
under section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Act. We have issued over 200 NCDs on specific services. We publish NCDs in the Medicare
Coverage Issues Manual (HCFA-Pub. 6), and in other HCFA program manuals or as notices or HCFA Rulings in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 1871(a)(2) of the Act, NCDs are exempt from the general requirement that no rule, requirement, or other
statement of policy that establishes or changes a substantive legal standard governing the scope of benefits, the
payment for services, or the eligibility of individuals, entities, or organizations to furnish or receive benefits
under title XVIII will take effect unless it is promulgated by the Secretary through regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. HMOs and CMPs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HMOs and CMPs enter into contracts with HCFA to furnish Medicare covered services to Medicare beneficiaries who enroll
in them in accordance with section 1876 of the Act. The contracts provide for payment to the HMOs and CMPs on either a
risk or a reasonable cost basis. The provisions in this proposed rule apply only to HMOs and CMPs that contract on a risk
basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Risk HMOs and CMPs are paid a predetermined, per capita rate for each enrolled Medicare beneficiary. Under section
1876(a)(1)(A) of the Act, we annually determine and announce by September 7 for the following calendar year, a per
capita rate of payment for each class of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in a risk HMO or CMP. The per capita rate is
set at 95 percent of the adjusted average per capita cost (AAPCC). (The AAPCC is an actuarial estimate that we make in
advance of an HMO's or CMP's contract period and that represents an estimate of what the average per capita cost would
be to the Medicare program for each class of Medicare enrollees if the enrollees had received covered services in the
same geographic area or a similar area, from sources other than the HMO or CMP.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We define the classes on the basis of county of residence (State of residence, for end-stage renal disease beneficiaries),
age, sex, disability, institutional status, and welfare status. Within each class, we establish two rates, one for
beneficiaries entitled to Medicare Part A and Part B, and one for those entitled only to Medicare Part B.

C. Statutory Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 1876(c)(2)(A) of the Act, an HMO or CMP is required to furnish to Medicare enrollees the Medicare covered
services to which they are entitled, but only to the extent that those services are available to beneficiaries who
reside in the geographic area served by the HMO or CMP but are not enrolled in the organization. The only exceptions
to this general rule are: (1) That risk contracting HMOs and CMPs are not required to provide hospice care services,
or to assume financial responsibility for inpatient care furnished to an enrollee who, on the effective date of enrollment,
was an inpatient in a hospital paid under the prospective payment system; and (2) risk contractors are not required
to enroll Medicare beneficiaries who have end-stage renal disease (whether aged, disabled, or entitled to Medicare
solely because of having end-stage renal disease).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, before enactment of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA '90), under sections 1876(c)(2)(A),
1876(a)(6), 1876(a)(1)(D), and 1876(a)(3) of the Act, respectively_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Risk HMOs and CMPs were responsible for furnishing NCD services of significant cost even though that cost had
not been taken into account in determining the per capita rate that HCFA paid the HMO or CMP during that year;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Payment for services furnished to Medicare enrollees of a risk HMO or CMP could be made only to the HMO or CMP,
and only in the form of advance monthly per capita payments; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Those per capita payments were made instead of the amounts that would have been made on a fee-for-service basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Changes Made by OBRA '90
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4204(c)(1) of OBRA '90 added section 1876(c)(2)(B) of the Act, applicable to contract periods beginning
on or after January 1, 1991. Under section 1876(c)(2)(B), if HCFA projects that the cost of furnishing the NCD service
will be significant, and the cost of the service was not taken into account in calculating the most recently announced
per capita payment rates, then, unless otherwise required by law_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The risk HMO or CMP is not required to furnish the new or expanded benefit established by the NCD until the first
contract year that begins after the next payment rate announcement (that takes into account the cost of the NCD service);
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If the risk HMO or CMP does furnish the new or expanded benefit during the current contract period, the prohibition
of section 1876(a)(3) does not apply, and HCFA's intermediary or carrier would pay the risk HMO or CMP for the NCD service
(under the usual Medicare payment rules and methods) in addition to the monthly capitation payment. (Usual Medicare
payment methods require that payment for services furnished by a participating provider such as a hospital be made
only to the provider.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4204(c) of OBRA '90 also amended section 1876(a)(6) of the Act (the general prohibition against paying any
entity other than the risk HMO or CMP for services furnished to a Medicare enrollee) by providing an exception for NCD
services in section 1876(c)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act. Under that exception, if a Medicare enrollee chooses to obtain
an NCD service from a source other than the risk HMO or CMP, HCFA may make payment under the usual Medicare payment methods
and rules to the beneficiary, or to the qualified provider, physician, or supplier, as appropriate.

III. Provisions of the Proposed Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To implement the provisions of section 4204(c) of OBRA '90, we propose to make the following revisions to 42 CFR part
417 (``Health Maintenance Organizations, Competitive Medical Plans, and Health Care Prepayment Plans''). We also
plan to make various technical changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Definitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;417.401 we would add definitions of ``National coverage decision'' and ``significant cost.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
National coverage decision 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(NCD) means_a statement of national policy regarding the Medicare coverage status of a service that we make under
section 1862(a)(1) of the Act and publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
as a notice or HCFA Ruling, issue as a manual instruction, or announce by other formal notice. The term does not include
coverage changes mandated by statute.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Significant cost, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
as it relates to a particular NCD, means either of the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The average cost of furnishing a single service exceeds a cost threshold that_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) For calendar years 1991 and 1992, is $100,000; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) For 1993 and subsequent calendar years, is the preceding year's dollar threshold, adjusted to reflect the increase
or decrease in the United States per capita cost (USPCC) for the preceding year.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) The cost of all of the services furnished nationwide as a result of the particular NCD represents at least 0.1 percent
of the USPCC multiplied by the total number of Medicare beneficiaries nationwide for the applicable calendar year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(We would actuarially determine the significant cost of an NCD and include that information in the formal notice of
the decison). In section IV, below, we discuss our reasoning for proposing these thresholds for significant cost.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Range of Services Furnished by HMOs and CMPs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;417.414 Qualifying condition: Range of services, we would redesignate paragraph (b)(4), concerning selection
of practitioners, as paragraph (b)(3) of &sect;417.416 (which deals with furnishing of services and is thus a more
appropriate location than ``Range of services''), and add to &sect;417.414 a new paragraph (b)(4) to specify that
a risk HMO or CMP is not required to furnish an NCD service until the contract year beginning after the next per capita
rate announcement if all of the following conditions apply:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;HCFA has determined and announced that the NCD service meets the definition of ``significant cost.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The cost of that service was not included in the determination of the per capita rate of payment that HCFA pays
the HMO or CMP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The NCD that established coverage of the service was issued on or after the date of the announcement of the per
capita rate of payment for that contract year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Starting with the beginning of the next contract year, the HMO or CMP would be responsible for furnishing or paying
for the NCD service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We considered that these proposed revisions could have an adverse effect on the ability of the risk HMO or CMP to manage
the enrollee's health care, but believe the changes are required by the wording of the statute.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Deductible and Coinsurance Amounts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We would amend &sect;417.452, which deals with Medicare enrollees' liability for Medicare deductible and coinsurance
amounts_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;To clarify that the HMO or CMP may reduce these charges under the ``additional benefits'' provision in &sect;417.440(b)(4)(i);
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;To provide exemption from deductibles for ``significant cost'' NCD services that the risk HMO or CMP is not
required to furnish, regardless of whether the service is furnished by the HMO or CMP or obtained by the enrollee from
another source. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We considered also waiving coinsurance for these services because we believe that beneficiaries enroll in an HMO
or CMP, in part, to protect themselves from significant unanticipated costs. (In HMOs and CMPs, the actuarial equivalent
of deductible and coinsurance amounts is spread among all enrollees and enrollees know in advance what the charge
will be for particular services.) We believe that imposition of such costs for enrollees who need a significant cost
NCD service could discourage beneficiaries from enrolling or remaining enrolled in an HMO or CMP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We would prefer to encourage beneficiaries to enroll and remain enrolled in Medicare risk contracting HMOs and CMPs,
by relieving beneficiaries' liability for coinsurance amount. However, we believe the law requires that beneficiaries
be liable for coinsurance amounts because, unlike deductibles, these amounts are attributable to particular services
received. We are especially interested in comments on this issue, including other legal interpretations of beneficiary
liability for coinsurance amounts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Payment for NCD Services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We would remove current &sect;417.586 because it provides an option (electing to have Medicare intermediaries process
and pay hospital and nursing facility bills for services furnished to Medicare enrollees of a risk HMO or CMP) that
was repealed by section 4012(b) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA '87).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We would add a new &sect;417.586 (Special rules: Payment for significant cost national coverage decision (NCD) services).
Under this new section, for significant cost NCD services whose cost was not included in calculating the per capita
payment rate for a risk HMO or CMP, payment would be made under the usual Medicare payment rules and methods. Usual Medicare
payment methods require that payments for services furnished by a participating provider, for example, a hospital,
be made only to that provider. The carrier may make payment for Part B services of physicians and other suppliers such
as other practitioners and entities that are not providers, under usual carrier procedures, directly to any of the
following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The beneficiary who obtained the service from a qualified source other than the risk HMO or CMP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The qualified provider, physician, or supplier that furnished the service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The risk HMO or CMP that chose to furnish the service even though not required to do so.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We would specify, in &sect;417.586(c), that HCFA does not make an additional payment for a significant cost NCD service
furnished by the HMO or CMP (even though it is excepted during the current calendar year) if the HMO or CMP furnishes
the NCD service as an optional or required supplemental service under &sect;417.440(b)(2), or as an additional benefit
under &sect;417.592. The reason for the exclusion is that the costs of both of these types of services are already provided
for under the contract, and the statute specifies that the NCD ``shall not apply'' to the contract. Optional or required
supplemental services are paid for by the enrollees. The HMO or CMP may provide ``additional benefits'' as one way
to compensate the beneficiary if the per capita payments it receives from HCFA are higher than the HMO's or CMP's adjusted
community rate (ACR), which is what the HMO or CMP would charge its non-Medicare enrollees for a package of benefits
limited to Medicare-covered services. We note that, if the NCD services are already provided under the contract as
additional benefits or supplemental services, the beneficiary would not be required to pay any additional Medicare
coinsurance due to the NCD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Other Clarifying Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Throughout the affected sections, we would use the more precise term ``HMO'' or ``CMP'' in preference to the generic
term ``organization''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. In &sect;417.440, we would amend paragraph (a) to update a cross-reference, and paragraph (b)(1) to break down
a too-long sentence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For 1991 and 1992, we propose that the cost of an NCD service be considered ``significant'' if the average cost of furnishing
that service exceeds $100,000 or represents a change of at least 0.1 percent in the United States per capita cost (USPCC)
determined for the nation as a whole. The USPCC is defined in &sect;417.582 as the average per capita cost, including
intermediary or carrier administrative costs, incurred by Medicare, as determined on an accrual basis, for services
furnished to Medicare beneficiaries nationwide during the most recent period for which HCFA has complete data. AAPCCs
derived from the USPCC are the basis for Medicare payments to HMOs and CMPs. We also propose that beginning with calendar
year 1993 the preceding year's threshold be adjusted to reflect any increase or decrease in the USPCC. The purpose
of the annual adjustment is to keep pace with inflation. The average annual increase or decrease in the USPCC represents
the change in the average per capita cost of furnishing services to Medicare beneficiaries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We would actuarially determine the average cost of an individual NCD service and include it at the time the NCD is issued
in manuals, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, or announced by other formal notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The $100,000 threshold is proposed because it approximates the 1991 Medicare Part A cost of a liver transplant, a recent
and important national coverage decision that was included in the adjusted average per capita cost (AAPCC) for 1991.
The AAPCC is defined in &sect;417.401 as an actuarial estimate made by HCFA in advance of an organization's contract
period that represents what the average per capita cost to the Medicare program would be for each class (that is, Medicare
beneficiary designated by age, sex, disability, institutional, and welfare status) of the organization's Medicare
enrollees if they had received covered services other than through the organization in the same geographic area or
in a similar area. We are especially interested in receiving public comments concerning the thresholds we are proposing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A 0.1 percent annual change in the 1993 USPCC would represent an annual increase of approximately $4.30 or about $156
million in additional annual outlays for the Medicare program as a whole. We believe these figures represent the minimum
threshold of significant financial outlay for the average risk contracting HMO or CMP that has a mean enrollment of
nearly 15,800 Medicare beneficiaries and an average monthly payment from Medicare of approximately $339 per Medicare
beneficiary or $5.37 million. We also believe it would protect small organizations from unanticipated financial
outlays sufficiently to induce their continued participation in the Medicare program under section 1876 of the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The section that follows describes the NCDs announced in calendar years 1991 and 1992. During that period, HCFA announced
the addition of six new services and the removal of one service. By combining Medicare payment data for physician services
with facility costs data, we were able to estimate the relative costs associated with providing these services. The
coverage of liver transplantation for adults was estimated to cost over $100,000 per procedure, which meets the threshold
to be considered ``of significant cost'' under this proposed rule. Adult liver transplantation is covered for specific
conditions when performed in a facility approved by HCFA as meeting certain institutional coverage criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The remaining services were estimated to have average costs that are well below the $100,000 threshold. These services
are described below.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Patient selection criteria were changed to remove requirements that patients had to have inducible tachyrhythmia
before implantation or that this technology be used as a treatment of last resort. Although additional patients may
be covered, we believe that the savings in diagnostic costs offset additional costs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This autologous medical procedure is covered for specific conditions. Medicare coverage criteria have been updated
to include coverage for procedures performed in a hospital setting (inpatient or outpatient) or in a nonhospital
setting if the patient is under the care of a physician and a physician is also present to direct and supervise the nonphysician
services.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1991 this surgical procedure was removed from the list of Medicare covered procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The only ``significant cost'' NCD service among those listed above is the liver transplant for adults. That NCD was
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
as a final notice on April 12, 1991, at 56 FR 15006. The decision to cover liver transplants for adults was based on our
determination that liver transplants are medically reasonable and necessary services if furnished to adult patients
with certain conditions and if furnished by participating facilities that meet specific criteria including patient
selection criteria. Under certain circumstances, coverage of these liver transplants could be effective as early
as March 8, 1990, which was the publication date of the proposed notice in the

. However, Medicare payment for liver transplants for beneficiaries enrolled in risk HMOs and CMPs was not included
in the per capita rates of payment until January 1991. Consequently, risk HMOs and CMPs were forced to absorb any liver
transplant costs (approximately $100,000 per transplant) from March 8, 1990, through December 31, 1990.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Items and services necessary to diagnose a condition for which the recommended therapy is a noncovered service, and
most services furnished as followup care to the noncovered service, are not considered part of that service and are
not included in the payment for that service. Medicare already covers certain diagnostic services, which may lead
to a recommendation that a beneficiary receive therapy that is not covered. In addition, Medicare covers certain
medically necessary services that relate to follow-up care to a noncovered service. For example, for patients who
received liver transplants before March 8, 1990, outpatient diagnostic services preceding the transplant procedure
were covered, as was medically necessary follow-up care after discharge from the hospital for the noncovered transplant
procedure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hospitalization for the transplant procedure would not have been covered, nor would other services received
directly related to the noncovered procedure, such as the surgeon's fee for the transplant surgery itself. We consider
services that would not have been covered as part of the NCD occurrence. An occurrence includes the actual provision
of a discrete item or service that is the subject of an NCD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any item or service that is already covered, such as diagnostic services followed by a noncovered therapy, as discussed
above, would not be considered as part of the NCD service and thus would not be eligible for payment outside the HMO's
or CMP's monthly rate. An item or service that would not have been covered if furnished as part of a noncovered procedure,
such as the surgeon's fee for a noncovered liver transplant, would qualify for payment outside the HMO's or CMP's monthly
rate, even though it is not itself the subject of the NCD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1861(s)(2)(J) of the Act provides for coverage of prescription drugs used in immunosuppressive therapy
for 1 year following a transplant, only if the organ transplant procedure is a covered service. Therefore, if future
NCDs provide for coverage of transplantation of organs other than the presently covered kidney, liver, and heart,
and are announced after publication of AAPCC rates for the contract period, immunosuppressive therapy following
those organ transplants would also qualify for payment outside the HMO's or CMP's monthly rates.

VII. Regulatory Impact Statement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would affect those HMOs and CMPs (90 as of January 1993) that contract with HCFA to furnish health
care services to Medicare enrollees that are paid on a risk basis. Four demonstration projects are also subject to
the risk contract rules. As of January 1993, there were 21,908 Medicare enrollees in the four demonstration projects.
As a result of the OBRA '90 amendments discussed under section II of this preamble, for NCD services that the risk HMO
or CMP is not required to furnish (because the cost of furnishing the service is significant and was not taken into account
in determining the per capita rate that HCFA pays the HMO or CMP), additional payments may be made as explained in section
III.D. of the preamble.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is clear that these additional payments constitute additional program expenditures. However, estimation of
the amount is difficult because we cannot accurately predict_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;How many of the services added or expanded through NCDs in any year will be of ``significant cost''; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;How many of the Medicare enrollees of risk HMOs and CMPs (approximately 1.5 million as of January 1993) will
need a ``significant cost'' NCD service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We do know that only six NCD services were added by HCFA during 1991 and 1992, and that only one of those six services (liver
transplants for adults) would have met a ``significant cost'' criterion (average cost in excess of $100,000). We
do not anticipate a significant increase in the number of liver transplants performed on Medicare beneficiaries
because livers for transplantation purposes are not readily available. We believe this surgery will continue to
be performed relatively infrequently.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 12866, this proposed rule was reviewed by the Office of Management
and Budget.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA,
5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that a proposed rule would not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, all HMOs and CMPs that have entered into risk
contracts with HCFA are considered to be small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a proposed
rule would have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis
must conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small
rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted earlier in this preamble, we believe that, by ensuring that the cost of furnishing required Medicare services
would not increase substantially during a contract period, the new rules might encourage HMOs and CMPs to contract
on a risk basis. We anticipate an increase in the number of risk-contracting organizations, but recognize that this
proposed rule would not constitute a significant economic impact on a substantial number of HMOs and CMPs. These rules
would not affect the operations of small rural hospitals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are not preparing analyses under either the RFA or section 1102(b) of the Act because we have determined, and the
Secretary certifies, that this proposed rule would not result in a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities or a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule would remove the provision (never implemented) that would have made the adjusted average per capita
cost (AAPCC) the absolute limit on payment for services furnished to Medicare enrollees by an HMO or CMP with a cost
contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This change is necessary to conform our rules to the interpretation of the statute as set forth in court decisions relating
to payment of reasonable costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule would also provide for using the AAPCC as a presumptive limit, subject to exceptions, for HMOs and CMPs with
cost contracts, and for health care prepayment plans (HCPPs) that furnish inpatient hospital care as well as part
B services; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eliminate the effective incentives exception that is currently available to HCPPs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Require HCPPs that do not furnish inpatient hospital services to document that their costs do not exceed what Medicare's
cost would have been if the Medicare beneficiaries who received the services had not enrolled in the HCPP; and revise
the rules for reporting costs.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Medicare program (title XVIII of the Social Security Act (the Act)), HCFA helps pay for health services furnished
to eligible beneficiaries. Under ``part A'' (Hospital Insurance), HCFA pays hospitals and other providers of services
for inpatient hospital services, and some skilled nursing facility services, home health care, and hospice care.
Under ``part B'' (Supplementary Medical Insurance), HCFA helps pay for physicians' services, as well as hospital
outpatient and certain other medical services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, HCFA pays for Medicare part A and part B services under a fee-for-service system that includes a variety
of payment methods such as_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Fee schedules for physician and laboratory services and durable medical equipment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Diagnosis-related groups for most hospital services under the prospective payment system (PPS); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Reasonable costs for skilled nursing care, home health services and the services of certain hospitals not
subject to the PPS; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Reasonable charges for some supplier services.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For part A services, HCFA usually pays the provider and, for part B services, the supplier who has accepted assignment
or, if assignment has not been made, the beneficiary. Payment is on the basis of claims submitted by the provider, supplier,
or beneficiary after the service has been furnished. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title XVIII of the Act also permits beneficiaries to enroll in, and receive their Medicare benefits through, prepaid
health care organizations. These include health maintenance organizations (HMOs), and competitive medical plans
(CMPs), with contracts under section 1876 of the Act, and health care prepayment plans (HCPPs) with agreements under
section 1833 of the Act. HMOs and CMPs are required to furnish the full range of Medicare benefits, and do not bill on
a fee-for-service basis for covered services furnished to their Medicare enrollees. Rather, HCFA pays the organization
in advance a monthly amount for each enrolled beneficiary. If the HMO or CMP contracts to be paid on a reasonable cost
basis, there is a cost reconciliation at the end of the year. HCFA also pays HCPPs on a reasonable cost basis, following
procedures similar to those used for HMOs and CMPs, but only for part B services. If an HCPP arranges for part A services
for its enrollees, the Medicare intermediary pays the provider for these services on a fee-for-service basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As of March 1993, about 2.4 million of the 33 million Medicare beneficiaries had chosen to enroll in an HMO, CMP, or HCPP.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule would impose presumptive limits on reasonable costs_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;For HMOs and CMPs that choose to contract with HCFA on a reasonable cost basis; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;For HCPPs that furnish (to Medicare enrollees) services in general acute-care hospitals.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These presumptive limits replace absolute limits that were promulgated in 1985 but were never put into effect for
reasons given in HCFA Ruling No. 89&hyph;2, and explained below under section II.B.2. This rule would establish bases
for exceptions to the presumptive limit and would also establish limits on reasonable costs for HCPPs that do not furnish
inpatient hospital services.

1. HMOs and CMPs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 1876 of the Act we are authorized to contract with HMOs and CMPs to pay them either on a risk basis or on a
cost basis for services they furnish to Medicare enrollees. HMOs and CMPs must provide all part A and part B services
to Medicare enrollees entitled to both part A and part B, but HCPPs may limit the services they provide. Risk HMOs and
CMPs receive monthly capitation payments equivalent to 95 percent of the adjusted average per capita cost (AAPCC).

The AAPCC is an estimate of the average per capita cost, under the fee-for-service system, for Medicare-covered services
furnished to Medicare beneficiaries who are not enrolled in HMOs, CMPs, or HCPPs. HCFA's Office of the Actuary prepares
an AAPCC for both aged and disabled beneficiaries for each county in the United States and adjusts the AAPCC rates demographically
by age, sex, Medicaid status, and institutional status. For example, a 65&hyph;69 year old female, who is not eligible
for Medicaid and not in an institution, might have a monthly AAPCC rate of $300 in a given county. An 80&hyph;84 year
old female, institutionalized in the same county, might have an AAPCC rate of $680. These rate differences reflect
the lower average Medicare costs for the younger, non-institutionalized beneficiary. There are 30 demographic
groups for the aged Medicare population and 30 for the disabled Medicare population. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cost HMOs and CMPs receive monthly interim payments based on the annual operating budget they submit before the beginning
of their contract year. At the end of the contract year, they must submit a cost report to document their actual costs,
as a basis for a final settlement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As of March 1993, there were 93 risk HMOs and CMPs with 1,603,178 Medicare enrollees and 22 cost HMOs and CMPs with 140,415
enrollees.

2. HCPPs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HCPPs are prepaid health care organizations that have agreements with HCFA to be paid in accordance with section 1833(a)(1)(A)
of the Act. Under such an agreement, HCFA pays the HCPP only for part B services. Payment is based on ``reasonable costs''
and those costs are generally determined following the methods used for cost HMOs and CMPs, as described under section
II.A.1. of this preamble. Some HCPPs provide the full range of part B services, while others offer a much more limited
scope. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCPPs are not required to provide part A services and cannot be paid for those services under the HCPP agreement. Some
HCPPs are organized to furnish comprehensive health care services to their Medicare enrollees and to their commercial
enrollees. Those HCPPs, which could elect to contract as HMOs or CMPs, furnish or arrange for all or most part A services.
The providers of those part A services submit their claims to, and are paid by, Medicare intermediaries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In March 1993, there were 57 HCPPs with 640,633 Medicare enrollees.

B. History of Cost Limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Statutory basis for setting cost limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1861(v)(1)(A) of the Act authorizes us to establish limits on reasonable costs for entities that are paid
on a reasonable cost basis. The limits must be based on estimates of the costs necessary in the efficient delivery of
health care services. Our basic goal in establishing limits on costs for HMOs, CMPs, and HCPPs is to ensure that the
Medicare program pays no more for care furnished to beneficiaries enrolled in these organizations than it would pay
for services for beneficiaries not enrolled in an HMO, CMP, or HCPP. We consider that to pay more than we would have paid
under the fee-for-service system would be inefficient and, thus, an inappropriate use of Medicare funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Provisions of the Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before 1986, the regulations provided that, for HMOs and CMPs paying physicians on a salaried basis, costs were reasonable
if they did not exceed the costs for comparable services in the HMO's or CMP's geographic area. Those costs, however,
were not subject to the reasonable charge levels of the Medicare fee-for-service payment system, and HMOs and CMPs
were not required to document the comparability of their costs to the costs allowed under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Costs incurred for payment to groups of physicians (organized either on a group practice or an individual practice
basis) and for payment for other part B services could not exceed the Medicare reasonable charge levels. However,
with respect to physicians' services, most HMOs and CMPs were exempted from this limit, under the ``effective incentives''
policy. Under this policy, the exemption was available if the members of the group of physicians accepted effective
incentives, such as risk-sharing, designed to discourage unnecessary or unduly costly utilization of health services.
In connection with these rules, the AAPCC was used as a guideline, but not as a limit, in assessing the reasonableness
of the total costs incurred by HMOs and CMPs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rules for HCPPs were similar and are still in effect. For HCPPs that pay physicians on a basis other than fee-for-service,
such as capitation, costs are not measured against the reasonable charge or other fee-for-service rate. Rather,
costs are measured against what a ``prudent buyer'' would pay for comparable services in the geographic area. Payments
based on fee-for-service are generally subject to Medicare reasonable charge levels. However, if the payments are
to a medical group whose members accept ``effective incentives'' to control utilization, the payments are subject
to the ``prudent buyer'' standard rather than reasonable charge levels.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 10, 1985, at 50 FR 1314, we published a final rule that established a new part 417 containing the rules applicable
to prepaid health care. Section 417.532 provided that, beginning in 1986, 100 percent of the weighted average of the
AAPCCs of each class of a cost HMO's or CMP's Medicare enrollees would be applied as an absolute limit on the total amount
payable to that HMO or CMP. There would be no exceptions and no possibility of payments in excess of that limit. The provisions
relating to effective incentives were removed from the rules for HMOs and CMPs as no longer necessary, but retained
for HCPPs, to which the new absolute limit would not apply. Although the new absolute limit never went into effect,
the effective incentives policy was not restored for HMOs and CMPs, and the inoperative rule (&sect;417.532(a)(3))
was not removed from the CFR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In October 1989, HCFA issued HCFA Ruling (HCFAR) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No. 89&hyph;2, which stated that: ``Since the time that &sect;417.532 of the regulations was promulgated, the courts
have construed the authority to set cost limits under section 1861(v)(1)(A) [of the Act] to support generalized cost
limits applied on a presumptive basis, but not absolute cost limits applied on a final or conclusive basis *&blank;*&blank;*.''
The courts have interpreted section 1861(v)(1)(A) of the Act as requiring that a Medicare provider be afforded an
opportunity under the regulations to show that in its particular case, costs in excess of the applicable cost limits
were reasonable and therefore reimbursable. Thus, the court decisions support application of presumptive limits,
that is, limits with an exception process that affords the cost-contracting entity the opportunity to qualify for
additional payments if it can show that its excess costs are justified as ``reasonable.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of the policies discussed above, we have not accumulated data that would show whether the furnishing of
health care services by cost HMOs and CMPs, and HCPPs is cost-effective as compared to the furnishing of those services
under the Medicare fee-for-service system.

III. Provisions of the Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Provisions Applicable to HMOs and CMPs, and to HCPPs That Furnish Inpatient Hospital Services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since HCPP agreements pertain only to part B services, HCFA makes payment directly to the providers for part A services
furnished to HCPP enrollees. However, some HCPPs ``furnish inpatient services'' in the sense that they make the arrangements
for enrollees to receive those services, and pay applicable Medicare coinsurance and deductibles in return for a
premium from the enrollee. Like HMOs, HCPPs that furnish both part A and part B services would generally have an incentive
to use more cost-effective part B services when possible, rather than more expensive part A services.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, if we imposed a cost limit only on the services we reimburse through the HCPP agreement (that is, part B services),
it would create an incentive for the HCPP to shift costs by authorizing more expensive part A services (which will be
reimbursed directly to the provider), rather than part B services that would be subject to the limit. Accordingly,
to avoid potentially inappropriate increases in part A utilization, we propose to apply the aggregate part A and part
B presumptive limit to all costs incurred for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in HCPPs that furnish inpatient hospital
services. If the aggregate costs exceed the limit, the HCPP would be considered to have an overclaim for its part B services.
(The limit would apply to HCPPs that furnish inpatient care in hospitals commonly referred to as ``general acute-care''
or ``short-stay'' hospitals, as distinguished from psychiatric or rehabilitation hospitals or other chronic or
long-term hospitals.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Presumptive Limit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The presumptive limit on costs would be 100 percent of the weighted average of the AAPCCs of each class of Medicare enrollees.
Since the AAPCC is based on the costs of all Medicare services received by beneficiaries, as a presumptive limit it
must be applied to the total cost of all Medicare-covered services received by the Medicare enrollees, including
all part A and part B services, whether furnished by the prepaid health care organization or obtained from other sources.
In other words, all costs attributable to Medicare enrollees, whether paid by the organization or paid by Medicare's
intermediaries and carriers, would be totaled and compared to the presumptive limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We note that we plan to consider adjustment to, or a replacement for, the AAPCC as the basis for payment to risk HMOs and
CMPs. If we make any such changes, we might also need to modify using the AAPCC as the basis for the presumptive limit.
This would involve additional rulemaking activity.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Exception Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If costs exceed the presumptive limit, there would be an exceptions process that would permit payments in excess of
the limit, for either of the following reasons: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Special needs. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Medicare enrollees have special needs that require a volume and intensity of services that exceeds the average
for Medicare beneficiaries of the same age and sex living in the same service area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;For exceptions based on special needs, we are proposing the methodology discussed under section IV of this
preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If, after application of that methodology, the organization wished further review, it could present additional
documentation for HCFA's consideration. The organization could seek such further review if HCFA found that the organization
did not meet HCFA's standards for special needs or the HMO or CMP believed that not enough money was being allowed for
its special needs enrollees.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Extraordinary circumstances. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There were extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the organization. The circumstances include, but
are not limited to, strikes, fire, earthquake, flood or similar unusual occurrences with substantial cost effects.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For exceptions based on extraordinary circumstances, the HMO or CMP would be required to submit to HCFA information
documenting the particular extraordinary circumstances that it believes constitute justification for additional
payments and the amount of additional payments justified by the extraordinary circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Decision Not to Restore the Effective Incentives Exception 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We would not restore the effective incentives exception that was deleted from the regulations when we promulgated
the absolute limitation on payment to cost HMOs and CMPs in 1985. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existence of ``effective incentives'' was used by HCFA as a proxy for efficiency. We are now using the presumptive
limit as a proxy for efficiency, and we believe this is a more appropriate standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Exemption Based on Number of Medicare Enrollees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed rule, HCFA could exempt organizations with fewer than 500 Medicare enrollees from the cost limits
for up to 2 consecutive years. HCFA could specify additional criteria that these organizations must meet in order
to qualify for this exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Effect of Having a Final Overclaim for 2 Consecutive Years 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HCFA could terminate contracts with organizations that have a final overclaim for at least 2 consecutive years. Final
overclaim means that, after application of the exception process, the organization still has excess claims that
it cannot justify as ``reasonable.'' The rationale for termination is that organizations with final overclaims
are inefficient as compared to the fee-for-service system, and it is not prudent for HCFA to continue to contract with
inefficient organizations.

B. Provisions Applicable to HCPPs That do not Furnish Inpatient Hospital Services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Criteria for Reasonableness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The costs incurred by the HCPP for physicians' services and other part B supplier services would be considered reasonable
if they did not exceed, in the aggregate, the amount that HCFA would pay, in the aggregate, for those services if they
were furnished to beneficiaries not enrolled in the HCPP or any other prepaid health care plan. HCPP costs would be
compared to costs under the usual fee-for-service payment methods, based on fee schedules, reasonable charge limits,
or reasonable cost limits, whichever is appropriate for the particular services. The aggregate amount would include
an amount equivalent to the costs of claims processing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Documentation of Services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Participating HCPPs would be required to include in their cost reports documentation of each service furnished
to their Medicare enrollees, using the Medicare billing codes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Organizations seeking an agreement for participation as an HCPP would be required to demonstrate that they
have in place a system that enables them to comply with the documentation requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Failure to comply with the documentation requirement would be a basis for termination or nonrenewal of the
agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We would amend &sect;417.800(b), to include the documentation requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Removal of ``Effective Incentives'' Provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We would remove the effective incentives provisions that appear in &sect;417.802(2)(ii)(B) and (b)(3)(ii) of the
current HCFA rules. We believe that all HCPPs should be subject to the requirement that payment for services furnished
to their Medicare enrollees not exceed the estimate of what HCFA would have paid for those services under the fee-for-service
system. We believe that a more effective way to ensure that outcome is to use the presumptive limit for HCPPs that furnish
inpatient hospital services, and to use reasonable charges to define reasonable costs for other HCPPs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Methodology for Calculating Payments in Excess of the Presumptive Limit (Additional Payments) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Note: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
We believe that HMOs, CMPs, and HCPPs will be particularly interested in this methodology, and we are receptive to
suggestions for alternative methodologies. Any proposed alternatives must specifically address how that methodology
would ensure that HCFA pays no more for care to beneficiaries enrolled in these organizations than it would pay for
their care if the beneficiaries were not so enrolled.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The methodology discussed below applies only to HMOs and CMPs, and to HCPPs that furnish inpatient hospital services.
It pertains only to determining whether we can make additional payments based on special needs of Medicare enrollees.
We use the term ``sicker than average enrollment'' to mean enrollees who require a volume and intensity of services
that exceeds the average for Medicare beneficiaries of the same age and sex, living in the same geographic area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1861(v)(1)(A) of the Act authorizes us to establish limits on costs for entities paid on a reasonable cost
basis so that the Medicare payment does not exceed the ``estimates of the costs necessary in the efficient delivery
of needed health services''. Section 1861(v)(1)(A) also gives us flexibility for setting those limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. The Courts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The courts have indicated that absolute limits on costs are not acceptable, but, to date, appear to approve of presumptive
limits. A presumptive limit means that the organization may obtain additional payments, that is, payments above
that limit, if it can document that such payments are justified, using reasonable criteria to estimate payable amounts
in excess of the limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are proposing to establish 100 percent of the weighted average of the AAPCC as the presumptive limit for HMOs and
CMPs, and for HCPPs that furnish inpatient hospital services. We consider the presumptive limit to be a proxy for whether
or not the HMO, CMP, or HCPP is delivering needed health services efficiently. In other words, we consider an organization
with total costs below the presumptive limit to be operating more efficiently than Medicare operates under the fee-for-service
system. Conversely, we consider organization with costs above the presumptive limit to be operating less efficiently.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Methodology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The methodology discussed below is based on the fact that, generally in health care financing, a small number of high-cost
cases, called ``outliers,'' account for a large percentage of outlays. For example, in 1989, in the Medicare program,
about 90 percent of persons served accounted for only 37 percent of the outlays, while the remaining 10 percent of persons
served required 63 percent of the outlays.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to estimate what percentage, if any, of an organization's costs is attributable to inefficiency, we would
compare the average annual per capita cost for the organization's non-outliers with the average annual per capita
cost for non-outliers under the fee-for-service system. If the organization's average for non-outliers were less
than the fee-for-service average, we would consider the organization to be operating more efficiently than Medicare
operates under the fee-for-service system. We would make the assumption that, since the organization operates efficiently
for its non-outliers (who constitute the majority of its enrollment) its costs in excess of the presumptive limit
are attributable to a sicker than average enrollment. We would pay any excess costs that are otherwise allowable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, if the organization's average for non-outliers exceeded the fee-for-service average, we would consider
it to be operating less efficiently than Medicare operates under the fee-for-service system. If, for example, the
organization's average exceeded the fee-for-service average by 3 percent, we would consider that the organization's
services cost 3 percent more than Medicare would have paid for those services under the fee-for-service system. We
would assess a presumptive overpayment of 3 percent on the organization's total costs for services to Medicare enrollees,
that is, costs for both outliers and non-outliers.

&bull;If the costs were equal to, or less than, the presumptive limit, HCFA would pay the total allowable costs for
the organization's Medicare enrollees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Since there is a presumptive overpayment, the process would continue to Stage 2. (HCFA would give the organization
written notice and opportunity to respond in accordance with &sect;417.532(a)(6) of the proposed rules.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To carry out Stage 2, we need the annual outlier cost threshold, which HCFA establishes on a national or regional basis,
to distinguish ``outlier costs'' from ``non-outlier costs.'' For example, if the threshold is $39,000, the costs
for all beneficiaries whose costs exceed $39,000 would be outlier costs, and the costs for all beneficiaries whose
annual costs are equal to, or less than, $39,000 would be considered ``non-outlier costs.'' HCFA's determination
of the outlier threshold is discussed under section VI of this preamble. The organization would determine its costs
for outliers using HCFA's payment methods such as fee schedules, reasonable charge limits, and reasonable cost limits,
as appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stage 2. Determine whether the average annual per capita non-outlier cost for the organization's Medicare enrollees
exceeds the average non-outlier costs for the fee-for-service beneficiaries in the organization's service area.

a. If the average for the organization's enrollees is equal to, or less than, the average for the fee-for-service beneficiaries,
there is no final overpayment. As noted above, the presumption is that the organization is also efficient in furnishing
services to outlier enrollees.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this example of a presumptive overpayment of $770,000, the final overclaim or disallowance is $88,500. The organization
would receive $681,500 ($770,000 minus $88,500) in additional payments because of the exceptions process. In other
words, HCFA would estimate that $681,500 of the presumptive overpayment is attributable to a sicker than average
enrollment and $88,500 is attributable to inefficiency. HCFA would pay the amount attributable to a sicker than average
enrollment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Our primary goal in setting limits for coordinated care organizations is to ensure that we do not pay more for Medicare
beneficiaries enrolled in these organizations than we would pay if the beneficiaries were not so enrolled. The AAPCC
is an estimate of the average per capita cost for Medicare beneficiaries who receive their Medicare-covered services
in the fee-for-service sector, that is, Medicare beneficiaries who are not enrolled in HMOs, CMPs, or HCPPs. Because
it is a per capita estimate based on 100% of the costs for these beneficiaries in a geographic area, we consider it to
be an excellent basis for estimating the aggregate amount that HCFA would have paid for HMO, CMP, and HCPP enrollees
if they had not been so enrolled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In HCFA Ruling 89&hyph;2, we indicated that the courts ``have construed the authority to set cost limits under section
1861(v)(1)(A) [of the Act] to support generalized cost limits applied on a presumptive basis.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We considered two options. First, we considered using 100 percent of the AAPCC as a guideline, as we had done before
promulgation of the 1985 regulation establishing the AAPCC as an absolute limit. Second, we considered using 100%
of the AAPCC as a presumptive limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Application of a guideline simply triggers a closer scrutiny of the claimed costs. Use of a presumptive limit with
an exceptions process provides a clearer standard for determining the amount of payment. We expect that a presumptive
limit will provide incentives for more efficient operation, because overpayments will be determined unless the
organization can document that additional payments are appropriate either (1) because of a sicker than average enrollment
or (2) because of extraordinary circumstances. For this reason, we believe the use of a presumptive limit better serves
the intent, articulated in section 1861(v)(1)(A) of the Act, of using Medicare monies only to pay for the efficient
delivery of needed health services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Options Considered for Methodology for Calculating Exceptions for a Sicker Than Average Enrollment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We considered four options for a methodology to use in estimating what portion, if any, of an organization's presumptive
overpayment was attributable to inefficiency. Two of the options addressed only part B costs, and administrative
costs. The other two approaches addressed the full range of costs for Medicare enrollees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, we considered setting absolute limits for the organization's administrative and part B costs based on fee-for-service
payments. The final overpayment or disallowance would have been the amount by which (1) the organization's aggregate
payments for part B services exceeded Medicare's aggregate payments for the same services and (2) the organization's
relative administrative costs exceeded Medicare's relative administrative costs. This approach did not address
our concerns about the inappropriate utilization of part A services and would not have recognized the efficiencies
that can be achieved by using outpatient services rather than inpatient services, as most prepaid health care organizations
do. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, we considered calculating averages of volume and price for part B services, comparing the organization's
average price and volume with the Medicare fee-for-service average. The final overpayment or disallowance would
have been based on whether the organization exceeded Medicare averages for price, or volume, or both. The disallowance
for overpayments on the price side would have been the amount by which the organization's average price exceeded Medicare's
fee-for-service average. The disallowance for overpayments on the volume side would have been in the form of reductions
to allowable administrative costs, using the rationale that we should not pay 100% of administrative costs to an organization
that is not managing care, as evidenced by its higher volume. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both of these options would have required organizations to document all services on an individual basis. However,
they focused only on part B and administrative costs. They did not take into consideration the entire range of services.
We believe that HMOs and CMPs and HCPPs that furnish inpatient hospital services should be held accountable for all
of the Medicare-covered services received by their Medicare enrollees, whether furnished by the plan or obtained
from other sources. For this reason, we considered the two following options, both of which use an outlier-based approach.
The first option looked only at the organization's outlier costs in relation to outlier costs in the comparable fee-for-service
area. We realized that we could not limit our review to outlier costs because outliers are, by definition, not representative
of the relevant costs by which HCFA may judge whether a prepaid health care organization is efficient or inefficient
in comparison with the fee-for-service sector overall. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second option was the one described in this preamble. We concluded it was the best approach for three reasons.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;When compared to the other outlier approach, it was more in consonance with the statutory directive to make
estimates of the costs for the efficient provision of needed health services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A calculation based on outliers imposes manageable administrative requirements on the organization because
outliers comprise a small percentage of enrollees and because most coordinated care organizations must track costs
for outliers in order to receive payments from their reinsurers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Unlike the first two options, this approach examines all of the Medicare services and costs and thus holds the
organization accountable for all the Medicare-covered services received by its enrollees.

C. Options Considered for HCPPs That do not Furnish Inpatient Hospital Services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Our primary goal in setting limits for prepaid health care organizations is to ensure that we do not pay more for Medicare
beneficiaries enrolled in these organizations than we would pay if the beneficiaries were not so enrolled. We consider
Medicare fee-for-service payment amounts for individual services to be the most appropriate proxy for the amount
that Medicare would have paid for a group of HCPP enrollees if those beneficiaries were not so enrolled. As discussed
above, we also consider the AAPCC, which is derived from Medicare fee-for-service payment amounts, to be an appropriate
estimate of total Medicare fee-for-service costs for a group of Medicare beneficiaries. In addressing changes to
the regulations governing allowable payments to these HCPPs, we considered three options. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, we considered making only technical changes to the current regulations by updating them to reflect the movement
in fee-for-service Medicare away from reasonable charge-based payment to fee schedules for physician and lab services
and durable medical equipment. Under this option, we would have retained the effective incentives provisions. This
approach was not consistent with our primary goal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, we considered using the part B AAPCC plus an appropriate amount for administrative costs. We discarded this
option because it might constitute an incentive for these HCPPs to allow or encourage their Medicare enrollees to
seek part A services for medical conditions for which part B services would be equally or even more appropriate, but
might bring the HCPPs' incurred costs above the part B AAPCC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, we considered using aggregate Medicare payment levels for individual part B services to define ``reasonable
cost'' for these HCPPs. We selected this approach because we believe it is consistent with our primary goal. We also
considered whether it would be feasible to specify an appropriate volume of services. We concluded that, at this time,
we do not have sufficient data to determine appropriate volume for part B services for HCPP enrollees, so a volume formula
is not included in this proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Outlier Threshold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In setting the amount of the outlier threshold, we are concerned that it include an adequate number of high cost beneficiaries,
without including such a substantial proportion of costs that its utility as a measure of efficient behavior is limited.
Because in general in health care financing a small number of individuals account for a large percentage of outlays,
finding an appropriate balance between the percentage of total costs represented by the outlier threshold and the
percentage of beneficiaries represented is difficult. There is a range of reasonable choices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Using 1989 data summarized in the table below, we examined the relationship between the cumulative percentage of
persons served and the cumulative percentage of program payments to determine a reasonable outlier threshold. At
the low end for a potential outlier threshold, we believe a figure that accounts for about 2 percent of beneficiaries
and about 25 percent of outlays is reasonable. At the high end, we believe a figure that accounts for about 0.3 percent
of beneficiaries and about 7 percent of total outlays is reasonable. The approximate mid-point between these two
ends is the 1 percent of beneficiaries who account for about 16 percent of total payments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are proposing to set the outlier threshold at the lowest annual per capita amount that we project to account for the
1 percent of Medicare beneficiaries with the highest annual per capita outlays. In 1989, that amount was about $39,000.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For 1993, the annual per capita amount that we project to account for the 1 percent of Medicare beneficiaries with the
highest annual per capita outlays is $55,000. Outlays on behalf of this group of Medicare beneficiaries would account
for about 16 percent of total outlays.

Using a set percentage of beneficiaries, for example, 1 percent as we are proposing here, instead of a set dollar figure
eliminates the need to determine an inflation factor. The amount of the outlier threshold would increase by the change
in the annual per capita amount that we project to account for the 1 percent of Medicare beneficiaries with the highest
annual per capita outlays.

1. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Most HMOs and CMPs paid on a cost basis have elected under section 1876(h)(2) of the Act (as implemented by &sect;417.532(c)
of the regulations) to allow HCFA to process all bills for hospital and skilled nursing facility services furnished
to their Medicare enrollees. Under this election, HCFA simply performs a service (bill processing and payment) for
the HMO or CMP. The HMO or CMP authorizes the services and retains responsibility for coordination of those services
with other services it furnishes to its Medicare enrollees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 417.576(b)(2)(i) implements the requirement of section 1876(h)(4)(A) of the Act that the HMO or CMP report
its ``per capita incurred cost''. However, cost HMOs and CMPs have not been reporting the part A costs paid by the Medicare
intermediaries. For those services, they currently report only the deductibles and coinsurance. When the regulations
that would have imposed an absolute limit were developed, the cost report was revised to include the part A costs paid
by Medicare intermediaries. However, because the absolute limit policy was never implemented, the revised cost
report instructions were not implemented either.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We propose to amend &sect;417.576 to make clear that the incurred per capita costs in the cost report must include the
costs of hospital and skilled nursing facility services paid by Medicare intermediaries at the election of the HMO
or CMP.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. In &sect;417.800, we would revise paragraph (c)(2)(ii) to conform to the statutory provision and long-standing

Section 417.532(b) (with respect to HMOs and CMPs) and &sect;417.800(c) (with respect to HCPPs) require those organizations
to submit the information necessary for HCFA to determine whether payment in excess of the presumptive limit is appropriate,
because of the health condition of the organization's Medicare enrollees, or because of extraordinary occurrences.
The time needed to prepare the information would depend on the particular circumstances but would not, we believe,
exceed 8 hours per organization. Section 417.576 requires HMOs and CMPs to submit certified cost reports as a basis
for final settlement. We estimate that preparation of the full cost report will require 100 hours.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
This rule would also require HMOs and CMPs to include in their cost reports the costs of inpatient hospital services
and SNF care furnished to their Medicare enrollees, for which payment is made by Medicare intermediaries directly
to the providers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)
(5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that a rule would not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, all HMOs, CMPs, and HCPPs are considered to be small
entities. Individuals are not considered small entities under the RFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since this proposed rule represents a significant change in the application of cost limits for cost of HMOs, CMPs,
and HCPPs, and would also require HMOs and CMPs to make minor changes in the reporting of their per capita costs, we are
providing the following voluntary regulatory flexibility analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
1. Effect of the Presumptive Limit on Cost HMOs and CMPs and on HCPPs That Provide Inpatient Hospital Services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
We believe that the costs of services furnished by these prepaid health care organizations should not exceed the costs
for services furnished to an actuarially similar group of Medicare beneficiaries whose services are paid for under
the Medicare fee-for-service payment systems. Excess cost can often be avoided by reducing unnecessary utilization
and by electing effective but less expensive treatment modalities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 55 plans (22 HMOs and CMPs, and an estimated 33 HCPPs) that would be subject to the proposed
presumptive limit. Program data from 1989, the most recent year for which we have audited cost report data, indicate
that, in 1989, 38 percent of these organizations would have exceeded a presumptive limit of 100 percent of the AAPCC,
half of them by 0 to 10 percent. These organizations had, at that time, little incentive to monitor costs. This proposed
rule makes two changes that should encourage them to pay more attention to costs incurred on behalf of Medicare enrollees:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
&bull;The imposition of the presumptive limit on all these organizations; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The elimination of the effective incentives policy that had remained in effect for HCPPs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
We believe that many of these organizations would respond promptly to these incentives and reduce expenditures.
Consequently, we anticipate that, in the first year of implementation of these proposed rules, only 25 percent of
the HMOs, CMPs, and HCPPs would exceed the presumptive limit, that is, for only 25 percent would all the costs incurred
on behalf of their Medicare enrollees exceed 100 percent of the AAPCC. In subsequent years, we expect that this percentage
would decline, as more of these organizations modify their practices in response to the incentives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are two basic methods for reducing costs. First, the organizations can implement utilization controls, particularly
for inpatient hospital care. Currently these organizations are not reporting inpatient hospital and SNF costs and
hence have no reason to opt for lower-cost alternatives. However, the proposed full reporting requirement would
change this. HMOs and CMPs would be required to report all services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries. (See section
B.3. of this voluntary regulatory flexibility analysis.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the organizations can review claims more aggressively to identify and remove duplicate claims that result
in payment both from the organizations and the Medicare carrier to a physician or other supplier for the same service.
Although organizations are currently required to identify duplicate claims, they have no incentive to do a thorough
job. Although we do not have data on what percentage of total costs is represented by duplicate payments, we believe
that the elimination of those payments could, in many cases, bring costs below the presumptive limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed presumptive limit rules would provide exceptions of two kinds. In the first place, HCFA could exempt
small organizations (those with fewer than 500 Medicare enrollees) from the presumptive cost limit for up to two consecutive
years. The rationale is that a small enrollment is less likely (than a large enrollment) to be representative of the
general Medicare population in the area served by the organization. The small enrollment could be more healthy or
less healthy, and if less healthy, could lead to costs in excess of the limit.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In the second place, organizations that exceed the presumptive limit have the opportunity to document that their
Medicare enrollees have health care needs that exceed those of the average mix of Medicare beneficiaries who reside
in their service areas but, since they are not enrollees, have their services paid for under the Medicare fee-for-service
payment systems. An HMO, CMP, or HCPP that exceeded the presumptive limit would have the option of providing to HCFA
data to document that its costs in excess of the limit are justified because of the greater health care needs of its Medicare
enrollees. The full reporting requirement would assist HMOs and CMPs in this endeavor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The organizations could also document unusual circumstances beyond their control (such as fire, flood, earthquake,
strike) that had significant impact on their costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon documentation and verification by HCFA, the organization would receive payment for costs in excess of the limit
if it could show that the excess costs were ``reasonable.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some organizations may feel disadvantaged because they are located in areas where there is a relatively low AAPCC.
However, in all geographic areas, the basis for the AAPCC is precise data on Medicare costs for Medicare beneficiaries
who are not enrolled in HMOs, CMPs, or HCPPs. In areas where the AAPCC is relatively low because the delivery of services
under the fee-for-services systems is very efficient, prepaid health care organizations are still expected to be
at least as efficient as the fee-for-service payment system. Only if the group of Medicare enrollees is less healthy
than the Medicare average in the area could costs in excess of the presumptive limit be justified. In other words, a
managed care system, as represented by prepaid health care organizations, is expected to be at least as efficient
as the fee-for-service system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule could have a positive effect on the revenues of organizations that meet the criteria for payments
in excess of the presumptive limit; organizations that do not meet those criteria may face reduced revenues. We estimate
that the loss of revenue for HMOs, CMPs, and HCPPs that exceed the presumptive limit would be approximately 5 percent
on the average. However, we believe that many of these organizations will change their practices in ways that will
reduce their costs to correspond to the reduction in revenues. This would achieve the purpose of the proposed rule,
which is to protect the Medicare program against excessive payments by giving the affected organizations an incentive
to hold their costs to reasonable levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCPPs that furnish hospital services are subject to the presumptive limit, which applies to all services, part B as
well as part A. For these HCPPs, therefore, the removal of the ``effective incentives'' exception (under which these
HCPPs were exempt from reasonable charge limits for physicians' services) does not have any additional impact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
2. Effect of Cost-Reporting Changes on HMOs, CMPs, and HCPPs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The change in reporting per capita costs (referred to as full reporting) would affect all 26 cost HMOs and CMPs. HCPPs
that furnish inpatient hospital care would also have to monitor part A costs. As explained earlier in this regulatory
flexibility analysis, inpatient hospital and SNF costs are not being reported. This may constitute an incentive
to use more costly inpatient (part A) services, when outpatient (part B) services may be as, or even more appropriate.
Under this proposed rule, HMOs and CMPs and the specified HCPPs would be required to report or monitor these costs.
Although full reporting may cause a slight decrease in Medicare payments to HMOs and CMPs, accounting for these costs
should be the first step in establishing utilization controls and determining the most appropriate use of resources
for the least cost.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The time needed for compliance with this requirement would depend on what systems the plan already has in place, how
much modification, if any, they require, and, for an HCPP, the number of particular part B services the HCPP furnishes
to its Medicare enrollees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
3. Effect of Increased Reporting Requirements on HCPPs that do not Furnish Inpatient Hospital Services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
For HCPPs that do not furnish inpatient hospital services, the elimination of the effective incentives policy requires
major changes. As noted above, under this policy, HCPPs were in some cases exempt from reasonable charge limits and
therefore were not required to document what they paid for individual services. Under the proposed rule, these HCPPs
would be required to document what they paid for services using the Medicare coding systems and to determine the Medicare
payment level for all services. This would require changed procedures for these HCPPs, most of which are currently
exempt from such documentation either because they provide services on other than a fee-for-service basis, or because
they contract with physician groups that use effective incentives and thus are subject to the prudent buyer standard
of current &sect;417.802(b) of the rules. Since the information is readily available from the Medicare contractor,
we estimate that not more than 40 hours would be required to include it in the annual cost report. However, for a staff
or group plan that does not pay its physicians on a fee-for-service basis, the conversion may be more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time-consuming. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
4. Effect on Physicians 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Physicians would be affected by the presumptive limit, if an HMO, CMP, or HCPP_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
&bull;Terminates its contract with HCFA; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In order to keep costs within the presumptive limit_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Reduces its payments to physicians; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Controls utilization so that the fewer services are furnished; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Reduces the number of physicians on staff or under contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
5. Effect on Medicare Enrollees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Medicare enrollees could be affected if the organization in which they are enrolled decides, because its costs exceed
the presumptive limit, not to contract with Medicare. However, many HMOs and CMPs entered into contracts or retained
contracts when the AAPCC was to be applied as an absolute limit, so it does not seem likely this proposed regulation
alone would lead them to drop their cost contracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
6. Effect on Medicare Intermediaries and Carriers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
If an organization exceeds the presumptive limit and seeks payment under the special circumstances exception, intermediaries
and carriers might be required to provide information necessary to verify a plan's documentation of special circumstances.
However, this would not significantly affect intermediary or carrier workload and would not require renegotiation
of their contracts. If organizations terminate their cost contracts, carriers (and intermediaries for home health
claims) would have to process claims for those Medicare enrollees who do not enroll in another prepaid health care
organization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
7. Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The chief objective of the presumptive limit is to ensure that HMOs, CMPs, and HCPPs are paid no more for services than
would have been paid under the Medicare fee-for-service payment systems. We believe that this proposed rule would
move the Medicare program toward this objective by encouraging HMOs, CMPs, and HCPPs to operate more efficiently
without impeding reasonable and necessary service to Medicare enrollees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis for any rule that may have
a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must conform
to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital
as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are not preparing a rural impact statement since we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this proposed
rule would not have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 12866 this proposed rule was reviewed by the Office of Management
and Budget.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Cost reimbursement principles
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In determining fair and equitable payment to the HMO or CMP, HCFA generally applies the cost reimbursement principles
set forth in &sect;413.5 of this chapter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Applicability. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provisions of this paragraph apply to cost HMOs and CMPs and to HCPPs that furnish any inpatient services in general,
acute care, short stay hospitals (as distinguished from psychiatric, chronic, or rehabilitation hospitals that
are long-stay hospitals). In this paragraph, references to HMOs and CMPs must be read as applicable also to HCPPs that
furnish inpatient services in acute care hospitals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Criteria for reasonableness. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In judging whether costs are reasonable, HCFA applies, as a presumptive limit on the total amount payable on behalf
of Medicare enrollees, the weighted average of the AAPCCs for those enrollees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Terminology. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As used in this paragraph_(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Overclaim
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means a claim for costs in excess of the presumptive limit; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Final overclaim
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means that portion of an overclaim that the HMO or CMP cannot document as ``reasonable'' under paragraph (b)(4) of
this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exceptions to presumptive limit. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HCFA may accept and pay claims for costs that exceed the presumptive limit if the HMO or CMP documents that those excess
costs are reasonable because of either of the following circumstances: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The Medicare enrollees of the HMO or CMP have special needs and require a volume and intensity of services that exceed
the average for Medicare beneficiaries of the same age and sex living in the same geographical area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) There were extraordinary occurrences beyond the control of the HMO or CMP including, but not limited to, strikes,
fire, earthquake, flood, or similar unusual happenings that had substantial cost effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Conditions for additional payments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If an HMO or CMP seeks additional payments as an exception to the presumptive limit, it must comply with HCFA instructions
for the exception process described in paragraphs (a)(6) through (a)(10) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response to first notice
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Timing of response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Within 60 days after receipt of a first notice indicating that its costs exceed the presumptive limit, the HMO or CMP
must submit the required information to HCFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Required information. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The required information is any information that HCFA identifies as necessary for it to evaluate whether the HMO or
CMP qualifies for an exception to the presumptive limit. It may include, but is not limited to, data on costs of services
furnished to individual enrollees, documenting the volume and intensity of services required by the Medicare enrollees.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Consequences of failure to provide required information. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the HMO or CMP fails to submit the information requested by HCFA, the HMO or CMP forgoes the option of seeking additional
payments, and is subject to the final adjustment procedures of &sect;417.576(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Determination and notice of determination. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the HMO or CMP submits the information requested by HCFA, HCFA considers that information, determines whether
the HMO or CMP meets the conditions for additional payments, and gives the HMO or CMP notice of that determination.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response to notice of adverse determination. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) If HCFA's determination under paragraph (a)(7) of this section does not provide for additional payments, or provides
for them in amounts that the HMO or CMP considers to be less than the special needs of its Medicare enrollees justify,
the HMO or CMP may submit additional materials to support its position that its costs in excess of the presumptive limit
are the result of one of the circumstances specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, or that the special needs
specified in that paragraph justify larger additional payments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The HMO or CMP must submit the additional materials within 60 days of receipt of the notice of adverse determination.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Verification. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All information submitted by HMOs and CMPs seeking additional payments is subject to verification by HCFA or its authorized
representatives. HCFA may seek verification from sources such as Medicare intermediaries or carriers and State
and local agencies. For example, the local chapter of the American Red Cross might be able to confirm the impact of a
natural disaster. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Determination and notice of final overclaim. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HCFA determines whether there is a final overclaim and gives the HMO or CMP written notice of that determination as
follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) After the notice of presumptive overclaim, if the HMO or CMP does not timely submit required information under
paragraph (b)(6) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) After a notice of adverse determination under paragraph (b)(7) of this section, if the HMO or CMP does not submit
additional justification under paragraph (b)(8) of this section.

Adjustment for final overclaim. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) If the HMO or CMP has a contract with HCFA under subpart L of this part, the rules of &sect;417.576(c) apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the HMO or CMP no longer has any contract under subpart L of this part, it must, unless other arrangements are
mutually agreed upon, reimburse within 30 days after receipt of the notice, any amounts due HCFA under the final overclaim
determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(12) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exemptions based on size. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HCFA may exempt an HMO or CMP from the presumptive limit requirements for up to 2 consecutive years if the HMO or CMP has
500 or fewer Medicare enrollees at the beginning of its contract period. HCFA may establish additional criteria that
these HMOs or CMPs must meet in order to qualify for this exception. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(13) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Termination of contact. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As provided in &sect;417.494(b)(1)(v), HCFA may terminate its Medicare contact with an HMO or CMP that has a final
overclaim for 2 consecutive years, on the grounds that the HMO or CMP is inefficient and that it is not prudent for HCFA
to contract with inefficient entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Method and amount of payment to the HMO or CMP. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) HCFA makes interim per capita payments each month for each Medicare enrollee, equivalent to the interim per capita
cost rate determined in accordance with &sect;417.570. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) HCFA adjusts the interim per capita rate as necessary during the contract period and makes final adjustments at
the end of the contract period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In determining the amount due the HMO or CMP, HCFA deducts from the reasonable cost that the HMO or CMP actually incurs
for covered services furnished to its Medicare enrollees, an amount equal to the actuarial value of the applicable
Medicare part A and part B deductible and coinsurance amounts that would have applied to the covered services for which
payment is being made if these enrollees had not enrolled in this or another HMO or CMP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Cost basis payment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, HCFA pays an HCPP on the basis of the reasonable cost it incurs,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Deductions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In determining the amount due an HCPP for covered part B services furnished to its Medicare enrollees, HCFA deducts,
from the reasonable cost actually incurred by the HCPP_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) An amount equal to 20 percent of the incurred cost, representing the Medicare coinsurance; and

(i) Are comparable to costs incurred for similar services furnished by similar physicians and other suppliers in
the same or a similar location; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Do not exceed what HCFA would pay, in the aggregate (as determined under subpart E of part 405 or part 415 of this
chapter, as appropriate), for the same services under the fee-for service system.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule would bring certain sections of the regulations concerning Medicare fiscal intermediaries and
carriers into conformity with the appropriate sections of Title XVIII of the Social Security Act. The rule would distinguish
between those functions which applicable statutory authorities require to be included in agreements with fiscal
intermediaries and those functions that, while not required to be performed by organizations that have entered into
intermediary agreements with the Secretary pursuant to section 1816 of the Social Security Act, may be included in
such agreements at our discretion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We would require that the intermediary agreements include, as functions, requirements that intermediaries determine
proper payment amounts and pay bills. All other functions would be optional. We propose that all functions for carriers
are optional. These changes would provide us with the flexibility to transfer functions from one intermediary or
carrier to another or to otherwise limit the functions an intermediary or carrier performs when we determine to do
so would result in more effective and efficient program administration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, we propose a number of technical or clarifying revisions concerning carrier payment on a fee schedule
basis and the distinction between nonrenewal and termination of intermediary agreements and carrier contracts.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Intermediary Agreements and Carrier Contracts_Under sections 1816(a) and 1842(a) of the Social Security Act (the
Act), public or private organizations and agencies may participate in the administration of the Medicare program
under agreements or contracts entered into with us (on the Secretary's behalf). These Medicare contractors are known
as fiscal intermediaries (section 1816(a) of the Act) and carriers (section 1842(a) of the Act). With certain exceptions,
intermediaries perform bill processing and benefit payment functions for part A of the program (Hospital Insurance)
and carriers perform claims processing and benefit payment functions for part B of the program (Supplementary Medical
Insurance). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Our regulations at 42 CFR 421.100, Intermediary functions, require that the agreement between us and a fiscal intermediary
specify the functions the intermediary is to perform. In addition to any items specified by us unique to that intermediary,
the regulations require that all intermediaries perform activities relating to Medicare coverage, fiscal management,
provider audits, utilization patterns, resolution of cost report disputes, and reconsideration of determinations.
In addition, the regulations require that all intermediaries furnish information and reports, undertake dual intermediary
responsibilities for service to provider-based Home Health Agencies (HHAs) and provider-based hospices, and comply
with all applicable laws and regulations and with any other terms and conditions included in their agreements.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Similarly, our regulations at 42 CFR 421.200, Carrier functions, require that the contract between HCFA and a part
B carrier specify the functions the carrier is to perform. In addition to any items specified by us unique to that carrier,
the regulations require that all part B carriers perform activities relating to Medicare coverage, payment on a cost
basis, payment on a charge basis, fiscal management, provider audits, utilization patterns and hearings to part
B beneficiaries. In addition, the regulations require that all carriers furnish information and reports, maintain
and make available records, and comply with any other terms and conditions included in their contracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For both intermediaries and carriers, our regulations at 42 CFR 421.5, General provisions, state that HCFA has the
authority not to renew a part A agreement or a part B Contract when it expires. Our regulations at 42 CFR 421.126, Termination
of agreements, provide the Secretary with the authority to terminate fiscal intermediary agreements in certain
circumstances, while the regulations at 42 CFR 421.205, Termination by the Secretary, give the Secretary similar
authority to terminate carrier contracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Proposed Changes to the Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted earlier, our regulations at &sect;421.100 for intermediaries and &sect;421.200 for carriers specify a
list of functions that must, at a minimum, be included in all intermediary agreements and carrier contracts. These
requirements far exceed those of the statute. Section 1816(a) of the Social Security Act requires only that an intermediary
agreement provide for determination of the amount of payments to be made to providers and for the making of such payments.
Section 1816(a) permits, but does not require, an intermediary agreement to include provisions for the intermediary
to provide consultative services to providers to enable them to establish and maintain fiscal records or to otherwise
qualify as providers and, for those providers to which it makes payments, to serve as a channel of communications between
us and the providers, to make audits of the records of the providers, and to perform such other functions as are necessary.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that section 1816(a) mandates only that an intermediary agreement include the functions currently required
by &sect;421.100 paragraph (a) (Coverage) and paragraph (b) (Fiscal management) of the regulations. We believe
that the other functions (&sect;421.100 paragraphs (c) through (i)) that the regulations currently require to be
included in all intermediary agreements are not required by statute and the mandatory inclusion of them in all agreements
limits our ability to efficiently and effectively administer the Medicare program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) of section 1842 of the Act, which pertains to carrier contracts, requires that the contracts must provide
for some or all of the functions listed in that paragraph, but does not specify any functions which must be included
in a carrier contract. As in the case of intermediary agreements, our experience has been that mandatory inclusion
of a long list of functions in all contracts restricts our ability to administer the carrier contracts with optimum
efficiency and effectiveness. We believe that the requirements of the regulations for both intermediaries and carriers
should be brought into conformity with the statutory requirements. Moreover, we believe that such action would substantially
enhance the efficient and effective administration of the Medicare program by giving both HCFA and the contractor
community more flexibility in their approaches to the performance of intermediary and carrier functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We further believe that intermediaries and carriers would benefit from the ability to enter voluntarily into regional
arrangements for the performance of some functions. Intermediaries and carriers have shown interest in entering
into agreements with other contractors in their regions to shift the performance of a given function to a single intermediary
or carrier that is able to perform the function with the greatest efficiency or at the least cost, while another function
might in turn be shifted to a second contractor. For example, one intermediary in a region might perform medical review
for the entire region, while another would assume the audit function. Under the existing requirement that all intermediaries
and carriers perform all functions, such arrangements are not permitted, except through subcontracts, which must
be awarded through the competitive procurement process and which leave the final responsibility for the performance
of the function with the original contractor. The proposed change in the regulations would provide the intermediaries
and carriers with the ability to enter into arrangements to transfer formally the entire responsibility for performance
of a function to other intermediaries and carriers, subject to our approval.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The change would also simplify the process of our paying the intermediary or carrier actually performing the function.
Under a subcontracting arrangement, we pay the contractor that subcontracts out the function and that entity, in
turn, pays the subcontractor which is actually doing the work. Under the proposed change, we would make direct payment
to the intermediary or carrier performing the function. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Our conclusion is that the existing regulations, which state that intermediary agreements and carrier contracts
must include all of the functions cited, are not only inconsistent with applicable statutory authority, but also
are too restrictive. They deny us the flexibility to improve the administration of the Medicare program by removing
some of the functions from an intermediary's agreement or a carrier's contract and transferring them to another intermediary
or carrier where either we or the contractors themselves determine that such action would be more efficient than having
every intermediary and carrier perform all functions specified in the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are proposing to redesignate &sect;421.100, Intermediary functions, as &sect;421.101, Optional intermediary
functions. In a new &sect;421.100, Required intermediary functions, we would specify that all agreements must include
the functions of coverage (current content of &sect;421.100(a)) and fiscal management (current &sect;421.100(b)).
We believe these functions are required to be included in all agreements by section 1816(a) of the Act. In the redesignated
&sect;421.101, Optional intermediary functions, we would indicate that the intermediary agreement may include
the functions currently contained in &sect;421.100(c) through 421.100(i). That is, the cumulative effect of the
change would be to separate the two required functions that must be in all intermediary agreements from the remaining
functions that may or may not be included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;421.200, Carrier functions, we would change the word ``must'' to ``may'' in the first sentence, making all
the functions listed for inclusion in carrier contracts optional. This change would reflect section 1842(a) of the
Act, which does not list specific functions that must be included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Our use of the term ``optional'' does not mean that some functions might not be performed in some jurisdictions. All
functions will continue to be performed in all intermediary and carrier jurisdictions. ``Optional'' in this case
means only that HCFA will have the option of determining whether a given function should be performed in a specific
jurisdiction by the intermediary or carrier which normally serves that jurisdiction and therefore included in that
intermediary's agreement or carrier's contract, or should be performed by some other intermediary or carrier. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;421.200, we propose to add payment on a fee schedule basis as a new function which may be performed by carriers.
While the original carrier functions included payment on a cost basis and on a charge basis, recent statutory changes
and corresponding changes in the regulations have shifted some classes of physician and Medicare suppliers to payment
according to fee schedules. However, &sect;421.200 has never been updated to recognize these changes. Accordingly,
the addition of payment on a fee schedule basis as a function which may be included in carrier contracts will bring this
section of the regulations into conformity with current statutory provisions for Medicare part B payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, 42 CFR 421.5(d) states that, notwithstanding any of the provisions of part 421, HCFA has the authority
not to renew an agreement or contract when its term expires. Section 421.126(b) allows the Secretary to terminate
intermediary agreements under certain circumstances, while &sect;421.205 gives the Secretary the authority to
terminate carrier contracts at any time for cause. The distinction between the termination and nonrenewal of an agreement
or contract is important because the right of an intermediary or carrier to a hearing applicable to terminations does
not apply to nonrenewals. Consequently, we are proposing to revise &sect;&sect;421.5, 421.126, and 421.205 to make
certain that the distinction between nonrenewals and terminations is clear. The proposed changes are not substantive.
They are meant to reflect existing statutory and regulatory requirements, as well as HCFA's longstanding policy
and practice, as expressed in the standard intermediary agreements and carrier contracts.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The objective of these proposed changes is to make the regulations fully consistent with the relevant statutory authority
and to provide, as necessary, clarification of the distinction between contract nonrenewals and terminations.
In addition, the change to the regulations concerning mandatory and optional functions will provide us with the flexibility
to shift non-mandatory functions among intermediaries and carriers so that the Medicare program may be administered
in the most efficient and effective manner possible. We anticipate using the authority granted us by this change sparingly.
Any transfer or consolidation of functions will be determined on a case-by-case basis, and, prior to taking action
in any specific case, we will closely study the situation to determine whether the benefits to the effective administration
of the Medicare program warrant the action. It is not our intent at this time to shift functions from intermediaries
and carriers to any entities except other intermediaries and carriers.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of the large number of items of correspondence we normally receive on a proposed rule, we are not able to acknowledge
or respond to them individually. However, we will consider all comments that we receive by the date and time specified
in the ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
DATES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' section of this preamble, and we will respond to them in the preamble to the final rule.

IV. Collection of Information Requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule contains no information collection requirements. Consequently, this rule need not be reviewed by the Office
of Management and Budget under the authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Regulatory Impact Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)
(5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that a proposed rule would not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, intermediaries and carriers are not considered
to be small entities that will be affected as a result of these regulations. Individuals and States are not included
in the definition of a small entity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a proposed rule
may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must
conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we consider a small rural
hospital as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule would potentially affect the 47 Medicare part A intermediaries and 33 part B carriers with agreements
or contracts with HCFA to make payments to Medicare providers and beneficiaries for covered services and to perform
certain other functions currently described in &sect;421.100 for intermediaries and &sect;421.200 for carriers.
Under this proposed rule, we would have authority to redefine intermediary agreement and carrier contract requirements
and remove functions from some contractors and transfer them to other contractors. We would also be able to consolidate
some tasks under one contractor in regions where several contractors are all performing the same functions simultaneously.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would also add payment on a fee schedule basis as a function which may be included in carrier contracts
and distinguishes between contract nonrenewals and terminations. This proposed rule would make the regulations
more consistent with the relevant statutory authority and promote the more effective and efficient administration
of the Medicare program. Service to beneficiaries and Medicare providers would not be disrupted in the affected regions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Implementing this proposed rule would not create any additional expenses but should enable the Medicare program
to realize savings in administrative costs. At present, we are unable to estimate the potential dollar amount of these
savings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We evaluated the potential impact of these regulations changes on intermediaries and carriers for purposes of determining
whether a regulatory flexibility analysis is required. We believe that the effects or the changes will be minimal.
Almost all of the present contractors have been performing the functions for a number of years and have developed efficiencies
that would argue against our needlessly altering their functions. Therefore, it is not our intention to use the flexibility
of this regulation to make wholesale changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this proposed rule would not result in a significant
impact on a substantial number of small entities. Similarly, the Secretary certifies that it would not have a significant
effect on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Therefore, we are not preparing analyses
for either the RFA or section 1102(b) of the Act.

The flat-tailed horned lizard (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Phrynosoma mcallii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) is a small iguanid lizard restricted to flats and valleys of the western Sonoran desert. Its maximum length, excluding
the tail, is about 8 centimeters (3 inches) (Stebbins 1985). The range of the flat-tailed horned lizard includes portions
of Riverside, Imperial and extreme eastern San Diego Counties, California; northeastern Baja California, Mexico;
Yuma County, Arizona; and northwestern Sonora, Mexico. An estimated 34 percent of historically occupied flat-tailed
horned lizard habitat has been lost. About 95 percent of remaining optimal habitat in California is threatened by
one or more factors. Various human activities threaten 36 percent of the remaining habitat in Arizona. The flat-tailed
horned lizard and its habitat are also being adversely affected in Mexico, but to a lesser degree. The Service published
the proposed rule detailing these factors in the

The Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) (Magnuson Act) requires that each regional fishery management council submit any fishery management plan or plan
amendment it prepares to the Secretary for review and approval, disapproval, or partial disapproval. The Magnuson
Act also requires that the Secretary, upon receiving the plan or amendment, must immediately publish a notice that
it is available for public review and comment. The Secretary will consider the public comments in determining whether
to approve, disapprove, or partially disapprove the FMP amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Amendment 5 would implement: (1) A freeze of the minimum size limit for lobsters at the current carapace size of 31/4
inches; (2) a five year moratorium on new Federal vessel permits; (3) new permit requirements for vessel operators
and dealers; (4) several categories of Federal vessel permits and limits on lobster landings according to a vessel's
permit category; (5) the development a stock rebuilding program for all segments of the lobster fishery; (6) mandatory
reporting for permitted vessels and dealers; (7) changes to the width of the escape vent size from 6 inches to 53/4 inches;
and (8) framework measures to adjust the effort control and other measures in the proposed amendment and provisions
in the plan. This amendment also includes a revised definition of overfishing for lobster and a determination, based
on this definition, that the resource is overfished. The intent of this amendment is to reduce the fishing mortality
rate and rebuild the American lobster resource.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed amendment also included a provision that would allow moratorium qualification for vessels with state
endorsed permits in states that did not notify vessel owners of the control date for lobster. This provision has been
disapproved based on National Standard 4 and the determination that it would discriminate against individuals from
different states.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A notice of proposed rulemaking will be published within 15 days after the submission of the amendment.
