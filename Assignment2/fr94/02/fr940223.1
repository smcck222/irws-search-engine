<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This decision adopts a proposal for pricing milk on the basis of nonfat solids and protein, in addition to butterfat,
for the Pacific Northwest and Southwestern Idaho-Eastern Oregon marketing orders, respectively. In addition,
it reduces the supply plant shipping percentage for the Pacific Northwest order and modifies the producer-handler
regulation to permit a State institution with outside distribution to purchase an average of 1,000 pounds of milk
per day from pool plants. The decision denies a proposal to change location adjustments in Yakima County, Washington.

The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule
on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified
that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The amendments
would promote orderly marketing of milk by producers and regulated handlers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed amendments have been reviewed under Executive Order 12278, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not
intended to have retroactive effect, nor will it preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless
they present an irreconcilable conflict with the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674) (the Act), provides that administrative
proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler
subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any
obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law and requesting a modification of
an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After
a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in
any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity
to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the
entry of the ruling.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following findings and conclusions on the material issues are based on evidence presented at the hearing and the
record thereof: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Multiple component pricing of milk under the Pacific Northwest and Southwestern Idaho-Eastern Oregon orders.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Pacific Northwest and Southwestern Idaho-Eastern Oregon orders should be amended to provide for multiple component
pricing of Class II and Class III (including Class III&hyph;A) milk to handlers and for establishing minimum pay prices
to producers. Under the Pacific Northwest order, the components to be priced will be nonfat milk solids and butterfat.
Under the Southwestern Idaho-Eastern Oregon order, the components to be priced will be protein and butterfat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Multiple component pricing for both orders was proposed by Darigold Farms, and Western Dairymen Cooperative, Inc.,
joined as a co-proponent for the Southwestern Idaho-Eastern Oregon proposal. The basic thrust of the proposal was
that it was time to change the way milk is priced under both orders such that the pricing system would send a clear economic
signal to producers as to which milk components are in the greatest demand and which ones have the greatest economic
value in the marketplace. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two witnesses testified on behalf of Darigold. One witness testified extensively on the general concept of multiple
component pricing. He stated that the current pricing system, which is based on the value of butterfat and skim milk,
does not reflect changes that have occurred over time in the value of certain milk components. In his view, the current
system is based on market conditions that prevailed more than 50 years ago. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current system, in his opinion, simply encourages producers to increase the volume of skim milk produced without
regard to the content of such milk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Darigold witness indicated that under the current pricing system, given the current levels of milk prices and
fat differentials, one pound of protein, lactose, other solids, or even milk water is now valued at somewhere between
nine and ten cents per pound. Thus, the price of one pound of butterfat is about equal to the value attributed to one gallon
of milk water. He also indicated that one pound of butterfat is said to be worth seven to eight times as much as one pound
of milk protein, even though that appears to be unreasonable. He maintained that these unrealistic price comparisons
are nonetheless actual measurements of the incentives that dairymen are expected to respond to under present regulations
when they plan their breeding and production activities. He further indicated his strong belief that the present
system stands in the way of achieving optimum efficiency. Thus, he urged the adoption of multiple component pricing
wherein the marketplace values of various milk components will be reflected in pricing milk to handlers and to producers.
In this way, consumers' demands and preferences for milk and other dairy products can be translated into real signals
that indicate to producers the milk components consumers want and are willing to pay for.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A second witness spoke on behalf of Darigold Farms, Western Dairymen Cooperative, Inc., Farmers Cooperative Creamery,
Northwest Independent Milk Producers Association, Tillamook County Creamery Association, and Magic Valley Quality
Milk Producers, Inc. He indicated that in July 1991 these cooperatives represented 88 percent of the producers for
the Pacific Northwest market (Order 124) and 84 percent of producers for the Southwestern Idaho-Eastern Oregon market
(Order 135). This witness discussed how the proposed multiple component pricing (MCP) system would work, why it should
be adopted, and the form it should take for these two markets. He stated that in order for a MCP program to work well it
needed to be mandatory under the Federal order. Currently, just over 90 percent of the producers for Order 124 and just
over 88 percent of the producers for Order 135 are eligible to receive some component pricing premium. He further stated
that the premium programs result from inadequacies inherent in the current butterfat and skim pricing programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The witness indicated that another reason why MCP is needed is because of increasing interest by consumers in their
diet, especially noting concerns about cholesterol and fat levels in dairy products. He said that consumers now prefer
milk products with lower fat content. He went on to say that over the years there has been a general emphasis on the value
of fat, but that so far there has been only a general offset of this as values of the nonfat fluid portion of milk, which
is largely water, have increased. He stated that the values of specific nonfat components should be recognized and
increased so that consumer preferences could be more directly translated into indicating the milk components that
dairy farmers should be producing for the market. MCP would achieve this and at the same time promote more orderly marketing
for both producers and handlers, according to Darigold's spokesman.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Darigold's witness stated that MCP would contribute to orderly marketing by providing more equity among plants making
Class II and Class III products because their raw milk costs would be more uniform. Also, marketing organizations
would have more options in marketing individual loads of milk. He explained that plants would be less reluctant to
receive a low-testing load of milk because they would pay only for the components received rather than for water that
must be removed from the milk. He said that, in turn, producers in effect will have more options in choosing marketing
organizations or plants to take their milk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The witness also pointed to the changing relationship over time between the values of the butterfat and skim portions
of milk. For example, he noted that during the 1960's butterfat accounted for about 75 percent of the total value of
milk, while the skim value was only about 25 percent. Currently, over 70 percent of the total value of milk is associated
with the skim component because over time the value of butterfat has declined and the Commodity Credit Corporation
has changed the support prices of butter and nonfat dry milk. He expected that the trend to lower fat values will continue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed MCP program was modeled after the one now in effect in the Great Basin Federal milk order. It was chosen
because it would maintain the current Class I price structure, while applying MCP to Class II and Class III uses of milk
where there is a direct relationship between the component content of raw milk and its yield of manufactured milk products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the principal product manufactured from milk not needed for Class I or Class II uses in the Order 124 market
is nonfat dry milk, the proponents proposed that the MCP program for that market should be based on butterfat and nonfat
milk solids. On the other hand, in the Order 135 market the principal use for surplus milk is in hard cheeses. For that
reason, the proponents proposed that the MCP program for that order should be based on butterfat and protein.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As proposed, MCP would not apply to Class I milk, which would continue to be priced to handlers as it now is. Handlers
would account for the components (butterfat and nonfat milk solids or protein) used in Class II and Class III at prices
per pound as specified in the order. Each producer would be paid a weighted average of the Class I and Class II differentials,
plus the value per pound for the components in the producer's milk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Butterfat would be priced on a per-pound basis. The butterfat price, as proposed, would be the sum of the skim milk value
(based on the basic formula price) divided by 100 plus the butterfat differential for the month multiplied by 10.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The prices per pound for nonfat solids or protein, as the case may be, would be determined by subtracting from the basic
formula price the value of the butterfat, and dividing the remainder by the market average test for nonfat milk solids
or protein in producer milk for the current month.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There were three proposed modifications for determining the value of the components other than butterfat. One, advocated
by a spokesman for Kraft General Foods, would use the average component values (tests) of the milk included in the survey
of pay prices that make up the Minnesota-Wisconsin (M-W) estimated price for manufacturing grade milk. The M-W price
is the basic formula price for the orders. According to the Kraft witness, use of the M-W milk component tests would
provide uniformity of component prices among orders, whereas using market average tests could result in component
prices that were not uniform among orders. Darigold's witness indicated that Darigold would accept this approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A second modification was advanced by the witness for Northwest Independent Milk Producers (NWI). As proposed, the
Class III milk price would be a formula price based on the prices for 40-pound blocks of cheddar cheese, plus a value
for whey cream, minus the make allowance used by the Commodity Credit Corporation. The proponent claimed that the
current Class III price (the M-W price) may be reflective of cheese production and manufacturing in Minnesota and
Wisconsin, but is totally out of sync. with the real market situation in the Pacific Northwest region. The proposed
Class III price is needed to improve the competitive relationship between cheesemakers in the Northwest and those
in California, according to the proponent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NWI also proposed that the basic formula price provision should be amended by adding the words ``or $12.10 per hundredweight,
whichever is higher for the month.'' In the view of NWI's witness, this proposal would decouple Class I prices from
the radical price fluctuations that have occurred.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A witness for Swiss Village Cheese, a proprietary bulk tank handler under Order 135, supported MCP for that market.
The witness stated that the failure to recognize varying protein tests for raw milk produces a great inequity in the
Federal milk order pricing system and sends the wrong economic message to producers. He noted that the August 1992
M-W price of $12.54 per hundredweight yields a skim milk price of $10.09 with a seven cents butterfat differential.
The $10.09 figure is the same, regardless of the protein content of the milk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This being the case, he said, the value of a pound of protein thus varies as the test varies. If milk tests 4 percent protein,
dividing the $10.09 by 4 yields a value per pound of $2.52. However, if the test is only 3 percent, the per-pound value
is $3.36, or a difference of 84 cents. Thus, when a cheese plant wants the lowest-priced protein, it would want to attract
the highest testing milk. In order to attract high-testing milk, cheese plant operators pay producers protein premiums
or base their price on a cheese yield formula. He stressed that plants can pay a premium over the Federal order price,
but cannot lower the price to a producer below the minimum Federal order price based on butterfat content. In his view,
this causes handlers or cheese plants to play a price averaging game, which results in producers of low-testing milk
getting paid more than their milk is worth, while producers of high-testing milk are paid less than their milk is worth.
Adoption of multiple component pricing would correct this situation and provide a basis for making economically
correct decisions at both the dairy farm and the plant, he concluded.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Swiss Village Cheese representative presented what he believes are important factors regarding the future of
the dairy industry in Idaho, and in the West in general. He indicated that: (1) Herd size will be large; (2) production
per cow will be high; (3) total milk production increases will exceed population increases; (4) nearly all of the increased
production will be used to make cheese; and (5) most of this ``new'' cheese will be sold to consumers in the East. In view
of these factors, the witness proposed modifications to the MCP plan proposed for Order 135.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first proposed modification would use the protein test for milk that is included in estimating the M-W price. The
second modification proposes adjusting the M-W price for a transportation differential (minus 10 cents) prior to
determining the protein price. This proposal is based on the belief that the market for additional quantities of cheese
produced in Idaho will be population centers in the eastern United States. Therefore, a price adjustment is warranted,
in the view of this witness, because the cheese produced in Idaho will have to be moved long distances to find customers,
and a lower price would help Idaho cheese plants be more competitive with California cheese plants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A third proposed modification by the Swiss Village Cheese witness called for giving milk buyers the right to reduce
a producer's payment if the producer's milk had a high somatic cell count. He testified that cheese yields and cheese
quality both suffer when raw milk has somatic cell counts above 300,000 per milliliter.The money deducted from payments
for milk with a high somatic cell count would be returned to other producers in the pool whose milk had lower somatic
cell counts.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A witness for Avonmore West, a handler under Order 135, testified in support of MCP and urged also that if MCP is adopted,
the pricing must recognize the relationship of somatic cells to the true value of protein in the milk. The witness cited
the Recommended Decision (57 FR 36536) to adopt MCP in the Ohio Valley, Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania, and Indiana
orders. The Recommended Decision in that proceeding adopted MCP for the three orders and included adjustments for
somatic cells both in prices paid to producers and in prices paid by handlers. He urged USDA to follow its own lead and
adopt adjustments for somatic cells based on the evidence presented at this hearing and the Recommended Decision
for the three orders noted above. He contended that if MCP is adopted for Orders 124 and 135 without adjustments for
somatic cells, producers with a low somatic cell count in their milk will be subsidizing producers with high somatic
cell counts in their milk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The only brief filed on this issue was filed jointly by Darigold, Farmers Cooperative Creamery, and Northwest Independent
Milk Producers Association. The brief supported adoption of MCP for both orders and recapped the alternative proposals
made at the hearing. The brief concluded that the preferred basis of determining component values (other than butterfat)
would be as proposed by NWI, i.e., the Class III price would be based on the Green Bay National Cheese Exchange price.
This approach was preferred but the brief also indicated that either the original proposal or the proposal to use the
average M&hyph;W component tests as the divisor of the skim value to get the per-pound prices for protein or solids
nonfat would be acceptable. However, the brief expresses the view that a somatic cell adjustor for paying producers
should not be adopted on the basis of the record in this proceeding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The orders should be amended to provide Class II and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Class III milk prices to handlers and payments to producers based on multiple component values. This concept is widely
supported and is justified by evidence contained in the hearing record. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MCP should be adopted as a step towards improving the way the Federal order translates market values for dairy products
into milk prices that indicate to producers how these products are valued in the marketplace. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As the record indicates, the current pricing system has, over time, placed a greater share of milk value on the skim
portion of milk, and a lesser value on the butterfat portion. Nevertheless, a further recognition of market value
as it relates to the value of milk components can be achieved by converting the skim milk value into components, either
protein or solids nonfat, on a per-pound basis. As the testimony indicates, it is not sound pricing practice to consider
that all skim milk has the same value, regardless of its level of protein or solids nonfat content. The varying values
for the components in skim milk can be more properly reflected in handler prices for Class II and Class III milk, and
prices to individual producers, if MCP is incorporated into the order. Moreover, incorporating MCP into the orders
will tend to insure at least a minimum value of the components for all handlers and producers. This element may be lacking
where there are varying premium plans in use in the market, and where perhaps not all producers are involved. Also,
providing for MCP in the Federal orders will allow handlers to pay lower prices to producers whose milk tests low for
the component other than butterfat. Thus, pricing equity among producers and handlers should be enhanced by adoption
of MCP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another reason for adopting MCP is that, as a pricing system, MCP will improve how well the pricing system in the orders
translates consumer preferences into economic signals that indicate to dairy farmers exactly what consumers want.
Data presented at the hearing show clearly that, over time, consumers prefer milk products with less fat. Adopting
MCP for Orders 124 and 135 will facilitate sending clear signals to producers that consumers want less fat and more
protein or solids nonfat in their dairy products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Clearly, the vast majority of the milk pooled in these two markets is used for Class II and Class III uses. In the Pacific
Northwest market, almost two-thirds of the milk pooled annually in 1989, 1990, and 1991 was classified in Classes
II and III combined; and the percentage is increasing, going from 62.51 for 1989 to 64.47 percent for 1991. In the Southwestern
Idaho-Eastern Oregon market, over 80 percent of the total milk pooled in the years 1989 through 1991 was used in Class
II and Class III products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As proposed, MCP for Order 124 will utilize a solids nonfat component and MCP for Order 135 will utilize a protein component.
Not only will such pricing plans recognize that these markets utilize most of their milk in Class II and Class III uses,
they also will recognize the particular principal dominant product manufactured from surplus milk supplied in each
market. Moreover, the use of protein as the second component in Order 135 will make the provisions of that order more
compatible with provisions of the neighboring Great Basin Order.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proponents indicated that at the time of the hearing 59 percent of the Class II and Class III milk pooled under the
Pacific Northwest order was being made into nonfat dry milk and 26 percent into cheese. Thus, the use of solids nonfat
is appropriate since the majority of manufactured milk is oriented more toward the products and uses in which all the
solids nonfat are consumed together.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, in the Southwestern Idaho-Eastern Oregon market, nearly 80 percent of the milk is made into cheese,
in which protein is an important component. Thus, the use of butterfat and protein for MCP is appropriate for Order
135.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the plan adopted herein, the price for a pound of butterfat will be the same for both orders, i.e., the sum of the
skim milk price divided by 100 and the butterfat differential multiplied by 10. Since each producer will receive payment
for the milkfat on a price-per-pound basis, there will no longer be a need for a producer butterfat differential in
either order. Thus, the proposed order language does not contain a provision for a ``producer butterfat differential.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The prices per pound for solids nonfat and protein should be based on the basic formula price (i.e., the M&hyph;W price).
For each component, the skim milk value will be determined by subtracting from the M&hyph;W price the butterfat price
multiplied by 3.5, and dividing the result by the average percent of solids nonfat or protein (as appropriate) for
the month in the milk upon which the M&hyph;W price is based, as announced by the Dairy Division. Use of the average tests
for the components (other than butterfat) in the M&hyph;W milk will be consistent with such a provision recently adopted
for the Great Basin, Ohio Valley, Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania, and Indiana markets. This approach was suggested
by several people and was supported in briefs. No one specifically opposed it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are two related issues that also should be addressed in connection with determining component prices. First,
we should point out that the solids nonfat content of producer milk in the Pacific Northwest market may be higher than
the solids nonfat content of the milk that is the basis for the M&hyph;W price, based on limited information in the record.
For example, Exhibit Number 7, Table 1, shows that Darigold Farms' solids nonfat tests averaged 8.69 percent for the
months of January through July 1992. On a monthly basis, the Darigold tests were from .04 to .19 higher than the M&hyph;W
milk solids nonfat content for the same period. Also, page two of Exhibit 10&hyph;B shows that NWI's solids nonfat
tests averaged 9.10 percent during January through July 1992. Each of the monthly tests of NWI's milk was more than
.5 above the nonfat solids content of the M&hyph;W milk. The average percent solids nonfat tests of producer milk included
in the M&hyph;W ``Base Month'' Price Series during January through July 1992 were: January, 8.55; February, 8.52;
March, 8.55; April, 8.57; May, 8.56; June, 8.56; and July 8.53. Official notice is taken of page 2 of Dairy Market News,
Volume 59, Report 46, dated November 13, 1992, issued by the Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Marketing Service,
Dairy Division, P.O. Box 8911, Madison, Wisconsin 53708&hyph;8911.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The record does not contain data showing the average solids nonfat content of all producer milk for the Pacific Northwest
market. Thus, the comparisons made above are not conclusive. However, if the comparison reflects the actual market
situation, the price for a pound of solids nonfat would be higher if the M&hyph;W test is used as a divisor in the proposed
formula for calculating the price than if the market average test is used. As a result, the value of Class II and Class
III milk in the pool would increase from current levels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A second related issue that must be kept in mind is that USDA has already conducted a hearing to consider proposed alternatives
to the M&hyph;W price as the basic formula price for all the orders. If the Secretary decides to replace the M&hyph;W
price with some other factor or factors to establish the basic formula price, a question may arise as to what tests for
solids nonfat or protein should then be used. Absent any knowledge at this time as to the outcome of that proceeding,
it would seem appropriate to continue to use the tests prescribed in this decision. Later, it may be necessary to consider
amending the orders in this regard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NWI's proposal to put a $12.10 per hundredweight floor under the basic formula price is not adopted. The principal
purpose of this proposal relates to Class I milk prices. However, Class I milk prices are not an issue in this proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several other proposed modifications to the initial proposal on component prices were offered at the hearing. However,
none of these modifications should be adopted.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One of the modifications would provide a location adjustment to the basic formula price for Order 135 because additional
milk supplies likely would be made into cheese that would have to be transported elsewhere to be sold. Another reason
advanced is because a lower price would improve competition with cheese made from milk priced under the California
State milk order, which has a lower price.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed modification should not be adopted. The purpose of the basic formula is to move prices for milk in most
uses in all Federal order markets. It should not be modified for the purpose of accommodating expected sales competition
for one product under one order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, the Class III cheese formula price modification advanced by NWI and endorsed by Darigold in its brief also
must be denied. With the exception of consideration of a lower price for milk used to make nonfat dry milk (Class III&hyph;A),
it has long been the policy of USDA that the lowest-priced class of use under the Federal order program is based on the
concept of a national market for products (butter, powder, and cheese) made from milk not needed for Class I use. Those
products made from Grade A milk marketed under Federal orders compete with products made from non-grade A milk. Since
these products compete in a national market, there has been a common surplus class price in almost all Federal orders
for many years. It should be noted, of course, that the policy of uniformly pricing surplus milk was modified with the
adoption of a Class III&hyph;A pricing formula that was implemented in 27 Federal orders, including the Pacific Northwest
order, on December 1, 1993. Despite this change, however, the policy of uniformly pricing all surplus milk, except
skim milk used in the production of nonfat dry milk, should be continued, at least for the present.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are other considerations as well. As noted earlier, a hearing has already been held on a replacement or an alternative
to the M&hyph;W price for the basic formula price under the orders. Also, as noted above, there is now a separate Class
III&hyph;A price for skim milk used to produce nonfat dry milk in the Pacific Northwest order. There appears to be a
question about whether a separate Class III&hyph;A price could be justified if the proposed price to be derived from
the cheese exchange prices were adopted as a basic formula price. The record in this proceeding is not adequate to deal
with this question.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, there appears to be a dilemma in the difference between handler prices for milk to make cheese prescribed under
the Federal orders and those provided under the California milk pricing program. However, we do not feel the proper
approach to this problem is to lower the surplus milk price to handlers under one particular order.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another reason not to adopt the NWI proposal is that it is a product formula price based on cheese, yet the principal
use of surplus milk in the Pacific Northwest order is nonfat dry milk. The record simply contains no explanation as
to why a proposal for multiple component pricing in this market situation should have the component values based on
a price derived from the cheese market only. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, on the basis of the record in this proceeding there should be no adjustments to prices under Order 135 based
on the level of somatic cells present in the market's raw milk supply. While the record evidence indicates that somatic
cell levels are important, the record lacks sufficient evidence to develop appropriate provisions to implement
a price adjustment based on somatic cell levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In should also be noted that the brief filed on behalf of Darigold, NWI, and Farmers Cooperative Creamery also concluded
that ``there is insufficient evidence to warrant adopting an `SCC Adjuster' in either Order 124 or Order 135.'' Finally,
we would point out that some proponents expressed a desire to keep the MCP provisions in Order 135 compatible with those
in the Great Basin order. Since the Great Basin MCP provisions do not include a somatic cell adjustor, it would be contrary
to compatibility to include such an adjustor in Order 135. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Incorporation of component pricing in Orders 124 and 135 will necessitate amending provisions of the orders dealing
with handler reports, class (and component) prices, the computation of handler's obligations and payments to the
producer-settlement fund, and the determination of payments to producers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of allocating nonfat milk solids and protein, it is assumed that both components remain evenly distributed
within the skim milk portion of milk receipts. This assumption will allow the proration of nonfat solids and protein
to skim milk for purposes of determining shrinkage and allocating receipts to utilization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the information that is already reported each month to the Market Administrator, each handler under
Order 124 will be required to report the average nonfat solids content of milk received from each producer during the
month, the amount of nonfat solids in the handler's other receipts, except receipts of other source milk, and the nonfat
solids contained in bulk transfers of milk and cream to other handlers. Partially regulated distributing plant operators
will not be required to report information regarding the nonfat solids of their milk receipts unless they elect to
have their obligations calculated under the provision that would determine obligations on the same basis as those
of fully regulated handlers. Handlers under Order 135 will have to report the protein content of their milk receipts
in a similar fashion as that described above.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amended orders will contain definitions for a skim milk price, a butterfat price, a nonfat dry milk price for Order
124, a milk protein price for Order 135, and the usual class and producer prices. The ``skim milk price'' will be used
to determine the value of the skim milk portion of producer milk that is allocated to Class I. Value adjustments for
determining payments by handlers for milk used in Class II and Class III, and to producers, will be made by prices per
pound for the butterfat and nonfat dry milk (for Order 124) or protein (for Order 135) contained in the milk. The skim
milk price, the butterfat price, the nonfat milk solids price, and the milk protein price will be derived from the Class
III price and the butterfat differential. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Payments to producers for deliveries of milk will be determined through the operation of two marketwide pools for
each order. Both orders will contain a ``differential pool'' which will be used to determine producers' share of the
Class I and II market. A second pool_the ``skim milk nonfat milk solids pool'' in the case of Order 124 and the ``skim
milk protein pool'' for Order 135_will be used to determine the price to be paid producers for the nonfat solids or protein
in their milk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each handler's net obligation to the pool (i.e., the handler's payment to the producer-settlement fund) will be determined
by subtracting the differential and nonfat solids (or protein) values due to the handler's producers from the differential
and nonfat solids (or protein) values of the producers' milk used by the handler. The value of butterfat in each producer's
milk will not be pooled, but will be paid directly to the producer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The differential value of each handler's receipts of producer milk assigned to Class I and Class II will be calculated
by multiplying the hundredweights of producer milk allocated to these classes by the difference between the respective
class prices applicable at the location of the plant and the Class III price. In addition, the adjustments to the class
values of producer milk that currently are included in determining a handler's obligation would be included in the
differential value. The adjustments include the values of overage, beginning Class III inventory allocated to a
higher class, other source and filled milk receipts allocated to Class I, certain receipts from unregulated supply
plants that are allocated to Class I, and receipts of bulk concentrated fluid milk and nonfluid milk products that
are reconstituted for fluid use. Each handler's differential value will be combined and then divided by the hundredweight
of producer milk in the differential pool to determine the ``weighted average differential price.'' An ``estimated
uniform price'' can be derived by adding the weighted average differential price to the basic formula price for the
month. Although the uniform price would not be applicable to producers under the component pricing plan, it is of value
for price comparison purposes with other Federal orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each handler's skim milk-nonfat milk solids value for Order 124 and skim milk-protein value for Order 135 will be determined
by combining the skim milk value of the handler's producer milk in Class I with the nonfat solids value (or milk protein
value) of the handler's milk in Class II and III. The skim milk value will be determined by multiplying the skim milk
in producer milk assigned to Class I by the skim milk price. The nonfat milk solids (or protein) value will be determined
by multiplying the nonfat milk solids (or protein) in producer milk assigned to Class II and III by the nonfat milk solids
price (or the milk protein price). The amount of nonfat solids or protein in each class will be determined by multiplying
the skim milk portion of producer milk allocated to each class by the nonfat solids (or protein) content of all of the
handler's producer milk. The price to be paid to producers for the nonfat solids (or protein) in their milk will be determined
by combining the individual handler values of skim milk in Class I milk and nonfat solids (or protein) in Class II and
III milk, and dividing the resulting total by the pounds of nonfat solids (or protein) in all producer milk. The resulting
price will be the ``producer nonfat milk solids price'' (or the ``producer milk protein price''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of the order amendments described, payments to producers will be based on three factors: (1) The weighted
average differential price for all of their milk; (2) the nonfat milk solids or protein contained in their milk multiplied
by the respective producer nonfat milk solids price or producer protein price; and (3) the butterfat in their milk
multiplied by the butterfat price. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adoption of multiple component pricing plans requires amending provisions of the orders dealing with handler reports,
shrinkage, computation of class and component prices, the computation of a handler's obligation to the pool, computation
of a weighted average differential price, and the computation of a producer nonfat milk solids price for Order 124
and a producer protein price for Order 135. These changes have already been discussed.

Several conforming changes must be made in the order language of both orders to implement component pricing. Other
minor changes, though not strictly of a conforming nature, have been made to clarify and improve order language. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other sections of the orders, however, have been changed to accommodate reference changes, date changes, and minor
terminology changes resulting from component pricing. These changes require some explanation here. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 19 (``product prices'') of both orders has been modified to accommodate reference changes, eliminate unnecessary
language, and to include the butterfat differential that previously was described in section 74 of both orders. The
latter change was made because the description of the butterfat differential fits better with the product prices
which are used to compute the butterfat differential and because of the diminished importance of the butterfat differential
under a component pricing system. This change also eliminates redundant language that was included in both sections.
As a result of making this change, several sections following section 74 (i.e., &sect;&sect;1124.75&hyph;1124.78
and &sect;&sect;1135.75&hyph;1135.79) had to be redesignated to close the gap created and several reference changes
had to be made as a result. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 30 and 31 of both orders were modified to accommodate the reporting of nonfat milk solids in Order 124 and protein
content in Order 135. In addition, under Order 135 the date for filing reports of receipts and utilization was changed
from the 7th day to the 9th day after the end of the month, and the date for filing payroll reports was changed from the
20th to the 22nd day after the end of each month. In support of these changes, the spokesman for Darigold Farms testified
that the present reporting date for the report of receipts and utilization leaves no time to review the report, investigate
apparent errors, or make corrections. He also stated that the modified reporting dates will correspond to those of
the Pacific Northwest order. There was no opposition to these proposals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``other reports'' section of Order 124 was modified to improve the language of that section. There was no intention
to substantively change the meaning of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The present &sect;&sect;1124.51a and 1135.51a have been eliminated, but the contents of those sections have been
incorporated in &sect;&sect;1124.51 and 1135.51, respectively. These changes, which are also of a non-substantive
nature, were made in conformance with

Performance standards for supply plants under the Pacific Northwest order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Pacific Northwest order should be amended to provide that the delivery requirements for qualification as a supply
plant be not less than 20 percent of the total quantity of milk that is (1) physically received at the plant from dairy
farmers eligible to be producers or (2) is diverted as producer milk to another plant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To qualify as a pool plant, the order currently requires a supply plant to ship ``not less than 30 percent'' of the total
quantity of milk that is physically received at the plant from producers or that is diverted as producer milk to another
plant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tillamook County Creamery Association (TCCA) proposed a decrease in the shipping percentage from 30 percent to 20
percent. TCCA requested, and was granted, a temporary reduction in the delivery requirements in 1990, 1991, and 1992.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A TCCA spokesman testified that the request to reduce the supply plant shipping percentage was made by TCCA as a result
of continuing changes in the industry. He pointed out that the present 30 percent shipping percentage was adopted
when the Federal order was adopted February 1, 1989. The witness noted that at the time of order implementation (early
1989), Class I utilization was 155 million pounds, which represented in excess of 39 percent of total producer milk
in the Pacific Northwest market. By February 1992, however, Class I utilization was 164 million pounds in the Pacific
Northwest market, and the Class I pool utilization had dropped to 35 percent. By May of 1992, the percent Class I utilization
decreased even further to 30.8 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two other witnesses, one representing Darigold Farms and the other Northwest Independent Milk Producers, testified
in favor of TCCA's proposal. No one testified in opposition to it.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The proposal to amend the delivery requirements for qualification as a supply plant should be adopted due to the changing
conditions in the market. As a result of increases in milk production, pool supply plants are utilized less by pool
distributing plants as a source of milk for bottling. Consequently, they may be unable to meet the order's present
shipping requirements and maintain the producer status of dairy farmers that have been historically associated
with this market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, three options are open to the operators of pool supply plants who find that their milk is not needed at pool
distributing plants. First, despite the fact that the milk is not needed, they can move milk from the production area
to pool plants in the metropolitan area, unload it, and pick up an equal amount of milk from the pool plant and return
it to the pool supply plant location where the milk can then be processed into Class III products. This adversely affects
the milk quality without even considering the costs of transportation, yield reduction, and milk volume loss. When
milk is handled, abuse occurs to some extent. When milk is pumped into a plant, through equipment, and then reloaded
and hauled back or hauled to another plant, this process affects the quality of the product. That can affect the milk's
use for fluid products, depending on the amount of handling involved. It can also affect the quality of cheese that
can be made from milk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second alternative is to find another pool plant that has adequate pool sales and combine the two marketing reports.
If the combined delivery percentage reaches 30 percent of the total production of the combined supply plants, then
both plants qualify to participate in the pool. This option depends entirely on the pool supply plant's ability to
find another supplier with adequate sales to cover the deficit and one who is willing to cooperate by allowing its volume
to be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third option available to the supply plant operator is to request a temporary reduction in the delivery requirements.
Paragraph 1124.7 3(c) allows the director of the Dairy Division to reduce or increase the delivery percentage by 10
percent upon request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After carefully reviewing the testimony on this issue, it is concluded that the delivery requirements for qualification
as a supply plant should be decreased from not less than 30 percent to not less than 20 percent. In view of the increases
in milk production and the lower Class I utilization percentage, it is much more appropriate to permanently change
the delivery requirements of the order than to rely on temporary revisions in shipping percentages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The evidence shows that TCCA is committed to meet the needs of the fluid market. For example, on several occasions it
has reduced its cheese production to supply loads of fluid milk to the Portland market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TCCA is the largest Oregon-based dairy cooperative, handling approximately one-third of the milk produced in the
State each day. Of the one and a half million pounds of milk handled daily, roughly 1.1 million pounds are used to produce
cheese for the retail market and 400,000 pounds are shipped to the Portland market for sale to Class I milk handlers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The lower shipping percentage for pool supply plants will not jeopardize the needs of the fluid market, particularly
with the provision now in the order that permits the Director of the Dairy Division to increase the percentage on short
notice should additional shipments become necessary. The lower percentage will, however, permit milk that has been
historically associated with this market to continue to participate in the marketwide pool and, for this reason,
it should be adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment letter was received with respect to this part of the recommended decision. Darigold Farms stated that
it was pleased with the adoption of this proposal and urged that it be implemented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Status of a milk plant operated by a State institution under the Pacific Northwest order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Pacific Northwest order should be amended to provide that a milk plant operated by a State institution, but which
is not exempt from the provisions applicable to a producer-handler, may receive up to an average of 1,000 pounds per
day of Class I milk from fully regulated handlers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The order currently provides that ``any State institution shall be a producer-handler exempt from the provisions
of this Section and &sect;&sect;1124.30 and 1124.32 with respect to milk of its own production and receipts from pool
plants processed or received for consumption in State institutions and with respect to movements of milk to or from
a pool plant.'' Thus, a State institution plant may buy bulk milk or packaged milk products as Class I milk without limits
from pool plants for use in State institutions. If such a plant has sales to outlets other than State institutions,
a limit on such purchases of 100 pounds per day average is applicable, and the plant must file reports, the same as any
other producer-handler.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Washington State Department of Corrections proposed amending the producer-handler and nonpool plant provisions
to provide total exemption from all provisions of the order for ``a plant owned and operated by a State institution
or establishment which processes or packages fluid milk products.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The witness for the proponent testified that because the Department of Corrections buys milk products from pool plants,
there is a continuing conflict between the State law under which the prison dairy is operated, and the Federal order's
definition of a producer-handler. He explained that under Chapter 72, Correction Reform Act of 1981, Revised Code
of Washington, the Washington State Reformatory Dairy (WSRD) is mandated to ``(1) provide a work training program
for inmates, (2) imitate private industry as much as possible and thereby be self-supporting, and (3) provide quality
products to government and nonprofit agencies at or below market prices.'' Thus, the WSRD is allowed, under the State
law, to buy whatever milk products it needs in order to serve its clients. Such purchases have, on occasion, exceeded
the quantity that a producer-handler is allowed to acquire under the Pacific Northwest order, according to the testimony.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The only other witness that testified in favor of the proposal represented the Oregon Department of Corrections.
Under cross examination, he indicated that there are no Oregon statutes that apply to the Department of Corrections'
dairy facility. On the other hand, he also indicated that the Dairy is prohibited from selling to the private sector.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal to exempt State institutions was opposed by one proprietary handler and by three cooperative associations.
The principal thrust of the opposition testimony was that adoption of the proposal would open the door for State institutions
to compete against fully regulated handlers for Class I and Class II sales, and that the State institutions would have
a competitive advantage by being exempted from the Federal order pricing and pooling regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal to totally exempt a plant operated by a State institution should not be adopted because it would make it
possible for the operations to compete for commercial sales against fully regulated handlers. On the other hand,
there appears to be a need to provide some relief from the very limited amount of Class I fluid milk products that such
a plant may receive from pool plants under the producer-handler provisions of the order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing the testimony on this issue, it is concluded that a State institution that is not exempt from the producer-handler
limits on receipts of milk from pool plants should be able to receive more fluid milk products from pool sources than
the amount allowed for other producer-handlers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The evidence shows that the WSRD has had problems in conducting its operation in accord with its operating mandate
while, at the same time, staying within the limits that the order places on receipts by a producer-handler. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current limit on receipts of fluid milk products from pool plants by a producer-handler has been in effect for many
years (Official Notice is taken of the Order Amending The Order Regulating The Handling Of Milk In The Puget Sound,
Washington, Marketing Area, effective September 1, 1959, as published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 29, 1959, beginning at page 6027). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this proceeding does not deal with producer-handlers as such, it is clear that the 100 pounds per day limit as
applied to a State institution is unreasonably low. This is clearly demonstrated in the testimony that in the last
five years the number of inmates in the Washington State Department of Corrections institutions has increased from
6,000 to 10,000 inmates, and that growth to 12,000 is expected in the next three years. Since the Department of Corrections
is authorized to purchase products that it does not process or manufacture, the need for greater supplemental purchases
is clear. Accordingly, a State institution milk plant should be permitted to receive an average of 1,000 pounds per
day of Class I fluid milk products from pool plants during the month. However, no change in the limit should be provided
for producer-handlers that are not State institutions.

In commenting on the Department's handling of Issue No. 3, Darigold Farms, the only party commenting on this issue,
indicated that it supported the position reached in the recommended decision.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Plant location adjustments for Yakima County, Washington, under the Pacific Northwest order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal to change the location adjustment (No. 3 in the Notice of Hearing) on all producer milk received at plants
in Yakima County in Federal Milk Order 124 is denied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The order defines zones for the purpose of determining location adjustments. The order currently states that Yakima
County, Washington, is in Zone 4, which has a 15 cents per hundredweight location adjustment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Darigold Farms proposed a decrease in the location adjustment from 15 cents per hundredweight to 6 cents per hundredweight,
a change of 9 cents. Accordingly, Yakima County would move from Zone 4 to Zone 2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The witness for the proponent testified that the theory behind a location adjustment is to be able to attract producer
milk from outlying areas to market centers or alternatively to attract packaged milk from a pool plant located in outlying
areas. The Pacific Northwest order has four market centers: Portland, Oregon; Eugene, Oregon; Seattle, Washington;
and Spokane, Washington. Yakima County is roughly in the center of the triangle formed by Portland, Seattle, and Spokane.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The witness noted that the Pacific Northwest Order has relatively low Class I utilization, about 35 percent. There
is more than an adequate supply of bulk milk to serve both fluid and manufacturing markets. He also pointed out that
in a low utilization market such as Pacific Northwest, location adjustments are seldom needed. There has been no history
of handlers in the Pacific Northwest market not being able to obtain bulk milk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The witness testified that Darigold was not proposing the elimination of location adjustments, but rather to maintain
the status quo for all the other fluid milk handlers in the market. The only fluid plant that would be affected is the
Darigold plant in Yakima County, which would pay an added nine cents per hundredweight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The witness' testimony drew a parallel between Yakima County, Washington, and Whatcom County. The two counties are
very similar, he noted, in that there's a large concentration of milk in a small area. Moreover, both plants are located
outside major market centers, and both counties have small fluid operations which serve the county area but not the
market centers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The witness for the proponent testified that the proposal was being made because of the opening of the Darigold plant
in Sunnyside in December of 1991. The plant was needed to help balance the increased production in the Pacific Northwest
and the increase of milk in Yakima County. Comparing December of 1980 to December of 1990, Yakima County dairymen increased
their deliveries of producer milk from 18.9 million pounds to 49.7 million pounds per month. The Yakima County producers
currently account for 13.5 percent of the milk marketed in the Pacific Northwest order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The witness noted that, prior to the opening of the Darigold/Sunnyside plant, the milk from Yakima County was sent
to plants in Seattle and Chehalis, Washington, which have no location adjustment. No location adjustment was needed
since milk production increases in western Washington are expected to keep all plants full. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The witness testified that the 15-cent-per-hundredweight location adjustment at Sunnyside, in effect, constitutes
a ``penalty'' to the Darigold producers who financed the Sunnyside plant, which was needed by all producers to ensure
outlets for all milk produced in the marketing area. Had the plant not been built, disorderly market operations surely
would have developed, he said. The witness argued that this ``penalty'' is unnecessary because hauling costs will
move the milk to market centers without location adjustments. He pointed out, for example, that Darigold's hauling
costs from Sunnyside to Spokane, the closest market center, is 76 cents per hundredweight for a distance of 120 miles,
or .6 cents per mile. In comparison, the proposed decrease from 15 cents to 6 cents would move the milk only about 15 miles
at the .6-cent-per-hundredweight cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The witness testified that for any producer farm located closer to Spokane than to Sunnyside, it is cheaper to move
milk to Spokane than to Sunnyside even with no location adjustment. Reducing the location adjustment to six cents
merely moves the geographic break-even point 15 miles closer to Sunnyside and enlarges by the same 15 miles the area
from which Spokane pool plants can readily attract milk.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The witness testified that within the original area, without the 15-mile adjustment, there already is enough milk
to satisfy the needs of Spokane pool plants, so there is no need to provide a further incentive to move milk that is located
in that 15-mile area closer to Sunnyside. The Sunnyside milk also can and does supply Seattle pool plants and could
service plants in Portland and Spokane. A similar analysis shows that there is far more milk in the areas closer to Seattle
and Portland than needed by pool plants in those areas. Therefore, the 15-mile incentive which the 6-cent location
adjustment represents is not really needed as an incentive to move milk to those market centers. The witness noted
that the combination of some Yakima Valley milk that is surplus to the Sunnyside plant's capacity, plus the western
Washington milk, is adequately supplying the needs of all the plants in western Washington. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three other witnesses testified on Proposal No. 3. The witnesses for Portland Independent Milk Producers Association
and Olympia Cheese Company were opposed to Proposal No. 3, and the witness from Inland Northwest Dairies, Inc., also
expressed reservations. Two briefs discussing Proposal No. 3 were filed, one by Darigold Farms in favor of the proposal,
and one by Portland Independent Milk Producers Association opposed to the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Portland Independent Milk Producers Association opposed Proposal No. 3 to change the zone classification for plants
in Yakima County from Zone 4 to Zone 2 to reflect the same location adjustment that Whatcom County currently enjoys.
The witness testified that the theory behind a location adjustment is to be able to attract producer milk from outlying
areas to market centers. He pointed out that the proposed zone change in the proposal appears to have the opposite effect
in that it would increase the return to producers delivering milk to plants located in Yakima County. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The witness noted that increased returns could send two signals. One signal is that there is actually an additional
demand for fluid milk to be delivered to Yakima County, which is not believed to be the case. There appears to be more
than an adequate supply of milk for the Yakima County fluid operations. The second signal sent to producers when there
is a situation of increasing returns is to increase production. The witness did not feel that either of these signals
is appropriate in light of the theory behind a functioning location adjustment program or the already increasing
supplies of milk surplus to fluid market needs in these areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The witness also expressed concern that there is an increasing imbalance between freight costs of milk produced in
the Yakima Valley area and delivered to local plants and that milk which moves up to 200 miles to the market center. He
argued that acceptance of Proposal No. 3 further accentuates the potential imbalance. The witness stated that it
was their understanding that Yakima County is the type of market situation that a location differential program is
designed to protect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In comparing Whatcom County to Yakima County in this proposal, the witness extended that comparison by quoting from
the 1988 final decision (53 FR 49165) which merged the Oregon-Washington and Puget Sound-Inland Federal milk orders
into the Pacific Northwest order and established the current location adjustment program under the merged order.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Proponents' arguments for reducing the present six cent location adjustment at locations in Whatcom County, Washington,
are less persuasive. The location adjustment should not be reduced. One reason given for such a reduction was that
the nearby manufacturing plant in Lynden provides an outlet for milk surplus to the market's fluid needs while location
adjustments are still needed at locations in southern and central Oregon and central Washington precisely because
no nearby manufacturing plant exists to provide an outlet for surplus milk produced in these areas. In fact, the situation
thus described by the Darigold witness should result in a greater location adjustment for Whatcom County, for instance,
than Jackson County, Oregon. The receipt of milk at a manufacturing plant located in an area of heavy milk production
at some distance from the market's center is the classic situation to which location adjustments were designed to
apply. Prices paid for such milk are adjusted downward for location to compensate for the fact that the milk has not
been hauled to distant bottling plants but instead has been shipped a relatively short distance at a significantly
lower hauling cost.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=3 -->
these markets, with manufacturing plants located in heavy production areas distant from most distributing plant
locations, are more comparable to the situation of Whatcom County. Such increases, that update location adjustments
to correspond to the significant increases in hauling costs that have been experienced since most location adjustment
provisions were written, are actually the only means of ``modernizing'' location adjustments. It is very possible
that it would be appropriate to modernize or increase the location adjustment at Whatcom County as urged by Northwest
Independent Milk Producers Association and Carnation Company. However, there is inadequate data and testimony
in the record of this proceeding to determine an appropriate change in the level of location adjustment for Whatcom
County.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The witness pointed out that the same theory underlying the 1988 decision relative to Whatcom County is applicable
to Proposal No. 3, and expressed the view that based on the current harmonious relationships within the marketplace,
the 15-cent location adjustment should be maintained if location adjustments are going to continue to be recognized
within this Federal order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Olympia Cheese Company opposed Proposal No. 3 relative to changing the zone classification for plants in Yakima County
from Zone 4 to Zone 2 to reflect the same location adjustment as Whatcom County. The witness testified that Olympia
Cheese Company currently procures a substantial portion of its milk supply in Yakima County. That milk has to be shipped
over the mountains in order to get to western Washington where its plant is located. The company subsidizes part of
those hauling costs. The witness maintains that the proposed reduction in the location adjustment in Yakima County
will further add to milk costs because in order to keep the milk supply from that county, hauling costs will have to be
subsidized further by the same amount as the reduction in the location adjustment in order to stay competitive in milk
procurement in that region. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The witness testified that Olympia Cheese Company's suppliers are going to be competing precisely against those
suppliers in the Yakima County area, forcing them to come up with the same amount, even though its suppliers go across
the mountains to western Washington. The witness contends that if its suppliers were breaking even before with respect
to hauling cost, with the adoption of Proposal No. 3 they would be nine cents worse off. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Olympia Cheese Company's witness stated that a location adjustment's traditional role is to reduce the payment
to individual farmers for any milk that stays in the county_i.e., that milk which is not shipped to a heavily populated
area. This provides a disincentive and promotes the shipment of milk from high production/low population areas to
high population areas. The witness stated that in the case of Proposal No. 3, it appears the location adjustment is
doing the opposite of intended, in the sense that all of a sudden the incentive is reduced, therefore increasing the
incentive for the milk to stay in Yakima County. The witness pointed out that location adjustments are there precisely
to promote shipment of milk to populated areas, and that they were used as a mechanism by USDA for this purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Inland Northwest Dairies, Inc., also expressed concerns over the adoption of Proposal No. 3. The witness emphasized
that there has been a very harmonious relationship in the marketplace. The witness stated that, with the adoption
of Proposal No. 3, the company might be in a much tougher position in the future to recruit milk from producers in the
Yakima Valley, from where 80 percent of its milk supply comes. He contended that because of competitive conditions,
Darigold's producers may not have to pay as much in the future to get their milk to the Sunnyside plant as what others
would have to pay to bring milk from the Yakima region to Spokane, Washington. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The witness was further concerned with adjusting the location allowance because of the situation that also exists
in Moses Lake, where Safeway 85, Inc., a pool plant, has a 15-cent location adjustment. He stated that reducing the
location adjustment in Yakima County could create some disparity in the marketplace because Safeway is definitely
competition. The witness emphasized that the majority of its milk comes from the Yakima and Benton County region and
that in the long-term there may be some inequities should the amount charged Darigold producers in the future be adjusted
by the location adjustment in Proposal No. 3.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The purpose and intention of location adjustments is to provide the incentive to move milk from one area to another
for fluid uses only. Generally speaking, this means moving milk from outlying production areas to the more heavily
populated market centers. It is not the purpose of location adjustments to facilitate the movement of milk to a distant
location for manufacturing uses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The witness for the proponent testified that the proposal was being made because of the opening of the Darigold plant
in Sunnyside in December of 1991 to help balance the increased production in the Pacific Northwest and the increase
of milk in Yakima County. Prior to the opening of the Darigold/Sunnyside plant, milk from Yakima County was sent to
plants in Seattle and Chehalis, Washington, which have no location adjustment. The witness testified that the 15-cent-per-hundredweight
location adjustment at Sunnyside in effect constitutes a ``penalty'' to the Darigold producers who financed the
Sunnyside plant. In light of this, however, Darigold producers now have access to the local Sunnyside plant without
having to incur the costs of hauling milk to Seattle and Chehalis, Washington. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current conditions indicate harmonious relationships within the marketplace. The location adjustment change
proposed is not needed to prevent disorderly marketing conditions in Yakima County or anywhere within the marketplace.
Fluid milk needs are being more than adequately met, and there appears to be no need to encourage production of milk
in the Pacific Northwest market by increasing the level of returns to producers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In conclusion, we find no compelling reason to reduce the location adjustment in Yakima County based on this record.
Yakima County should remain in Zone 4 with a 15-cent-per-hundredweight location adjustment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While no exception was taken to this conclusion, two cooperative associations did comment on it. Portland Independent
Milk Producers Association (PIMPA) stated that the department was correct in denying the proposal, while Darigold
Farms wrote that it was ``puzzled'' by the department's rationale in denying the proposal and would like to revisit
the issue of location adjustments at a future hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It was stated in the recommended decision that the record evidence indicated there was no need to move milk for fluid
use from Yakima County to any of the population centers in this market: i.e., Seattle, Portland, Eugene or Spokane.
However, PIMPA points out in their exception that a significant amount of their Yakima County milk does, in fact, move
to a number of handlers in one or more of these population centers, and this point is supported by record evidence. Consequently,
it cannot be concluded on the basis of this record that location adjustments are no longer necessary in this market.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This order shall not become effective unless and until the requirements of &sect;900.14 of the rules of practice and
procedure governing proceedings to formulate marketing agreements and marketing orders have been met.

Findings and Determinations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The findings and determinations hereinafter set forth supplement those that were made when the orders were first
issued and when they were amended. The previous findings and determinations are hereby ratified and confirmed, except
where they may conflict with those set forth herein.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Findings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A public hearing was held upon certain proposed amendments to the tentative marketing agreements and to the orders
regulating the handling of milk in the Pacific Northwest and Southwestern Idaho-Eastern Oregon marketing areas.
The hearing was held pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7
U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), and the applicable rules of practice and procedure (7 CFR part 900).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon the basis of the evidence introduced at such hearing and the record thereof, it is found that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The said orders as hereby amended, and all of the terms and conditions thereof, will tend to effectuate the declared
policy of the Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The parity prices of milk, as determined pursuant to section 2 of the Act, are not reasonable in view of the price
of feeds, available supplies of feeds, and other economic conditions which affect market supply and demand for milk
in the said marketing areas; and the minimum prices specified in the orders as hereby amended are such prices as will
reflect the aforesaid factors, insure a sufficient quantity of pure and wholesome milk, and be in the public interest;
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The said orders as hereby amended regulate the handling of milk in the same manner as, and are applicable only to
persons in the respective classes of industrial or commercial activity specified in, marketing agreements upon
which a hearing has been held.

Order Relative to Handling
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is therefore ordered that on and after the effective date hereof, the handling of milk in the Pacific Northwest and
Southwestern Idaho-Eastern Oregon marketing areas shall be in conformity to and in compliance with the terms and
conditions of the orders, as amended, and as hereby amended, as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice proposes to amend Class D airspace at El Toro MCAS, El Toro, CA, designated as an extension to a Class C surface
area. The floor was inadvertently lowered from a base of 2500 mean sea level (MSL) down to the surface. This proposed
modification would raise the floor between the 10 and 15 mile radius of Class D airspace from the surface up to 2500 feet
MSL.

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify the Class
D airspace as an extension to the Class C airspace at El Toro MCAS, El Toro, CA. During the Reclassification of Airspace
effective September 16, 1993 a portion of the Class D extension was inadvertently published as being from the surface
to 4400 feet MSL. This proposed amendment would return the airspace to a floor of 2500 feet MSL and a ceiling of 4400 feet.
The coordinates for this airspace are based on North American Datum 83. Class D airspace designated as an extension
to a Class C surface area is published in paragraph 5000b of FAA Order 7400.9A, dated June 17, 1993, and effective September
16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D airspace listed in
the document would be published subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would establish Class E airspace extending from 700 feet above ground level (AGL) at Belle Plaine,
Iowa. The development of new standard instrument approach procedures (SIAPs) at Belle Plaine Municipal Airport,
Belle Plaine, Iowa, utilizing the Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range Tactical Air Navigation
(VORTAC) and Belle Plaine, Iowa, non-directional beacon (NDB) located on the airport has made this proposal necessary.
The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate controlled airspace for aircraft executing these SIAPs
at Belle Plaine, Iowa.

The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace at Belle Plaine, Iowa, extending upward from 700 feet above the surface excluding that portion which overlies
the Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Class E airspace. The development of new SIAPs at Belle Plaine Municipal Airport has made this
proposal necessary. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace for aircraft executing
the NDB or VOR/DME&hyph;A SIAPs at Belle Plaine Municipal Airport. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based
on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth
when designated in conjunction with an airport are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17,
1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993).
The Class E airspace designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would modify the Class D airspace for Grant County Airport by excluding the airspace overlying
the Moses Lake Municipal Airport, Washington. This action would allow operations to and from the Moses Lake Municipal
Airport without radio communication with the Grant County Airport Control Tower.

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify the Class
D airspace for Grant County Airport, WA. The reclassification of airspace which became effective September 16, 1993,
encompassed the Moses Lake Municipal Airport. The FAA endeavors to exclude satellite airports located within Class
D Airspace where safety would not be substantially compromised. This action would avoid any adverse impact on the
Moses Lake Municipal Airport and simplify ATC coordination responsibilities between the primary and the satellite
airport. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D designations are published
in Paragraph 5000 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D airspace designation listed in this document would
be published subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend the Class
E airspace at Portland, Oregon, to accommodate a new instrument approach procedure at the Portland, Oregon International
Airport. The area would be depicted on aeronautical charts for pilot reference. Airspace reclassification, in effect
as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued use of the term ``transition area,'' replacing it with Class E airspace.
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations for airspace
areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order
7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58
FR 36298; July 6, 1993). Class E airspace designations for airspace areas extending upward from the surface of the
earth are published in Paragraph 6003 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which
is incorporated by reference in 17 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designations listed in
this document would be published subsequently in the Order.

The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations

summary: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice proposes to change the final compliance date for installing improved (11-parameter digital) flight
data recorders from May 26, 1994, to the next heavy maintenance check, but no later than May 26, 1995, in Stage 2 airplanes
subject to the rules requiring a transition to an all Stage 3 fleet. This change would allow carriers more time to take
actions necessary to retrofit Stage 2 airplanes, and would make the flight data recorder replacement rule more compatible
with the noise transition requirements without having a significant impact on safety.

On March 25, 1987, the FAA promulgated a final rule that requires operators, by May 26, 1994, to install improved (11-parameter
digital) flight data recorders on all airplanes type certificated on or before September 30, 1969, and operated under
part 121 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (52 FR 9622). The final rule, &sect;121.343(c), was issued in response
to a recommendation from the National Transportation Safety Board that was based on accident/incident files for
January 1983 to February 1986 that revealed a high failure rate for metal foil flight recorders. The data revealed
that 37 recorders (48 percent) had one or more malfunctioning parameters preceding the accident or incident, preventing
the recording or readout of pertinent data.

Air Transport Association's Petition for Exemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In August 1991, the Air Transport Association (ATA) petitioned the FAA for an exemption from &sect;121.343(c). The
ATA stated that the compliance date for the digital flight data recorder (DFDR) retrofit was inappropriate when considering
the schedule for either retrofitting airplanes with noise abatement equipment or retiring airplanes in order to
comply with the Stage 3 transition mandated in September 1991 (56 FR 48628, September 25, 1991). The FAA denied the
ATA exemption request, stating that the Stage 3 transition rule did not mandate the retirement of any Stage 2 airplanes.
The FAA pointed out that noise abatement equipment was expected to be available for virtually the entire active fleet.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In June 1992, the ATA again requested that the FAA extend the May 26, 1994, DFDR compliance date for its members and similarly
situated operators. In the alternative, the ATA requested that the FAA establish a delayed DFDR retrofit schedule
that coincided with the State 3 transition interim compliance dates to avoid having to install new DFDR's on airplanes
that were scheduled to be retired. The ATA asserted that the compliance deadline would require its members to install
DFDR's on Stage 2 airplanes that would be retired within 51/2 years of the May 1994 compliance date to remain in compliance
with the part 91 noise operating rule. The ATA asserted that this DFDR retrofit requirement for Stage 2 airplanes would
impose substantial costs on them with little perceived benefit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ATA cited several factors in support of its petition, including the estimated cost of DFDR retrofit, the cost and
lead time in accomplishing the engineering work to support the retrofit, the impact of retiring Stage 2 airplanes
that were DFDR retrofitted, the required review of agency rules to insure that benefits are maximized, and the argument
that flight data recorders do not enhance aircraft safety. The ATA concluded that the DFDR retrofit would no longer
be viewed as cost beneficial because of the noted events and circumstances that have occurred since the rule was promulgated
in 1987.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A summary of the petition was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 12, 1992. Two comments were received, both of which opposed the petitioner's request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A DFDR manufacturer opposed the exemption, citing the number of unsolved accidents, the extended life of commercial
airplanes, and the possibility of further expenses associated with a delay in compliance with &sect;121.343(c)
as its reasons for opposing the exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) opposed the exemption because (1) it would delay the safety benefits
to be gained by the DFDR retrofit; (2) the need for and safety benefits of having 11-parameter recorders were well established;
and (3) linking the DFDR requirement to the operating noise rules of part 91 could result in non-complying aircraft
being flown beyond the year 2000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 29, 1993, after considering all the data presented by the ATA and the commenters, the FAA determined that
a grant of exemption was justified and in the public interest. Exemption No. 5593 permits ATA members to operate certain
Stage 2 airplanes equipped with DFDR's that have 6 rather than 11 operational parameters. Operation is allowed subject
to certain conditions and limitations, including the requirement that air carriers submit a list of their Stage 2
aircraft that will be retired by December 31, 1998. The terms of the exemption allow non-ATA air carriers to apply for
coverage under the exemption if they are similarly situated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 30, 1993, the FAA amended Exemption No. 5593 to clarify certain conditions that were being misinterpreted.

Air Transport Association's Petition for Rulemaking
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 17, 1993, the ATA submitted a petition for rulemaking to amend &sect;121.343. The ATA states that the previously
granted exemption does not provide the scope of relief necessary for its members and similarly situated air carriers,
and that a change to the rule is necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ATA requests that &sect;121.343(c) be amended to reflect the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Installation of 11-parameter DFDR's be required only for those airplanes that will be in the fleet beyond December
31, 1999.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Installation of 11-parameter DFDR's in those airplanes (those that will remain in the fleet beyond December 31,
1999, including Stage 3 airplanes) would be accomplished on a phased compliance schedule with the option of retiring
or retrofitting a percentage of the operator's fleet as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After December 31, 1994, at least 25 percent of the Operator's fleet on U.S. operations specifications that do not
have the 11-parameter DFDR installed must be retired or have the 11-parameter DFDR installed;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After December 31, 1996, at least 50 percent must be retired or have the 11-parameter DFDR installed;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After December 31, 1998, at least 75 percent must be retired or have the 11-parameter DFDR installed;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After December 31, 1999, 100 percent must be retired or have the 11-parameter DFDR installed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As justification for this proposed change, the ATA states in its petition that, if 10 of its operators were to comply
with the retrofit requirements of &sect;121.343(c) by May 28, 1994, the cost would exceed $29 million. The ATA petition
does not specify how these costs were computed, or what portion applies to aircraft that would be retired. The ATA does
state that if non-ATA-member carriers were considered, the cost estimate would be at least double.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ATA also states that the change is justified by problems with the technical requirements of DFDR installation.
The ATA notes that retrofit instructions and parts do not yet exist for all aircraft currently in the fleet. These engineering
specifications and retrofit kits can cost up to $250,000 per aircraft type to develop, require a 40-week lead time,
and must undergo FAA approval. The petition does not give any detail as to the number or type of airplanes affected by
these circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ATA also restated the justifications presented in its original petition for exemption, including the variable
fleet plans of carriers and the fact that the presence of an 11-parameter DFDR on an airplane does not make the operation
of that airplane any safer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In January 1994, to further support its petition, the ATA presented updated information indicating that conditions
in the industry have changed further, and that meeting the May 26, 1994, compliance date would be impossible for a significant
number of Stage 2 airplanes because of changes in fleet plans, and equipment availability and certification difficulties.
A copy of the updated data presented by the ATA has been placed in the docket.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed the ATA proposal in detail and is unable to support it for several reasons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA acknowledges that an economic burden results from the inconsistent timing of the Stage 3 transition rule and
DFDR rule requirements, that thee burdens affect part 121 operators to varying extent, and that relief is needed that
is beyond the scope of the current exemption. However, the ATA petition seeks to include all aircraft currently in
the fleet, whether Stage 2 or Stage 3. The noise transition rule does not affect Stage 3 airplanes currently in the fleet;
their status has not changed since the time the DFDR rule was adopted in 1988, and the ATA has presented no justification
why these aircraft should be included in any relief.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the ATA has repeatedly argued that its member carriers revise their fleet plans on a weekly basis. However,
in its petition, the ATA proposes that aircraft that would leave an operator's fleet by December 31, 1999, would not
have to be DFDR retrofitted, and that those that will remain will be phased into DFDR compliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA finds it difficult to reconcile these two positions. The ATA proposal would require every affected operator
to engage in considerable fleet planning if it is to know in advance which aircraft need not be retrofitted because
they will not be in the operator's fleet after 1999. The same would be true of any attempt to retrofit any percentage
of a fleet by specific dates. Given the admitted constant shifts in fleet plans, the FAA has determined that to make
full use of a rule such as that proposed by the ATA would require complete flexibility for the operator and thus would
make compliance almost impossible to monitor or establish at any given time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the ATA petition is unclear in its starting point for individual operator's fleets. Given the changing fleet
plans of operators, the FAA was unable to determine when there would be a ``count'' of airplanes from which to measure
percentage compliance, or how that percentage would be affected by aircraft movements in and out of an individual
fleet.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, as stated previously, the FAA acknowledges that some relief is needed from the combined impact of the Stage
3 transition and DFDR retrofit rules and the current equipment availability problems, at least as far as Stage 2 airplanes
are concerned. Accordingly, the FAA is proposing to amend &sect;121.343(c) to provide some relief to part 121 operators.
This proposal seeks to limit the financial burden for DFDR installation while recognizing that there is a safety benefit
from the installation of 11-parameter DFDR's. The substance of the exemption granted to the ATA and other petitioning
part 121 carriers would not be affected by this proposed extension of the compliance date; a carrier may choose to maintain
exemption coverage for that portion of its Stage 2 fleet listed on the Aircraft Retirement Schedule required by the
exemption. Based on the outcome of this rulemaking action, however, the FAA will reexamine the exemption to ensure
its continued legal applicability and compatibility with any changes made to &sect;121.343 and determine whether
the date for submission on an Aircraft Retirement Schedule should be amended.

The Proposed Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA proposes to extend the compliance date in &sect;121.343(c) for all Stage 2 airplanes subject to the Stage 3
transition rule (&sect;91.801(c)). The proposed rule would require that the DFDR installation be accomplished
at the next heavy maintenance check, but in no case later than May 26, 1995. The proposed extension would allow more
flexibility in retrofit planning for those carriers that have experienced difficulty in obtaining engineering
approval for DFDR retrofit designs, or an inability to obtain parts and installation services before the May 26, 1994,
compliance date. This change may also function to bring carriers past the first interim compliance date of the Stage
3 transition rule, possibly eliminating the necessity for any airplanes to be DFDR retrofitted before they are removed
from the fleet for noise compliance purposes, depending on the individual circumstances of the carrier.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would also require that by May 26, 1994, each carrier submit to the FAA a list of its Stage 2 airplanes
that will be covered under by this proposed rule change, and evidence (i.e., a binding contract) that the carrier has
ordered sufficient flight data recorder equipment to meet the May 26, 1995 compliance date, either by aircraft retirement
or planned retrofit. This provision is designed to ensure that carriers take full advantage of the time provided by
the proposal extension.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed relief would be of economic significance to the industry and is consistent with recent recommendations
from the National Commission to Ensure a Strong Competitive Airline Industry (Commission), a Presidential task
force formed in April 1993 to make policy recommendations about the financial health and future competitiveness
of the U.S. airline and aerospace industries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the Commission recommendations and the information submitted, the FAA has determined that the ATA has
presented a persuasive case concerning the changing conditions and difficulties that carriers have encountered
in attempting to meet the May 26, 1994, DFDR compliance date. The FAA does not anticipate any significant impact on
safety if this proposal is adopted. Flight data recorders, regardless of the number of operational parameters they
record, have no direct effect on the safe operation of an airplane. The importance of flight data recorders lies in
their ability to reveal the status and operational parameters of an airplane after it is involved in an accident or
other incident. Depending on what is revealed, such data can be used as the basis for altering the operation or physical
characteristics of similar airplanes. Thus, for the proposed rule to have a negative impact, one of the airplanes
covered by it would have to be involved in an accident in the additional 1 year, and information essential to the determination
of cause must be a part of one of the five additional parameters recorded on the upgraded DFDR but not on the currently
required six-parameter flight data recorders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has concluded that the chance of these particular circumstances occurring is remote. Further, the FAA has
sought to limit this possibility by extending the compliance date only for Stage 2 airplanes, some of which are expected
to leave the fleet by December 31, 1994, under the noise transition regulations. By requiring all other airplanes
to comply with the DFDR rule are promulgated in 1987, the FAA seeks to maximize the benefit of DFDR installation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA stresses that all airplanes covered under the proposed extension must still be equipped with one or more approved
flight data recorders that record those parameters specified in part 121. It is only the upgrade to 11-parameter DFDR's
that would be extended for a limited number of airplanes. The FAA also stresses that the proposed relief would have
no effect on compliance with the Stage 3 transition. The proposed relief would not be available for Stage 2 airplanes
not subject to the Stage 3 transition rule, i.e., Stage 2 airplanes that weigh less than 75,000 pounds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule provision that requires DFDR installation at the time of the next heavy maintenance check after
May 26, 1994, is the FAA's admonition to carriers that the agency expects DFDR installation to be accomplished at the
earliest feasible time. A ``heavy maintenance check'' is considered to be any occasion on which the airplane is taken
out of service for 4 or more days for maintenance; the FAA recognizes that carriers may have different terminology
to describe this concept, and the term ``heavy maintenance check'' as used in this proposal is not meant to describe
a specific recognized circumstance or event. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In petitioning for an exemption from &sect;121.343(c), the ATA based its argument of cost without benefit on the regulations
requiring the transition to an all Stage 3 fleet. In granting the requested exemption, the FAA emphasized that the
Stage 3 transition rule does not require the retirement of any Stage 2 airplanes. The exemption was thus limited to
those aircraft that operators actually planned to retire rather than retrofit to meet Stage 3 noise levels. However,
the operators indicated that the equipment usage and retirement plans mandated by the granted exemption were incompatible
with both fleet planning capabilities and the less restrictive compliance requirements of the Stage 3 transition
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA acknowledges that the relief proposed here is not as broad as that described in the ATA petition. The FAA seeks
comment from affected operators on the extent to which this proposed extension will relieve recent problems experienced
in DFDR retrofits of Stage 2 airplanes. The FAA specifically requests economic data that details the costs of compliance
with the current May 1994 compliance date and any costs savings anticipated from the extension proposed here. Comments
that contain information concerning any quantifiable impact on safety in delaying compliance are also requested.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA stresses that carriers should not consider the extension as a period of deferred retrofit action. The FAA does
not anticipate granting any further relief from the DFDR requirements for any airplanes beyond that proposed here.
The DFDR rule was promulgated in 1987 and should have been incorporated into fleet planning by part 121 operators.
The FAA acknowledges that circumstances such as the Stage 3 transition rules require some reconsideration of rule
impacts, and in light of the reported difficulties in obtaining the necessary equipment and support to comply with
the DFDR rule, this extension is an example of the kind of relief that the FAA considers to be justified. To date, no other
substantial, quantifiable data has been presented to support further delay in compliance with the DFDR regulation.

Regulatory Evaluation Summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12866 established the requirement that, within the extent permitted by law, a Federal regulatory
action may be undertaken only if the potential benefits to society for the regulation outweigh the potential costs
to society. In response to this requirement, and in accordance with Department of Transportation policies and procedures,
the FAA has estimated the anticipated benefits and costs of this rulemaking action. The FAA has determined that this
proposed rule is not a ``significant rulemaking action,'' as defined by Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning
and Review). The results are summarized in this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule, by extending the compliance date by up to 1 year, would allow for the installation of DFDR to coincide
with the installation of noise suppression kits for those aircraft that are affected by the December 31, 1994, noise
compliance date. The current exemption limits the relief from the current deadline for installing DFDR on Stage 2
airplanes that will be retired by the end of the decade, leaving aircraft intended for retrofitting with noise suppression
equipment subject to the current deadline of May 1994. Any aircraft that are scheduled for retirement by the end of
the decade for which an exemption has not been obtained would also be subject to this deadline.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The potential benefits of this rule change would be the cost savings realized by the operators of Stage 2 aircraft in
part 121 service that plan to retrofit these aircraft with noise suppression equipment or have not received an exemption
for those Stage 2 aircraft they plan to retire by the end of the decade. The proposal would afford these operators up
to an additional year in which to install the required DFDR equipment. Operators that were planning to retrofit their
aircraft with noise suppression equipment before May 1995 would derive the greatest cost savings because DFDR retrofit
could be accomplished at the same time that the aircraft was being retrofitted with noise suppression equipment.
Therefore, no additional non-routine downtime would be required for the upgraded DFDR retrofit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amount of the potential cost savings accruing to operators planning to retrofit their aircraft prior to the proposed
May 1995 deadline was estimated using industry data. Information provided to the FAA by ATA members indicates that
the installation of upgraded DFDR's could require from 2 to 5 days of downtime per airplane, depending on the type of
equipment. The major passenger carriers responding to the ATA survey estimated the costs of this downtime from $14,000
to $26,000 per day per airplane. The FAA forecasts that about 250 Stage 2 aircraft will be retrofitted with noise suppression
equipment over the next 11/2 years. Operators of these aircraft could therefore expect cost savings of between $10
million (based on 2 days of downtime per aircraft and an average cost of $20,000 per day) and $25 million (based on 5 days
of downtime per aircraft and a cost of $20,000 per unit) from this proposal. The FAA solicits comments from the industry
regarding the cost savings expected from the avoidance of additional downtime solely for the purpose of retrofitting
aircraft with upgraded DFDR's.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operators planning to retrofit their Stage 2 airplanes with noise suppression equipment after May 1995 would not
receive as great a benefit in terms of reduced downtime, however, because the additional 1 year afforded by this proposal
may not be enough for them to avoid any non-routine downtime. Nevertheless, these operators would be able to benefit
from the opportunity to delay incurring installation costs for the upgraded DFDR equipment by up to one year, the value
of which is calculated in the following paragraph. Available FAA data indicates that about 490 Stage 2 aircraft would
fall in this category. The FAA solicits data from the industry regarding the amount of non-routine downtime that could
be avoided if the operators of these aircraft were afforded the proposed additional year to comply with the upgraded
DFDR requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA was able to estimate the opportunity cost of capital savings that operators could expect from being able to
delay incurring the expense of installing upgraded DFDR equipment by up to 1 year. Responses from a survey of its members
conducted by the ATA indicated that the installed cost of the equipment would range from $20,000 to $40,000. Given
the expected rate of return on capital of 7 percent that is mandated by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the
FAA estimates that the opportunity cost savings expected to result from the proposal would amount to about $1.03 million,
using the midpoint of the expected range of equipment installation costs (.07 &times; $30,000 &times; 490 aircraft).
The FAA solicits comments from part 121 air carriers regarding the expected impact of the proposed regulatory relief
on their costs of compliance, including the number of airplanes to which this relief would apply. Information pertaining
to the scheduling of these retrofits would also be useful in calculating the cost savings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of operators that plan to retire their Stage 2 aircraft over the next 5 years have not taken advantage of the
previously granted exemption from the upgraded DFDR requirement. Those operators of aircraft that plan to remove
from service some airplanes by the December 31, 1994 noise transition compliance deadline and that are not using the
exemption could also benefit from this proposal. Extension of the DFDR deadline would allow them to forego installing
upgraded DFDR equipment on some aircraft that would otherwise be retired within 7 months of the installation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule change would impose only a minimal cost on society in the form of a reduction in safety because of the
extremely low probability that one of the 740 airplanes potentially affected by this rule will have an accident (which
would not be prevented by the new 11-parameter DFDR) during the additional 1 year. Moreover, if there were an accident
involving these Stage 2 airplanes, the causes of such an accident would have to be determinable only with the additional
data provided by an upgraded DFDR. For a safety benefit to be realized, this information would have to be used in rulemaking
or some other agency action that would prevent a second future accident with a chain of causation closely resembling
that of the first accident. The resulting probability of these two hypothetical accidents actually occurring, assuming
the proposal goes into effect, is considerably less than the already remote possibility that one of the 740 affected
aircraft would have a serious accident over this time frame. The FAA calls for comments on the extent of the potential
reduction in safety that could result from this proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would also require that each air carrier submit to the FAA documentation listing those Stage 2 aircraft
scheduled for retrofit as well as evidence that it has ordered a sufficient number of flight data recorders to meet
the May 26, 1995, compliance date for all aircraft on the list. The FAA has estimated that this paperwork information
requirement would cost each affected air carrier about $25. The total cost of this provision would therefore not appreciably
alter the overall balance between the costs and benefits of the proposed rule.

Initial Regulatory Flexibility Determination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily
burdened by government regulations. The RFA requires agencies to review rules that may have a ``significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' The proposed rule is of a cost relieving nature and would therefore
afford cost savings to individual part 121 operators.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under FAA Order 2100.14A, the criterion for a ``substantial impact'' is a number that is not less than 11 and that is
more than one third of the small entities subject to the rule. For operators of aircraft for hire, a small operator is
one that owns, but does necessarily operate, nine or fewer aircraft. This proposal would mainly affect part 121 scheduled
operators, although some unscheduled operators could be affected as well. The FAA's criterion for a ``significant
impact'' is $116,300 or more per year for a scheduled operator whose entire fleet has a seating capacity of 60 seats
or more, $65,000 for a scheduled operator with a fleet including smaller aircraft, and $4,600 or more for an unscheduled
operator.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The extent of the annualized cost savings per aircraft resulting from the opportunity cost of capital that would be
saved (i.e., what could be earned on alternative investments) would be $2,100 per aircraft, based on the assumptions
used in calculating the potential total cost savings resulting from this factor in the previous section (.07&times;$30,000).
A scheduled carrier with a fleet of smaller aircraft would therefore need to convert well over nine aircraft to exceed
its threshold value of $65,000, in which case it would not be regarded as a small entity. A scheduled carrier with a fleet
of larger aircraft would have to convert even more aircraft to exceed its threshold of $116,300. The threshold value
for an unscheduled operator is only $4,600, however, as noted above. A carrier would therefore, only have to convert
three airplanes to exceed this threshold, using the estimate of cost savings derived above. To make a determination
of a ``significant economic impact,'' the FAA needs information pertaining to the number of Stage 2 aircraft that
small unscheduled operators are planning to retrofit with noise suppression equipment. The FAA therefore requests
that affected part 121 operators provide information pertaining to the number of aircraft involved and the potential
reduction in compliance costs per aircraft.

International Trade Impact Assessment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OMB directs agencies to assess the effects of regulatory changes on international trade. The proposed rule will affect
only U.S. air carriers because foreign carriers are not subject to part 121. The economic analysis of the final rule
mandating that aircraft receiving an original type certificate before September 30, 1969, install DFDR's capable
of recording the required number of parameters by May 1994 concluded that there would not be any trade impact. Therefore,
the provision of relief from the original rule in the form of a deadline extension is not expected to have any impact
on international trade.

Federalism Implications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national
government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12866, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient
federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

International Civil Aviation Organization and Joint Aviation Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In keeping with U.S. obligations under the Convention on International Civil Aviation, it is FAA policy to comply
with the Standards and Recommended Practices of the International Civil Aviation Organization to the maximum extent
practicable. The FAA is not aware of any differences that this proposal would present if adopted. Any differences
that may be presented in comments to this proposal, however, will be taken into consideration.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons discussed in the preamble, and based on the findings in the Regulatory Flexibility Determination
and the International Trade Impact Analysis, the FAA has determined that this proposed regulation is not a significant
regulatory action under Executive Order 12866. In addition, the FAA certifies that this proposal, if adopted, will
not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the
criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This proposal is considered not significant under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Postal Service has noted that a number of publications which currently have second-class mailing privileges
are also available to subscribers in alternate media, such as floppy diskettes and CD&hyph;ROMs. These alternate
media, even if containing exactly the same information that is available in the paper version of the second-class
publication, are not currently eligible for second-class mailing privileges because the Postal Service has interpreted
the requirement that ``second-class must be formed of printed sheets'' to exclude this material. (See section 200.0103
of the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule, reprinted in 39 CFR part 3001, subpart C, appendix A.) While current
usage of these alternate media appears to be limited, it is expected that future usage will increase. It is also expected
that new types of information not available in traditional second-class publications (e.g., videos or musical accompaniment)
will become available in these alternate media, and that new ways of presenting and using this information may make
simple analogies to traditional second-class publications more difficult.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Postal Service believes it might be useful at this time to review the printed sheet requirement pertaining to the
mailing of second-class publications and other aspects of the classification of non-print media. Commenters should
keep in mind that the other requirements for second-class matter have not been identified for reconsideration at
this time. These requirements include that the matter must be originated and published for the purpose of disseminating
information of a public character or devoted to literature, the sciences, art or some special industry; that it must
be issued at stated intervals no less than four times per year; that there be limited advertising in issues; and that
there be a list of subscribers/requesters, as applicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Options available for the classification of non-print media include, but are not limited to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Allowing publications in non-printed sheet formats to be mailed at second-class rates, if they meet all other current
requirements of second class.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Requiring matter not on printed sheets to be mailed at non-second class rates, such as first-, third-, or fourth-class
mail.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Allowing only some material, in highly specific formats (such as 100% non-advertising content), to be eligible
for second-class rates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Establishing an entirely new classification (class, subclass or rate category) to meet the service and pricing
needs of mailers of non-printed sheet publications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in view of the foregoing, the Postal Service requests from interested parties, comments and proposals
on the following subjects:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. How are publications on diskette or CD&hyph;ROM currently mailed or distributed (e.g., via first-class mail,
third-class mail, alternate delivery services, etc.)?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Should publications in non-printed sheet formats be eligible for second-class?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Would allowing formats other than printed paper sheets maintain the integrity of second-class?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Should computer diskettes and CD&hyph;ROMs be considered ``printed sheets?''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. If formats other than printed sheets are to be allowed, should these formats be limited to computer diskettes and
CD&hyph;ROMS, or should other formats be eligible? What would these other formats be?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. If additional formats are to be eligible, would the material have to meet the other existing criteria for second-class
eligibility, such as periodicity?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Should second-class eligibility be limited to media that contain information nearly identical to the paper-based
issues already eligible for second class? For example, should publications containing audio or video segments be
excluded? If they are not to be excluded, how are they to be measured for postage computation purposes? How much or what
kind of variance between the paper and non-paper formats would be appropriate?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. If additional formats are allowed, there may be an impact, either positive or negative, on postal handling and administrative
costs, and subsequently, rates. Therefore, should there be additional machinability and/or preparation requirements
for the new formats?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. How should the Postal Service handle the determination and verification of advertising percentage, postage,
weight, and other factors that are physically measurable with printed sheets? Given industry trends, is it likely
that publications in additional formats will evolve in such a way as to make both editorial and advertising content
increasingly difficult to measure?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
h. Should mixed formats be allowed in a mailing (e.g., paper and CD&hyph;ROM)?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. If any commenter believes that the Postal Service should request a recommended decision from the Postal Rate Commission
to establish a new classification (class, subclass or rate category) that would include materials in electronic
formats that may or may not meet the current requirements for second-class publications, such as periodicity or a
subscriber/requester list, the commenter is asked to also comment on the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. If a new rate category were to be established, what are the current and anticipated future rate and service requirements
for materials in additional formats? For example, within how many days of issue do they need to be delivered locally,
nationally, etc.?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. What should be eligible for this new classification? Should eligibility be limited to publications, or should
other items in electronic format be included?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Should this classification be a new class, subclass or rate category:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Postal Service will evaluate the comments and proposals received in response to this notice and issue a notice
of proposed rulemaking if it determines that such action is appropriate.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This serves as notice of, and a request for, comments on proposed changes to the Commission's rules of practice and
procedure that the Commission is considering for adoption. The proposed rules evolved out of the Commission's Docket
RM91&hyph;1 proceeding. Participants to that proceeding developed specific proposals for improvements to the
Commission's rules of practice. Adoption of these proposed rules is expected to enhance the efficiency of Commission
proceedings and ease the burdens on participants in Commission proceedings.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission's Office of the Consumer Advocate (OCA) has filed a motion requesting that the Commission consider
a Stipulation and Agreement on proposed changes to the Commission's rules of practice and procedure. All documents
relating to the RM91&hyph;1 proceeding are available for public inspection at the Commission's H Street offices.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule changes resolve some, but not all, of the outstanding issues in this proceeding. Fifteen participants
support proposed changes to the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, 39 CFR 3001, which would alter the service
requirements applicable to requests for written discovery and the answers thereto; restrict transcript corrections
to material, substantive errors; require limited participators to respond to discovery requests specifically
directed to testimony they sponsor; alter production specifications relating to margins, line spacing and choice
of typeface; and allow a ten-day grace period for filing signature pages to interrogatory responses under specified
conditions. Additionally, nine participants support adding a new rule 10(d), 39 CFR 3001.10(d), which would require
that certain documents be filed in electronic form (on diskettes) within five working days of their being formally
filed in hard copy. Adoption of these proposed rules is expected to enhance the efficiency of Commission proceedings
and ease the burdens on participants in Commission proceedings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Punctuation within the attachment to the Stipulation and Agreement might be interpreted to propose elimination
of certain provisions not discussed in the motion. It is the understanding of the Commission that there was no intent
to propose changes other than those explained in the proposed Stipulation and Agreement. To avoid any possible misunderstandings,
the full text of affected subsections, as they would appear if the changes proposed herein were adopted, are set forth
below. Additionally, to improve clarity, an article has been added to the next to last sentence in Rule 26(c), 39 CFR
3001.26(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the signatories to the Stipulation and Agreement, McGraw-Hill, Inc., also filed a comment noting that the language
describing the service requirements of discovery questions and objections differed from the language in the rules
applicable to service requirements for discovery answers and compelled answers. Compare for example proposed rule
25 (a)(c), with rule 25(b)(d). The comment indicates that parties to the Stipulation intended that the rules for service
of discovery requests, answers, objections, and compelled answers be identical. Conforming adjustments have not
been proposed at this time to allow interested persons to comment on the specific language submitted in the Stipulation.
Absent comments in opposition submitted in response to this notice, conforming changes would be made in the final
rule to reflect that, for documents described in rules 25, 26, and 27, special requests for service will be honored;
and the final sentence in proposed rule 12(b), 39 CFR 3001.12(b) would be changed to read as follows: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Special requests for service are used for obtaining service of discovery requests and answers, and any objections
and compelled answers related thereto. Participants may serve special requests for service on any other participant
requesting service of discovery requests directed to specified witnesses or participants; or answers provided
by specified witnesses or that participant.

Regulatory Evaluation

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that these rules will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the terms of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 It has also been determined that these rules do not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment pursuant to Executive Order 12612. These rules do not contain any information collection
requirements as defined in the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3502(4), and consequently the review provisions
of 44 U.S.C. 3507 and the implementing regulations in 5 CFR part 1320 do not apply.

 If not printed, documents filed with the Commission shall be produced on paper of letter size, 8 to 81/2 inches wide
by 101/2 to 11 inches long, with left- and right-hand margins not less than 1 inch and other margins not less than 0.75
inches, except tables, charts or special documents attached thereto may be larger if required, provided that they
are folded to the size of the document to which they are attached. The impression shall be on only one side of the paper
unless there are more than ten pages. The text shall be not less than one and one-half spaced except that footnotes and
quotations may be single spaced. Any typeface not smaller than 12 pt may be used. If the document is bound, it shall be
bound on the left side. Copies of documents for filing and service may be reproduced by any duplicating process that
produces clear and legible copies.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) All testimony, exhibits, workpapers, library references, briefs and reply briefs which have been prepared
on a computer or word processor shall be filed as diskettes (or otherwise electronically transmitted to the Commission)
within five business days of the initial filing of the hard copy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Diskettes filed pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section may be provided in any widely-used format. The preferred
formats are IBM&hyph;PC compatible diskettes in Word Perfect, Microsoft Word, ASCII text, Lotus (DOS 3.0 or later
version), or DIF format. If these formats are not used to produce the initial hard copy, diskettes will be accepted
in any format actually used. Documents which have been generated on a mainframe or minicomputer, for example, shall
be converted to diskettes, if possible. In such cases as these, where a file translation program must be used to produce
a PC-compatible diskette, reasonable conversion programs will satisfy the requirements of this section. If a party
has generated hard copy of documents subject to this section on a computer other than a personal computer and lacks
the capability of producing a PC-compatible diskette, the party must arrange for other means of conveying the information
electronically. Recommended alternatives to the filing of diskettes are transmission by modem or providing the
information on magnetic tape.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) If documents are not prepared using electronic media, diskettes need not be created and filed. A party that generates
documents subject to this section using non-electronic means is to file an affidavit or declaration so stating within
five business days of the initial filing of the hard copy. The declaration or affidavit may be the statement of a witness,
counsel or an official representative of the participant. Such an affidavit or declaration need be filed only once
during the course of a proceeding, within five business days of the filing of the first document subject to this section.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The Commission intends to file within five business days of their initial issuance in hard copy form diskettes
of all documents issued by the Commission or the Presiding Officer. This includes Presiding Officer's rulings, Commission
orders, notices of inquiry and other notices and Commission opinions and recommended decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Any changes or revisions to electronically-filed documents shall be filed on updated diskettes. The updated
diskettes are to be filed within five business days of the initial filing of the hard copy of the revisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

upon the participants in the proceeding individually or by such groups as may be directed by the Commission or presiding
officer except for discovery requests as governed by &sect;&sect;3001.25 to 3001.27. Special requests relating
to discovery must be served individually upon the party conducting discovery and state the witness who is the subject
of the special request.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Subject to the provisions of &sect;3001.30(f), limited participators may present evidence which is relevant to
the issues involved in the proceeding and their testimony shall be subject to cross-examination on the same terms
applicable to that of formal participants. Limited participants may file briefs or proposed findings pursuant to
&sect;&sect;3001.34 and 3001.35, and within 15 days after the release of an intermediate decision, or such other
time as may be fixed by the Commission, they may file a written statement of their position on the issues. The Commission
or the presiding officer may require limited participators having substantially like interests and positions to
join together for any or all of the above purposes. Limited participators are not required to respond to discovery
requests under &sect;3001.25 through &sect;3001.28 except to the extent that those requests are directed specifically
to testimony which the limited participators provided in the proceeding; however, limited participators, particularly
those making contentions under 39 U.S.C. 3622(b)(4), are advised that failure to provide relevant and material information
in support of their claims will be taken into account in determining the weight to be placed on their evidence and arguments.

Service and contents.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the interest of expedition and limited to information which appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery
of admissible evidence, any participant may serve upon any other participant in a proceeding written interrogatories
requesting nonprivileged information relevant to the subject matter in such proceeding, to be answered by the participant
served, who shall furnish such information as is available to the participant. A participant through interrogatories
may require any other participant to identify each person whom the other participant expects to call as a witness at
the hearing and to state the subject matter on which the witness is expected to testify. The participant serving the
interrogatories shall file a copy thereof with the Secretary pursuant to &sect;3001.9 and shall serve a copy upon
the Postal Service. Special requests for service by other participants shall be honored. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Answers.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Each interrogatory shall be answered separately and fully in writing, unless it is objected to, in which event the
reasons for objection shall be stated in the manner prescribed by paragraph (c) of this section. The party responding
to the interrogatories shall serve the answers on the party who served the interrogatories within 20 days of the service
of the interrogatories or within such other period as may be fixed by the presiding officer, but before the conclusion
of the hearing. The answers are to be signed by the person making them. If the person responding to the interrogatory
is unavailable to sign the answer when filed, a signature page must be filed within ten days thereafter with the Commission,
but need not be served on participants. Copies of the answers to interrogatories shall be filed with the Secretary
pursuant to &sect;3001.9 and shall be served upon other participants who request them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Objections.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the interest of expedition, the bases for objection shall be clearly and fully stated. If objection is made to part
of an interrogatory, the part shall be specified. A participant claiming privilege shall identify the specific evidentiary
privilege asserted and state the reasons for its applicability. A participant claiming undue burden shall state
with particularity the effort which would be required to answer the interrogatory, providing estimates of cost and
work hours 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required, to the extent possible. An interrogatory otherwise proper is not necessarily objectionable because an
answer would involve an opinion or contention that relates to fact or the application of law to fact, but the Commission
or presiding officer may order that such an interrogatory need not be answered until a prehearing conference or other
later time. Objections are to be signed by the attorney making them. The party objecting to interrogatories shall
serve the objections on the party who served the interrogatories within 10 days of the service of the interrogatories.
Copies of objections to interrogatories shall be filed with the Secretary pursuant to &sect;3001.9 and shall be served
upon the proponent of the interrogatory and the Postal Service. Special requests for service by other participants
shall be honored.

In the interest of expedition and limited to information which appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery
of admissible evidence, any participant may serve on any other participant to the proceeding a request to produce
and permit the participant making the request, or someone acting in his/her behalf, to inspect and copy any designated
documents or things which constitute or contain matters, not privileged, which are relevant to the subject matter
involved in the proceeding and which are in the custody or control of the participant upon whom the request is served.
The request shall set forth the items to be inspected either by individual item or category, and describe each item
and category with reasonable particularity, and shall specify a reasonable time, place and manner of making inspection.
The participant requesting the production of documents or things shall file a copy of the request with the Secretary
pursuant to &sect;3001.9 and shall serve copies thereof upon the Postal Service. Special requests for service by

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 USEPA is proposing to approve a revision to the Minnesota State Implementation Plan (SIP) for new source review in
nonattainment areas, submitted to meet longstanding requirements as well as new requirements imposed by the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990. This revision consists of the State Rules 7005.3010 through 7005.3060, which incorporate
by reference the new source review requirements specified in appendix S to title 40 Code of Federal Regulations part
51 (40 CFR part 51), ``Emission Offset Interpretive Ruling,'' except for the deletion of unacceptable exemptions
included in appendix S. Final approval of this revision would lift the current ban on permitting major sources and
major modifications in Minnesota nonattainment areas.

I. Summary of State Submittal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part D of title I of the Clean Air Act sets forth SIP requirements for nonattainment areas. Section 173 and the various
subparts of title I contain the program requirements for the review and issuance of permits for the construction of
major new sources and major modifications in a nonattainment area. Currently, Minnesota has no approved nonattainment
area permitting program. On August 5, 1992, and August 26, 1993, Minnesota submitted revised new source review regulations
for the purpose of meeting these requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statutory requirements that apply to State regulations for new source review in nonattainment areas are set forth
at part D of title I of the Clean Air Act, particularly in sections 172(c)(5) and 173. Federal regulations developed
prior to enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 for nonattainment area new source review programs are set
forth at title 40 Code of Federal Regulations part 51 (40 CFR part 51), particularly 40 CFR 51.165. The Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990 also establish assorted new requirements, for which preliminary guidance was published April
16, 1992 (57 FR 13498), and April 28, 1992 (57 FR 18070). For example, section 189(a)(1)(A) requires that sections
172(c)(5) and 173 be met for fine particulate matter nonattainment areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) has submitted general permitting regulations to USEPA on various
occasions, including January 28, 1972; May 28, 1972; January 23, 1981; and January 7, 1985. USEPA approved the 1972
submittals on May 31, 1972; the 1981 submittal on May 6, 1982; and the 1985 submittal on May 13, 1988. However, these
rules did not address the specific requirements for permitting new and modified major sources in nonattainment areas.
Consequently, Minnesota has no approved nonattainment area permitting program, and the State continues to be subject
to a prohibition against permitting major new sources and major modifications in the State's nonattainment areas,
as promulgated by USEPA on July 2, 1979 (44 FR 38583). More recent MPCA submittals, which are the subjects of this proposed
rulemaking, were intended to address the requirements for nonattainment area new source permitting and allow USEPA
to lift the permitting prohibition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MPCA has submitted SIP revisions for meeting the permitting requirements of part D on two previous occasions. MPCA's
first submittal was on December 22, 1981. USEPA proposed conditional approval of this rule in the July 29, 1982, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (47 FR 32742). Minnesota used the plant-wide definition of source in its rule. Before final rulemaking could be published,
the D.C. Circuit Court ruled against the plant-wide definition of source. This decision was later overturned (

, 104 S.Ct. 2778 (1984)), but USEPA never approved this SIP revision because of other concerns. This submittal was
ultimately withdrawn, in an August 21, 1990, letter from the Commissioner of MPCA, and USEPA's proposed action on
this submittal was withdrawn in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 of November 7, 1990 (55 FR 46829).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MPCA submitted its second revision for meeting the permitting requirements on March 13, 1989. In February 1990, USEPA
provided MPCA with comments, stating that the rule would not be approved. In a February 24, 1992, letter, Charles W.
Williams, Commissioner, MPCA, withdrew the March 13, 1989, submittal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current revisions being addressed in this rulemaking include State submittals of August 5, 1992, and August 26,
1993. These submittals include State Rules 7005.3010 through 7005.3060 (``Offset Rule''). These rules incorporate
appendix S to 40 CFR part 51 into these State rules, modified in response to recommendations by USEPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 173 of the Act identifies four essential requirements that State new source permit regulations must impose
in nonattainment areas: (1) New source emissions must be offset by equivalent or greater emission reductions in the
area, (2) the new source must have lowest achievable emission rates (LAER), (3) other sources owned by the owner or
operator of the new source must be in compliance or on a schedule to achieve compliance with applicable regulations,
and (4) the area must not be subject to a finding of failure to implement the SIP.

Incorporation of Appendix S 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, adoption of appendix S of 40 CFR part 51 into the State's regulations serves to impose the requirements
identified in section 173. Part IV. A. of appendix S provides multiple conditions for granting a permit, including
a requirement for lowest achievable emission rates (requirement 2 above), a requirement for compliance of commonly
owned sources (requirement 3 above), and a requirement for offsets (requirement 1 above). Although appendix S contains
no provision prohibiting permits in ``failure to implement'' areas, USEPA has adequate authority under section
113(a)(5) to take any necessary action to address permits that violate this prohibition.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nevertheless, the adoption of appendix S by reference as a State rule fails to satisfy permitting requirements under
subpart I of 40 CFR part 51. In particular, appendix S exempts certain source types and is insufficiently clear on some
issues. A letter from USEPA dated May 17, 1991, recommended the following modifications: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The requirement for LAER must apply to all new sources or modifications meeting the applicability requirements
of 40 CFR 51.165. Footnotes 4 and 5 must be deleted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Requirements for offsets must be clarified to ensure that offsets are based on actual emissions as defined in 40
CFR 51.165(a)(3). This clarification must also be made in Part IV, section C. Footnote number 7 must be deleted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Footnote 8, which provided an exemption from the requirement for net air quality benefit, must be deleted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Section B of Part IV, which exempts certain source types, must be deleted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Section C, paragraph 5, which allows ``banking'' of emissions offset credits, must either be deleted or supplemented
with approvable banking regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Minnesota has made each of these modifications to its rules. Most of these modifications were included in the rule
revisions submitted August 5, 1992. In addition, pursuant to communications from USEPA subsequent to the May 1991
letter, the State made further modifications, including deletion of the general provisions for banking.

Relationship to Subsequent Rule Revisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At present, the rules in the Minnesota SIP governing permit processing are the Consolidated Permit Rules adopted
by the State on July 24, 1984, and approved by USEPA on May 13, 1988 (53 FR 17033). The subject of today's rulemaking is
a supplemental rule known as the ``Offset Rule,'' which establishes the substantive requirements for new sources
in nonattainment areas. Minnesota then adopted significant revisions to its regulations on permit processing on
August 24, 1993, which it submitted for SIP rulemaking on November 23, 1993. The primary purposes of these regulations
were to satisfy requirements in Title V of the Clean Air Act for a State operating permit program and to amend the new
source permitting regulations to provide an integrated set of permitting regulations. In developing these regulations,
the State incorporated language intended to address various concerns USEPA had identified with respect to the prior
permitting rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's rulemaking does not address the approvability of the submittal of November 23, 1993. Nevertheless, this
latter submittal is germane to this rulemaking, insofar as these more recent revisions assure that certain potential
problems which could have arisen under the prior general permitting rules will not arise. It should be noted that the
November 1993 submittal does not amend the rules under consideration in this action, i.e. the ``Offset Rule'' submitted
by the State in August 1992 and amended in August 1993, but instead revises the general provisions in the Consolidated
Permit Rules concerning permit processing. The following paragraphs identify the issues that were of concern and
how the November 1993 submittal affects these issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first issue was provision in the prior general permitting regulations for expiration of permits, and a concern
that expiration of a permit could cause the construction permit conditions to expire. The State's general permitting
regulations now define ``Title I conditions'' to include conditions established to satisfy new source review requirements,
and state that ``[a]ny Title I condition shall remain in effect without regard to permit expiration or reissuance,
and shall be restated in the reissued permit.'' Therefore, USEPA believes that requirements imposed on sources during
new source review clearly do not expire as a result of permit expiration.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second issue of concern was the authority granted in State law for the State agency to grant variances, including
variances from Federal requirements. However, the revised general permitting regulations state that: (1) The State
agency ``shall not issue variances from any Federal requirement to obtain an air quality permit, unless explicitly
authorized to do so in writing by [USEPA],'' and (2) the State agency ``shall issue a permit *&blank;*&blank;* only
if [various conditions have been met including that] the permit does not reflect a variance from any federally enforceable
applicable requirement *&blank;*&blank;*.'' For purposes of this action, these provisions render the second issue
moot, insofar as the State agency no longer has the ability to grant variances from Federal requirements. Nevertheless,
it is appropriate to state that USEPA believes that the statutory provision for variances is not being approved and
that issuance of a variance from Federal requirements would be contrary to both State and Federal regulations and
would have no bearing on enforcement of the applicable requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third issue of concern was that public notice for new source review permits was provided for only in a Memorandum
of Understanding (MOU) containing several outdated references. The revised general permitting regulations provide
public notification procedures and a 30 day public comment period. Minnesota has clearly committed itself both in
the MOU and its regulations to continuing to provide for proper opportunity for public input into permitting decisions
in accordance with USEPA requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For all three of these issues, Minnesota has made clear through its revised general permitting regulations that the
SIP as revised by the rule under consideration in this action would satisfy Federal requirements. Therefore, USEPA
believes that the three issues discussed above are no longer impediments to today's proposed conclusion that Minnesota
has satisfied nonattainment area permitting requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fourth issue of concern was whether Minnesota had satisfied the requirement of 40 CFR 51.160(a) to assure that
new sources do not interfere with attainment or maintenance of the air quality standards. The general permitting
regulations in Minnesota's SIP require permits for facilities with emissions above 25 tons per year of any criteria
pollutant except lead, or with more than 1/2 ton of lead emissions per year. (At such a facility, any modification would
require a permit.) The recently submitted permitting rules raise some of these size cutoffs. In support of the raised
cutoffs, the State's recent submittal includes a modeling analysis to show that the revised size cutoffs do not interfere
with attainment or maintenance. A preliminary review indicates that this analysis adequately supports the size
cutoffs in the current SIP. Consequently, USEPA believes that the general permitting rules in the SIP as supplemented
by the Offset Rule satisfy 40 CFR 51.160(a). Nevertheless, USEPA is reserving judgment on the acceptability of the
recently raised size cutoffs, which will be addressed in the context of rulemaking on the more recent submittal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fifth issue of concern pertained to a provision in the State's Rule 7001.0150 authorizing the State not to enforce
``local laws, rules and plans.'' Although this provision clearly applies to local laws and not Federal laws, this
provision is arguably ambiguous as to whether the State is authorized not to enforce Federal as well as local rules
and plans. The recent rule revisions did not modify this provision. Nevertheless, the State's intent is presumably
that the regulations only authorize nonenforcement of relevant local laws, local rules, and local plans. USEPA is
expressly not proposing approval of any provision for State nonenforcement of Federal rules or Federal plans. USEPA
solicits public comment on this element of the proposed approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USEPA has reviewed whether the new requirements in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 have been satisfied. These
new requirements include an analysis of alternatives, and a requirement for submitting information to the RACT/BACT/LAER
Clearinghouse. The Amendments also introduce numerous new requirements that are not currently relevant to Minnesota,
in part because the State has no ozone nonattainment areas. The TSD provides a more detailed discussion of the new requirements
and how these requirements are addressed in Minnesota. The conclusion of this review is that Minnesota has satisfactorily
addressed these requirements as they currently apply in the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USEPA is currently developing a rule to implement the changes under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 in the new source
review provisions in Parts C and D of Title I of the Act. The Agency anticipates that the proposed rule will be published
for public comment in the spring or summer of 1994. If USEPA has not taken final action on Minnesota's new source review
submittal by that time, USEPA may generally refer to the proposed rule as guidance regarding the approvability of
the submittal. USEPA expects to take final action to promulgate a rule to implement the Parts C and D changes sometime
during 1994 or 1995. Upon promulgation of those regulations, USEPA will review new source review SIPs to determine
whether additional SIP revisions are necessary to satisfy the requirements of the rule.

 levels which exceed the standard in the area.'' On June 25, 1993 (at 58 FR 34397), USEPA proposed such a determination
of the insignificance of particulate matter precursors in Minnesota. If that proposed action is finalized, section
189(e) would no longer require new source review of major particulate matter precursor sources.

II. Proposed Rulemaking Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
USEPA believes that the regulations submitted by Minnesota on August 5, 1992, and August 26, 1993, satisfy the requirements
under Part D for a new source permitting program in nonattainment areas. Therefore, USEPA proposes to approve this
SIP revision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the rules in the SIP, permits for nonattainment area sources that satisfy the substantive requirements of the
Offset Rule (Rules 7005.3010 through 7005.3060) would be processed in accordance with permit processing provisions
in the Consolidated Permit Rules (Rules 7001.0010 through 7001.0210 and Rules 7001.1200 through 7001.1220). Rulemaking
of May 13, 1988 (53 FR 17033) approved the Consolidated Permit Rule as satisfying attainment area permitting requirements
but noted that nonattainment area permitting requirements were not met. Today's action proposes to lift the current
ban on construction of major new sources and major modifications in Minnesota nonattainment areas, and would impose
Minnesota's Consolidated Permit Rule and Offset Rule as Federally enforceable requirements for such new sources
and modifications. Subsequent rulemaking will address the approvability of more recent revisions to State permitting
regulations.

The rules submitted by Minnesota were intended to address nonattainment area new source review requirements and
did not address visibility-related permitting requirements specified in 40 CFR 51.307. Therefore, USEPA is retaining
the provisions of 40 CFR 52.1236, which note the absence of approvable State regulations for visibility protection
and impose the Federally promulgated regulations of 40 CFR 52.26 and 52.28.

Public comment is solicited on all elements of USEPA's proposed rulemaking action. Written comments received by
[Insert date 30 days from date of publication] will be considered in the development of USEPA's final rulemaking action.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq., USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis
assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604.) Alternatively, USEPA
may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities
include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations
of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Act forbids USEPA to base
its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Orange Sol, Inc., 955 N. Fiesta Blvd., Ste. #1, Gilbert, AZ 85234, submitted pesticide petition (PP) number 3E4172,
requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C.
346a(e), amend 40 CFR 180.1001(c) by establishing an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of
d-limonene (CAS Registry No. 5989-27-5) when used as an inert ingredient (solvent, fragrance) in pesticide formulations
applied to growing crops or to raw agricultural commodities after harvest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but
are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own):
solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers
such as clay and diatomacous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading,
and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term ``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient
may or may not be chemically active.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. As part of the EPA policy statement
on inert ingredients published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 22, 1987 (52 FR 13305), the Agency set forth a list of studies which would generally be used to evaluate the risks
posed by the presence of an inert ingredient in a pesticide formulation. Where it can be determined that the inert ingredient
will present minimal or no risk, the Agency generally does not need some or all of the listed studies to rule on the proposed
tolerance or exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for an inert ingredient. The Agency has decided that any
data, in addition to that described below, for d-limonene will not need to be submitted. The rationale for this decision
is described below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. d-Limonene is a naturally occurring chemical found in high concentrations in citrus fruits and spices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. d-Limonene is widely used as a fragrance in products such as perfumes and soaps.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The probable lethal dose of 3-limonene is estimated at 1 pint.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. d-Limonene has been administered orally to successfully dissolve gall stones with no toxic effects observed after
ingesting 1 fluid ounce.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. A battery of mutagenicity tests conducted on d-limonene resulted in no positive effects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. A teratogenicity study in which pregnant rats were fed d-limonene (20 grams per kilogram) during gestation days
6 to 15 yielded results ``not considered teratogenic.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. In a 2-year feeding study conducted by the National Toxicology Program, no carcinogenic activity was noted in female
rats and mice and in male mice. Clear evidence of kidney-associated carcinogenic activity was noted in male rats.
However, the NTP has concluded that the male rat kidney carcinogenicity is not predictive of mammalian carcinogenicity.
Also, the Agency's position regarding compounds producing renal tubule tumors in male rats attributable solely
to chemically induced alpha-2u-globuylin accumulation is that these tumors will not be used for human cancer hazard
identification and that the associated nephropathy is not an appropriate endpoint for determining noncancer risks
in humans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. d-,l-, and dl-Limone are generally regarded as safe by the Food and Drug Administration when used as direct food
additives (synthetic flavoring substance, adjuvant) under 21 CFR 182.60. The results of the NTP Bioassay did not
change its GRAS status.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the above information and review of its use, EPA has found that, when used in accordance with good agricultural
practice, this ingredient is useful and a tolerance is not necessary to protect the public health. Therefore, EPA
proposes that the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance be established as set forth below. Because of the low
toxicity of this chemical, the Agency will consider expanding this exemption to include additional uses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, as amended, which contains this chemical may request, within 30 days after publication

, that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation
indicating the document control number, [OPP-300320]. All written comments filed in response to this document will

The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 2 of Executive Order 12866.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164; 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) is today proposing to amend &sect;266.20, which contains provisions
for conditionally exempting hazardous waste-derived products used in a manner constituting disposal (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, applied to or placed on land) from the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Subtitle C regulations. Specifically,
the Agency is proposing to amend &sect;266.20 so that non-encapsulated uses of slag residues produced from high temperature
metal recovery (HTMR) treatment of electric arc furnace dust (EPA Hazardous Waste No. K061), steel finishing pickle
liquor (K062), and electroplating sludges (F006) are not exempt from RCRA Subtitle C regulations. This action is
being taken to partially implement a settlement agreement entered into by the Agency on August 13, 1993 with the Natural
Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and Hazardous Waste Treatment Council (HWTC). If today's proposed rule is finalized,
non-encapsulated uses of HTMR slags derived from K061, K062, and F006, as waste-derived products placed on the land,
will be prohibited unless there is compliance with all Subtitle C standards applicable to land disposal. This rule
would not prohibit encapsulated uses of wastes that meet &sect;266.20 requirements. The rule also would not prevent
the disposal of HTMR slags in a Subtitle D unit if the residuals can meet the risk-based exclusion levels specified
in &sect;261.3(c)(2). The Agency is currently assessing and also seeks comments on whether the necessary data are
available to establish risk-based generic exclusion levels for HTMR slags used in non-encapsulated manner.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Existing Regulations for Hazardous Wastes Used in a Manner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Constituting Disposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, hazardous wastes that are used in a manner constituting disposal (applied to or placed on land), as well
as waste-derived products that are produced in whole or in part from hazardous wastes and used in a manner constituting
disposal, are not subject to hazardous waste disposal regulations provided the products produced meet two conditions.
First, the hazardous wastes must undergo a chemical reaction in the course of becoming products so as to be inseparable
by physical means (see &sect;266.20(b)). A second condition for exemption is that the waste-derived products must
meet best demonstrated available technology (BDAT) treatment standards under the land disposal restrictions program
for every prohibited hazardous waste that they contain before they are placed on land (see &sect;266.20(b)). Note
that hazardous waste-derived fertilizers that utilize hazardous waste K061 as a source of zinc are exempt from regulation
without complying with either of these two conditions (see also &sect;266.20(b)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exemption in &sect;266.20 is used for residuals (``slag'') generated from the treatment of hazardous waste K061
(and, to a limited extent, F006) using high temperature metal recovery (HTMR) processes. Section 266.20 is applicable
because the majority of this slag is used in highway construction materials (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, as road-base), and a limited amount is also used by directly applying it to road surfaces (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, as an anti-skid or deicing agent). (See 56 FR 15020, April 12, 1991.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 18, 1992 (see 57 FR 37194), the Agency finalized a generic exclusion for nonwastewater slag residues generated
from the HTMR treatment of several metal-bearing hazardous wastes (K061, K062, and F006). This rule expanded a generic
exclusion EPA originally published that applied only to HTMR slag from K061 (see 56 FR 41164, August 19, 1991) to include
slags from F006 and K062. These HTMR slag residues (i.e., from K061, K062, and F006) are currently excluded from the
hazardous waste regulations provided they meet designated concentration levels for 13 metals, are disposed of in
subtitle D units, and exhibit no characteristics of hazardous waste (see &sect;261.3(c)(2)).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The generic exclusion levels for the metals were based on the use of the EPA Composite Model for Landfills (EPACML),
which predicts the potential for groundwater contamination from wastes that are placed in a landfill. The Agency
limited the generic exclusion to residues disposed of in a Subtitle D unit because it could not properly evaluate concerns
over potential releases to other media resulting from uses of the HTMR slag as product, especially as an anti-skid
material on road surfaces. In the original rule proposing the generic exclusion for K061 HTMR slag (see 56 FR 15020,
April 12, 1991), the Agency solicited comment to identify other significant routes of exposure for product uses of
the slag. The rule specifically sought suggestions for methods to evaluate exposures from the use of the slag as anti-skid
material. Although EPA received comments concerning possible risks from road uses, no useful data, methods, or models
were submitted to assist the Agency in evaluating exposures from releases to media other than groundwater. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As the Agency noted in the final rule for the initial generic exclusion for K061 residues (see 56 FR 41164, August 19,
1991), the use of HTMR residues as anti-skid material was not prohibited, provided the residue meets the exemption
conditions given in &sect;266.20. The Agency also noted in the same notice that it would further evaluate the uses
of K061 HTMR residues that constitute disposal, and would consider amendments to &sect;266.20 for HTMR slags that
might require further controls on such uses.

B. Summary of Petition and Settlement Agreement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and the Hazardous Waste Treatment Council (HWTC), collectively ``NRDC
Petitioners'', filed a petition for review challenging EPA's decision not to apply ``generic exclusion levels''_levels
at which K061 slags are deemed nonhazardous_to K061 slags used as waste-derived ``products'' and applied to or placed
on land. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The generic exclusion levels established for some metals in the K061 HTMR slags are lower than the BDAT standards that
apply to K061. Therefore, while the generic exclusion requires that the nonhazardous K061 slag that meets exclusion
levels be disposed of in a Subtitle D unit, K061 HTMR slag that may exhibit metal levels above the exclusion levels (but
below BDAT) may be used as a product in a manner constituting disposal under the exemption in &sect;266.20(b). The
petitioners pointed out the anomaly of the slag used in an uncontrolled manner being effectively subject to lesser
standards than slag disposed in a controlled landfill. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 13, 1993, EPA entered into a settlement agreement with NRDC Petitioners which would address their concerns
through two separate notice-and-comment rulemakings. EPA agreed to propose the first rule within 6 months of the
settlement date (and issue a final rule within 12 months) to either establish generic exclusion levels for ``non-encapsulated''
uses of K061 slags, or effectively prohibit such uses of K061 slags on the land. EPA also agreed to propose a second rule
within 16 months of the settlement date (and issue a final rule within 28 months), to establish generic exclusion levels
for encapsulated uses of K061 slags on the land. The agreement specified that the generic exclusion levels for K061
slags will be based on an evaluation of the potential risks to human health and the environment from the use of K061 slags
as waste-derived products, taking into account all relevant pathways of exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Proposed Decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule proposes to prohibit non-encapsulated uses of products derived from hazardous HTMR slags (K061, K062,
and F006), if these products are used in a manner constituting disposal. The term ``non-encapsulated'' use is being
defined in this rule as a use in which: the material is not contained, controlled, covered, or capped in a manner that
eliminates or significantly reduces its mobility and potential for release into the environment. The uses of HTMR
residues on roads as anti-skid or deicing materials are considered to be non-encapsulated product uses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Agency is proposing to amend the existing regulations under &sect;266.20 that conditionally exempt
hazardous waste-derived products used in a manner constituting disposal from RCRA Subtitle C regulations to reflect
this change. The language of &sect;266.20 would be revised to prohibit non-encapsulated uses of products derived
from hazardous HTMR slags, unless they comply with all of the applicable Subtitle C standards (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, permitting, minimum technology standards for land disposal units, financial responsibility, etc.). Since these
requirements cannot realistically be met by entities that would use the HTMR slag in a non-encapsulated fashion (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, entities are unlikely to seek land disposal permits for the placement of deicing materials on roads), the Agency
is effectively proposing to prohibit non-encapsulated uses of the slags.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency is proposing this action for the following reasons. First, non-encapsulated uses of HTMR slags may pose
potential risk to human health and the environment, and this risk may be greater for non-encapsulated uses than for
any other disposition of the slags. This is because the slags contain significant total concentrations of toxic metals
of concern. For example, the concentrations of lead in the slags are typically in the range of 1000&hyph;2000 parts
per million (ppm) and concentrations of chromium can approach 1000 ppm. (See data from the BDAT Background Document
for K061 slag in the RCRA public docket for today's rule.) These slags may also potentially leach metals at levels that
would require regulation under subtitle C (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at levels greater than the generic exclusion levels in &sect;261.3(c)(2)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, non-encapsulated uses of the slags may be viewed as uncontrolled disposition of the material. Thus, this
may lead to many potential exposure pathways for the waste, not just those the Agency previously evaluated in assessing
this wastes' hazardousness. The major non-encapsulated use of K061 slag is as an anti-skid material on road surfaces.
This involves spreading the material on road surfaces during icy or snowy conditions to provide traction for vehicles
(see comments from Horsehead Resource Development Company on April 12, 1991 proposal). Although the K061-derived
slag as applied to the road surface is initially relatively coarse, the wear caused by vehicular traffic will break
down the slag into finer particles. These particles may then be dispersed through particulate releases to the air,
or to surface and ground water by run-off during precipitation or melting ice/snow. Some commenters were concerned
about potential exposure to metals in the K061 slag through inhalation of air releases and ingestion of nearby contaminated
soils, concerns the Agency shares. Without a more detailed assessment of the risks posed by such non-encapsulated
uses, the Agency believes it is appropriate to prohibit these uses at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, these potential risks are ones that are very difficult for the Agency to evaluate with certainty with available
methodology, particularly given the current lack of data the Agency has on non-encapsulated uses of the slags and
the tight timeframe for this rule. Because of this, some of the potential exposure pathways, such as ingestion, inhalation
or surface water runoff pathways, cannot be readily evaluated. Additionally, commenters to the August 19, 1991 rulemaking
did not provide any reliable means for assessing the risks posed by non-encapsulated uses of these slags. (See 56 FR
41172.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is again soliciting information that may be used to estimate potential risks for non-encapsulated uses
of HTMR slag and the likely exposure pathways of greatest concern. When used as an anti-skid agent, HTMR materials
could accumulate on the road surface and travel to nearby receptors. Particulates could be inhaled by people downwind
or transported in the air and deposited on land or water bodies. Storms can also wash HTMR materials to the roadside.
At the edge of the road, constituents in the slags could either travel overland to water bodies or percolate into the
ground and reach the groundwater. Ingestion of contaminated soil could occur either from the deposition of HTMR slag
particulates or from highway run-off. The Agency requests comment on other potentially significant exposure pathways.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although there are techniques that may be used to estimate pollutant loadings from roads, these techniques would
have to be tailored to the characteristics of non-encapsulated uses of HTMR slags. The following paragraphs describe
potential approaches to estimate the risks from these pathways and the data or assumptions necessary to construct
estimates of potential risks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Airborne Particulates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With the appropriate data, the Agency believes it is possible to estimate the rate at which particulates become airborne
from road surfaces. Critical parameters include the traffic volume, the mean vehicle speed, the type of road surface
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 unpaved or paved), particle density, and particulate size. The Agency believes that HTMR slags are most likely to
be applied as an anti-skid agent on paved roads. Many State transportation departments have traffic volume estimates
for most significant roads in their jurisdiction which could be used to estimate particulate generation rates. The
Agency does not have adequate data regarding the distribution of particle size in HTMR anti-skid material or how that
distribution could change after weathering and vehicular traffic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another critical parameter is the frequency at which HTMR slags would be applied to roads as a de-icing agent. The Agency
does not have direct measurements of application rates of HTMR materials as de-icing agents. In 1981, the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA) reported that application rates of de-icing salt ranged from 400 to 1200 pounds per
mile of two-lane road. The Agency requests comment on whether HTMR materials would be applied at rates comparable
to that of de-icing salt or other compounds.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Modeling pollutants in run-off from road surfaces requires estimating rainfall and run-off rates, accumulation
rates of pollutants on the road surface, pollutant wash-off during run-off, and constituent loading at potential
receptors. While the Agency often relies on standard techniques to predict rainfall and run-off (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 see docket for approach used to estimate soil run-off in USDA Handbook, No. 282, 1978), accumulation of HTMR slags
will depend on the application rates. The FHWA has also developed an approach that relates pollutant accumulation
with traffic volume. Combining the FHWA techniques and the loading rates discussed above would yield an estimate
of total accumulation of a constituent on a road surface. The FHWA also has estimated pollutant wash-off rates for
various types of road surfaces, including rural roads with flush, unpaved shoulders. The Agency requests comment
on this approach to estimate run-off rates and pollutant loadings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once run-off reaches the side of a road, it can either flow along natural contours or be channeled by engineering controls.
Many roads are constructed with catch basins, swales, or other structures designed to control water and sediment
flow. (See docket for examples from Chapter 11 in Highway Engineering, by Oglesby and Hicks, 1982.) Engineered barriers
may significantly retard or block the flow of constituents of concern from reaching receptors adjacent to the road
or from nearby water bodies. The Agency requests comment on the prevalence and effectiveness of these controls.

If HTMR Materials accumulate on a road surface, the paving will likely block any leaching of constituents from the
materials into the subsurface. However, if run-off transports the material off the road, constituents could leach
into the subsurface. The Agency requests comments on how to estimate the flux rate of metals from the HTMR slag into
the subsurface. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency would need adequate estimates of the above key parameters (particulate generation, run-off, and leaching
rate), in order to apply fate and transport models to estimate potential concentrations at receptors. EPA also has
limited information as to where HTMR residuals are applied as an anti-skid agent, and what potential receptors could
be exposed. Further, were the Agency to develop generic exclusion levels for non-encapsulated uses, EPA would need
to ensure that these levels would be protective in a wide range of potential settings. Therefore, the Agency requests
data on likely receptor points (e.g., water bodies, residences) that would be affected by non-encapsulated uses
of HTMR slag, and what, if any, exposure assumptions the Agency could use to ensure an appropriate level of protection.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency's present evaluation is that non-encapsulated uses of the slags may pose potential risks to human health
and the environment that may warrant control, and that the Agency lacks the necessary information and time for assuring
that these non-encapsulated uses are safe. If the Agency were to receive sufficient data that would allow EPA to carry
out a more complete evaluation of non-encapsulated uses, EPA will reconsider its present decision to effectively
prohibit non-encapsulated uses of HTMR slag. However, EPA does not anticipate being able to complete the evaluation
of any new data and assess the risks posed by non-encapsulated uses until the second rulemaking that EPA agreed to conduct
as part of the settlement with the NRDC petitioners (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the rule to establish generic exclusion levels for encapsulated uses of HTMR slags). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency also considered another important factor in making the determination to effectively prohibit non-encapsulated
uses of HTMR slags. Information available to EPA indicates that most HTMR slags are in fact used in an encapsulated
manner, for example as road-base material with some form of cover or ``cap''. Encapsulation may prevent dispersal
of the slag through the exposure pathways noted above. Indeed, as the Agency noted in the August 19, 1991 rulemaking,
use of these slags as road-base may be analogous to a capped disposal unit. (See 56 FR 41172.) In meetings with EPA, industry
representatives indicated that non-encapsulated uses account for a relatively small fraction (less than 15%) of
the HTMR slag used in a manner constituting disposal. (See memorandum of a March 30, 1993 meeting with Horsehead Resource
Development Co., Inc. in the RCRA public docket for today's rule.) Therefore, the Agency believes that there should
be adequate capacity for all of the slag to be used in an encapsulated manner. An important part of the basis for today's
proposal is the expectation that a prohibition on non-encapsulated uses would result in a more environmentally acceptable
means of reuse of the material without significant dislocations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal would thus effectively prohibit non-encapsulated uses of HTMR slag, whether or not the slag meets the
existing exclusion levels in &sect;261.3(c)(2). As noted earlier in this proposal, the methodology EPA used to set
the generic exclusion levels was based on potential risks posed by releases to ground-water from HTMR slag in a landfill
setting. The existing exclusion levels do not consider other possible exposures (e.g., through air releases) arising
from non-encapsulated uses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is consequently proposing to amend &sect;266.20 such that non-encapsulated uses of HTMR slag are no longer exempt
from the Subtitle C standards applicable to land disposal. The Agency expects that this will have the effect of essentially
prohibiting non-encapsulated uses of HTMR slags derived from K061, K062, and F006. With this proposal, the Agency
solicits comment on possible means of demonstrating when these non-encapsulated uses do not pose significant potential
risks to human health and the environment. In order to support such a demonstration, the Agency solicits comments
on possible generic exclusion levels for HTMR slags used in non-encapsulated manners, and on the basis for setting
these exclusion levels. The Agency will consider such comments in the context of the later rulemaking (which EPA also
agreed to conduct as part of the settlement with the NRDC petitioners) to establish generic exclusion levels for encapsulated
uses of HTMR slags.

EPA is also taking the opportunity in this proposal to solicit all available information on product uses of HTMR slag

volumes of these slags going to each use?

IV. Limited Effect of Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment to &sect;266.20 would effectively prohibit non-encapsulated uses of HTMR slags derived
from K061, K062, and F006. Although BDAT standards provide some measure of safety, it is the Agency's intent to further
evaluate these uses based on risks posed to human health and the environment and to determine if additional generic
exclusion levels should be proposed in the near future. As discussed above, information provided by representatives
of the major generator of HTMR slag indicates that the portion of HTMR slags that are currently being processed for
non-encapsulated product uses is relatively small (less than 15% of the HTMR slags that are used as waste-derived
products). Following the prohibition, this portion of HTMR slags may be used to produce other waste-derived products
that are still exempt under &sect;266.20(b). These other uses (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, use as road-base material) are encapsulated uses that appear to present much lower risk to human health and the environment.
There also exists a generic exclusion under &sect;261.3(c)(2) that allows for the disposal of HTMR slags in subtitle
D units. Finally, if it is not possible to meet the conditions of the exemption or the generic exclusion, the HTMR slags
would be subject to full regulation as hazardous wastes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is not changing the notification, record-keeping and reporting requirements contained in existing regulations
for hazardous waste being used to produce products used in a manner constituting disposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

V. Effective Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency is proposing that this rule be effective six months after the date of publication of the final rule. (See
RCRA section 3010(a)). The Agency believes that this would provide sufficient time for affected parties to comply
with the proposed change.

A. Applicability of Rule in Authorized States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 3006 of RCRA, EPA may authorize qualified States to administer and enforce the RCRA program within the
State. Following authorization, EPA retains enforcement authority under sections 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA,
although authorized States have primary enforcement responsibility. The standards and requirements for authorization
are found in 40 CFR part 271. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, a State with final authorization administered its
hazardous waste program in lieu of EPA administering the Federal program in that State. The Federal requirements
no longer applied in the authorized State, and EPA could not issue permits for any facilities that the State was authorized
to permit. When new, more stringent Federal requirements were promulgated or enacted, the State was obliged to enact
equivalent authority within specified time frames. New Federal requirements did not take effect in an authorized
State until the State adopted the requirements as State law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast, under RCRA section 3006(g), new requirements and prohibitions imposed by HSWA take effect in authorized
States at the same time that they take effect in nonauthorized States. EPA is directed to carry out these requirements
and prohibitions in authorized States, including the issuance of permits, until the State is granted authorization
to do so. While States must still adopt HSWA-related provisions as State law to retain final authorization, HSWA applies
in authorized States in the interim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Effect on State Authorization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA views today's proposed rule as a HSWA regulation. The proposed rule can be viewed as part of the process of establishing
land disposal prohibitions and treatment standards for K061, K062, and F006 hazardous wastes. (See 56 FR 41175).
The ultimate goal of the land disposal prohibition provisions is to establish standards, ``if any'', which minimize
short-term and long-term threats to human health and the environment posed by hazardous waste land disposal. (See
RCRA section 3004(m)(1)). In this case, the Agency is uncertain what level of treatment would assure that these threats
are minimized when HTMR slag is used in a non-encapsulated manner, and consequently is effectively proposing a prohibition
on this type of use. (See 57 FR at 37237, August 18, 1992, interpreting ``if any'' clause in section 3004(m)(1)). Thus,
as noted above, EPA will implement today's rule, if finalized, in authorized States until their programs are modified
to adopt the new prohibition and the modification is approved by EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's proposed rule will result in more stringent Federal standards. Section 271.21(e)(2) requires that States
that have final authorization must modify their programs to reflect Federal program changes and must subsequently
submit the modifications to EPA for approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States with authorized RCRA programs may already have requirements similar to those in today's proposed rule. These
State regulations have not been assessed against the Federal regulations being proposed today to determine whether
they meet the tests for authorization. Thus, a State is not authorized to implement these requirements in lieu of EPA
until the State program modifications are approved. Of course, States with existing standards could continue to
administer and enforce their standards as a matter of State law. In implementing the Federal program, EPA will work
with States under agreements to minimize duplication of efforts. In many cases, EPA will be able to defer to the States
in their efforts to implement their programs rather than take separate actions under Federal authority.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (see 58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), EPA must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The order defines
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory
action'' because it raises novel policy issues in terms of defining when products used in a manner constituting disposal
should be regulated. As such, this action was submitted to OMB for review. Changes made in response to OMB suggestions
or recommendations will be documented in the public record.

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., whenever an Agency is required to issue a general notice
of rulemaking for any proposed or final rule, it must prepare and make available for public comment a regulatory flexibility
analysis that describes the impact of the rule on small entities (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions). No regulatory flexibility analysis
is required, however, if the head of the Agency certifies that the rule will not have any impact on any small entities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This amendment will not have any impact on any small entities, since the regulated community will continue to have
other readily available options for using and managing HTMR slags. Therefore, pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, the Administrator certifies that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on
a substantial number of small entities. This regulation, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This document invites written comments on a proposed amendment to the Federal Property Management Regulations (FPMR)
that removes Federal Supply Service (FSS) schedule ordering instructions. FSS schedule ordering instructions
will be restated in the form of non-regulatory principles. GSA's Federal Supply Service will issue and maintain these
non-regulatory principles in the Federal Supply Service Program Guide. This document is issued simultaneously
with another notice that similarly affects multiple award schedule ordering instructions contained in the Federal
Information Resources Management Regulations (FIRMR).

When combined, these actions will result in uniform set of principles that empower Federal agencies to make ``best
value'' buying decisions in a de-monopolized environment. These proposed changes are consistent with the Report
of the National Performance Review (NPR), and are part of GSA's larger plans to create a Government that works better
and costs less.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
FPMR subpart 101&hyph;26.4 primarily contains FSS schedule ordering instructions. Over time, these instructions
have become obsolete. Hence, it is no longer necessary to retain these instructions in the FPMR. Removing these instructions
from FPMR subpart 101&hyph;26.4 will carry out the principles of the NPR Report by unburdening all Federal agencies
from unnecessary regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A small amount of the information previously contained in subpart 101&hyph;26.4 will be retained and relocated in
the FPMR: Text permitting the procurement of printing of Standard Form 149 by GSA; text permitting certain fixed-price
contractors and lower tier subcontractors to purchase security equipment from GSA sources; and text explaining
why GSA supply distribution facilities make multiple award schedule purchases.

GSA supply distribution facilities are responsible for quickly and economically providing Government customers
with frequently needed common-use items. Stocking a variety of commercial, high-demand items purchased from FSS
multiple award schedules is an important way in which GSA supply distribution facilities meet this responsibility.

Federal agencies and other activities authorized to purchase security equipment through GSA sources shall do so
in accordance with provisions of this &sect;101&hyph;26.507. Under section 201 of the Federal Property and Administrative
Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 481), the Administrator of GSA has determined that fixed-price contractors and lower
tier subcontractors who are required to protect and maintain custody of security classified records and information
may purchase security equipment from GSA sources. Delivery orders for security equipment submitted by such contractors
and lower tier subcontractors shall contain a statement that the security equipment is needed for housing Government
security classified information and that the purchase of such equipment is required to comply with the security provision
of a Government contract. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of the delivery order
and those of the Federal Supply Schedule contract, the latter shall govern. Security equipment shall be used as prescribed
by the cognizant security office.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice invites written comments on a proposed rule to remove provisions for using GSA nonmandatory multiple
award schedule (MAS) contracts from the Federal Information Resources Management Regulation (FIRMR). These instructions
will be issued in the form of non-regulatory principles. Other notices will similarly affect MAS ordering instructions
contained in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Federal Property Management Regulations (FPMR). The
non-regulatory principles will be issued and maintained by GSA's Federal Supply Service (FSS) and Information Resources
Management Service (IRMS) in the Federal Supply Service Program Guide, and the FIRMR Bulletin series respectively,
or by other similar Service issuance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When combined, the proposed regulatory changes will result in a uniform set of principles that empower Federal agencies
to make ``best value'' buying decisions in a demonopolized environment. The regulatory changes described are consistent
with the Report of the National Performance Review and are one part of GSA's larger plan to create a Government that
works better and costs less.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) GSA initiated a MAS Improvement Project in October 1990. In addition to addressing recurring issues of concern
to GSA customer agencies and MAS contractors, one major objective consistent with those concerns was to streamline
and unify the procedures for ordering products and services provided under the MAS program. GSA's internal perspectives,
the rapid emergence of electronic commerce, the recommendations of the General Accounting Office, and the recommendations
of the National Performance Review were all considered. The choices for restructuring GSA procedures offer stark
contrast: the imposition of a rigid, decision making regimen or the adoption of a more flexible set of principles which
empower purchasing agents and line managers to make `'best value'' decision in a de-monopolized environment. GSA's
own views, since the inception of the project, have been aligned with the adoption of a more customer-oriented, unregulated,
less paperbound approach, that also enables ordering officials to take advantage of effective competition within
the scope of the MAS contracting system as well as developing electronic ordering capabilities. Unlike open market
purchases, GSA schedule prices are the product of a competitive environment where GSA negotiates or otherwise obtains
prices determined to be fair and reasonable. Further, the nature of the MAS system is to recognize the variation of
functions, quality, and performance inherent in a wide variety of commercial products. In recognition of the foregoing,
and in an attempt to recognize the good judgment of our customers, GSA should provide its customers with flexible ordering
mechanisms which emulate commercial purchasing practices. Existing ordering rules should be streamlined and stated
in the form of principles.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Services Administration (GSA) plans to deregulate, streamline and unify its multiple award schedule
(MAS) ordering procedures. GSA establishes MAS contracts to provide Federal agencies a cost-effective mechanism
for ordering common use commercial items. Two GSA organizations award and manage MAS contracts, the Federal Supply
Service (FSS) and the Information Resources Management Service (IRMS). Three different regulations contain MAS
ordering procedures; i.e., the Federal Property Management Regulation (FPMR), the Federal Information Resources
Management Regulation (FIRMR), and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This document invites public comment on proposals to eliminate MAS ordering instructions to customer agencies from
the FPMR and FIRMR. Applicable regulations, however, will retain pertinent solicitation provisions, contract
clauses, and those policies and procedures that govern the Government-contractor relationship. GSA has initiated
a case to make similar changes to the Federal Acquisition Regulation. In lieu of the current regulatory scheme, GSA
proposes to adopt a uniform set of non-regulatory principles for MAS ordering. FSS and IRMS will issue and maintain
the principles in the FSS Program Guide and FIRMR Bulletin series, respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This document also invites public comment on a proposal to revise the Price Reduction Clause currently used in MAS
contracts and include it in the General Services Administration Acquisition Regulation (GSAR). Additionally,
GSA announces its decision to eliminate regulatorily prescribed mandatory use provisions from the MAS Program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When combined, the proposed changes described in this document will result in a uniform set of principles that empower
ordering activities to make ``best value'' buying decisions in a de-monopolized environment. The proposed changes
are consistent with the Report on the National Performance Review (NPR) and are one part of GSA's larger plan to help
create a Government that works better and costs less.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
GSA, the General Accounting Office (GAO) and the NPR have all recently examined MAS ordering procedures and recommended
improvements. Among other things, GAO found that Federal agencies do not consistently comply with existing regulations
and recommended that GSA clarify its requirements. The NPR generally recommended that GSA simplify its regulations
and eliminate complex administrative requirements. After reviewing the various recommendations, GSA decided
to eliminate regulatorily prescribed mandatory use provisions imposed on other agencies. Solicitations that have
a closing date after January 13, 1994, will reflect GSA's new position on non-mandatory use. Existing contractual
obligations will not be affected by the change. GSA also proposes to ``deregulate'' MAS ordering procedures and provide
agencies with non-regulatory guidance that is simpler, more customer-oriented, and less paperbound than current
requirements. These principles will enable ordering officials to take advantage of competition within the scope
of the MAS contracting system.

Description of Changes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
GSA proposes the following changes:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Most of the existing regulatory instructions regarding the use of MAS and single award Federal Supply Schedules
will be deleted from the FPMR and FIRMR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. GSA regulations will not require agencies to place orders against future MAS contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The current requirement that an ordering activity publicize in the Commerce Business Daily its intent to place
an order against an MAS contract for federal information processing (FIP) resources valued in excess of $50,000 will
be eliminated. This requirement is the product of regulation, (i.e., order synopsis not required by statute) for
MAS contracting, and is inconsistent with GSA's efforts to empower its customers, and streamline and maximize the
efficiency of the program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. GSA will not dictate an across-the-board Maximum Order Limitation (MOL) for MAS schedules. Instead, contracting
officers will establish MOL's on a schedule-by-schedule basis. Contracting officers will set MOL's at levels appropriate
for negotiation of volume purchasing prices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. GSA will generally award MAS contracts as indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity type contracts. Indefinite-delivery,
indefinite-quantity type MAS contracts will normally obligate the Government to purchase a minimum amount during
the contract term. Contractors must deliver up to the MOL for each delivery order they receive.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The clause entitled ``Price Reductions'' will be modified to delete paragraph (c), ``Price Reductions to Federal
Agencies''. The modified clause will be incorporated into the GSAR. Other MAS provisions and clauses will be amended
as necessary to reflect revised ordering procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. GSA will streamline existing ordering procedures and state them in the form of guiding principles. The resulting
non-regulatory guidance will read as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. GSA awards Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) contracts for a variety of commercial products and services at prices
determined to be fair and reasonable. The administrative cost of placing a MAS order can be significantly lower than
purchasing by other means. Accordingly, for orders of minimal dollar value (e.g., $10,000 or below) ordering activities
are given wide latitude to order items at those prices that represent the best value for the money.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. To reasonably ensure that a selection meets the agency's needs at the lowest overall cost before placing an MAS order
of significant dollar value (e.g., greater than $10,000) an ordering activity should:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Consider reasonably available information about products offered under MAS contracts; this standard is met
if the ordering activity does the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Consider products and prices contained in any GSA MAS automated information system; (e.g., Information Resources
Management_On-line Schedule System, Federal Supply Service_Automated Product Listing Service); or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If automated information is not available, review at least 3 price lists.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Make reasonable efforts to compare differing functions, performance characteristics and prices of MAS items.
The nature and degree of such comparisons should be commensurate with the value of the order. The agency's administrative
costs should be considered in making a best value determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Give preference to the items of small business and/or labor surplus area concerns by following the order of priority
in FAR 14.407&hyph;6 when two or more items at the same delivered price will meet an ordering activity's needs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. MAS contractors will not be required to pass on to all schedule users a price reduction extended only to an individual
agency for a specific order. There may be circumstances where an ordering activity finds it advantageous to request
a price reduction, such as where the ordering activity finds that a schedule product is available elsewhere at a lower
price, or where the quantity of an individual order clearly indicates the potential for obtaining a reduced price.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Ordering activities should document MAS ordering files in accordance with internal agency practices. Agencies
should keep documentation to a minimum.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would amend the General Services Administration Acquisition Regulation (GSAR) to prescribe
a Price Reductions clause for use in multiple award schedule (MAS) solicitations and contracts. The clause is a modification
of that currently in use. The modifications clarify the clause's applicability, reduce contractor reporting requirements
and eliminate MAS price reductions based on a low price to an individual Federal agency.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On June 14, 1993, GSA solicited comments (58 FR 32890) on proposed changes to the current MAS Price Reductions clause.
The proposed clause would have eliminated certain reporting requirements and increased the time given contractors
to notify the Government of price reductions. Public comments received generally supported the changes, but felt
that further changes should be made to reduce the burden on MAS contractors. To address these comments GSA proposes
to further revise the clause to require that the Government be extended price reductions under the same terms and with
the same effective dates which the contractor extends to commercial customers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The National Performance Review recommended that line managers be given greater flexibility to buy the same or comparable
MAS products for less. In order to remove any disincentive to MAS contractors offering agencies a lower price on individual
orders, GSA proposes to eliminate paragraph (c) of the current clause entitled ``Price Reductions to Federal Agencies.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
B. Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This rule was submitted to and approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in accordance with Executive Order
12866, Regulatory Planning and Review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
C. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
An initial regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared and submitted to the Acting Chief Counsel for Advocacy
of the Small Business Administration. Copies of the initial regulatory flexibility analysis are available from
the office identified above. The initial regulatory flexibility analysis indicates that the proposed rule will
affect contractors, including small businesses, that are awarded contracts under GSA's MAS program. Historically,
approximately seventy percent of MAS contractors have been small businesses. Based on the number of MAS contracts
currently in effect, it is estimated that 4,288 small businesses will be impacted by the new rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
D. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Price Reductions clause is an information collection subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and has been submitted to OMB for approval under the Act. Comments on the information collection requirements may
be submitted to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of OMB, Attention: Desk Officer for GSA, Washington,
DC 20503. The title of the information collection is ``GSAR 552.238&hyph;75 Price Reductions.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Price Reductions clause is intended to ensure that the Government maintains its price/discount (and/or term
and condition) advantage in relation to the contractor's commercial customer(s) upon which the MAS contract is predicated.
The customer or category of customer upon which the award is predicated is identified at the conclusion negotiations
and reflected in the MAS contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Price Reductions clause requires MAS contractors to notify the contracting officer of price reductions at the
same time that commercial customers are notified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Price Reductions clause is needed to assure that the Government maintains the relative discount position, negotiated
at the time of contract award, throughout the term of the contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The estimated annual burden for the Price Reductions clauses is 24,508 hours. This is based upon an estimated average
burden per response of 2 hours, a frequency of 2 responses per respondent, and an estimated number of likely respondents
of 6,127.

(a) Prior to the award of an MAS contract, the contracting officer and the offeror shall reach an agreement as to the
customer (or category of customer), price lists, and discounts which will serve as the basis of contract award. The
award document shall expressly state the price/discount relationship between the Government and the identified
commercial customer which is the basis of contract award. The Price Reductions clause is intended to maintain this
price/discount relationship (and/or term and condition) between the Government and the offeror's customer or category
of customer upon which the MAS contract was predicated, for the contract term.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) During the term of the contract any changes in discount/pricing practices by the contractor which result or will
result in a less advantageous relationship between the Government and the customer or category of customer upon which
the MAS contract discount/price was predicated, shall result in a price reduction to the Government to the extent
necessary to reflect the original relationship.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Section 552.238&hyph;76 is added to read as follows:

As prescribed in 538.203&hyph;71(e), insert the following clause:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 -->
Price Reductions (XXX 1994)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Before award of a contract, the Contracting Officer and the Offeror will agree upon (1) the customer (or category
of customers) which will be the basis of award, and (2) the Government's price or discount relationship to the identified
customer or category of customers. This relationship shall be maintained throughout the contract period. Any change
in the Contractor's commercial pricing arrangement applicable to the identified customer or category of customers,
which disturbs this relationship, will constitute a price reduction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) During the contract period, the Contractor shall report to the Contracting Officer all price reductions to the
Contractor's identified customer or category of customers upon which the contract award was predicated. The Contractor's
report shall include an explanation of the conditions under which the reductions were made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A price reduction shall apply to purchases under this contract if, after the date negotiations conclude, the Contractor:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Reduces prices (or grants any more favorable discounts, or terms and conditions) contained in the commercial
catalog, pricelist, schedule or other documents upon which contract award by the Government was predicated; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Grants special discounts to the identified customer or category of customers, upon which the contract award by
the Government was predicated, so as to disturb the discount/price relationship of the Government to the identified
customer or category of customers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The price reduction shall be offered to the Government with the same effective date, and for the same time period
as extended to the commercial customer or category of customers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The Contractor shall extend to the Government, any general price reductions (including temporary reductions)

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS issues this proposed rule to implement Amendment 6 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Summer Flounder Fishery
(FMP). This amendment would allow vessels with moratorium permits to carry on board nets other than the minimum mesh
size once the seasonal thresholds for summer flounder are retained, modify the schedule for establishing the annual
management measures, provide for an experimental fishery to gather data, prohibit the use of twisted mesh, prohibit
interference with any observers, and modify the dimensions of the fish box or tote. The intended effect of this rule
is to relieve the industry of a regulatory restriction, use the best available data to assess the fishery, establish
conformity with other regulations in the same fishing area, and protect observers.

Amendment 6 was prepared by the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (Council) in consultation with the Atlantic
States Marine Fisheries Commission and the New England and South Atlantic Fishery Management Councils. A notice
of availability for the proposed amendment was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 4, 1994 (59 FR 5384). Copies of the amendment are available from the Council upon request [see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES

]. The amendment revises management of the summer flounder (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Paralichthys dentatus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) fishery pursuant to the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, as amended (Magnuson Act).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The management unit continues to be summer flounder in U.S. waters in the western Atlantic Ocean from North Carolina
northward. The objectives of the FMP as it would be amended continue to be: (1) Reduce fishing mortality in the summer
flounder fishery to assure that overfishing does not occur; (2) reduce fishing mortality on immature summer flounder
to increase spawning stock biomass; (3) improve the yield from the fishery; (4) promote compatible management regulations
between state and Federal jurisdictions; (5) promote uniform and effective enforcement of regulations; and (6)
minimize regulations to achieve the management objectives stated above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendment 1 to the FMP added a definition of overfishing. Amendment 2, which contained the large majority of the management
measures implemented by the current regulations, is discussed below. Amendment 3 revised the boundary of the exemption
area in the Northeast and increased the minimum mesh threshold to 200 pounds during the winter fishery from November
1 to April 30. Amendment 4 modified the state-specific percentage shares that allocate the coastwide annual commercial
quota to the States. Amendment 5 empowered States to combine and transfer commercial quota with the approval of the
Director, Northeast Region, NMFS (Regional Director).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Amendment 2 to the FMP instituted a broad spectrum of measures to stop overfishing and to allow the stock to rebuild.
These measures are to be revised, if necessary, each year to meet a mortality reduction schedule. One of these measures
is a minimum mesh requirement in the cod end of an otter trawl net when certain amounts of summer flounder are retained
(i.e., 100 pounds or more from May through October and 200 pounds or more from November through April). Since the regulations
allow only nets that meet the minimum mesh size to be on board once the threshold amounts of summer flounder are retained,
vessel operators are faced with several choices. The vessel may sail with only nets that meet the minimum mesh requirement
and gamble on catching species of a certain size, including summer flounder, that are subject to capture with the minimum
mesh size. Vessel operators may put nets with different size mesh on board and fish for several species of fish, including
those subject to capture with small mesh, on the same trip. To conduct this mixed trawl fishery, vessel operators have
to discard any amount of summer flounder that would result in the retention of the threshold amounts triggering the
minimum mesh requirement. If a vessel operator pursuing a mixed trawl fishery wants to continue fishing for summer
flounder in excess of the threshold amounts, he/she has to return the vessel to port to offload all nets that do not meet
the minimum mesh requirement and return to the fishing grounds to resume fishing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certain industry members (industry) approached the Council and claimed that the one-mesh-on-board provision is
creating a hardship for those in the mixed trawl fishery without the concomitant benefits to those enforcing the minimum
mesh requirement. Industry made a convincing case that the minimum mesh requirement could easily be frustrated by
lining a legal size cod end with another legal size cod end, which could be located anywhere on deck, or by cinching off
the net above the portion of the net with regulated mesh. As an alternative, the industry proposed that the one-mesh
on-board provision be replaced with the net stowage provisions in the regulations governing the Northeast Multispecies
fishery, in which a number of summer flounder fishermen participate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council, after hearing industry testimony, reviewing public hearing comments, and engaging in discussion,
decided at its December meeting to adopt Amendment 6 and replace the one-mesh-on-board provision with the mesh stowage
provision of the Northeast Multispecies regulations. Amendment 6, if approved, would allow vessel operators to
carry several nets with different size mesh on board their vessels and exceed the minimum mesh seasonal thresholds,
as long as all nets that do not meet the minimum mesh requirement are appropriately stowed once the minimum mesh threshold
amounts of summer flounder are retained. Once stowed, these nets cannot be used for the remainder of the fishing trip.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A regulation that would allow the Regional Director to authorize an experimental fishery to collect management information
in certain circumstances was recommended by the Council for inclusion in this proposed rule to give effect to section
9.4.2 of the FMP regarding information and data needs. The Council is particularly interested in having additional
mesh studies conducted to augment the results of the mesh studies done in New York and New Jersey. However, the Council
was firm in its intent that no experimental fishery should result in a quota being exceeded. This restriction would
maintain the integrity of the mortality reduction schedule, the central feature of Amendment 2.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council also adopted for inclusion in this proposed rule a prohibition on the use of twisted mesh. Nets constructed
of twisted mesh, when towed, do not conform to the minimum mesh requirement and violate the prohibition found at 625.8(a)(6).
The addition of this prohibition would conform the summer flounder regulations with the Multispecies regulations.
Such conformity is desirable since multispecies and summer flounder can be caught on the same fishing trip. The Council
adopted another provision to modify the dimensions of the fish box or tote referred to in &sect;625.25(d), to conform
to those used in the Northeast Multispecies regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The prohibition found at &sect;625.8(c)(9) would be revised to prohibit interference with a sea sampler or observer
on board a vessel for any purpose, and not just for the activities under &sect;625.26 and &sect;625.27, as currently
expressed in this prohibition. Observers placed on board a vessel engaged in an experimental fishery should have
the same protection afforded to other observers and sea samplers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The annual fishing measures schedule found at &sect;625.20(c) would be modified by this proposed rule. The date on
which a certain measure is published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would be changed to a later time to allow for more current data to be included in the assessment and monitoring process.
The total allowable removals from the stock, translated into a coastwide commercial quota and a recreational harvest
limit, as well as additional measures for the commercial fishery must be published on or before October 15 of each year.
This is the latest date that these measures can be set and allow states an opportunity to implement them on January 1
of each year. Unlike the commercial fishery, which operates year round, the recreational fishery ceases from October
until May. Marine recreational survey data, which allow the recreational harvest limit to be converted into a possession
limit and a recreational fishing season, are not available until well after the October 15 date. Sometimes, these
data are not available until the beginning of the following year. Thus, the date on which additional measures for the
recreational fishery must be published would be changed to February 15 of each year.

Section 304(a)(1)(D)(ii) of the Magnuson Act requires the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) to publish regulations
proposed by a Council within 15 days of the receipt of the amendment and proposed regulations. At this time, the Secretary
has not determined that the amendment these rules would implement is consistent with the national standards, other
provisions of the Magnuson Act, and other applicable law. The Secretary, in making that determination, will take
into account the information, views, and comments received during the comment period.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the Small Business Administration that this proposed
rule, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities for the reasons
set forth in the regulatory impact review prepared by the Council, a copy of which may be obtained from the Council at
the address listed above. As a result, a regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared. The replacement of the
one-mesh-on-board restriction with the mesh stowage provision alleviates a regulatory burden on the industry,
enabling the industry to operate with greater economic efficiency. The amendment's conformance to the Northeast
Multispecies regulations will also standardize certain regulatory requirements imposed on the industry and can
be reviewed as relieving a restriction. Revising the schedule for publication of management measures will enable
the Council and ASMFC to use the best available data as the basis of their deliberations. This should aid in rebuilding
the stock for the benefit of industry. The experimental fishing provision should also aid in assessing the validity
of certain measures which, in turn, should assist in rebuilding the stock.

for immediate use any net, or any piece of net, not meeting the minimum mesh size requirement, or mesh that is rigged
in a manner that is inconsistent with the minimum mesh size. A net that conforms to one of the following specifications
and that can be shown not to have been in recent use is considered not to be ``available for immediate use'':

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Regional Director may not grant such exemption unless he/she determines that the purpose, design, and administration
of the exemption is consistent with the objectives of the FMP, the provisions of the Magnuson Act, and other applicable
law, and that granting the exemption will not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have a detrimental effect on the summer flounder resource and fishery; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Cause any quota to be exceeded; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) requires that each Regional Fishery Management
Council submit any FMP or FMP amendment it prepares to the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) for review and approval,
disapproval, or partial disapproval. The Magnuson Act also requires that the Secretary, upon receiving an FMP or
amendment, immediately publish a notice that the FMP or amendment is available for public review and comment. The
Secretary will consider the public comments received during the comment period in determining whether to approve
the FMP or amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Amendment 2 would establish the Norton Sound Section of the Northern District of the king crab fishery as a superexclusive
registration area. The operator of any vessel registered and participating in this fishery would not be able to register
that vessel and participate in other BSAI king crab fisheries. A proposed rule has been submitted that would remove
existing regulations, which supersede State of Alaska regulations that established Norton Sound as a superexclusive
registration area in the exclusive economic zone of the BSAI.
