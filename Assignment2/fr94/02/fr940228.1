SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) is proposing to establish a new testing service under the United States
Grain Standards Act (USGSA) for pesticide residues in wheat. The new service will be provided, upon request, using
gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The cost of the testing will be recovered by fees charged to the applicant.
Testing will be conducted at the USDA&hyph;FGIS Technical Center, Kansas City, Missouri.

The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.

Executive Order 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended
to have a retroactive effect. The United States Grain Standards Act provides in section 87g that no State or subdivision
may require or impose any requirements or restrictions concerning the inspection, weighing, or description of grain
under the USGSA. Otherwise, this proposed rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies
unless they present irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be
exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
David R. Galliart, Acting Administrator, FGIS, has determined that this proposed rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Most users of the official inspection and weighing services
and those persons who perform those services do not meet the requirements of small entities as defined in the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601

Information Collection Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35), the information collection requirements
contained in part 800 have been previously approved by OMB under control number 0580&hyph;0013.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the early 1980s, FGIS has provided official service under the Agricultural Marketing Act (AMA) to test grain
and processed grain products for the residue of three pesticides, carbon tetrachloride, methylbromide, and ethylene
dibromide. This service has been available upon request from FGIS' Commodity Testing Laboratory in Beltsville,
MD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FGIS is now proposing to expand its pesticide residue testing program to include testing wheat for 29 additional pesticides
under the authority of the United States Grain Standards Act. The service will be performed on a request basis; it will
not be required for either domestic or export shipments. All samples will be tested at the Kansas City Technical Center.
A minimum of 500 grams of wheat will be required for testing. The residues (routine compounds) that will be certified
are as follows: Aldrin, Azinphos-methyl, Alpha-BHC, Beta-BHC, Delta-BHC, Carbofuran, Chlorpyrifos, Chlorothalonil,
Chlorpyrifos Methyl, P.P'-DDD, P.P'-DDE, P.P'-DDT, Diclofop-methyl, Dieldrin, Dimethoate, Endosulfan, Endrin,
Esfenvalerate, Fenitrothion, Fenthion, Folpet, Lindane, Malathion, Methidathion, Methoxychlor, Parathion,
Parathion-methyl, Pirimiphos-methyl, and Triallate. These compounds will be analyzed by gas chromatography/mass
spectrometry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Laboratory analytical results will be provided to the applicant as soon as practicable. Generally the testing requires
a minimum of 48 hours.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed fees will be set forth in &sect;800.71(a), Schedule A. The proposed fee is $200 for each sample tested
during a regular workday and $300 for each sample tested during a non-regular workday. The proposed fees are intended
to cover, as nearly as practicable, the FGIS operating cost including related supervisory and administrative costs.
Testing for additional residues (special compounds) within FGIS capabilities may be requested at a proposed rate
of $100 per hour during a regular workday and $150 per hour during a nonregular workday. The testing fee does not include
charges for sampling. Sampling service fees, if required, will be assessed in accordance with the sampling rates
in &sect;800.71(a), Schedule A. Testing of other grains will be provided as a service at a later date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Major importers of U.S. wheat such as Japan, China, Mexico, and Korea have indicated a strong interest in having U.S.
grain tested for the presence of specific pesticide residues. FGIS is proposing to offer certification of these specific
pesticide residue levels for export and domestic wheat. The anticipated volume of requests for this service is 500
samples per year or 10 per week. This represents a generated income of approximately $100,000 per year which will cover
the costs of providing the service.

(order). The order regulates the handling of filberts/hazelnuts grown in Oregon and Washington. The purpose of the
hearing is to receive evidence on proposals to amend provisions of the order. The proposed amendments would make changes
in order provisions regarding: Volume control; nomination and membership of the Filbert/Hazelnut Marketing Board
(Board); collecting assessments; and the administration and operation of the program. The proposed amendments
were submitted by the Board, the agency responsible for local administration of the order, to make the order more consistent
with current industry conditions and needs. The Fruit and Vegetable Division, Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS),
proposes other conforming and necessary changes.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This administrative action is taken pursuant to the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' This action also is governed by the provisions of
&sect;&sect;556 and 557 of Title 5 of the United States Code and, therefore, is excluded from the requirements of Executive
Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et. seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) seeks to ensure that within the statutory authority of a program, the regulatory and informational requirements
are tailored to the size and nature of small business. Interested persons are invited to present evidence at the hearing
on the possible regulatory and informational impact of the proposals on small businesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments proposed herein have been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. They are not
intended to have retroactive effect. If adopted, the proposed amendments would not preempt any state or local laws,
regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his principal place of business, has
jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later
than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hearing is called pursuant to the provisions of the Act and the applicable rules of practice and procedure governing
the formulation of marketing agreements and orders (7 CFR Part 900). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board proposes several amendments to the order's volume control provisions. The Board recommends an amendment
that would expand the primary (domestic) market by adding Hawaii to the distribution area that currently is the continental
United States (including Alaska) (&sect;982.16). In addition, the Board proposes an amendment that would allow
the Board, with the approval of the Secretary of Agriculture, to make future changes in the primary market's distribution
area (&sect;982.16). The Board proposes another amendment designed to provide the Board with additional flexibility
to release up to 15 percent of the average volume acquired by the trade for the primary market for the preceding three
years' rather than the mandatory 15 percent release specified in the current order (&sect;982.40). The Board recommends
an amendment that would allow the Board to establish identification standards for inspected and certified lots of
hazelnuts rather than the current order requirement which specifies seals, stamps, tags or other identification
(&sect;982.46). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board recommends several proposed amendments regarding nomination and Board membership. The Board proposes
an amendment to change the length of the term of office to two years from the current one-year period with a corresponding
change limiting the consecutive terms to three two-year terms rather than the current six consecutive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one-year terms (&sect;982.33). A corresponding amendment would establish the qualifications for nominating handler
Board members based on the handlers' previous two years' volume handled rather than the previous one year volume handled,
as currently required (&sect;982.30). Similarly, the Board recommends a conforming change to the qualification
period for weighing handler votes to the previous two marketing years rather than the previous one year marketing
year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(&sect;982.32). The Board proposes that a change be made in the voting procedures when calculating handler voting
qualifications by changing the minimum weighted volume to one ton rather than the current one percent (&sect;982.32).
The Board also proposes that a clarification be added to voting procedures to make it clear that eligible handlers
vote for only one member and one alternate member (&sect;982.32).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board recommends several amendments to the administrative procedures and operations of the order's programs.
The Board recommends changing the name of the regulated product from ``filberts'' or ``filberts/hazelnuts'' to
the single name ``hazelnuts'' (&sect;982.4). Another amendment would allow telephone votes taken by the Board to
remain unconfirmed until the next Board meeting rather than being confirmed in writing by individual members immediately
after the vote (&sect;982.37). Also, the Board proposes an amendment to remove the requirement that ``verbatim''
reports be made of Board proceedings on marketing policy meetings (&sect;982.39). One amendment would remove an
incorrect word in the current order language which determines handler credit for ungraded product (&sect;982.51).
The Board has recommended an amendment which would provide that, when the Board establishes bonding rates for handlers
who temporarily defer meeting their restricted obligations, the Board would use the estimated value of restricted
credits rather than the estimated product value of a handler's deferred restricted obligation (&sect;982.54).
Further, the Board recommends that defaulted bond payments should be used by the Board to purchase excess restricted
credits from handlers rather than purchasing certified merchantable product which has already met restricted obligations
(&sect;982.54). Also, the Board recommends a corresponding change that such restricted credits should be used by
the handlers to liquidate their restricted obligation rather than be disposed of as restricted product (&sect;982.54).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board proposes two amendments to the assessment provision to allow the Board to accept advance assessment payments
(and provide discounts to those handlers who make advanced payments) and borrow money. Advance payments and borrowed
moneys would be used only for meeting administrative obligations before current year assessment payments are available
(&sect;982.61). The Board also proposes a new provision that would allow the Board to accept voluntary contributions
from willing individuals. Such contributions would be used only for production research, marketing research and
development, and marketing promotion, including paid advertising (new &sect;982.63). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Board proposes that a clarification be added to the exemption provision of the order to make it perfectly
clear that mail order sales to destinations outside the area of production are not exempt from order requirements
(&sect;982.57). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposals were submitted by the Board which works with the Department in administering the order. The Fruit
and Vegetable Division, AMS, proposes conforming changes to further clarify and assure consistency with existing
provisions of the order. The Board's proposed amendments have not received the approval of the Secretary of Agriculture.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public hearing is held for the purpose of: (1) Receiving evidence about the economic and marketing conditions
which relate to the proposed amendments of the order; (2) determining whether there is a need for the proposed amendments
to the order; and (3) determining whether the proposed amendments, or appropriate modifications thereof, will tend
to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On or before November 15, the Board shall meet to recommend to the Secretary the interim final and final free and restricted
percentages, including the portion of the restricted supply that may be shelled or exported. The interim final percentages
shall release 100 percent of the inshell trade demand previously computed by the Board for the marketing year. The
final free and restricted percentages may release up to an additional 15 percent of the average of the preceding three
years' trade acquisitions of inshell hazelnuts for desirable carryout. If the trade acquisitions during any or all
of these years were abnormal, the Board may use a prior year or years in determining this three-year average. The final
free and restricted percentages shall become effective 30 days prior to the end of the marketing year, or earlier as
may be recommended by the Board and approved by the Secretary. The recommendations to the Secretary shall include

shall deliver to the Board the certified merchantable restricted hazelnuts to be exported, but the Board shall be
obligated to sell in export only such quantities for which it may be able to find satisfactory export outlets. Any hazelnuts
so delivered for export which the Board is unable to export shall be returned to the handler delivering them. Sales
for export shall be made by the Board only on execution of an agreement to prevent reimportation into the area designated
in &sect;982.16. A handler may be permitted to act as an agent of the Board, upon such terms and conditions as the board
may specify, in negotiating export sales, and when so acting shall be entitled to receive a selling commission as authorized
by the Board. The proceeds of all export sales, after deducting all expenses actually and necessarily incurred, shall
be paid to the handler whose certified merchantable restricted hazelnuts are so sold by the Board.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend its regulations governing industrial radiography.
The proposed rule would include additional safety requirements to enhance the level of protection of radiographers
and the public and would clarify the regulations so that licensees may have a better understanding of what is expected
in radiographic operations. The proposed rule includes a number of updated radiography regulations that have been
adopted by the Agreement States. The major changes in the proposed rule include requirements for: (1) Two qualified
individuals to be present whenever radiography occurs at a temporary jobsite, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) mandatory certification of radiographers, (3) permanent radiographic installations, and (4) a radiation safety
officer. The format of the radiography regulations would be revised to place requirements into descriptive categories.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part 34 of Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations was first published in 1965 (30 FR 8192) as part of the recodification
of parts 30 and 31 for the purpose of simplifying and clarifying the format of the then-current requirements on radiography
so that persons subject to byproduct material licensing regulations could conveniently use and understand them.
Numerous modifications to the original part 34 have been made since 1965, many of which have been directed toward the
safety aspects of field radiography. These modifications include performance requirements on radiography equipment
and requirements for the use of alarming ratemeters published in 1990 (55 FR 843; January 10, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 200 NRC radiography licensees with an additional 500 Agreement State licensees. Radiography
licensees often conduct business under both NRC and Agreement State jurisdiction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC has not initiated an overall revision of part 34 in many years. However, a number of Agreement States have updated
their radiography regulations. The decision to develop an overall revision to 10 CFR part 34 was made with the intent
of establishing new safety requirements for radiography licensees and clarifying the regulation so that licensees
will have a better understanding of what is expected in radiographic operations. The format of the radiography regulations
would be revised to place requirements into descriptive categories that better describe the type of requirements
found in the subpart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC solicited recommendations on radiography issues at the 1991 Agreement States' meeting in Sacramento, CA,
as well as from NRC regional offices, radiography equipment manufacturers, and radiography licensees. Public comments
were solicited on the issue of radiographer certification at the May 19, 1991, annual meeting of the Conference of
Radiation Control Program Directors (CRCPD), Inc. in Wichita, Kansas, and a public workshop on radiographer certification
was held May 27&hyph;28, 1992, in Mobile, Alabama. A separate workshop was held on November 18, 1992, in Dallas, Texas,
to discuss recommendations received from the Agreement States and licensees on revision of the radiography regulations.
The transcripts of these meetings, which are available for inspection and copying in the NRC Public Document Room,
were reviewed in further developing the proposed revision. The NRC utilized part E of the ``Suggested State Regulations
for Control of Radiation'' developed by the CRCPD, part 31 of the Texas Regulations for Control of Radiation, Chapter
5 of the Louisiana regulations, and the Canadian ``Atomic Energy Control Regulations,'' that apply to radiography
in developing this proposed revision of part 34.

II. Petition for Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A petition was received on October 15, 1992, from the International Union of Operating Engineers (IUOE), Local No.
2, requesting an amendment to the radiography regulations to require a minimum of two radiographic personnel when
performing industrial radiography at temporary jobsites. The petition was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 4, 1992 (57 FR 57392). Thirty-eight comment letters were received, 35 were in favor of granting the petition.
Resolution of this petition has been addressed in this proposed revision to part 34. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The IUOE petition offered three options for the makeup of the two-person crew: (1) Two radiographers; (2) one radiographer
and one radiographer's assistant; and (3) one radiographer and one trainee, with the trainee having completed 40
hours of approved radiation safety training and passed an examination. The petitioners identified a number of problems
associated with the use of licensed material by one radiographer at temporary jobsites. These problems included:
(1) Difficulty keeping the area under constant surveillance while radiographic operations are ongoing; (2) difficulty
in maintaining surveillance when working in trenches; and (3) difficulty in obtaining assistance in the event of
an emergency if there is only one individual. The petitioners believe that the suggested change is necessary to ensure
a safe working environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments received raised concerns regarding the combination of a radiographer and a trainee as a two-person team.
Many stated that the trainee is an unskilled individual that may or may not achieve radiographer status and spending
the time and money for 40 hours training may not be financially feasible for some radiography companies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule, if adopted, would constitute a partial granting of the petition in that it proposes to require,
at a minimum, a two-person crew whenever radiographic operations are being conducted outside of a permanent radiographic
installation. The NRC has decided not to adopt the term ``radiographer trainee,'' and is proposing that the second
person be another qualified radiographer or an individual who has met, at a minimum, the requirements for a radiographer's
assistant. The NRC recognizes that, in Agreement States, the training of those individuals designated as trainees
would meet the NRC's training requirements for a radiographer's assistant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The estimated cost of requiring the two-person crew could be significant for licensees who send only one radiographer
to a temporary jobsite. However, the current regulation requires direct surveillance of the operation to prevent
unauthorized entry into a high radiation area. To comply with this regulation most licensees already must use more
than one qualified individual in many situations. For certain circumstances where a licensee could demonstrate
that adequate surveillance can be maintained by one radiographer, the Commission could consider granting an exemption
through the process described in the proposed &sect;34.111. The Commission is concerned that this requirement could
cause a significant impact on a number of small entities which currently do not use two-person crews, and is soliciting
comments on the potential impact. Furthermore, the Commission is interested in receiving proposals for alternatives
to the two-person requirement which would achieve comparable enhancements in safety with less of a burden on licensees.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, the Commission believes that by requiring at least two qualified individuals to always be present when
radiographic operations are being conducted, there will be a significant increase in assurance that operational
safety measures and emergency procedures will be effectively implemented. The expectation is that violations involving
failures to perform adequate radiation surveys of radiographic exposure devices and the surrounding area, failures
to adequately post and monitor the restricted area, and failures to lock and secure the camera when not in use will become
less frequent. Furthermore, if an incapacitating injury to a radiographer should occur at a remote location, the
presence of a second individual could be an important factor in preventing unnecessary radiation exposures. The
Commission is considering amending the Enforcement Policy as a result of this proposed rulemaking to provide, as
an example of a Severity Level III violation, the conduct of radiography operations without the required second radiographer
or individual with, at least, the qualifications of a radiographer's assistant as provided in the proposed &sect;34.41.

III. General Discussion of Proposed Rule Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendments contain requirements which are intended to improve radiography safety. The first major
change is a proposal to require, at a minimum, two qualified individuals (two radiographers or a radiographer and
an individual who has met, at least, the requirements to be a radiographer's assistant) to be present any time radiographic
operations occur outside of a permanent radiographic installation. This issue has already been addressed under
Section II. Petition for Rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 19, 1991 (56 FR 11504), the NRC published a final rule which provided for a voluntary third-party radiographer
certification program through the American Society for Nondestructive Testing (ASNT), as discussed further in
Section IV. Several Agreement States have adopted mandatory radiographer state administered examination programs.
The promulgation of these programs, as well as other changes in their radiography regulations, have contributed
to an overall improvement in safety and a decrease in serious overexposures in these Agreement States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would recognize other certifying organizations who meet the requirements outlined in Appendix
A of the proposed rule. Independent certifying organizations would be required to meet all of the requirements listed
in Appendix A, while Agreement States that wish to become certifying entities would only be required to meet the requirements
listed in part II and III of the Appendix. The NRC plans to publish annually in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 an updated list of certifying entities and to provide the list with license application forms. The NRC also plans to
investigate the feasibility of establishing a toll-free telephone number whereby licensees could obtain information
on approved certifying entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another issue involves the definition of a permanent radiographic installation. The proposed rule changes the definition
of a ``permanent radiographic installation'' to mean an enclosed shielded room, cell, or vault in which radiography
is performed. The terms ``designed or intended for radiography'' and ``regularly performed'' have been removed
from the definition to reduce any ambiguity as to what is intended. Under the existing rule, if a licensee has a room,
cell, or vault that meets the definition of a ``permanent radiographic installation'', then it must meet the special
safety requirements of &sect;34.33. The proposed rule adds two additional requirements: (1) To perform a daily check
of the visible and audible signals, and (2) to list all permanent facilities on the license. Under the proposed rule,
radiography can only be performed in one of two ways: (1) In a permanent radiographic installation with a qualified
radiographer, or (2) at any other location with at least two qualified individuals. The special safety requirements
of &sect;34.33 would not apply to the use of a shielded room at a temporary jobsite, although licensees would be permitted
to submit a license amendment requesting approval to use a shielded room which meets the requirements of &sect;34.33
as a permanent radiographic installation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule includes requirements specifying the qualifications and duties of the Radiation Safety Officer
(RSO). The RSO is the key licensee individual charged with the responsibility to ensure that the requirements in the
license are followed. These requirements have been based on similar commitments previously included in specific
license conditions on a case-by-case basis. The proposed rule would require additional special training for RSOs.
The Commission is considering permitting existing RSOs to obtain the additional training within 2 years from the
effective date of the rule and is specifically requesting comment on this proposed requirement.

IV. An Independent Certifying Entity (ASNT) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current ASNT program for certifying industrial radiographers was approved by its Board of Directors in March
1990 and offers certification for either isotope or x-ray users. The NRC staff has extensively reviewed this program,
which includes a written examination developed by the State of Texas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The application to become a certified radiographer requires documentation of 40 hours of classroom training in radiation
safety topics specified by ASNT including those topics listed in the proposed &sect;34.43(f), documentation of
520 hours of direct hands-on experience with radiography sources and devices under the control of an NRC or Agreement
State licensee, and proof of successful completion of a practical examination on safety procedures administered
by an ASNT-recognized institution. Recognized institutions, generally the candidates' employers, have been licensed
by NRC or an Agreement State for the use of radiography sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After ASNT's approval of an application, a candidate radiographer takes the written examination. The examination
is administered by ASNT or the Conference of Radiation Control Program Directors, Inc. (CRCPD) and subsequently
sent to the State of Texas for grading. The results of the examination are forwarded to ASNT. The written examination
covers the fundamental radiation safety principles outlined in 10 CFR part 34, pertinent Federal and State regulations,
basic radiographic equipment operation, general operating and emergency procedures, radiation detection instrumentation,
and radiation safety procedures applicable to industrial radiography. In addition, candidates are required to
sign a pledge that they will abide by the ASNT Rules of Conduct. On successful completion of the required examinations
and other requirements, a certified individual is provided with a wallet card identifying him/her as an ASNT-certified
radiographer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ASNT certification is valid for 3 years, unless suspended or revoked for cause. Renewal of certification may be accomplished
either with or without reexamination. A candidate for renewal without reexamination must document continuous active
full-time employment in radiography for at least 6 of the last 12 months. In addition, the candidate must document
at least 8 hours, each year, of classroom refresher training covering basic radiation safety principles, equipment
operations, emergency procedures, new safety regulations, license requirements, and other pertinent information.
If these criteria are not met, the candidate must retake the written examination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ASNT Rules of Conduct require certified individuals to comply with NRC and Agreement State regulations and the
employer's procedures for radiation safety, routine and emergency operations, and to act in a professional manner
in matters pertaining to industrial radiography or to the ASNT certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The certification program also contains complaint and hearing procedures. For example, written allegations of
unauthorized practice by an ASNT-certified individual are reviewed by the ASNT Ethics Subcommittee. In some cases
a formal hearing may be held. If the ASNT Ethics Subcommittee determines that an unauthorized practice has been committed,
the subcommittee may take one of the following actions:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This subpart covers items of a general nature, such as listing definitions and OMB approvals. It also describes the
purpose and scope of the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.1, Purpose and scope, is basically unchanged from the existing regulation. Other NRC regulations that
apply to radiography licenses are referenced in this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.3, Definitions, contains the following new terms: ALARA, Annual safety review, Becquerel, Certifying
entity, Collimator, Control (drive) cable, Field station, Gray, Independent certifying organization, Radiographer
certification, Radiation Safety Officer, Sievert, S-tube, and Temporary jobsite. These definitions were added
to define terms used in requirements not previously addressed in Part 34. The term ALARA, which means as low as reasonably
achievable, has been added to describe a key element of the revised part 20, ``Standards for Protection Against Radiation,''
that licensees must implement by January 1994. The term Annual safety review was added to describe this activity in
the proposed rule. The terms Becquerel, Gray, and Sievert were added to define the metric units used in all new or revised
regulations. The terms Certifying entity, Independent certifying organization, and Radiographer certification
were added to describe terms associated with revised requirements for verification of radiographer training. The
terms Collimator and Control (drive) cable were added to the proposed rule to describe pieces of equipment that is
often used in conducting radiography operations. The term S-tube was added to describe this component of a radiographic
exposure for which there are new requirements in the proposed rule. The terms Field station and Temporary jobsite
were added to clarify the meaning of these terms in the proposed rule. The term Field station is being used to designate
those locations where radiography equipment is stored and from which equipment is dispatched. The term Temporary
jobsite is being used to describe locations not authorized on the license where radiography is conducted. The term
Radiation Safety Officer (RSO) was added to describe the role of this individual in the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The terms Associated equipment, Control tube, Exposure head, Field examination, Projection sheath, Radiographic
Operations, Shielded position, and Source assembly, while used in the existing regulation, were not previously
defined. Both licensees and Agreement State representatives requested clarification of these terms. Changing
the definition of radiographer's assistant was discussed at the November 1992 workshop in Dallas, Texas. Some Agreement
States use the term ``trainee'' to refer to a radiographer's assistant and require training similar to that required
of a radiographer. The NRC has decided to retain the term radiographer's assistant and has proposed upgrading the
training requirements to provide additional assurance that radiographers' assistants are sufficiently knowledgeable
of NRC regulations. Although the NRC is not adopting the term ``trainee,'' the proposed rule has been written to provide
the flexibility for the second person to have training beyond that of a radiographer's assistant. This position could
then equally be filled by a ``trainee.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of a permanent radiographic installation was modified to remove ambiguities in the previous definition.
The definitions of storage area and storage container were modified to remove references to transportation. Specific
transportation requirements are addressed in &sect;34.35.

Section 34.5, Interpretations, is standard regulatory language to state that only the General Counsel of the NRC
has the authority to provide interpretations of the regulations which will be binding on the Commission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.8, Information collection requirements: OMB approval, is unchanged from the current regulation, except
for changing the section numbers to conform to the new format of the proposed rule and to list any new requirements that
require OMB approval. The Commission has submitted the proposed rule for OMB clearance. Final OMB clearance will
be obtained before publication of a final rule.

Subpart B_Specific Licensing Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed subpart provides the basic requirements for submittal of a license application. The sections in this
proposed subpart are basically unchanged from those in the current subpart A of part 34. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.11, Application for a specific license, is worded the same as &sect;34.3 in the current part 34. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.13, Specific license for radiography, has several changes from &sect;34.11 in the current part 34. A proposed
&sect;34.13(c) would specify requirements for establishing procedures to verify the certification status of radiographers.
The requirement for verifying an individual's certification would only apply to previously certified radiographers
whom a licensee might hire. A licensee would already know an individual's status if the individual is employed by the
licensee at the time of certification. However, the licensee would be required to ensure that all radiographers are
certified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.13(e) proposes a reduction in the frequency of field inspections of radiographers and radiographer's
assistants from quarterly to annually for individuals regularly conducting radiographic operations. For individuals
who have not performed radiographic operations for more than six months, an inspection of job performance would be
required at the time they next participate in a radiographic operation. This reduction is possible due primarily
to the proposed two-person rule, adoption of mandatory certification for radiographers, and upgraded radiographer
assistants training which would reduce the need for inspection of job performance. The basic requirements for conducting
the field inspections have been relocated to &sect;34.43(d) to more accurately reflect its role in the training program.
In addition, a requirement for conducting annual safety reviews has also been added in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;34.13(b)(1) and &sect;34.43(c) to clarify the intent of the current &sect;34.11(b) which requires periodic
training. Section 34.13(g) is proposed to require the licensee to designate an individual on the license to fulfill
the duties of the RSO. The qualifications and duties of this individual are specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;34.42. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.13(i) is a new paragraph which, as proposed, would require a list and description of all permanent radiographic
installations and all field stations to be included in the license application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.13(j) is a new paragraph which, as proposed, would permit licensees to have the option to use certified
radiographers before the proposed rule is adopted in final form and becomes effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart C_Equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed subpart describes the requirements for radiographic equipment performance and use. Some of the requirements
in this proposed subpart are changed from the current part 34 as described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.20, Performance requirements for radiography equipment, is slightly changed from &sect;34.20 of the
current rule. Section 34.20(b)(3) is revised to prohibit modification of any exposure device. The proposed rule
was modified to remove any ambiguity regarding permission to modify safety components. The term Source assembly
was added to &sect;34.20 (c) and (e) to make clear that it is one of the pieces of equipment that must meet the requirements
of &sect;34.20. Section 34.20(f) is added to require labeling of all associated equipment acquired after January
10, 1996, to identify that the components have met the requirements of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.21, Limits on levels of radiation for radiographic exposure devices, storage containers, and source
changers, is basically unchanged from &sect;34.21 of the current rule with the following exceptions. Metric equivalents
to the values previously cited have been included. While it is recognized that radiation exposure instruments currently
use units of roentgens to measure radioactivity, the rule has been modified to use the terms millisieverts and millirems.
Rather than making the transition from roentgens to coulombs per kilogram (in air), the terms millisieverts and millirems
were chosen because a quality factor of 1 is appropriate in dealing with gamma-ray emitting radiography sources.
Under the proposed rule measurements taken in roentgens may continue to be recorded in terms of roentgens, provided
the limits described in the rule, expressed in millisieverts or millirems, are not exceeded.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 34.23, Locking and relocation of radiographic exposure devices, storage containers, and source changers,
is slightly changed from &sect;34.22 of the current rule, as described below. Section 34.23(a) describes locking
of radiographic exposure devices. A requirement to remove the key of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
keyed-lock is proposed. Should the key remain in the radiographic exposure device, there is an increased likelihood
of the accidental or intentional removal of the sealed source when the radiographic device is unattended. The word
``manually'' is added to clarify what is meant by securing the source assembly for radiographic exposure devices
manufactured before January 10, 1992. Section 34.23(b) is added which specifies requirements for ensuring that
the sealed source is in the shielded position before moving the device and associated equipment because a number of
overexposures have occurred while radiographic devices were being moved from one location to another. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.25, Radiation survey instruments, replaces &sect;34.24 in the current rule and has been updated to reflect
current calibration standards for different types of survey meters. This is to specify requirements to address the
variety of survey instruments currently available. An additional requirement to perform an operability check before
use is proposed. While this is routinely part of all survey instrument specifications, a failure to determine whether
an instrument was operable before use has been a contributing factor in overexposures during radiographic operations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;34.27, Leak testing and replacement of sealed sources, the words ``repair, tagging, opening, and modification''
of sealed sources have been removed because these activities are only approved for individuals specifically licensed
to do so. It was never intended that radiographers would be permitted to perform these activities without special
authorization from the Commission or an Agreement State. Section 34.31 was modified to include a specific prohibition
on the opening, repair, or modification of sealed sources. Most of the language in the proposed rule is the same as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;34.25 of the existing rule. However, the organization has been modified for purposes of clarification. The
requirement that performance of a source exchange or a leak test must be done by persons approved by the Commission
has been modified to include Agreement States. Recordkeeping requirements have been moved to &sect;34.67. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.27(f) is proposed to require surveys for depleted uranium (DU) contamination in the ``S'' tube of radiographic
devices at least once every 12 months. Depleted uranium is used as a shielding material in most radiographic devices
and replaces the lead shielding that was used in older models. The presence of DU contamination in the ``S'' tube may
be an indication that the control cable has worn a groove through the ``S'' tube into the DU shielding. This condition
could cause binding of the control cable in the groove with the resultant inability to retract the source, and could
result in unwarranted exposures. Recordkeeping requirements may be found in &sect;34.67. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.29, Quarterly inventory, is basically unchanged from the existing regulation with the exception of moving
all recordkeeping requirements to &sect;34.69. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.31, Inspection and maintenance of radiographic exposure devices, storage containers, associated equipment,
and source changers, includes several proposed changes from &sect;34.28 in the current rule. The term associated
equipment has been included in the proposed rule, and includes various items used for specific tasks which may not
be supplied with the radiographic device. Experience has shown that defects in associated equipment can have an effect
on safety. Therefore, associated equipment must be included in an inspection and maintenance program. Section 34.31(a)
has been revised to clarify the intent of the daily visual check and the required actions if defects are found. In &sect;34.31(b),
the term routine maintenance is now used to clarify that licensees are not required to perform all maintenance. Many
equipment repairs may require returning the device to the manufacturer. Language has been added to specify that defective
equipment must be removed from service until repaired and that a record of the defect, as well as corrective actions
taken, must be made. While this appears obvious, there have been numerous instances where the use of defective equipment
continued and overexposures of personnel occurred as a direct result of the defects. Recordkeeping requirements
have been moved to &sect;34.73. The records required to be kept would now be specified in the rule, and include: Date
of check, individual performing check, equipment involved, any defects found, and repairs made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.33, Permanent radiographic installations, is basically unchanged from the existing requirements in
part 34, with the exceptions noted below. Section 34.33(a) has been revised to clarify which entrance controls are
required by incorporating the appropriate language from 10 CFR 20.1601 into part 34. Section 34.33(b) is revised
to require an alarm system check at the beginning of each day of use. This is to be performed by checking the warning light
and audible alarm with the source exposed before using the room each day. A defective alarm would require repair before
radiographic operations could resume. This requirement is included because there have been instances where failures
in alarm systems have resulted in personnel overexposures upon entry into a high radiation area.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 34.35, Labels, storage, and transportation precautions, is a proposed new section that would place requirements
that specify labeling and security precautions for radioactive material storage and transportation in part 34.
Section 34.23 of the current rule describes storage precautions for exposure devices and storage containers but
does not address transportation or labeling requirements. In &sect;34.35 of the proposed rule, labeling requirements
for source changers and storage containers are specified. The proposed rule contains specific requirements to lock
and physically secure transport packages. The proposed rule would also require licensees to store licensed material
in a manner which minimizes the danger from explosions or fire. The requirement for a Quality Assurance (QA) program,
as described in &sect;71.105, has been added to the proposed rule. While radiography licensees have always had to
comply with &sect;71.105, there have been numerous cases where radiography licensees were unaware of this requirement
and, therefore, failed to comply. The addition of requirements addressing labeling and transportation is necessary
because in the past personnel and public exposures have occurred from the failure to properly safeguard radioactive
material during storage and transportation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This subpart describes basic radiation safety requirements for radiographic operations and includes training,
safety procedures, personnel monitoring and surveys. New requirements describing the duties of the radiation safety
officer are proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.41, Conducting radiographic operations, would be added to address the practice of conducting radiography
at sites where the special safety features of a shielded facility are not available. The proposed requirement specifies
that, as a minimum, either two radiographers or a radiographer and an individual who has met the requirements to be
a radiographer's assistant must be present any time radiographic operations occur outside a permanent installation.
The basis for this proposed requirement is to ensure that, in the absence of the safety features outlined in &sect;34.33,
there will be a significant increase in assurance that operational safety measures will be implemented effectively.
The expectation is that violations involving failures to perform adequate radiation surveys of radiographic exposure
devices and the surrounding area, failures to adequately post and monitor the restricted area, and failures to lock
and secure the camera when not in use will become less frequent. Furthermore, if an incapacitating injury to a radiographer
should occur at a remote location, the presence of a second individual could be an important factor in preventing unnecessary
radiation exposures. Section 34.41(b) is proposed to require that radiographic operations conducted at locations
listed on the license be conducted in a permanent radiographic installation. If licensees would need to perform radiography
outside of a permanent facility due to some unique circumstances Commission authorization would be required, and
the requirements of &sect;34.41(a) would need to be met.

Section 34.42, Radiation Safety Officer (RSO), lists the qualifications and duties of the RSO. This section would
be added to place in the regulations the requirements for this key individual. Previously, these requirements were
referenced in regulatory guides and included as license conditions on a case-by-case basis, but not specified in
the regulations. The NRC believes that the RSO is the key individual for ensuring safe operations. The qualifications
listed for the RSO in the proposed rule include: (1) Completion of the training required for a radiographer as described
in part 34; and (2) 2000 hours of documented experience in industrial radiography with at least 40 hours of formal classroom
training with respect to the establishment and maintenance of radiation protection programs. It is anticipated
that most existing RSOs already meet these requirements. It is proposed that licensees would have two years from the
effective date of the rule to meet this 40 hour training requirement for existing RSOs. A key duty of the RSO is to ensure
the safe conduct of operations and to stop unsafe operations and institute corrective actions. Other duties of the
RSO in the proposed rule include overseeing procedure implementation and employee training, and monitoring radiation
surveys, leak tests, and personnel monitoring results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.43, Training, contains several new requirements. Section 34.43(a) has been revised to require radiographers
to be certified by a certifying entity meeting the criteria specified in Appendix A of the proposed rule. To be recognized
as a certifying entity, an independent organization meeting the criteria specified in part I of appendix A would have
to apply as specified in &sect;34.43(a)(2). Certifying programs would be periodically reviewed by the NRC to ensure
that the conditions of approval are being met. A list of approved certifying entities would be made available to licensees
on request by contacting the appropriate regional office listed in appendix D to 10 CFR part 20, and would be published
annually in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Under the proposed rule licensees would have 2 years to implement the proposed change. The change in the verification
of training requirements was included in the proposed rule to provide assurance of the quality of radiographers'
training in the safe handling of radioactive material. NRC and Agreement States must reciprocally recognize valid
radiographer certifications issued by either an independent certifying entity approved by the NRC or an Agreement
State certification program meeting the requirements of appendix A, parts II and III, of the proposed rule. Also included
in this section is training in &sect;&sect;30.7, 30.9, and 30.10, applicable sections of 10 CFR part 71, and some instructions
in applicable Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations as referenced in 10 CFR part 71 in addition to other
parts of NRC regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.43(b), which lists training requirements for radiographers' assistants, has been revised to require
training in &sect;&sect;30.7, 30.9, 30.10, and parts 19, 20, 34, 71, and instructions in applicable DOT regulations
as referenced in 10 CFR part 71, in addition to the licensee's operating and emergency procedures. These changes are
to ensure that radiographers and radiographers' assistants are knowledgeable of the safety requirements applicable
to handling radioactive material in the conduct of radiography. In &sect;34.43(b)(3) the option of providing an
oral test has been omitted. The proposed rule would only allow a written test to be given. Section 34.43(c) describes
a proposed requirement to conduct annual safety reviews of radiographers and radiographers' assistants. In the
current rule, periodic training is required but required topics to be addressed are not included. Because a number
of violations involving personnel overexposures have resulted from licensees' failures to provide adequate training,
the proposed amendment for annual safety reviews includes training on revised operating and emergency procedures,
new equipment, and safety issues.

Section 34.43(d) has been relocated from &sect;34.11(d), and describes the requirements for routine inspections
of job performance for radiographers and radiographers' assistants. The proposed rule reduces the frequency of
these inspections from quarterly to annually. The NRC is proposing to reduce the frequency of inspections of job performance
for individuals regularly conducting radiographic operations. For individuals who have not performed radiographic
operations for more than six months, an inspection of their job performance would be required at the time of their next
participation in a radiographic operation. With several of the other requirements proposed in this rulemaking,
such as, certification of radiographers, and having at least two individuals at a temporary jobsite, the Commission
believes that the frequency of inspection of job performance can be reduced from quarterly to annually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;34.43(e) specifies that recordkeeping requirements can be found in &sect;34.79. The requirements
for records are unchanged from the current part 34 except for the addition of records verifying the certification
status of radiographers. Proposed &sect;34.43(f) contains the subjects currently listed in Appendix A of part 34.
Several additional requirements are proposed. These include: Pictures or models of source assemblies; training
in storage, control, and disposal of licensed materials; and pertinent Federal regulations, i.e., Department of
Transportation. A new &sect;34.43(g) would be added which would allow licensees to continue to permit uncertified
individuals to act as radiographers for a 2-year period after the proposed rule becomes final. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;34.45, Operating and emergency procedures, minor changes were made to include procedures for source recovery
if the licensee intends to perform emergency source recovery. These were added because many of the steps in a source
recovery would be the same in any circumstance and, in the past, a number of personnel overexposures have occurred
during emergency source recovery operations because basic radiation protection precautions were overlooked.
Additional requirements are proposed for transportation procedures to include placarding of vehicles, and reference
to the DOT regulations. A number of violations have resulted from licensees failing to follow DOT regulations in the
transportation of radioactive material. Section 34.45(b) is proposed which specifies that the recordkeeping requirements
can be found in &sect;34.81. Sections 34.89 and 34.91 specify that copies of current operating and emergency procedures
are to be maintained at field stations, permanent installations, and temporary jobsites, to ensure that adequate
documents are available where radiographic operations occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.46, Supervision of radiographers' assistants, is unchanged from &sect;34.44 of the current rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;34.47, Personnel monitoring, several changes are proposed. The existing requirement specifies that pocket
dosimeters have a range from zero to at least 200 milliroentgens. The proposed rule has dropped the term ``at least,''
to limit the range to be only from 0&hyph;200. This is to prevent the use of pocket dosimeters with very high ranges where
the users would be unable to properly determine their exposure. Use of pocket dosimeters with a range higher than 200
milliroentgens will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Additional requirements are proposed on the replacement
frequency for film and TLDs. The existing regulation does not specify the replacement frequency for film and TLDs.
The high intensity sources used in radiography necessitate frequent monitoring. Monthly replacement is judged
to be an appropriate frequency to adequately track an individual's exposure. With the new lower limits for occupational
dose, less frequent monitoring could result in a worker receiving an overexposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.47(b) addresses the use of pocket dosimeters. A requirement to read dosimeters at the beginning and end
of each shift is proposed. This is added to ensure that the dose is correctly estimated. The existing regulation only
specifies a daily reading and does not provide sufficient instruction on how licensees should handle any readings
which remain on the pocket dosimeter after recharging. Because it is nearly impossible to recharge a pocket dosimeter
to zero, licensees must take a reading before and after use and determine the difference to determine the dose accurately.
Section 34.47(d) addresses an off-scale pocket dosimeter. The proposed rule would require that, in the case of a pocket
dosimeter being off-scale, the individual will not be permitted to work with licensed material until the RSO or a designee
of the RSO makes a determination of the worker's radiation exposure. The current rule requires that the worker's film
badge or TLD be sent for processing, but does not specify when the individual can return to work. The proposed revision
provides the criteria that must be met before permitting the individual to return to work. A provision is included
which will permit the individual to return to work when the circumstances are clearly known and justified by the RSO
that there was no possibility of overexposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.47(e) is proposed to require that a worker cease work whenever a film badge or TLD is lost or damaged until
a replacement is available. This is added to ensure that there is a means to accurately determine the worker's radiation
dose.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 34.47(g) has a proposed revision to require alarm ratemeters to be capable of alerting the wearer regardless
of the environmental conditions. In a recent radiography overexposure incident, a licensee reported that a radiographer
who was wearing ear protection due to high workplace noise levels was overexposed because he was unaware that his ratemeter
was alarming. For use in high ambient noise areas, ratemeters could be supplied with either a vibrating alarm that
could be felt by the wearer or a small speaker built into hearing protectors to meet this requirement. NRC expects its
licensees to determine the need for alarm ratemeters that incorporate these additional protective measures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;34.49, Radiation surveys, there are several proposed changes. The existing regulation requires a survey
of the circumference of the radiographic exposure device and the guide tube. A number of violations of NRC requirements
have occurred due to a failure to comply with the requirement to survey the full circumference of the camera. In reviewing
the regulation, the NRC has decided to revise the survey requirements to specify that a survey be conducted of the radiographic
exposure device to determine that the sealed source has returned to the shielded position, and specify that the radiographer
conduct a survey as he/she approaches the guide tube to exchange film, reposition the collimator, or dismantle equipment.
The proposed rule places the responsibility with the licensee for ensuring that an adequate survey is conducted.
In the majority of cases, a survey of the radiographic exposure device's ports should be adequate to make this determination.
A proposed requirement to survey storage areas when radioactive material is initially placed in storage, during
each quarterly inventory, and whenever changes occur which could increase radiation levels, is added.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Section 34.51, Surveillance, is basically unchanged from &sect;34.41 of the current rule. References to part 20

This subpart does not appear in the current part 34. This subpart is proposed to place all recordkeeping and notification
requirements in one location. Most of the recordkeeping requirements are unchanged from those contained in the existing
part 34. Proposed changes are discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.61, Specific license for radiography, requires the licensee to maintain a copy of the license until it
is terminated by the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.63, Records of receipt and transfer of sealed sources, is added to provide a record showing the disposition
of sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.65, Records of radiation survey instruments, is proposed as currently written in Section 34.24. Licensees
would be required to maintain calibration records for radiation survey instruments for 3 years after the record is
made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.67, Records of leak testing and replacement of sealed sources is proposed as currently written in &sect;34.25(c)
and requires licensees to maintain records of leak tests for 3 years after the record is made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.69, Records of quarterly inventory is proposed as currently written &sect;34.26 and requires licensees
to maintain records of quarterly inventories for 3 years after the record is made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.71, Utilization logs, is proposed much as currently written in &sect;34.27. This section would require
licensees to maintain utilization logs for 3 years after the record is made. The proposed rule has added several additional
pieces of information to the logs including the serial number of the device in which the sealed source is located, the
radiographer's signature, and the dates the device is removed and returned to storage. This information is necessary
in order to verify location of sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.73, Records of inspection and maintenance of radiographic exposure devices, storage containers, associated
equipment, and source changers, is proposed much as currently written in &sect;34.28(b). This section requires
licensees to maintain inspection and maintenance records for 3 years after the record is made. The proposed rule would
specify the information that must be included in the inspection records: Date of check, name of inspector, equipment
inspected, any defects found, and repairs made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.75, Records of alarm system checks at permanent radiographic installations, is proposed as currently
written in &sect;34.29(c) and requires licensees to maintain records of alarm system checks for 3 years after the
record is made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.79, Records of training, is proposed as currently written in &sect;34.31(c) with proposed additional
requirements for maintaining records of radiographer certification and annual safety reviews. This paragraph
would require licensees to maintain records verifying radiographer certification status. For annual safety reviews,
the records would include copies of tests, dates administered, names of instructors and attendees, and the topics
covered. Under the proposed rule, records of the annual inspections would include a list of items checked, and any
non-compliances observed by the RSO.

license.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.83, Records of personnel monitoring, is proposed as currently written in &sect;34.33(b), and requires
licensees to maintain records of alarm ratemeter calibrations, pocket dosimeter readings, and operability checks
for 3 years from the date the record was made, and to maintain records of film badge or TLD reports until the Commission
terminates the license.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.85, Records of radiation surveys, is proposed as currently written in &sect;34.43(d) and requires records

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.87, Form of records, is proposed as currently written in &sect;34.4 and specifies how records must be maintained,
including permitting records to be stored in electronic media.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.89, Documents and records required at field stations and permanent installations, would be added to list
documents and records required at field stations and permanent installations. This section is necessary to ensure
that licensees have available sufficient records to demonstrate compliance with NRC regulations. Field stations
and permanent installations may be far removed from the home office. Therefore, records necessary to conduct operations
safely should be readily available. These records include a copy of the current license, copies of pertinent regulations,
copies of operating and emergency procedures, instrument calibration records, leak test results, inventory records,
utilization logs, training and survey records. These records are those required for licensees to safely handle radioactive
material, and are a subset of the records required at a licensee's normal place of business.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 34.91, Documents and records required at temporary jobsites and use or storage locations exceeding 180 days,
would be added to list documents and records required at temporary jobsites and locations where radioactive material
will be in use or storage for more than 180 days. This section is necessary to ensure that licensees have available sufficient
records to demonstrate compliance with NRC regulations and those records necessary to maintain safe operations.
The records listed are a smaller subset of the records required for a field station or permanent installation. These
records include copies of pertinent regulations, evidence of latest instrument calibrations, latest survey records,
shipping papers, and NRC license or Agreement State license if operating under reciprocity. These records are those
required for licensees to safely handle radioactive material.

This subpart is basically unchanged from &sect;34.30 with the exception of an additional requirement. Section 34.101(c)
would require licensees to notify the appropriate NRC regional office in writing before using or storing radioactive
material in one location for more than 180 days. This notification would be required within 30 days of exceeding the
180-day timeframe. This provision would be added to provide the NRC with information in a timely manner to permit inspection
of radioactive material at these locations.

Appendix A to Part 34 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This appendix is new. The requirements in appendix A to the current part 34 have been relocated to &sect;34.43(f).
Part I of the new appendix A provides the proposed requirements for an independent certifying organization, and does
not apply to Agreement States choosing to become a certifying entity. Parts II and III of the new appendix A provide
the proposed requirements for certification programs and written examinations for a certifying entity, which would
include Agreement States. The proposed appendix A would not impose new requirements on NRC's radiography licensees.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC is proposing that an independent certifying organization would have to be a national society or association involved
in setting national standards of practice for industrial radiography or non-destructive testing to be recognized.
Membership in the organization could not be restricted because of race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin
or handicap and the organization's certification program would need to be open to nonmembers. The independent certifying
organization would need to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Be incorporated; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Have a permanent full-time staff; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Be nationally recognized; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Have a policy and decision-making review board; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Be governed by written organizational by-laws and policies; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Have a viable system of financing its operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An independent certifying organization would also need to have: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A committee to review and approve certification guidelines and procedures and to advise the organization's staff
in implementing its certification program; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A committee to review complaints against certified individuals; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Written procedures describing its certification program; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) An agreement to exchange information about certified individuals with the Commission and the Agreement States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For a certification program to be acceptable, NRC is proposing that it include provisions requiring individuals
to receive training in the topics listed in &sect;34.43(f), complete a written examination, complete a practical
examination or equivalent, and require a minimum period of on-the-job experience. The program would also have to
include procedures that ensure due process whenever an individual's certification may need to be revoked, suspended,
or restricted for willful or significant failure to comply with his or her employer's operating or emergency procedures,
or the Commission's or an Agreement State's regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the written examination, NRC is proposing that it be: (1) Designed to test knowledge and understanding of the subjects
listed in &sect;34.43(f); (2) written for a ninth-grade reading comprehension level; and (3) scientifically analyzed
to ensure that the questions are not biased or misleading. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Agreement State Compatibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rule will be a matter of compatibility between the NRC and the Agreement States, thereby providing consistency
between Federal and State safety requirements. With regard to basic radiation equipment specifications, standards,
and definitions identified as matters of Division 1 level of compatibility, the Agreement States will be expected
to adopt, essentially verbatim, the proposed part 34 standards and definitions into their equivalent regulations.
However, the NRC also recognizes that certain terms, such as radiographer's assistant, may not be used in present
Agreement State regulations. Continued use of alternative terms, such as ``trainee'' will be considered acceptable
so long as the underlying requirements of the position are consistent with those proposed by the Commission. The remainder
of the rule will be a Division 2 level of compatibility allowing the Agreement State regulators the flexibility to
adopt similar or more stringent requirements based on their radiation protection experience, professional judgments,
and community values. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix A of proposed 10 CFR part 34 provides the requirements for certifying entities to be acceptable to NRC. The
Commission reserves the right to make this determination and therefore this is a Division 4 item of compatibility.
Because it concerns a regulatory function that will be reserved for the Commission pursuant to 10 CFR part 150, the
Agreement States will not need to implement this provision of the proposed rulemaking. A new section proposed for
part 150 would make clear the Commission's intent to reserve this function and also to reserve the right to set minimum
radiographer certification standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agreement States that wish to develop radiographer certification programs would be expected to implement parts
II and III of the proposed appendix A. The definitions and the requirements for certification programs and written
examinations contained in this rulemaking must be the same for all NRC and Agreement State licensees to maintain consistency.
In practice, States that develop certification programs must develop regulatory language and regulations that
implement appendix A, parts II and III criteria. States would be permitted to include additional administrative
requirements (such as State-issued cards). States that do not develop certification programs would not be expected
to implement appendix A. NRC or an Agreement State must reciprocally recognize valid radiographer certifications
issued by either an independent certifying entity approved by the NRC or by an Agreement State certification program
meeting the requirements of appendix A, parts II and III, of the proposed rule. Agreement States would be expected
to submit their proposed program for NRC review and evaluation prior to implementing their certification program.

Implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission intends to have different implementation dates for particular requirements of this proposed rule.
The proposed requirements would become effective 90 days after publication of the final rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. For the proposed requirements in &sect;34.41 to use, as a minimum, a two-person crew for radiographic operations
not conducted in a permanent facility, licensees would have 1 year from the effective date of the rule to comply. Licensees
would be required to affirm that all radiographers have met the certification requirements of 34.43(a)(1) within
2 years from the effective date of the rule. This would allow radiography licensees operating in NRC jurisdiction
2 years to obtain certification for their employees who act as radiographers. This requirement would include radiographers
employed by Agreement State licensees operating in non-Agreement States under reciprocity pursuant to 10 CFR 150.20.
The Commission notes that the State of Texas currently provides a 90-day grace period for non-Texas licensees operating
in that State under reciprocity (TRC 31.90). However, because this proposed rule will be a matter of compatibility,
the requirement for mandatory certification would apply to radiography licensees nationwide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Licensees would have one year from the effective date of the rule to comply with the additional training requirements
specified in &sect;34.43(b). Licensees could consider combining this training with the annual safety review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the proposed revision to &sect;34.47(g) that would require alarm ratemeters be capable of alerting the wearer
regardless of environmental conditions, licensees would have 1 year to obtain or modify a sufficient number of additional
alarm ratemeters to meet anticipated needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For use/storage locations not previously identified on the license (e.g., field stations, permanent radiographic
installations, and temporary jobsites exceeding 180 days) licensees must request amendments or notify the NRC,
as appropriate, by the effective date of the rule. Few amendment requests are anticipated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All current RSOs would be granted a two-year extension to meet the proposed additional RSO training requirements
specified in &sect;34.42(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission requests that persons commenting on this proposed rulemaking particularly address any hardships
that would result if the proposed rule were adopted and also address any hardships that would result if the proposed
implementation schedule were adopted. The NRC is particularly interested in suggestions for alternative implementation
schedules.

Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact: Availability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has determined under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and the Commission's
regulations in subpart A of 10 CFR part 51, that the rule, if adopted, would not be a major Federal action; therefore,
an impact statement is not required. The revision of 10 CFR part 34 should have no environmentally significant impact
because radiography only involves the use of sealed sources, and no environmental impact will be involved. The environmental
assessment and finding of no significant impact on which this determination is based are available for inspection
at the NRC Public Document Room at 2120 L Street, NW. (Lower Level), Washington DC.

This proposed rule amends information collection requirements that are subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of
1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). This rule has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review and approval
of the information collection requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The NRC has prepared an initial regulatory analysis of the impact of this proposed rule on small entities. A summary
of this analysis appears as Appendix A to this document. A copy of the analysis is available for inspection in the NRC
Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Single copies of the analysis may be obtained
from Donald O. Nellis or Mary L. Thomas, Division of Regulatory Application, Office of Research, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, Washington, DC 20555. Telephone (301)&hyph;492&hyph;3785. The NRC is seeking public comment on the
initial regulatory flexibility analysis. The NRC is particularly seeking comment from small entities (i.e., small
businesses, small organizations, and small jurisdictions under the Regulatory Flexibility Act) as to how the regulations
will affect them and how the regulations may be tiered or otherwise modified to impose less stringent requirements
on small entities while still adequately protecting the public health and safety. Those small entities which offer
comments on how the regulations could be modified to take into account the differing needs of small entities should
specifically discuss the following items: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The size of their business and how the proposed regulations would result in a significant economic burden upon
them as compared to larger organizations in the same business community.

to it a durable tag at least one (1) inch square bearing the prescribed radiation caution symbol in conventional colors,
magenta, purple or black on a yellow background, and at least the instructions: ``Caution (or Danger)_Radioactive
Material_Do Not Handle_Notify Civil Authorities (or Name of Company).'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Each exposure device using depleted uranium (DU) shielding and an ``S'' tube configuration must be periodically
tested for DU contamination. This test can be performed by the licensee using available test kits or method approved
by the Commission or an Agreement State, or the exposure device could be returned to the manufacturer for such testing.
The analysis must be capable of detecting the presence of 185 Bq (0.005 microcuries) of radioactive material on the
test sample and must be performed by a person specifically authorized by the Commission or an Agreement State to perform
the analysis. This test must be undertaken at intervals not to exceed 12 months and should such testing reveal the presence
of DU contamination, the exposure device must be removed from use and arrangements for repair or proper disposal in
a facility licensed under 10 CFR part 61 must be made. A record of the DU leaktest must be made in accordance with &sect;34.67.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Be checked to ensure that the alarm functions properly (sounds) before using at the start of each shift; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Be set to give an alarm signal at a preset dose rate of 5 mSv/hr (500 mrem/hr); with an accuracy of plus or minus 20 percent
of the true radiation dose rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Be adequate to alert the individual regardless of the environmental conditions (e.g., high ambient noise levels).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Require special means to change the preset alarm function; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Appendix A_Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Revision of 10 CFR Part 34 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend its regulations governing industrial radiography.
The proposed rule would include additional safety requirements to enhance the level of protection of radiographers
and the public and would clarify the regulations so that licensees may have a better understanding of what is expected
in radiographic operations. The proposed rule includes a number of updated radiography regulations that have been
adopted by many Agreement States. The format of the radiography regulations would be adjusted to place requirements
into descriptive categories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The radiography industry in the United States consists of approximately 700 firms, employing about 20,000 individuals,
that perform radioisotope radiography either at fixed locations or at multiple temporary job sites. Of these firms,
approximately 200 are NRC licensees employing about 3,400 radiographers with an additional 2,000 radiography supervisors
and radiographers' assistants. This estimate is based on 1990 data for the number of individuals monitored for radiation
exposure to comply with 10 CFR Part 20. The industry uses an estimated 3,500 radiographic exposure devices that employ
either cobalt-60 or iridium-192 radioisotope sources. Roughly one-quarter of the firms conduct radiography at
a single location and the other three-quarters work at multiple locations generally referred to as temporary jobsites.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approximately 90 percent are considered to be ``small entities'' under the criterion established in Section 605(b)
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980. Most of the radiography licensees are in the business of non-destructive
testing in which radiography represents only a part of their total income. A few small firms work only in radiography.
Much of the work in the field involves the inspection of welds in bridges, oil, gas, and other pipelines and in the steel
framework of commercial buildings under construction so that the success and viability of the industry is closely
tied to the economic health of the country. NRC surveys indicated that 76 percent of NRC radiography licensees had
annual receipts of over $500,000, and most of the remainder had annual receipts exceeding $250,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 605 (b)), the Commission believes that this rule
may, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revisions to part 34 are intended to provide additional safety requirements to enhance the level of protection
of radiographers and the public and to clarify the regulations so that licensees may have a better understanding of
what is expected in radiographic operations. The proposed rule includes a number of radiography regulations which
have been adopted by the Agreement States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revisions to part 34 can be grouped into major and minor impacts. Of the five major impacts, the proposed
requirement to have a second qualified individual at temporary jobsites may have a significant effect on small entities,
who would be more likely to use single-person crews. It should be recognized that under the current rule many licensees
already need to have, at least, two qualified individuals present at a temporary jobsite to maintain direct surveillance
of radiographic operations so as to protect against any unauthorized entry into the restricted area. Therefore,
this proposed requirement will only impact those operations where two individuals are not currently required. It
was assumed in the draft Regulatory Analysis that approximately 25 percent of NRC licensees who perform radiography
at temporary jobsites will need to hire and train additional staff to meet the proposed requirement. Other assumptions
used in the draft Regulatory Analysis were that each of these 50 licensees would need to hire 3&hyph;4 additional workers,
and that the cost of each assistant is $24,000 per year including benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other major impacts include mandatory certification requirements for radiographers, additional training
for radiographers' assistants, a specific requirement for a Radiation Safety Officer (RSO) who meets certain training
requirements, requirements for permanent installation alarms, and additional requirements for alarm ratemeters.
The estimated costs for all of these changes are significantly less than the costs associated with adopting the two-person
rule. The initial costs to certify radiographers is approximately $4080. The initial costs for each licensee to provide
an additional eight hours of training for radiographers' assistants is approximately $1,200. The initial costs
to provide the additional training required to meet the proposed RSO requirements is $3,700 per RSO. The initial costs
to install alarms in permanent installations is estimated to be $3,000. The initial costs to purchase additional
upgraded alarm ratemeters is estimated to be $1800. The other proposed revisions which are of a minor nature, would
result in initial costs of $700-$800 per licensee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the proposed rule includes a reduction in the number of field inspections to be conducted, from quarterly
to annual. This reduction would lead to an estimated annual savings to each NRC licensee of approximately $16,000.
The proposed rule also includes a reduction in the frequency for radiation survey instrument calibrations from 3
months to 6 months. This reduction would lead to an estimated annual savings to each NRC licensee of approximately
$1400. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of these changes, the costs to adopt the two-person rule may have the most impact on a substantial number of ``small
entities''; however, the Commission believes that by requiring at least two qualified individuals to always be present
when radiographic operations are being conducted, there will be a significant increase in assurance that operational
safety measures and emergency procedures will be implemented effectively. The potential for a lowering of the risk
of unintended public exposure can be viewed as a potential cost savings to the industry. This proposed rule does not
duplicate or conflict with other Federal rules. No other alternative regulatory provisions that would minimize
the economic impact on small entities were considered.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This action withdraws a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that proposed a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable
to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes. That action would have required modification of the automatic speed
brake control circuit. Since the issuance of the NPRM, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has reconsidered
its position on this safety issue and has concluded that the proposed modification is unnecessary to provide an acceptable
level of safety. Accordingly, the proposed rule is withdrawn.

<SUPPLEM>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to add a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable
to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes, was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 17, 1993 (58 FR 48616). The proposed rule would have required modification of the automatic speed brake
control circuit. That action was prompted by a report of failure of a hydraulic pressure line to a landing gear truck
tilt cylinder, which resulted in inadvertent deployment of the automatic speed brake. The proposed actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were intended to prevent inadvertent in-flight operation of the automatic speed brake system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Boeing requests that the proposal be withdrawn. Boeing notes that an AD was not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issued when the Boeing service bulletin (referenced in the notice) was released in 1971 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because, at that time, neither Boeing nor the FAA considered that there was an unsafe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition addressed. Boeing has carefully examined the scenario of the incident of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inadvertent deployment of the automatic speed brake that prompted issuance of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal, and finds that the incident did not occur during airline operations, but during a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Boeing test flight. Specifically, the incident occurred while the airplane was conducting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``touch and go's'' (which are not allowed in airline operations), which allowed the landing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gear trucks to move out of the fully tilted position and initiated extension of the automatic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
speed brake. The pilot immediately recognized this and retracted the spoilers manually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(On Boeing Model 747 series airplanes equipped with triple slotted flaps, once the spoilers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are retracted, the hydraulic flow redirects to the flaps immediately, and the lift is regained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with minimal altitude loss.) Boeing points out that, during this incident, the reported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6-foot loss in altitude occurred when the airplane was at around 100 feet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, Boeing asserts that the reason for issuance of its service bulletin, containing procedures for installing
the modification of the automatic speed brake control circuit, was not only to add better protection for the circuit,
but to minimize the ``pitch up'' on the ground during landing. If the number four hydraulic system (which powers the
inboard spoilers) is inoperative, a ``pitch up'' would occur with outboard spoilers only. Boeing asserts that the
pilot can easily compensate for this condition by using his/her hand and the speed brake levers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the information discussed above, Boeing requests that the proposal be withdrawn. 
<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to these comments, the FAA acknowledges that issuance of the notice was based on a recommendation of the
Systems Review Task Force (SRTF). The SRTF has completed an extensive review process to ``*&blank;*&blank;* determine
possible design concepts that will provide alternative means of control of flight critical functions in the event
of total loss of all (normal) redundant systems which provide that control *&blank;*&blank;*'' The SRTF's charter
was specifically oriented toward identifying alternative means to ensure controllability of airplanes that have
lost all normal flight control functions, while maintaining basic airplane structural integrity. The SRTF recommended
incorporation of the modification described in Boeing Service Bulletin 27&hyph;2066, Revision 1, dated August
20, 1971, which was referenced in the notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, after further study of the Boeing service bulletin and its intent, the FAA has determined that failure to
incorporate the modification described in that service bulletin does not degrade the flight safety of the airplane.
While the modification adds logic to prevent uncommanded deployment on touchdown for airplanes equipped with auto
speed brakes, the effects of such deployment can be readily rectified by manually retracting the spoilers. Although
the installation of the proposed modification would add additional protection against inadvertent deployment
of the speed brakes and thereby minimize the pitch up on the ground as a result of such deployment, this condition does
not cause loss of hydraulics, does not affect airplane symmetry, and does not significantly degrade airplane flight
controllability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon further consideration, the FAA has determined that this condition does not present an unsafe condition that
would warrant the proposed mandatory corrective action. Accordingly, the proposed rule is hereby withdrawn. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Withdrawal of this notice of proposed rulemaking constitutes only such action, and does not preclude the agency from
issuing another notice in the future, nor does it commit the agency to any course of action in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since this action only withdraws a notice of proposed rulemaking, it is neither a proposed nor a final rule and therefore,
is not covered under Executive Order 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, or DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979).

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Fokker Model
F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes. This proposal would require inspections to detect cracks of certain demountable
flange (inboard) wheel subassemblies and of the bolt bosses on certain demountable flange (outboard) wheel subassemblies,
and modification or replacement, if necessary. This proposal is prompted by reports of cracks and broken spokes found
on certain main wheel assemblies of these airplanes. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevent loss of a main wheel assembly during takeoff or landing.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Rijksluchtvaartdienst (RLD), which is the airworthiness authority for the Netherlands, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes. The RLD advises that
several operators of Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes have reported finding cracks and broken spokes on certain
main wheel assemblies, part number 5008131&hyph;4. Investigation revealed that the manufacturer of these wheels
had discontinued a shot-peening procedure that was part of the manufacturing process prior to April 1991. Subsequently,
an improved shot-peening procedure on the mating surfaces of the inboard wheel subassemblies was introduced in October
1992. However, this procedure was not introduced on the outboard wheel subassemblies until February 1993. Consequently,
a number of units were produced that are prone to fretting and cracking due to a lack of shot-peening of the assembly
mating surfaces and bolt bosses. This condition, if not corrected, could result in loss of a main wheel assembly during
takeoff or landing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fokker has issued Service Bulletins SBF100&hyph;32&hyph;070, dated January 18, 1993, and SBF100&hyph;32&hyph;073,
dated September 10, 1993, which reference Aircraft Braking Systems Corporation (ABSC) Service Bulletins Fo100&hyph;32&hyph;46,
dated December 24, 1992, and Fo100&hyph;32&hyph;48, dated March 10, 1993, as the appropriate sources of service
information. The RLD classified these Fokker service bulletins as mandatory and issued Netherlands Airworthiness
Directive (BLA) 93&hyph;009/3 (A), dated June 1, 1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes
in the Netherlands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ABSC Service Bulletin Fo100&hyph;32&hyph;46 describes procedures for eddy current inspections to detect cracks
of certain demountable flange (inboard) wheel subassemblies; and, if no cracks are found, modification and subsequent
inspections of the subassemblies; and, if cracks are found, replacement of the subassemblies with serviceable parts.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ABSC Service Bulletin Fo100&hyph;32&hyph;48 describes procedures for eddy current inspections to detect cracks
of the bolt bosses of certain demountable flange (outboard) wheel subassemblies; and, if no cracks are found, modification
of the subassemblies; and, if cracks are found, replacement of the subassemblies with serviceable parts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in the Netherlands and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the RLD has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the RLD, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require repetitive eddy current inspections to detect
cracks of certain demountable flange (inboard) wheel subassemblies and of the bolt bosses of certain demountable
flange (outboard) wheel subassemblies, and modification or replacement, if necessary. Replacement of a cracked
wheel subassembly terminates certain repetitive inspections required by this AD. The actions would be required
to be accomplished in accordance with the ABSC service bulletins described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 87 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
14 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed inspection and modification, and that the average labor rate
is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated
to be $66,990, or $770 per airplane. This total cost figure assumes that no operator has yet accomplished the proposed
requirements of this AD action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would revise and update the procedures governing the imposition and adjudication of program sanctions
predicated on recommendations of State Utilization and Quality Control Peer Review Organizations (PROs). These
changes are necessitated by statutory revisions addressing health care fraud and abuse issues and the OIG sanctions
process. In addition, this proposed rule also sets forth new appeal and reinstatement procedures for practitioners
and other persons excluded by the OIG based on a PRO recommendation.

The Medicare Utilization and Quality Control Peer Review Organization (PRO) program was established to ensure that
Medicare beneficiaries receive medical care that meets professionally recognized standards. Section 1156 of the
Social Security Act (the Act) sets forth specific statutory obligations imposed on practitioners and other persons
to furnish necessary services meeting professionally recognized standards. The statute also authorizes the Secretary,
based on a PRO's recommendation, to impose sanctions (exclusion from Medicare and any State health care program participation
as defined under section 1128 of the Act or a monetary penalty) on those who fail to comply with the statutory obligations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under the PRO sanction process, no practitioner or other person is recommended for exclusion or the imposition of
a monetary penalty until the PRO provides the opportunity for extensive discussion with the practitioner or other
person, and the opportunity to provide additional information. After receipt of a recommendation from a PRO, the
Office of Inspector General (OIG) excludes, or imposes a monetary penalty, only after a careful review of all the documentation
submitted and a separate determination that the practitioner or other person has violated the statutory obligations
to render only medically necessary and appropriate care that meets professionally recognized standards or has failed
to provide evidence of medical necessity and quality, and is unwilling or unable to comply with those obligations.
A practitioner or other person who is excluded from Medicare and any State health care programs as defined in section
1128(h) of the Act, or assessed a monetary penalty, on the basis of a PRO finding is entitled to administrative and judicial
review after the exclusion is imposed or the monetary penalty is assessed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Prior to the enactment of Public Law 100&hyph;93 (the Medicare and Medicaid Patient and Program Protection Act of
1987), section 1156 of the Act set forth obligations of practitioners and other persons providing care to Medicare
patients to provide care that was medically necessary and appropriate that meets professionally recognized standards
of quality, and appropriately documented. It also provided for the exclusion from Medicare of practitioners and
other persons who, upon the review and recommendation of a PRO, were found to have violated those obligations. Section
6 of Public Law 100&hyph;93 extended those obligations to encompass all health care services for which payment may
be made under the Act, and not just Medicare. Further, the exclusion authority was extended to encompass violations
occurring in, and exclusions from, Medicaid, the title V Maternal and Child Health Block Grant, and the title XX Social
Services Block Grant programs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 4095 of Public Law 100&hyph;203, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1987, amended section 1156
of the Act to provide that an exclusion of a health care practitioner or other person who practices in a country of less
than 70,000 people or in a rural health professional shortage area (HPSA) cannot be effectuated until an opportunity
is provided for a preliminary administrative hearing. The purpose of this preliminary hearing is to determine whether
the practitioner's or other person's continued program participation, through the conclusion of the administrative
proceedings on the merits of the exclusion, would place beneficiaries at serious risk. In accordance with section
1156(b)(5) of the Act, unless the administrative law judge (ALJ) at the preliminary hearing determines that the practitioner
or other person will pose a serious risk to Medicare beneficiaries if permitted to continue furnishing such services,
the exclusion of a rural practitioner or other person may not be effectuated until they are given an opportunity for
an administrative hearing on the merits of the exclusion itself.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 4205 of Public Law 101&hyph;508, OBRA 1990, set forth new statutory requirements with respect to PRO sanction
activities. Specifically, the statutory amendments require PROs, if appropriate, to offer a corrective action
plan to practitioners and other persons prior to making a finding under section 1156 of the Act; and require the Secretary
to consider, in determining whether a practitioner or other person is willing and able to comply with his, her or its
obligations, whether the practitioner or other person entered into and successfully completed a corrective action
plan prior to the PRO's submission of its recommendation and report to the Secretary.

A. Inclusion of the OBRA 1990 Provisions Relating to PROs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On January 29, 1992, the OIG published a final rule (57 FR 3298) setting forth amendments to the OIG's exclusion and
civil money penalty (CMP) authorities resulting from Public Law 100&hyph;93. Specifically, that final rule revised
&sect;1004.130 of the regulations and deleted &sect;1004.100(g) in its entirety to be consistent with the establishment
of a new part 1005_Appeals of exclusions, civil money penalties and assessments_which now governs ALJ hearings and
subsequent appeals to the Secretary for all CMP and other OIG sanction cases.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The revisions to 42 CFR part 1004 of that final rule were meant only to conform the regulations to new statutory changes
resulting from OBRA 1990, and were not meant to be a comprehensive rewrite of part 1004. This regulation sets forth
a more complete and comprehensive rewrite of this part. Among other revisions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;These proposed regulations would eliminate the current procedural distinction between ``substantial''
violations and ``gross and flagrant'' violations. This is an artificially created procedure that has no basis in
law or legislative history to provide a distinction between the two types of violations. Experience in processing
these cases has shown that the second meeting is just a repeat of the first meeting since the present regulations preclude
any new violations identified in the second meeting as serving as the basis for a sanction recommendation. Under these
proposed regulations, which are consistent with a recommendation from the Administrative Conference of the United
States, an opportunity would be provided for a meeting with the PRO and to provide additional information. The regulations
would also provide that any violations of the obligations that are identified during a corrective action plan period
would be used to support the PRO's recommendation regarding unwillingness or inability to comply with the statutory
obligations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;These proposed regulations also codify the agreement reached among the American Medical Association, the
American Association of Retired Persons, the Health Care Financing Administration, and the Office of Inspector
General with regard to PRO physicians involved in the sanctions process. Under this agreement, no physician member
of the PRO panel may be in direct competition with, or have a substantial personal bias against, the practitioner or
other person being considered for sanction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 1004.30(e) of these proposed regulations would provide instructions to the PROs on the actions to
be taken when a physician relocates after receiving a sanction notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Among the factors considered by the OIG in imposing an exclusion, in addition to the practitioner's or other
person's previous sanction record, are any prior problems that such person has had with the Medicare carrier or intermediary.
We are now proposing to include as an additional factor any prior problems that any State health care program has had
with such practitioner or other person.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The current language of &sect;1004.90(b)(1) concerning the OIG's review responsibilities (that would now
be designated as &sect;1004.100(b)(1)) would be modified to state that the OIG will review the PRO report to determine
whether the PRO followed the ``regulatory requirements of part 1004.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The existing definition of the term ``physician'' appearing in &sect;1004.1 would be deleted in order to conform
with the HCFA definition of this term.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
B. Preliminary Hearings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
These proposed regulations would amend part 1004 by allowing a practitioner or other person in specified rural areas
or counties of a specified population to request a preliminary hearing when notified of an exclusion from participation
in the Medicare program by the OIG as a result of a PRO recommendation under section 1156(b) of the Act. The preliminary
hearing would be solely on the issue of whether such practitioner's or other person's continued participation in
the program during the appeal to an ALJ would place program beneficiaries at serious risk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Criteria for entitlement.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Entitlement to such a preliminary hearing would apply to providers or practitioners for whom an exclusion is proposed
who practice in a rural Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) for their specialty or in a county with a population
of less than 70,000. For purposes of this entitlement, a practitioner's or other person's practice is where over 50
percent of his, her or its services are rendered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Health professional shortage areas are designated by the Secretary and are defined in regulations at 42 CFR 5.2. Since
HPSAs are not specifically designated by rural or urban classifications, we are proposing that any HPSA not located
in a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) would be considered a rural HPSA for purposes of these regulations. Both
section 1886(d)(2) of the Act and regulations at 42 CFR 412.62(f) use these MSAs as the basis for determining an urban
area or rural area for computing Medicare prospective payment rates. Although Public Law 100&hyph;203 divided the
definition of urban into large urban and other urban areas, it did not change the differentiation between urban and
rural. Therefore, we are proposing to classify any HPSA not located in a MSA as rural.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are seven different HPSA specialty categories. These HPSA specialty categories are described in current regulations
at 42 CFR part 5, Appendices A through G, and include primary medical care, dental, psychiatric, vision care, podiatric,
pharmacy and veterinary manpower. In determining eligibility for a preliminary hearing, we are proposing to use
these categories for all practitioners and other persons to whom they apply. For all practitioners not covered by
the specialty categories, we are proposing to use the ``primary medical care'' specialty category for determining
eligibility for a preliminary hearing. This means that any practitioner who practices a specialty other than those
identified in 42 CFR part 5 will be regarded as practicing in a rural HPSA only if that area is designated as an HPSA for
``primary medical care.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``primary medical care'' category will also be used for all other persons and facilities, e.g., hospitals, with
the exception of those ``other persons'' qualified under the ``psychiatric'' manpower category.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information on a county's population size would be obtained by the OIG from the responsible officials of that county.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Timeframes for hearing
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The proposed regulations provide that a practitioner's or other person's request for a preliminary hearing must
be received within 15 days of receipt of an OIG exclusion notice. Once such a request is received, the preliminary hearing
is to be held and a decision rendered on the ``serious risk'' issue within 45 days. In those cases where the ALJ grants
a stay of the exclusion, a full hearing must be held and a decision rendered within six months. These timeframes developed
for the ALJs are intended to balance the right of a ``rural'' practitioner or other person to receive timely due process
against the OIG responsibility to ensure that substandard or unnecessary health care services are not provided to
program beneficiaries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Sanctions Notification Process
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1156(b)(2) of the Act requires reasonable notice to the public of a sanction action being taken against a practitioner
or other person based on the PRO's recommendation. Under the current implementing regulations, when a sanction action
is taken by the OIG against a practitioner or other person, the OIG is required to notify the general public of such action.
This notice to the public specifically identifies: (1) The sanctioned practitioner or other person; (2) the obligation
that has been violated by this person; (3) the specific sanction action imposed; and (4) if the sanction is an exclusion,
the effective date and duration of this action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this public notification process has worked well in most instances, we believe the present publication procedure
may not always yield the most effective results of informing affected parties and program beneficiaries of a specific
sanction action taken under the program. As a result, we are considering permitting practitioners and other persons
to select an alternative method of notification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed regulations would amend 42 CFR part 1004 to offer sanctioned health care practitioners and other persons
the option of informing all their patients directly of a sanction action taken against them. If they select this option
and comply with its requirements in a timely fashion, this compliance would constitute public notice and would replace
the public notice currently published by the OIG. Among other things, a practitioner or other person opting for this
method of notification would be required to certify to the Department that they have undertaken to inform all their
patients of the action taken and, in the case of exclusion, that they will notify new patients before furnishing services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Method of direct notification of patients by practitioner or other person
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. We considered a variety of methods for practitioners and other persons to notify and inform patients of a sanction
action. For example, we considered having the sanctioned party (1) post a sign in his, her or its office; (2) verbally
communicate the information to patients when they called for an appointment or came to an office visit; or (3) send
written notification to each of his, her or its patients. After evaluating the options, we believe that the first two
methods indicated above would not effectively meet the proposed requirement that all existing patients be informed
within 30 calendar days since it is unlikely that all of these patients would make an appointment or come for an office
visit in the specified period. In addition, the Department would be unable to verify that the proper information had
been adequately conveyed to the patients if either of the first two notification methods were selected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We, therefore, propose that each sanctioned practitioner or other person opting for this alternative notification
procedure alert both his, her or its existing patients and all new patients through written notification based on
a suggested (non-mandatory) model that will be provided to the sanctioned individual by the OIG. If the sanctioned
party is a hospital, the hospital would be required to notify all physicians having privileges at the hospital, as
well as post a sign in its emergency room, business office and in all affiliated entities regarding its sanction. (Practitioners
and other persons must also notify all new patients orally at the time an appointment is set to provide services, as
well as provide written notification to such patients at the time they arrive to see the provider for treatment or services.)
We believe that only through this method can the OIG assure that all patients are properly informed of a sanction action.

Certification of notice to patients.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the sanctioned practitioner or other person chooses to use the alternative notification approach, he, she or it
would be given 30 calendar days from receipt of the notification from the OIG to return an OIG-prepared certification
form stating that: (1) He, she or it has informed each of their existing patients that a sanction has been imposed; (2)
if excluded from Federal programs, the program will not pay for items and services ordered, furnished or prescribed
by the practitioner or other person and that this ban will remain in effect until the practitioner or other person is
reinstated; (3) if excluded, he, she or it will provide this information, prior to providing services, to any new patient
seen until he, she or it is reinstated; and (4) he, she or it certifies to the truthfulness and accuracy of the notification
and the statements in the certification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Non-election of the alternative method of notification.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the sanctioned practitioner or other person does not elect this alternative method of notification of informing
his, her or its patients and returning the certification form within the proposed 30-day period, the OIG would follow
its standard procedure for public notification, which consists of notifying the public directly of the identity
of the sanctioned practitioner or other person, the obligation that has been violated, and the effective date and
duration of any exclusion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Failure to comply with alternative method of notification after electing such method.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the sanctioned practitioner or other person elects the alternative method of notification by returning the certification
form within the proposed 30-day period, but the OIG receives reliable evidence that such practitioner or other person
has not adequately informed his, her or its new and existing patients of the sanction, the OIG would follow its standard
procedure for public notification as described above. Once a practitioner or other person has elected the alternative
notification option by returning the certification form to the OIG, his, her or its failure to follow through and fully
comply with the notification requirements will be considered adversely at the time of his, her or its application
for reinstatement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to ensure that patient notification is enforced and provided in a timely manner so that patients are not at
risk of receiving poor quality of care, we are soliciting comments on how best to enforce this provision. Under this
proposed approach, when the OIG learns through patient complaints or other forms that the practitioner or other person
has not fully complied, the IG at that point may additionally consider specific action to remedy the situation, such
as pursuing penalties for the filing of a false statement. Comments on this alternative notice process and on whether
this enforcement approach is reasonable and effective are specifically invited.

A. Regulatory Impact Statement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Management and Budget has reviewed this proposed rule in accordance with the provisions of Executive
Order 12866. As indicated above, the revisions contained in this proposed rule are intended to revise and update administrative
procedures governing the imposition and adjudication of program sanctions, based on PRO recommendations, against
practitioners and other persons who violate the statute. We believe that the great majority of practitioners and
other persons do not engage in such prohibited activities and practices, and that the aggregate economic impact of
these provisions should, in effect, be minimal, affecting only those who have engaged in prohibited behavior in violation
of statutory intent. As such, these regulations should have no direct effect on the economy or on Federal or State expenditures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, we generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612), unless the Secretary certifies that a proposed regulation would not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. While some sanctions and penalties may have an impact on
small entities, we do not anticipate that a substantial number of these small entities would be significantly affected
by this rulemaking. Therefore, since we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this proposed rule would
not have a significant economic impact on a number of small business entities, we have not prepared a regulatory flexibility
analysis.

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Right to preliminary hearing. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1)(i) A practitioner or other person excluded from participation in Medicare and any State health care programs
under section 1156 of the Act may request a preliminary hearing if the location where services are rendered to over
50 percent of the practitioners's or other person's patients at the time of the exclusion notice is in a rural HPSA or
in a county with a population of less than 70,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Unless the practitioner's or other person's practice meets the definition for psychiatric professional, vision
care professional, dental professional, podiatric professional or pharmacy professional, the HPSA used by the
OIG for determination of entitlement to a preliminary hearing will be the HPSA list for primary medical care professional.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Information on the population size of a county in order to determine entitlement to a preliminary hearing will
be obtained by the OIG from the responsible officials of that county.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2)(i) A request for a preliminary hearing must be made in writing and received by the Departmental Appeals Board (DAB)
no later than the 15th day after the notice of exclusion is received by a practitioner or other person. The date of receipt
of the notice of exclusion by the practitioner or other person is presumed to be 5 days after the date appearing on the
notice, unless there is a reasonable showing to the contrary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A request for a preliminary hearing will stay the effective date of the exclusion pending a decision of the ALJ
at the preliminary hearing, and all the parties informed by the OIG of the exclusion will be notified of the stay.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A request for a preliminary hearing received after the 15-day period has expired will be treated as a request
for a hearing before an ALJ in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) If the practitioner or other person exercises his, her or its right to a preliminary hearing, such a hearing must
be held by the ALJ in accordance with paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section unless the OIG waives it in accordance with
paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The ALJ cannot consolidate the preliminary hearing with a full hearing without the approval of all parties to the
hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3)(i) The preliminary hearing will be conducted by an ALJ of the DAB in a city that the ALJ deems equitable to all parties.
The ALJ will conduct the preliminary hearing and render a decision no later than 45 days after receipt of the request
for such a hearing by the DAB. Date of receipt by the DAB is presumed to be 5 days after the date on the request for a preliminary
hearing, unless there is a reasonable showing to the contrary. A reasonable extension to the 45-day period of up to
15 days may be requested by any party to the preliminary hearing and such a request may be granted upon concurrence by
all parties to the preliminary hearing. Such request must be received no later than 15 days prior to the scheduled date
of the preliminary hearing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The only issue to be heard and decided on at the preliminary hearing is whether the practitioners's or other person's
continued participation in the Medicare and State health care programs during the appeal of the exclusion before
an ALJ would place program beneficiaries at serious risk.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iii) In the interest of time, the ALJ may issue an oral decision to be followed by a written decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) In those cases where the ALJ has stayed an exclusion after a preliminary hearing, a full hearing must be held and
a decision rendered by the ALJ within 6 months. If, for any reason, the request for a full hearing before the ALJ is withdrawn
or dismissed, the exclusion for the period that has not been served will be effective 5 days after the notice of the withdrawal
or dismissal is received in the OIG headquarters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The preliminary hearing decision is not appealable or subject to further administrative or judicial review.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) A practitioner or other person found at the preliminary hearing not to place program beneficiaries at serious
risk, but later determined to have been properly excluded from program participation after a full hearing before
an ALJ, is not entitled to have the exclusion stayed further during an appeal to the DAB. Exclusions in such instances
will be effective 5 days after receipt of the ALJ decision in the OIG headquarters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6)(i) After notice of a timely request for a preliminary hearing, the OIG may determine that the practitioner's or
other person's continued program participation during the appeal before the ALJ will not program beneficiaries
at serious risk and waive the preliminary hearing. Under these circumstances, the exclusion will be stayed pending
the decision of the ALJ after a full hearing. The hearing must be held, and a decision reached, within 6 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the OIG decides to waive the preliminary hearing, the request for the preliminary hearing will be considered
a request for a hearing before the ALJ in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Right to administrative review. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) A practitioner of other person dissatisfied with an OIG determination, or an exclusion that results from a determination
not being made within 120 days, is entitled to appeal such sanction in accordance with part 1005 of this chapter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Due to the 120-day statutory requirement specified in &sect;1004.100(e), the following limitations apply_

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FTA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 9, 1993, at 58 FR 64856, concerning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the creation of a State oversight agency that would develop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain procedures for overseeing the safety of rail fixed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guideway systems. FTA has determined that a public hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would help in the development of the final rule. FTA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordingly will hold the hearing in conjunction with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conference sponsored by the American Public Transit Association 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(APTA), which will be attended by State and local transit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representatives. The hearing will be held on March 8, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of this action, FTA is extending the comment period.

The hearing will be held on March 8, 1994, in the Grand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ballroom_Salon D at the J.W. Marriott Hotel, 1331 Pennsylvania 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20004. It will begin at 8 a.m. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(EST). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those interested in providing comments on the NPRM may respond 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in writing to the docket or participate in the public hearings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and are encouraged to do both. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FTA has established the following procedures to facilitate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearings. Those wishing to participate in the public hearings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should contact either Mr. Franz Gimmler or Mr. Roy Field by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
telephone at (202) 366&hyph;2896, by fax at (202) 366&hyph;3765, or in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
writing at the address in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
section at least three business days before the hearing is to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
held or register with the FTA on the day of the hearing. Those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contacting FTA at least three business days before the hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is scheduled may request a particular time to testify. FTA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will try to accommodate those requests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For those who have not contacted FTA at least three business 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days in advance, a registration desk will be available at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing site on the day of the hearing. Individuals may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
register beginning one hour before the hearing is scheduled to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
start. The registration desk will remain open until the hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
begins, after which FTA staff will try to accommodate late 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registrants. Time permitting, individuals will testify in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order in which they have registered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those who request to testify may be given ten minutes to make a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement or present other relevant documents which will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the docket. FTA encourages those individuals to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submit a written statement which will also be included in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those individuals in need of an oral interpreter should inform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Gimmler or Mr. Field of that need also at least three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business days before the hearing is to be held. Unless 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested three business days before the hearing, an oral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpreter will not be provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A hearing officer will preside over the hearing. The hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officer may make a statement to clarify issues or facilitate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussion during the hearing . Any statements the hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officer makes during a hearing are not intended to be and should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be construed as a position of the FTA with respect to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NPRM or any future rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hearing will be recorded by a court reporter. A transcript 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the hearing will be included in the official rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Docket 92&hyph;D and be available for inspection. Any individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interested in a copy of the transcript of a hearing may contact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the court reporter directly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hearing is designed to solicit public views and information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the NPRM. Therefore, the hearing will be conducted in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
informal and nonadversarial manner. However, the hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officer may ask questions in order to clarify statements made at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the hearing. To facilitate comment and get a broad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cross-section of views, the FTA may ask some of those who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
register in advance to participate on a panel during the hearing.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In order to approve a postsecondary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education institution to participate in the student financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance programs authorized by Title IV of the HEA (Title IV, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA programs) and many other Federal programs, the Secretary must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine, in part, that the institution satisfies the statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of an ``institution of higher education.'' Under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA and other Federal statutes, one element of that definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires an eligible institution of higher education to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accredited or preaccredited by an accrediting agency recognized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the Secretary as a reliable authority as to the quality of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education or training provided by the institution. Another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
element requires an eligible institution to be legally authorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to provide an educational program beyond the secondary level in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State in which it is located. Thus, the statutory definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an institution of higher education provides the framework for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a shared responsibility among accrediting agencies, States, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Federal government to ensure that the ``gate'' to the Title IV, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA programs is opened to only those institutions that provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students with quality education or training worth the time, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
energy, and money they invest in it. The three ``gatekeepers'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sharing this responsibility have traditionally been referred to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as ``the triad.'' While the concept of a triad of entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible for gatekeeping has had a long history, the triad has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not always worked as effectively as it should to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
educational quality, nor has it served as an effective deterrent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to abuse by institutions participating in the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. For several years, certain institutions participating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Title IV, HEA programs have failed to provide students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with education or training of an acceptable level of quality; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they have also failed to treat students fairly. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they have failed to meet acceptable standards of financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility and administrative capability and to adequately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protect Title IV, HEA program funds entrusted to them. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions that have engaged in these abusive practices are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restricted to a particular sector of higher education. Rather, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the abuses have been found in all types of institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participating in the Title IV, HEA programs, including those in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the private non-profit and public sectors of higher education as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well as those in the proprietary sector. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the same time, gatekeeping functions have not been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carried out effectively. For example, some accrediting agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have not taken sufficient care to ensure the quality of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education or training provided by the institutions or programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they accredit or to protect student interests when they accredit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular institutions or programs. Moreover, some States have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also not taken sufficient care to ensure the quality of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education or training provided by the institutions they authorize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or license to operate in the State or to protect student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interests. Finally, the Federal government's management of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities to determine eligibility and to certify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs has not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
always been adequate to prevent abusive practices at institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that participate in those programs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consequently, in the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 102&hyph;325, (the Amendments of 1992), Congress provided for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a new part H of Title IV entitled ``Program Integrity Triad.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under that part, States and accrediting agencies are required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assume major new oversight responsibilities, and States, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accrediting associations, and the Secretary are linked to create 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a stronger and more coordinated evaluation of institutions that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate or wish to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that the most appropriate approach to this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coordinated evaluation of institutions by the three components of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the triad is a complementary one with each component focusing its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation on its obligations within the context of the HEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the focus for accrediting agencies is the quality of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education or training provided by the institutions or programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they accredit. For States, which already had responsibility for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining that institutions have the legal authority to operate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the State, the HEA added a new focus: reviewing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions that trigger certain statutory review criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The focus of the Secretary's evaluation of institutions is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative and financial capacity of those institutions to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in the Title IV, HEA programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute allocates legal responsibility among the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities that compose the program integrity triad. While the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific statutory responsibilities for the three triad entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may overlap, when viewed as a whole the triad brings together in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a coordinated fashion three different but very important aspects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of institutional review. Within this statutory scheme, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary has sought to assure that the gatekeeping system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operates as efficiently as possible, with maximum integration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
among the three triad entities and without unnecessary burden on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
postsecondary institutions. In order to assist the Secretary in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designing a final regulation that achieves these goals, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary specifically requests comment on the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
questions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In several areas, the statute specifically requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each triad entity to evaluate an institution under the same or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar standards. For example, a SPRE and an accrediting agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may establish different standards for evaluating the financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility of an institution or for evaluating the success of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an institution's educational program. Thus, a reviewed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution would need to satisfy the SPRE's and the accrediting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's standards even though those standards address the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas. How should final regulations be structured to both reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the burden on institutions and enable the triad entities to carry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
out effectively their statutory functions? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Should final regulations be more explicit in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identifying levels, characteristics, or definitions for any of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the assessment or review criteria that a triad entity is expected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to consider in its evaluation of an institution? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart 1 of part H creates a new program, the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Postsecondary Review Program, or SPRP, under which State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oversight of institutions participating in the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs is strengthened. Subpart 2 of part H establishes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures and criteria under which the Secretary recognizes an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accrediting agency as a reliable authority as to the quality of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the education or training offered by institutions that the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accredits. Lastly, subpart 3 specifies the procedures the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary uses to determine whether an institution meets the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility requirements and has the administrative capacity and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial responsibility to administer the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 24, 1994, the Secretary published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the NPRMs to implement the SPRP provisions in subpart 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of part H of the HEA (59 FR 3604) and the accrediting agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions in subpart 2 of part H of the HEA (59 FR 3578). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's publication of this NPRM prior to the publication of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final regulations implementing the SPRP and accreditation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions provides the Department of Education an opportunity to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coordinate all comments received on the triad. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions of subpart 3 that pertain to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutional eligibility requirements found in 34 CFR part 600 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been addressed in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 10, 1994, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposes changes to 34 CFR part 600. This NPRM addresses those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of subpart 3 that pertain to subparts A and B of 34 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFR part 668. Subpart A contains definitions applicable to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA programs. Subpart B contains requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial and continued participation in the programs. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular, the following provisions in this NPRM address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of subpart 3: Proposed &sect;&sect;668.15 and 668.16 delineate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the standards for the evaluation of an institution's financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility and administrative capability, respectively, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by section 498(a), (c), and (d) of the HEA. Proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;668.15 also codifies the definition of persons who exercise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial control of an institution found in section 498(e) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the HEA. Proposed &sect;668.12 addresses the requirements of section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
498(b) of the HEA that requires the Secretary to develop a single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application form to be used by institutions that wish to apply to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate or to continue to participate in a Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. Proposed &sect;668.13 includes the provisions governing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement of financial guarantees from owners found in section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
498(e) of the HEA, addresses the provision that requires the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary to establish a schedule for the expiration of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval of institutions to participate in the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs found in section 498(g) of the HEA, and codifies the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions governing provisional certification of institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found in section 498(h) of the HEA. Pursuant to sections 498(g) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (h) of the HEA, proposed &sect;668.26 delineates the date that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's period of participation would end, when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's period of participation expires, or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's provisional certification is revoked.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Amendments of 1992 amended the HEA in several areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relating to the participation of institutions in the Title IV, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA programs. The Student Assistance General Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations contain requirements that are common to educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions that participate in the Title IV, HEA programs. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following list summarizes the major issues in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NPRM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Each participating institution is subject to a new statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of an academic year in which a full-time student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(with respect to an undergraduate course of study), during a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum 30-week period, must complete: At institutions that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measure program length in credit hours, at least 24 semester 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or trimester hours or 36 quarter hours; or at institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that measure program length in clock hours, at least 900 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clock hours. Section 668.2 proposes to clarify the terms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used in the statutory definition of academic year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The statute now mandates the definition of an eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program for proprietary institutions of higher education and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
postsecondary vocational institutions, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``short-term'' programs (at least 300 but less than 600 clock 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours) that would be eligible for the FFEL programs only. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute requires that these programs must have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completion and placement rates of at least 70 percent, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measured in accordance with regulations. Section 668.8 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposes methodologies for those measurements. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary eventually may propose a single methodology (based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on comments on this NPRM, regulations to implement the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Student Right-to-Know Act, and other NPRMs) to be used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wherever appropriate in regulations for the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. In accordance with the statute, this NPRM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contains further provisions to evaluate the quality of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs, specifically a requirement proposed by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary that a program may not exceed by more than 50 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent the minimum number of clock hours required by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State for training in the recognized occupation for which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the program prepares students, and a requirement that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program be in existence for at least one year before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applying for eligibility under these criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;This NPRM proposes to add two new sections to codify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures with regard to applications to participate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initially or to continue to participate in a Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program (proposed &sect;668.12) and procedures by which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary certifies that an institution meets the standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in subpart B of these regulations and accordingly may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in a Title IV, HEA program (proposed &sect;668.13). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;668.13 also includes proposed procedures whereby 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary codifies new statutory provisions governing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisional certification procedures for participation in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA program. Provisional certification permits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary to allow an institution that otherwise would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not qualify to participate in a Title IV, HEA program to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate on a limited basis. The institution is subject 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to shorter periods of participation than a fully certified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution and does not have the right to the extensive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeal proceedings under subpart G of the Student Assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General Provisions if the Secretary revokes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's provisional certification. Instead, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed by the Secretary in this NPRM, the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be offered a modified appeal. Further, an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is provisionally certified may be monitored more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closely to the extent that the Secretary believes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution warrants a greater degree of oversight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 668.14 proposes to amend the regulations governing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program participation agreements to include numerous new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions added by the Amendments of 1992 and provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously prescribed by the HEA but not specifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spelled out in the regulations. This section also includes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions proposed by the Secretary. This NPRM proposes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement statutory requirements regarding disclosure of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revenues and expenses for institutions that offer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
athletically related student aid. This NPRM would also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
address statutory requirements concerning incentive payments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based directly or indirectly on success in securing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollments or financial aid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;This NPRM proposes significant changes to &sect;668.15 (currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;668.13) the section governing the evaluation of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's financial responsibility. The NPRM proposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to strengthen the factors used to evaluate an institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial responsibility and to reflect statutory changes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including the provision that requires that any standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developed for the determination of an institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial responsibility take into account any differences 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in accounting principles between for-profit and nonprofit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions. For example, this NPRM proposes to require a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for-profit institution to have a ratio of current assets to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current liabilities of 1.25:1 and a nonprofit institution to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1:1. As the statute requires the establishment of cash 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reserves sufficient to ensure repayment of any required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refunds, the NPRM also proposes to require each institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to maintain a minimum cash reserve of at least 10 percent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution's total deferred tuition income at the end 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the institution's most recent fiscal year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;This NPRM proposes, in &sect;668.16 (currently &sect;&sect;668.14 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
668.15) to strengthen and expand the standards of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative capability for participating institutions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addressing areas previously not regulated or for which there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were only guidelines, such as: The maximum time frame 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowed in the standards for satisfactory academic progress 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for completion of a student's educational program and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expansion of standards to include those general areas that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be reviewed by State postsecondary review entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(SPREs). The SPRE review areas are included because these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas may have a significant bearing on an institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative capability and thus should be considered as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary reviews the administrative capability of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the NPRM does solicit comments on whether these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional proposed standards should be implemented across 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the board or be made applicable only to institutions that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet specific criteria or thresholds, e.g., institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with short-term programs and institutions with a history of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative problems. For example, this section of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NPRM includes the proposed requirement that an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that offers a vocational program of less than two years in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
length that prepares students to enter recognized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occupations must demonstrate that the borrower's increased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual expected earnings, based on completion of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training, will exceed the annual amount of Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program assistance received for the programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The provisions in proposed &sect;668.17 (currently &sect;668.15) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governing default reduction measures reflect statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes made by the Amendments of 1992 and current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
departmental practices. The provisions in the Technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendments of 1993 that address institutional appeals of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cohort default rates are not included in this NPRM and will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be addressed separately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;As mandated by statute, all participating institutions are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to implement a fair and equitable refund policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This statutory provision is similar to the requirement for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fair and equitable refunds prescribed by the FFEL program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations for institutions that participate in the FFEL 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. Section 668.22 proposes to clarify the terms used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the statutory definition of a fair and equitable refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy. The NPRM also proposes to mandate a refund policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Appendix A) that an institution must use to calculate a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student's refund if the student is not entitled to a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refund and an institution's State and accrediting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency do not have specific refund standards. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of a new statutory provision that specifies the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order of return of refunds to the Title IV, HEA programs and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other sources of aid without regard to the amount of aid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received from State or private sources, this NPRM proposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to remove the fraction that is currently used to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the portion of the refund attributable to the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs and that attributable to other sources of aid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In accordance with the statute, institutions will now be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to have compliance audits every year rather than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
every two years, as required by current regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 668.23 proposes to allow institutions that do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pose a great financial risk to the Title IV, HEA programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i.e., institutions that received less than $100,000 in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total annual funding under the Title IV, HEA programs or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have not had deficiencies identified in their most recently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted audit reports) to submit audits biennially. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, under this proposal, an institution would not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to submit a compliance audit for any year in which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the total Title IV, HEA program funds it received were less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than $25,000. This section also proposes to extend audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements to foreign institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This NPRM also contains a proposed change to the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pell Grant Program regulations. This NPRM proposes to implement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 487(c)(7) of the HEA that provides that an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may offset the amount of Title IV, HEA program disbursements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against liabilities or may receive reimbursement from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department for those amounts if, in the course of any audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted after December 31, 1988, the Department discovers or is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
informed of any Title IV, HEA program assistance (specifically, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Pell Grant Program funds) that an institution has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided to its students in accordance with program requirements, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but the institution has not previously received credit or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reimbursement for these disbursements. Although this provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relates directly to the Federal Pell Grant Program and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed to be included in the Federal Pell Grant Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, it is contained in Part G of the HEA and is subject 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the negotiated rulemaking process explained below. Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it has been included in this NPRM instead of the Federal Pell 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grant Program NPRM, which was not subject to the negotiated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking process.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under new section 492 of the HEA, these proposed changes are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to the negotiated rulemaking process, which includes a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement for the Secretary to convene regional meetings to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtain public involvement in the development of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. Accordingly, issues related to these proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes were discussed in meetings held in September 1992 in New 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
York City; San Francisco; Atlanta; and Kansas City, Missouri. At 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these meetings, the Secretary provided the attendees with a list 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of issues to be addressed in these proposed regulations. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summary of the responses of the attendees is contained in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix to this preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Groups that attended the regional meetings nominated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals to participate in the regulation negotiations. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary selected regulation negotiators from the names 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nominated and chose negotiators to reflect all the groups that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in the Title IV, HEA programs, such as students, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student financial aid administrators, and various types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed regulations also address statutory changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 103&hyph;208 (the Technical Amendments of 1993). Those areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected by the Technical Amendments of 1993 are identified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the discussion of regulatory changes. The Secretary notes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the statutory changes required by the Technical Amendments of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993 are not subject to the negotiated rulemaking process of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 492 of the HEA.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 492(b) of the HEA, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared draft proposed regulations and negotiated the provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of that draft with negotiators. The great majority of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed changes do not reflect consensus reached at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negotiations (as consensus was rarely obtained). The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has identified in the discussion of changes the areas where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consensus was reached. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following discussion reflects proposed significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes to the existing Student Assistance General Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations and the Federal Pell Grant Program regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed changes are discussed in the order in which they appear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the proposed regulatory text. If a provision applied to more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than one section or is included in more than one section, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed the first time it appears with an appropriate reference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to its other appearances.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to revise this section to remove 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vocational school from the list of what the term institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes, because vocational schools are no longer eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions under the HEA. The Secretary proposes to revise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section to reflect a listing of currently existing Title IV, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA programs that would be subject to part 668. Programs added 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the list would include the National Early Intervention 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Scholarship and Partnership, Presidential Access Scholarship, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Direct Student Loan programs. The Income Contingent Loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program, which no longer exists, would be removed from the list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These revisions reflect statutory changes made to the HEA by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendments of 1992.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section includes definitions proposed in NPRMs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published on October 4, 1993 (58 FR 51716), and on February 17, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994 (in part II) (59 FR 8044). Those definitions are:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repeat the discussion of those definitions here. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to remove the definitions of

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA. The Secretary proposed to move these definitions to 34 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 600 in the NPRM published on February 10, 1994 (59 FR 6446). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary is proposing technical changes to clarify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definitions of the current Title IV, HEA programs and to add 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definitions of the newly authorized Title IV, HEA programs to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conform with statutory changes and for consistency with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminology used in the individual program regulations. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary also proposes to make technical changes in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definitions of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Independent student,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for consistency with other program

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary is proposing to add or amend the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definitions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Academic Year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 481(d)(2) of the HEA provides a definition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
academic year
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to be used for all the Title IV, HEA programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute specifies that in an academic year, a full-time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student is expected to complete at least twenty-four semester or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trimester hours or thirty-six quarter hours at an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that measures program length in credit hours, or at least nine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hundred clock hours at an institution that measures program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
length in clock hours. The definition delineates not only the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum amount of work that a full-time student enrolled in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undergraduate educational program is expected to complete during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an academic year, but also the minimum period of time over which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the work in any educational program must be completed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Technical Amendments of 1993 specify that this provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is only applicable with respect to an undergraduate course of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
study. The Secretary expects that institutions would continue to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use their own academic standards, within the framework of current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program regulations, to determine the amount of work full-time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
graduate and professional students are expected to complete over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a minimum of thirty weeks of instruction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The minimum time period specified is thirty weeks of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructional time. The Technical Amendments of 1993 further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended section 481 of the HEA definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
academic year 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide that the Secretary may reduce, for good cause on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case-by-case basis, the 30-week minimum to not less than 26 weeks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of instructional time in the case of an institution of higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education that provides a 2-year or 4-year program of instruction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for which it awards an associate or baccalaureate degree. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary has been unable to determine a definition of ``good 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause'' that would justify using this authority. In addition, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary is concerned that regulatory standards for those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reductions would encourage many institutions to seek that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment routinely and this implementation would result in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inequitable treatment of Federal student aid recipients from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to institution. Further, the Secretary is concerned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that widespread implementation would result in increased costs to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Title IV, HEA programs. Therefore, the Secretary has not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed specific criteria to implement this technical amendment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at this time. The Secretary requests comments on a definition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``good cause'' and ways of implementing this provision through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations that address the Secretary's concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary has determined that the terms used in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
academic year
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 must be clarified if the definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is to be well-understood and applied consistently. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining what constitutes the 30-week period, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would count the period that begins on the first day of classes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and ends on the last day of classes or examinations. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, if an institution's first day of classes begins on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tuesday, the first week of the academic year would begin on that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tuesday and end the following Monday. The institution would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
begin counting with the Sunday preceding the first day of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes that, for purposes of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition, a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
week
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would be a consecutive seven-day period, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opposed to a five-day or six-day 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
school week
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or seven individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days that are spread out over more than one calendar week. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach would facilitate counting and readily accommodate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions that start and end on different days of the week. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of this definition, a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
week of instructional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would be any week in which at least one day of regularly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scheduled instruction, examinations, or preparation for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examination occurs. The Secretary recognizes that there may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain weeks during an academic year during which fewer than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
five days of instruction occur. An institution should not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prohibited from counting those weeks in its 30-week period, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided at least one day of regularly scheduled classes occurs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in each of those weeks. Further, this proposal would accommodate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
innovative educational programs such as those offered only on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weekends or condensed schedules. At the same time, the proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not open the door to abuse, because regardless of the number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of days of study that occur in any week, an institution must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
still provide enough instruction for a full-time student to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
able to earn the minimum number of credit or clock hours needed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to meet the definition. Finally, the Secretary would make clear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that an institution cannot count, as instructional time, periods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consisting purely of noninstructional activities, such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
orientation, counseling, or vacations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It should be noted that because the statute specifies both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the amount of work expected to be completed and the minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timeframe for an academic year for use in the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs, an institution might need to prorate or adjust 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA program assistance for its students. For example, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the span of time from the first scheduled class at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beginning of the school year until the last examination at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
end of the school year (excluding any weeks that consist 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusively of vacation time and all other activities not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly related to instruction, preparation for examinations or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examinations) is twenty-five weeks, the institution would need to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make adjustments in accordance with individual program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. Because summer sessions generally would not be long 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enough to constitute the equivalent of a complete semester or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quarter, as they are under various current program regulations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA program funds awarded for summer sessions would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need to be adjusted to reflect the lengths of the sessions. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comprehensive discussion of the potential effect of this new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of academic year on Federal Pell Grant calculations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be found in the NPRM on the Federal Pell Grant Program to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published shortly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Full-Time Student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary believes it is necessary to have a definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
full-time student
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that is applicable to all Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. A definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
full-time student
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is needed because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
academic year
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is based, in part, on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workload of a full-time student, and because the term is used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elsewhere for other purposes in part 668. The Secretary has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed a definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
full-time student
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that would be based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a slightly modified definition found in the Federal Pell Grant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the campus-based program regulations. This definition also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would incorporate parts of the definition of full-time student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found in the FFEL program regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generally, the Secretary proposes to define a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
full-time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as an enrolled student who is carrying a full-time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
academic workload (other than by correspondence) as determined by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution under a standard applicable to all students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrolled in a particular educational program. In determining a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student's workload, an institution would be permitted to include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combinations of courses, work, research, or special studies that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution considers sufficient to classify the student as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full-time student. Under this proposal, for an undergraduate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student, an institution's minimum standard must equal or exceed: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 12 semester hours or 12 quarter hours per academic term in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an educational program using a semester, trimester, or quarter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system; (2) 24 semester hours or 36 quarter hours per academic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year for an educational program using credit hours but not using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a semester, trimester, or quarter system (or the prorated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent for a program of less than one academic year); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 24 clock hours per week for an educational program using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clock hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This definition also provides for a method for determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full-time status for students enrolled in an educational program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using both credit and clock hours. In order to evaluate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combined workload of the student, an institution could determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full-time status based on the sum of the proportionate workload 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carried in terms of credit hours and the proportionate workload 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carried in terms of clock hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, an undergraduate student could be considered a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full-time student if he or she undertakes a series of courses or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seminars that equals at least 12 semester hours or 12 quarter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours in a maximum of 18 weeks. For cooperative education 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs, an undergraduate student could be considered a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full-time student if the work portion of a cooperative education 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program in which the amount of work performed is equivalent to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the academic workload of a full-time student. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary is particularly interested in establishing a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum standard for a full-time academic workload for students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who receive funds under the FFEL programs. Currently, for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose of those programs, an institution determines what a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full-time academic workload is for these students. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognizes that, because no minimum requirement for an academic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workload of a full-time student exists under the FFEL programs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is the potential for abuse of FFEL program funds through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the use of the definition of an academic year. For example, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution might have educational programs that are measured in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit hours and do not use academic terms. The institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could claim that it offers a full academic year's worth of work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over a thirty-week period by giving a full-time student a small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of instruction, which the institution claims to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent to 24 semester or 36 quarter hours. This situation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would result in the receipt of an inordinately large amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FFEL program funds for the amount of work actually accomplished. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary requests comments on whether, to further address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this potential abuse, he should also establish a weekly minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full-time workload for educational programs that are measured in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit hours but do not use academic terms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

in this part. The proposed definition is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the definition currently found in the Federal Pell Grant and

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
undergraduate student 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
as a student enrolled in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undergraduate educational program at an institution who has not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
earned a baccalaureate or first professional degree. The student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have to be enrolled in an undergraduate educational program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that usually does not exceed 4 academic years, or a 4- to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5-academic-year program designed to lead to a first degree. A

student enrolled in a program of any other length would be

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These proposed regulations would remove the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions in &sect;668.8(a)(1) (i) through (iv), which govern the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
educational qualifications of persons admitted into an eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. These qualifications are appropriately addressed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
34 CFR 600.4 through 600.6, which govern the types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions that may be eligible to apply to participate in HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. The educational qualifications of eligible students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the Title IV, HEA programs are also addressed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;668.7(a) (3) and (b). Therefore, these provisions are no longer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needed for purposes of defining an eligible program. Note that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other provisions governing the admission requirements needed for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain educational programs to qualify as an eligible program

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These regulations would clarify a number of the terms used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to determine an eligible program. Proposed &sect;668.8(b)(1) would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
define the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
equivalent of an associate degree 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
as either an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associate degree, or the successful completion of at least a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two-year program that is acceptable for full credit toward a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bachelor's degree and qualifies a student for admission into the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third year of a bachelor's degree program. This definition is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needed because educational programs offered by a proprietary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution of higher education or a postsecondary vocational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution may qualify as eligible programs depending, in part, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on whether the programs admit students with the equivalent of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associate degree (see the discussion on minimum program lengths). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition is based on the provision in section 1201(a)(3) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the HEA that qualifies institutions offering 2-year transfer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs for institutional eligibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the same reason (that the terms are needed to establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the eligibility of programs offered by proprietary institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of higher education and postsecondary vocational institutions_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
see the discussion on minimum program lengths) the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposes to define 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
week 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
week of instruction. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistency, these terms would be the same as those proposed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be used in &sect;668.2 for the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
academic year. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The terms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are discussed in detail there. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is important to note that short-term programs (those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offering less than 600 clock hours) that are eligible under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current regulations because they met the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
vocational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that used to be in section 435 of the HEA, will cease to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be eligible when the final regulations governing programs become 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective, unless those short-term programs are able to satisfy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these regulations. Short-term programs that were not offered or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were not eligible before July 23, 1992 can only become eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when final regulations become effective.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations would also add requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding the minimum length of an eligible program. Under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 481(b) of the HEA, a proprietary institution of higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education or a postsecondary vocational institution must, to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible, provide an eligible program, as defined in section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
481(e) of the HEA. Proposed &sect;668.8(d) would implement that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition. The proposed definition would supplant the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory definition of a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
six-month training program 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in 34 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
600.2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 481(e) of the HEA provides for three types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible programs. The first type of eligible program is one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that must provide at least 600 clock hours, 16 semester or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trimester hours or 24 quarter hours of instruction offered during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a minimum of 15 weeks. The program must provide undergraduate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training that prepares a student for gainful employment in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognized occupation. The program may admit as regular students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
persons who have not completed the equivalent of an associate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degree. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second type of eligible program is one that must provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at least 300 clock hours, 8 semester hours, or 12 quarter hours 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of instruction offered during a minimum of 10 weeks. The program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must provide training that prepares a student for gainful 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employment in a recognized occupation and be a graduate or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional program or admit as regular students only persons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who have completed the equivalent of an associate degree. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the first time, this type of program may qualify for purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all Title IV, HEA programs, not just the FFEL programs, as under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third type of eligible program would qualify for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FFEL programs only. It must provide at least 300 but less than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
600 clock hours of instruction offered during a minimum of 10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weeks. The program must provide undergraduate training that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepares a student for gainful employment in a recognized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occupation, and admit as regular students some persons who have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not completed the equivalent of an associate degree. This type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of program must also satisfy regulations of the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governing placement rates, completion rates, and other criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These rates and criteria are discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 481(e)(2) of the HEA requires the third type of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible program to have a verified completion rate of at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
70 percent and a verified placement rate of at least 70 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in accordance with the Secretary's regulations and to meet other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria specified by the Secretary in regulations. Proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;668.8(e) would implement these provisions. Proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;668.8(e)(2) would require an institution to substantiate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculation of its completion and placement rates by having its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
independent auditor who prepares its compliance audit report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under &sect;668.23 verify the accuracy of the calculations. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary believes that the auditor's assurance of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculations would be a reliable independent substantiation. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary also believes it is practical for an auditor to check 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this information, inasmuch as he or she is already on site to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perform the institution's required compliance audit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 668.8 would include formulas in paragraphs (f) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) for calculating the appropriate completion and placement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates. The Secretary believes a single methodology is desired, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and invites comments in this area. The Secretary notes that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NPRM implementing the Student Right-to-Know provisions in section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
485(a) of the HEA, which addressed the calculation of completion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or graduation rates, was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
July 10, 1992 (57 FR 30826). The Secretary will be publishing a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
second NPRM for implementation of the Student Right-to-Know 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions shortly after publication of this NPRM to further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
address this calculation. The Secretary would also like to know 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if any proposals relative to the Student Right-to-Know Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding graduation and completion rate calculations should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used instead of the methods proposed here. The proposed formulas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be based on the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Award Year
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All calculations would be based on enrollments, completions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and placements during an award year. Thus, an applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completion or placement rate would be the rate as it existed at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the end of a particular award year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculation of Completion Rate
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) An institution would base its calculation on the number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of regular students who were enrolled in the program during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
award year. The rate calculation is based on regular students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because those students by definition intend to complete a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. The Secretary believes that inclusion of other students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not provide an accurate picture of the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completion rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The institution would subtract from the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regular students the number of those students who, during that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
award year, withdrew from, dropped out of, or were expelled from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the program and were entitled to and actually received in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timely manner in accordance with &sect;668.22(i)(3) a refund of 100 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of their tuition and fees (less any permitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative fee) under the institution's refund policy. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary believes that the inclusion of students who have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received a 100 percent refund at an institution would unduly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalize the institution because these students would not have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participated in the academic component of an institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. These students are excluded from the calculation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because there would not be a loss of Title IV, HEA program funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Department of Education if the institution has refunded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all tuition and fees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The institution would subtract the number of students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who were enrolled in the program at the end of that award year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The institution would determine the number of regular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students who, during that award year, received the degree, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certificate or other recognized education credential awarded for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
successfully completing the program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(5) The institution would divide the number determined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
item (4) by the total obtained under item (3) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed methodology instructs institutions to subtract 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the denominator all students who were enrolled in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program at the end of the award year without regard to any time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frame established for the completion of the program. In view of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fact that the Secretary is addressing the effect of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expectation that a student complete a program in a reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of time on the calculation of completion rates in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forthcoming NPRM concerning the Student Right-to-Know provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in section 485(a) of the HEA, the Secretary particularly invites 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment on whether that expectation should also be considered in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the calculation under this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculation of Placement Rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) An institution would determine the number of students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who, during the award year, received the degree, certificate, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other recognized educational credential awarded for successfully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completing the program. The Secretary believes it would not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fair or accurate to include in the placement rate calculation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those students who have not yet completed the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The institution would subtract from the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students described in item (1) the number of those students who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were employed by the institution either before or after their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receipt of the degree, certificate, or other recognized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
educational credential. The Secretary believes that excluding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees of the institution will help curb abuse by those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
schools who may hire their own students in order to increase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
placement rates. The Secretary specifically requests comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether there are methods of distinguishing legitimate hiring by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an institution of its graduates or students from hiring simply to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improve the results of a placement rate calculation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Of the total obtained under item (2), the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would determine the number of students who, within 180 days of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the day they received their degree, certificate, or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognized education credential, obtained gainful employment in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the recognized occupation for which they were trained or in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related comparable recognized occupation and, on the date of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculation, are employed or have been employed for at least 13 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weeks following receipt of the credential from the institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that only students who have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
placed within 180 days should be counted in the calculation. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary proposes 180 days because it is consistent with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum period of time that a payment on a student's loan under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the FFEL loan program may be deferred. These FFEL deferments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include provisions for deferments for periods of unemployment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary considers this time frame to be adequate and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable, and provides ample time for an institution to place a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulation allows an institution to include in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its placement rate a student who is placed in a recognized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occupation which is comparable and related to the occupation for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the student has been trained. For instance, if a student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were trained as an auto mechanic, he could be included in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
placement rate calculation if he were placed as a boat mechanic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, if a student completed a retail sales management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program, he could not be included in the calculation if he were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
placed as a counterman at a fast food establishment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To be included in the placement rate, a student must have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been employed for at least 13 weeks following graduation from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution. The Secretary believes that this requirement will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
help stem abuse by institutions that may arrange to have students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hired for short term jobs in order to boost placement rates. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed 13-week period is consistent with the period of time a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student must be employed to be counted in the calculation of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's placement rate under the procedures delineated in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current &sect;668.15(g) for the appeal of an institution's loss of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation due to an unacceptable cohort default rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated above, for purposes of this calculation, a student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has up to 180 days after he or she receives his or her degree, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certificate, or other recognized education credential to obtain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gainful employment and then must be employed for at least 13 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weeks following receipt of the credential from the institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary understands that, because of the total length of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time allowed for obtaining and maintaining employment, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's calculations may not accurately reflect placement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results for programs that are offered in the latter half of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
award year. The Secretary specifically requests comments on ways 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to address this issue.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) The institution would divide the number of students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined in item (3) of this section by the total obtained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under item (2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The institution must maintain documentation that each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student described in item (3) above, obtained gainful employment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in an occupation for which he or she was trained or in a related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occupation. Examples of satisfactory documentation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student's gainful employment include, but are not limited to_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A written statement from the student's employer; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Signed copies of State or Federal income tax forms; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Written evidence of payments of Social Security taxes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that requiring institutions to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collect this data will help curb abuse by institutions that may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overstate their placement rates in order to achieve and maintain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility for short-term programs. Furthermore, to further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
avoid potential abuse, the Secretary proposes that in certifying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the accuracy of an institution's placement rate, as required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under &sect;668.8(e)(2), the institution's auditor should review the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above types of documentation collected by the institution to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verify each student's inclusion in the placement rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute provides that the Secretary may prescribe other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations to determine the quality of these programs. Under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;668.8(e)(1)(iii), to be eligible, programs less than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
600 clock hours in length may not exceed by more than 50 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the minimum number of clock hours required for training in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognized occupation for which the program prepares students, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established by the State in which the program is offered, if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State has established such a requirement. For example, if a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State requires security guard students to complete only 300 clock 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours of training, a security guard program in that state will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be eligible if it exceeds 450 clock hours. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes this regulation will help curb abuse of the programs by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preventing institutions from providing unnecessary training to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students in order to receive additional Title IV, HEA program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;668.8(e)(1)(iv) requires that to be eligible, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs less than 600 clock hours must have been in existence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for at least one full year. The Secretary believes that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time frame is necessary so programs may demonstrate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate completion and placement rates. Institutions will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required under 34 CFR 600 to apply for eligibility of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs after the one-year requirement is satisfied.

In addition to the elements already in place in the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations regarding English as a Second Language (ESL) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs, &sect;668.8(j)(2) proposes that in order for an ESL program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be eligible, the institution must test each student at the end 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the program to substantiate that the student has attained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate proficiency in written and spoken English to use already 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing knowledge, training or skills. The institution will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also be required to identify the test it gives to the students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the basis for the judgment that the student has attained the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate proficiency. This proposal, based on California law, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was suggested during the negotiation process as a method to stem 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
abuse by institutions which offer ESL programs. As established 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the current regulations, ESL programs which qualify as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible programs are eligible for purposes of the Federal Pell 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grant program only. This provision remains unchanged.

Section 668.12&blank;Application Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to add a new &sect;668.12 to codify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's current practices with regard to applications to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate or to continue to participate in a Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. This section also would include proposed procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whereby the Secretary codifies new statutory provisions governing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications to participate or to continue to participate in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 498(b) of the HEA requires the Secretary to develop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a single application form to be used by an institution that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wishes to apply to participate or to continue to participate in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA program. The statute requires that this form 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide for the collection of various information and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documentation. First, the form must require an institution to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide sufficient information and documentation to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the requirements of institutional eligibility, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accreditation, and the capability of the institution are met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the form must require an institution to describe the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship between a main campus of an institution and all of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its branches. In particular, the form must require an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to include a description of the student aid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing that is performed by the main campus and that which is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed at its branches. Third, the form must require an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to describe all third-party servicers of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution and supply a copy of any contract with a third-party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer. Finally, the form must require an institution to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide any other information that the Secretary determines will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure compliance with Title IV, HEA program requirements with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to eligibility, accreditation, administrative capability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and financial responsibility.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, the Department of Education uses a single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application form that addresses both institutional eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements (as found in 34 CFR part 600) and the standards for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification of administrative capability and financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility. In recent years, although institutions filed a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
single application form, they received separate notifications of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action from the Department: an institutional eligibility notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and a certification letter. This created confusion because some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions misinterpreted the institutional eligibility notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also to be the notice informing the institution that it met the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for ``certification'' and that the institution was now 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
able to participate in a Title IV, HEA program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to reduce confusion, the Secretary is now combining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these notices of ``institutional eligibility'' and ``certification'', 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issuing one ``Institutional Approval Notice'' to an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that meets the institutional eligibility and certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. The Institutional Approval Notice advises the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution that it is an eligible institution, and is approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs listed in the Notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and indicated in the institution's program participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement. The effective date of approval, which is specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Institutional Approval Notice, is the date that the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
signs the institution's program participation agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under current practice, an institution that wishes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in a Title IV, HEA program for the first time must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first apply to the Secretary for a certification that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution meets the standards for participation found in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart B of these regulations. A currently participating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution must apply to the Secretary for a certification that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution continues to meet these standards under a number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, the institution must apply for certification if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary requests the institution to apply. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reserves the right to require a participating institution to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply at any time if the Secretary is concerned about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's continued participation in a Title IV, HEA program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the Secretary exercises this authority only rarely, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and generally when the Secretary receives reliable information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that could affect the institution's eligibility under 34 CFR part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
600 or the institution's financial responsibility or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative capability under subpart B of these regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, if the Secretary receives information that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution that does not grant degrees has received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorization from its State and accrediting agency to award 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degrees, the Secretary would require the institution to apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under 34 CFR part 600 to determine whether the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfies the definition for a different type of institution and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore might be eligible to apply to participate in HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs for which the institution earlier was not qualified. At 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the same time, the Secretary requires the institution to apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for recertification under this subpart. Similarly, if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary receives reliable information that could affect whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an institution meets the factors of financial responsibility in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this subpart, the Secretary requires the institution to apply for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recertification. The Secretary does not intend to exercise this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority more frequently than under current practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, a participating institution must apply for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification if the institution wishes to include in its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation a branch campus (as that term would be defined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
34 CFR part 600) or another location that offers 100 percent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an educational program. Adding a branch campus or additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
location that offers 100 percent of an educational program can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a great effect on the ability of an institution to continue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considers it is appropriate to scrutinize the effect of such an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition. In particular, the Secretary believes it is necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to examine whether the institution has the financial resources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the administrative capability necessary to support such an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of circumstances that could affect an institution's participation in a Title IV, HEA program do not, under
the Secretary's current practice, require the institution automatically to apply for recertification under subpart
B of these regulations. Instead, these circumstances require the institution to notify the Secretary, and, if necessary,
provide specified information about the circumstances. These circumstances parallel many of those described in
34 CFR part 600 requiring the institution to notify the Secretary of changes that could affect the institution's eligibility.
Based on that notification and information, the Secretary determines whether the institution must apply for recertification.
If the institution need not apply, the Secretary notifies the institution under the provisions of 34 CFR 600.30 that
the institution continues to be eligible and participating. If the Secretary needs further information to make that
determination, the Secretary requests additional information from the institution or requires the institution
to apply for recertification. These procedures apply to the following circumstances: (1) A change in name, address,
or location of the institution or one of the institution's locations; and (2) the inclusion in an institution's participation
of a location that offers less than 100 percent but at least 50 percent of an educational program. In making the determination
that the institution must apply for approval, the Secretary takes into account the institution's ability to provide
adequately education or training at the location, including such factors as the percentage of an educational program
offered at the location and the financial and administrative capability of the institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under current practice and under these proposed regulations, a participating institution that wishes to include
in its participation a location that offers less than 50 percent of an educational program need not provide any notification
or application to the Secretary, unless the Secretary so requests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, a participating institution must apply for certification if the institution wishes to continue to participate
in a Title IV, HEA program following a change in ownership that results in a change in control. The regulations governing
institutional eligibility (34 CFR part 600) contain the requirements governing institutions that change ownership
resulting in a change of control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New section 498(g) of the HEA requires the Secretary to establish a schedule for the expiration of the approval of institutions
to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs. Once this schedule is in place, each program participation agreement
will have a specific expiration date. To continue participating in the Title IV, HEA programs beyond the expiration
date of its program participation agreement, an institution will need to apply for and be granted approval for continued
participation. The Secretary will notify an institution well in advance of the expiration date of the institution's
program participation agreement that the institution must apply for and be granted continued participation. If
an institution does not apply for or is not granted approval for continued participation by the expiration date of
the institution's program participation agreement, the institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs
would expire on that expiration date. In this case, the Secretary may choose to provisionally certify the institution.
Provisional certification will be addressed in more detail later in this discussion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations would specify that an institution that applies for participation in any Title IV, HEA program
must apply on the form prescribed by the Secretary and provide all information and documentation requested by the
Secretary. The Secretary would like to clarify that an institution may be asked to supply additional information
in support of its application after its initial submission. This does not represent a change from current procedures.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, the Secretary informally refers to the procedures by which the Secretary certifies that an institution
meets the standards in subpart B of these regulations and accordingly may participate in a Title IV, HEA program as
the ``certification procedures.'' The Secretary proposes to add a new &sect;668.13 to codify these procedures.
This section also would include proposed procedures whereby the Secretary codifies new statutory provisions governing
certification and provisional certification procedures for participation in a Title IV, HEA program.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Clearly, an institution may not be certified unless the institution is eligible under the provisions of 34 CFR part
600. Further, this section would make clear that an institution could be certified only if the institution meets all
the applicable standards for participation in subpart B of these regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, because the requirement that each time an institution seeks to begin to participate in a Title IV, HEA program
the specified individuals must complete ``precertification training'' provided by or approved by the Secretary
is a certification requirement, the Secretary proposes to move this requirement from the current &sect;668.12 (Institutional
participation agreement) to this section. The Secretary proposes to amend this requirement to clarify that an institution
subject to this training requirement may not begin participation until the individuals have completed the training.
Under current regulations, the Secretary specifies that an institution may request an on-site review (instead of
electing to use the precertification training procedures) before beginning its participation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 498(g) of the HEA, the Secretary proposes to delineate the period for which an institution
may participate in a Title IV, HEA program. Generally, this period is the maximum of four years permitted by the HEA;
however, the Secretary may specify a shorter period as the Secretary deems necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 498(h) of the HEA permits the Secretary to provisionally certify an institution to participate in a Title
IV, HEA program in a number of circumstances. Provisional certification permits the Secretary to allow an institution
that otherwise would not qualify to participate in a Title IV, HEA program to participate. However, because such an
institution cannot meet all the requirements for ``full'' certification, the institution's participation would
be limited. For example, an institution that is provisionally certified could be monitored more closely to the extent
that the Secretary believes the institution warrants a greater degree of oversight. Further, in accordance with
the statute, an institution that is provisionally certified is subject to shorter periods of participation than
a fully certified institution. The Secretary notes that these limitations may vary, within the limits of the statute,
to address the specific circumstances of the institution. Finally, under the terms of provisional certification,
an institution will not have the right to a formal appeal under subpart G of this part if the Secretary revokes the institution's
provisional certification; instead, the Secretary proposes to offer the institution a modified appeal. These limitations
are addressed in more detail later in this discussion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 498(h) of the HEA, the Secretary may provisionally certify an institution that: (1) Applies for initial
participation in any Title IV, HEA program; (2) has its administrative capability or financial responsibility determined
by the Secretary for the first time; (3) undergoes a change of ownership; (4) seeks to renew its certification and jeopardizes
its ability to perform its financial responsibilities by not meeting the factors of financial responsibility or
standards of administrative capability in proposed &sect;&sect;668.15 and 668.16 (and whose participation has
been limited or suspended under subpart G of this part, or voluntarily enters into provisional certification); or
(5) is a participating institution that was accredited or preaccredited by a nationally recognized accrediting
agency on the day before the Secretary withdrew recognition of that agency. In addition, the Secretary is proposing
to add, to the list of institutions that may be provisionally certified, an institution that allowed its specified
period of participation to expire without reapplying and qualifying for participation in time.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary intends to use provisional certification as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mechanism for monitoring an institution that has not previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participated or one that has changed ownership, until it has time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to establish a track record. In keeping with current practice, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary does not intend to certify any initial applicant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
until it has successfully completed a period of provisional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification. Because many of the requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification cannot be met until an institution has participated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Title IV, HEA programs for a period of time, an initially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participating institution would still have the opportunity to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate while establishing a record that demonstrates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with all of the proposed current standards for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation. The Secretary notes that certain factors of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial responsibility and administrative capability, such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements governing the appropriate handling of Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program funds and timely submission of required audits and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports, cannot be judged until an institution has Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program funds to administer. In these cases, instead of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certifying that an institution meets all the standards of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart B, the Secretary certifies that an institution has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrated that it meets all the standards it can currently and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it will be able to meet all the standards in subpart B to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualify it for full certification within a period of time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified by the Secretary. Such an institution will receive a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modified program participation agreement. For the same reasons, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary also intends to use provisional certification for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all institutions that undergo a change of ownership. Provisional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification would permit them to participate in Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs while demonstrating over time that they can meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards for participation under the new ownership. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the HEA provides that the Secretary may use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisional certification for institutions that are currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participating who will have their financial responsibility and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative capability determined for the first time. Some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions have been participating in the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs since before the establishment of the financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility and administrative capability standards, and have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
never undergone a certification review. These institutions may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be allowed the time necessary to establish that they can remedy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any deficiencies found and meet the standards for participation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, under the provisions of the Technical Amendments of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993, the Secretary may provisionally certify a participating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution that is undergoing a certification review if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary believes that the institution is in a financial or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative position that could jeopardize the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability to perform its financial responsibilities under its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program participation agreement. The Secretary may provisionally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certify an institution under this provision if the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation has been limited or suspended under subpart G of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this part, or voluntarily enters into provisional certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the Secretary proposes to use provisional certification as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a probationary period for some participating institutions, if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary determines that the institutions are capable of meeting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the standards for full certification by the end of that period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, the Secretary might find that an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applying for recertification on its own fails to meet one of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards in proposed &sect;668.15. If the Secretary determines that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the failure could jeopardize the institution's ability to meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its financial responsibilities, such as the payment of refunds, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary would provisionally certify the institution.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, the Secretary proposes to use provisional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification for institutions that seek a renewal of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation in a Title IV, HEA program after the expiration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a prior period of participation in that program. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will examine the reasons for the lapse in participation to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine if additional safeguards are necessary for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to demonstrate that it is capable of resuming its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary does not intend to certify an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisionally if the institution does not meet the financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility standards, unless the institution provides the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary with certain additional financial guarantees of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability to continue operating. The Secretary believes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional financial guarantees are necessary in that situation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ensure that funds may be available to repay liabilities or to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pay required refunds that could arise under the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. The Secretary generally does not intend to certify an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution provisionally if the institution does not meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general standards of financial responsibility or the exceptions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the general standards of financial responsibility under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;668.15(d) unless the institution meets three additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions. First, the institution would have to demonstrate to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the satisfaction of the Secretary that it has sufficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial and administrative resources to participate in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA programs under a funding arrangement other than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department of Educations's standard advance funding arrangement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, the institution could be funded through an escrow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arrangement where an approved third party controls the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's access to Title IV, HEA program funds. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary believes that it is necessary for the Department of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Education to have the added control over Title IV, HEA program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds provided by an escrow arrangement. Second, the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have to submit to the Secretary a letter of credit payable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Secretary equal to not less than 10 percent of the Title 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IV, HEA program funds received by the institution during the last 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete award year for which figures are available; the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary believes that 10 percent of an institution's Title IV, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA program funds is the minimum necessary to ensure repayment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liabilities that may be identified during the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of provisional certification. Further, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that the amount of Title IV, HEA program funds received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by an institution during the last complete award year for which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
figures are available provides the most accurate indication of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the amount of Title IV, HEA program funds the institution will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use in the next award year. Third, the institution would have to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate that it has met all of its financial obligations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the preceding two award years, including (but not limited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to) the payment of required refunds and repayments to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary for liabilities and debts incurred in programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administered by the Secretary. The Secretary believes that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution that could meet this proposed standard has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established a track record for meeting its financial obligations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary notes that an institution that is applying for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial participation in the Title IV, HEA programs could not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfy the proposed requirement that the institution submit to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary a letter of credit payable to the Secretary equal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to not less than 10 percent of the Title IV, HEA program funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received by the institution during the last complete award year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for which figures are available because the institution would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have received any Title IV, HEA program funds during the last 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
award year. The Secretary requests comments on a comparable way 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to determine the amount of a letter of credit for an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is applying for initial participation in the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also would impose additional conditions on any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution that has not been considered financially responsible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under proposed &sect;668.15 at any time within the past five years, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the institution is not considered financially responsible for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one of the following reasons (as delineated in &sect;668.15(c)(2)): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The institution has been limited, suspended, terminated or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entered into a settlement agreement to resolve such an action by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary or a guaranty agency within the preceding five 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years; (2) the institution had an audit finding during its two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most recent audits, or a program review finding during its two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most recent program reviews, that resulted in the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being required to repay an amount greater than five percent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Title IV, HEA funds that the institution received for any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
award year covered by the audit or the program review; or (3) the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution failed to address satisfactorily any compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problems identified in program review or audit reports based upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a final decision of the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An institution in these categories could only be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisionally certified if, in addition to meeting whatever 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions the Secretary might reasonably require of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisionally certified institution, the institution satisfied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one of the following conditions. First, the institution, or one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or more persons or entities that the Secretary determines to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exercise substantial control over the institution, or both, would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have to submit to the Secretary financial guarantees in an amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined by the Secretary to be sufficient to satisfy the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's potential liabilities arising from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, one or more persons or entities that the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determines to exercise substantial control over the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have to agree to be jointly or severally liable for any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liabilities arising from the institution's participation in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA programs and any civil and criminal monetary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalties authorized under Title IV of the HEA. The law permits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary to impose these conditions on these institutions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary is announcing that he would always impose them, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because these circumstances are indicative that extra protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is needed for the institution and their students to be permitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to benefit from the use of Title IV, HEA program funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generally, provisional certification may be granted for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of no longer than three award years. In accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 498(h) of the HEA, an institution that is applying for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial participation may be provisionally certified for a period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of no longer than one award year. A participating institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that was accredited or preaccredited by a nationally recognized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accrediting agency on the day before the Secretary withdrew the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's recognition of that agency may be provisionally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certified for no longer than 18 months after the date that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary withdrew that recognition. The Secretary has the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority to specify a shorter period of provisional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification, as necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 498(h) of the HEA, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may revoke an institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs, at any time before the end of a period of provisional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification, if the Secretary determines that the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is unable to meet its responsibilities under its program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation agreement. If the Secretary makes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination, the Secretary would notify the institution of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination by mail, unless the Secretary chooses more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expeditious means, and revocation would take effect on date that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice is mailed. The institution would have to adhere to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of proposed &sect;668.26 which describes the consequences 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of revocation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the terms of the provisional certification, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution does not have the right to a formal appeal under subpart G of this part before the revocation takes effect.
However, the Secretary proposes to allow the institution to submit a written request to reconsider the revocation
within 20 days of the institution's receipt of the Secretary's notice, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after the revocation takes effect. The institution's request for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reconsideration would have to include written evidence that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revocation is unwarranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Secretary decides that the revocation is unwarranted, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution's provisional certification would be reinstated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in accordance with the time, terms, and conditions set out in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's original provisional certification. If, after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration of the institution's submission, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
denies the institution's request, the institution would not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permitted to reapply for participation in the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs before at least 18 months after the revocation or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expiration of any debarment or suspension of the institution, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whichever is later. Generally, an institution whose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation has been terminated because the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisional certification was revoked would be able to apply for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reinstatement after 18 months. However, a debarment or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspension under E.O. 12549 or the FAR can last 3 or more years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This change would eliminate any doubt that a debarred or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspended institution may apply for reinstatement of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's participation during the period of a debarment or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspension. The Secretary will not accept any application by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
debarred or suspended institution until the debarment or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspension has expired or been removed.

The Secretary proposes to redesignate &sect;668.12 as &sect;668.14.

This section includes provisions dealing with third-party

February 17, 1994 (in part II). The Secretary will not repeat

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current regulations governing program participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreements state only the basic terms of participation in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA programs and the purpose and scope of the agreement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between the Secretary and individual institutions. All of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific provisions of the program participation agreement that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are listed in section 487(a) of the HEA are not restated in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. Instead, all the specific statutory provisions are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the actual agreement signed between the Secretary and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual institutions. The Secretary proposes to revise this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section of the regulations to include not only the new provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of program participation agreements added by the Amendments of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1992, but also those provisions previously prescribed by the HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but not specifically spelled out in this section. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will specify which proposed changes have been made to this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section as a result of the Amendments of 1992 to distinguish them 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the provisions that the Secretary proposes to add that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
already existed under the HEA, but have not been codified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The additional provisions of program participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreements enumerated in the HEA, as well as other changes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary is proposing in order to clarify what the agreements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cover and to reflect new procedures and statutory language, are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By providing a comprehensive list of the provisions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basic program participation agreement in one section, thus making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference to all the provisions more convenient, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hopes to facilitate institutions' understanding of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities with respect to initial and continued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to clarify the scope of the program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation agreement. By signing a program participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement, an institution indicates it understands that its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial or continued participation in the Title IV, HEA programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is contingent on compliance with the Student Assistance General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provisions regulations, the regulations of the specific Title IV, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA programs in which the institution participates, and any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional requirements specific to that institution that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary requires the institution to meet. Further, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary proposes to make clear the long-standing practice that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the program participation agreement applies to each branch or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other additional location of the institution that meets the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable requirements of the Student Assistance General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provisions, unless the Secretary specifies otherwise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to specify that by entering into a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program participation agreement the institution agrees to comply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not only with statutory and regulatory requirements, but also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with any special arrangement, agreement, or limitation. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed expansion of this provision is necessary to make it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clear that if it is to participate in a Title IV, HEA program, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution must adhere not only to those requirements listed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the statute and regulations, but to any conditions of provisional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification, any limitation imposed on the institution to which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution has agreed, or any other special arrangement that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution makes pursuant to statutory or regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority under Title IV of the HEA. The Secretary also believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it is necessary to clarify the Secretary's longstanding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpretation that to begin or continue to participate in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA program, an institution must comply with each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement applicable to that program, not just selected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to add a clause specifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring that institutions that receive Title IV, HEA program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds under an advance payment method must time their requests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for funds to meet immediate programs needs. The Secretary finds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that this addition is necessary because, in the absence of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically stated requirement, too many institutions have drawn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
down funds in excess of immediate need, thereby adding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unnecessarily to the Federal debt by causing the Treasury to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incur interest costs on funds given to institutions that were not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to meet immediate needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Amendments of 1992, as clarified by the Technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendments of 1993, has removed the requirement that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution may not request from or charge any student a fee for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing or handling the Federal Student Assistance Report, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conform with other statutory provisions of the Amendments of 1992 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that eliminated previous references to that report. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary would remove the corresponding regulatory language from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section. No change has been made to the general requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that an institution may not request from or charge any student a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fee for processing or handling any application, form, or data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to determine a student's eligibility for, and amount of, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA program assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the HEA, an institution must establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and maintain necessary administrative and fiscal procedures and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records to ensure proper and efficient administration of Title 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IV, HEA program funds that the institution receives from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary or from students. Further, the Amendments of 1992 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require that the institution provide, upon request and in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timely manner, information relating to its administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability and financial responsibility of the institution to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary, the appropriate State postsecondary review entity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated under Part H of Title IV of the HEA, any applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guaranty agency under the FFEL programs, and the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accrediting agency or agencies. The Secretary proposes to add to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this list of agencies the institution's State agency with legal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jurisdiction over the institution and, where appropriate, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agency recognized by the Secretary for the approval of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public postsecondary education as an alternative to accreditation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or preaccreditation. The Secretary believes that it is important 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that these agencies also have access to information regarding an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's financial responsibility and administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The HEA requires that an institution must agree to comply with the Secretary's regulations governing financial responsibility
and administrative capability. Thus, the Secretary would specify that the institution must agree to comply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with proposed-to-be-redesignated &sect;&sect;668.15 and 668.16. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HEA requires that an institution must submit reports, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directed by the Secretary, to the Secretary, or, as appropriate, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
holders of student loans under the Title IV, HEA programs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing information required to administer the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. The Secretary considers this provision to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
self-explanatory and proposes to add this statutory requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the regulations without substantive modifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HEA requires that an institution may not provide any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement to a student or certification to a lender under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FFEL programs that qualifies a student for loans in excess of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual and aggregate limits for which the student is eligible for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in accordance with statutory requirements. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposes to extend this requirement to include unsubsidized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Stafford loans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HEA requires that an institution must comply with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer information requirements in subpart D of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. The Secretary considers this provision to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
self-explanatory and proposes to add this statutory requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the regulations without substantive modifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HEA requires that an institution that advertises job 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
placement rates as a means of procuring enrollment must make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to prospective students data necessary to substantiate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the truthfulness of the advertisement. In addition, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendments of 1992 require that an institution make available to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prospective students the relevant State licensing requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for any job for which an institution's educational program is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed to prepare prospective students. The HEA also requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that an institution must inform all eligible borrowers under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FFEL programs of their eligibility for and the availability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State grant assistance. The Secretary considers this provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be self-explanatory and proposes to add this statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement to the regulations without substantive modifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to streamline these regulations, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposes to list in one place in this section all the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certifications that an institution must make to participate in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA program. The institution would have to agree in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its program participation agreement to provide these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certifications. These certifications include the following: (1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
That the institution has in operation a drug abuse prevention 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program accessible to any of the institution's officers,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
security policy and disclosure requirements as required by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 485(f) of the HEA. The Secretary considers this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision to be self-explanatory and proposes to add this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory requirement to the regulations without substantive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HEA requires that an institution make available to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students who receive Title IV, HEA program aid based on their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability to benefit from the training offered a program proven 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
successful in assisting those students to obtain the recognized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent of a high school diploma. The Secretary considers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this provision to be self-explanatory and proposes to add this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory requirement to the regulations without substantive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Amendments of 1992 require an institution to agree that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it will not deny any form of Federal financial aid to any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible student solely on the grounds that the student is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participating in a program of study abroad approved for credit by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution. The Secretary considers this provision to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
self-explanatory and proposes to add this statutory requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the regulations without substantive modifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Amendments of 1992 require that as a condition for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation any institution seeking to participate for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first time in the Federal Stafford Loan, Federal PLUS, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal SLS programs and any institution participating in those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan programs that changes ownership resulting in a change of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control or changes its status as a main campus, branch campus, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an additional location, develop and implement for two years a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
default management plan. The Secretary proposes to allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions to develop and implement, or submit if required by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary, a default management plan developed in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the default reduction measures described in appendix D of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current regulations to meet this requirement.

The Amendments of 1992 require that an institution must acknowledge the authority of the Secretary, guaranty agencies
and lenders as defined in 34 CFR part 682, nationally recognized accrediting agencies, the Secretary of Veterans
Affairs, and State postsecondary review entities designated under subpart 1 of part H of Title IV of the HEA, to share
with each other any information pertaining to the institution's eligibility for or participation in the Title IV,
HEA programs, or any information on fraud and abuse. The Secretary proposes to add to this list of agencies the institution's
State agency with legal jurisdiction over the institution and, where appropriate, the State agency recognized by
the Secretary for the approval of public postsecondary education as an alternative to accreditation or preaccreditation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statutory provision that governs the effect of fraud and criminal conduct by individuals, agencies, or organizations
affiliated with an institution was discussed in the NPRM published on February 17, 1994 (in part II) that deals with
third-party servicers. The Amendments of 1992 require that an institution must timely and satisfactorily complete
any survey conducted as a part of the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), or other Federal data
collection effort on postsecondary institutions. The Secretary considers this provision to be self-explanatory
and proposes to add this statutory requirement to the regulations without substantive modifications. The Amendments
of 1992 spell out the requirements imposed on participating institutions that offer athletically related student
aid. In order to participate in a Title IV, HEA program, an institution that offers athletically related student aid
must compile annually and have audited independently at least every 3 years, data on the revenues derived by the institution
from and expenses made by the institution for the institution's intercollegiate athletics activities. This compilation
must include data on total revenues and total expenses, revenues and expenses attributable to football, revenues
and expenses attributable to men's basketball, revenues and expenses attributable to women's basketball, revenues
and expenses attributable to all other men's sports combined, and revenues and expenses attributable to all other
women's sports combined. The compilation must also include data on the total revenues and operating expenses of the
institution. The institution is required to prepare the compilation within 6 months after the end of the institution's
fiscal year. The institution must make the compilation and, where allowable by State law, the required audits, available
for inspection by the Secretary and the public. For purposes of this compilation, the Amendments of 1992 define revenues
from intercollegiate athletics activities allocable to a sport to include without limitation gate receipts, broadcast
revenues, appearance guarantees and options, concessions, and advertising. Revenues such as student activities
fees or alumni contributions not allocable to a sport must be included in the calculation of total revenues only. The
Amendments of 1992 define expenses for intercollegiate athletics activities allocable to a sport to include without
limitation grants-in-aid, salaries, travel, equipment, and supplies. Expenses such as general and administrative
overhead that are not allocable to a sport must be included in the calculation of total expenses only. Generally, the
Secretary is proposing to restate the language of the statute in the regulations. However, the Secretary proposes
changes to conform with the NCAA's 1989 Financial Audit Guidelines. In addition to the statutory definition of what
is included in revenues from intercollegiate athletics activities allocable to a sport, the Secretary proposes
to specify that other conference distributions in addition to broadcast revenues would also be included. The Secretary
also proposes to specify that revenues such as investment interest income that are not allocable to a sport would be
included in the calculation of total revenues only.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Amendments of 1992 provide that an institution may not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impose any penalty on any student because of the student's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inability to meet his or her financial obligations to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution as a result of the delayed disbursement of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
title IV, HEA program loan due to compliance with statutory and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory requirements for the Title IV, HEA programs, or delays 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attributable to the institution. The statute specifies that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those prohibited penalties include the assessment of late fees, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the denial of access to classes, libraries, or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutional facilities, or the requirement that the student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrow additional funds. The Secretary proposes to clarify that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the restriction that institutions may not require a student to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrow additional funds would apply only to funds for which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest or other charges are assessed. Therefore, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision would not apply to any interest-free loans that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution might require the student to borrow until other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources of aid are available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Amendments of 1992 provide that an institution may not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial aid to any persons or entities engaged in any student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recruiting or admission activities. An institution also may not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide such an incentive payment to any persons or entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engaged in making decisions regarding the awarding of student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial assistance. The statute specifies that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement does not apply to the recruitment of foreign students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residing in foreign countries who are not eligible to receive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal student assistance. The Secretary proposes to extend 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this provision to require that institutions also may not contract 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with entities that improperly provide, any commission, bonus, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other incentive payment as delineated in the statute. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary believes that this provision is necessary to implement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more rigid restrictions than were seen in the past on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practices of ``commissioned salespersons.'' The Secretary proposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to repeat the language of the statute with the addition of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change. The Secretary believes it is clear that this statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement places rigid restrictions on the practice of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recruitment, admission activities, and the awarding of student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary is aware that some institutions pay incentives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to recruiters or admissions office employees based on the success 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of those persons in enrolling students, provided that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrolled students maintain satisfactory progress for and remain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrolled in the institution for a specified period of time. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary considers this practice, which commonly is referred to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as an incentive based on ``retention,'' to be an example of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activity that is prohibited by the statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the negotiated rulemaking sessions, the Secretary's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negotiator requested further examples of prohibited activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A non-Federal negotiator offered the following examples that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary believes are not permitted by the statute. (1) An 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution might offer payments or gifts to students for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referring other prospective students for admission to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution. (2) An institution might offer payments or gifts to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students on the condition that persons whom the students referred 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the institution were actually admitted and remained enrolled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the institution for a specified period of time. (3) An 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution might present gifts to alumni, such as coffee mugs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sporting events tickets, or contributions in their name for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referring students to the institution for admission. (4) An 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution might pay bonuses to Directors of Admissions (or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other management personnel) based on the number of enrollments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received during a particular academic year or the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students who, after enrolling, remained at the institution until 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all financial aid had been received. The Secretary specifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests comments on these examples and others that might serve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as useful guidelines in these regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Amendments of 1992 require that an institution comply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with applicable requirements established by all members of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``triad''; i.e., the Secretary, State postsecondary review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities, and nationally recognized accrediting agencies pursuant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to part H of title IV of the HEA. The Secretary considers this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision to be self-explanatory and proposes to add this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory requirement to the regulations without substantive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modifications.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Amendments of 1992 require that an institution comply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the institutional refund policy established in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with &sect;668.22. The Secretary considers this provision to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
self-explanatory and proposes to add this statutory requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the regulations without substantive modifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, in addition to the statutory requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program participation agreements, an institution would have to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agree to be liable for all improperly spent or unspent funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received under the title IV, HEA programs, including funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administered by a third-party servicer, and refunds that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution or its servicer may be required to make. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision was proposed and discussed in the NPRM published on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
February 17, 1994 (in part II) that deals with third-party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Amendments of 1992 and the Technical Amendments of 1993 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended the HEA to require that an institution that has a change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in ownership resulting in a change in control reestablish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutional eligibility and undergo a certification review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before it may participate in any title IV, HEA programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Secretary is proposing to remove the provision in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current regulations that permitted the new participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement of an institution that changed ownership to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective on the date of the change of ownership. Instead, under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed regulations, the program participation agreement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an institution that changes ownership would be effective on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date that the Secretary signs the agreement, just as any other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new program participation agreement would. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to specify that a program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation agreement expires if the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation ends because: (1) The institution closes or stops 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing educational programs for a reason other than a normal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vacation period or a natural disaster that directly affects the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution or the institution's students; (2) the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loses its institutional eligibility under 34 CFR part 600; (3) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution's period of participation, as specified under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;668.13, expires (that is, the four-year limit on participation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the limits on participation established pursuant to provisional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification, or shorter periods established by the Secretary), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or the institution's provisional certification is revoked under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;668.13; (4) the Secretary determines under &sect;668.13(c) that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution that is applying for certification has jeopardized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its ability to perform its financial responsibilities by not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meeting the factors of financial responsibility under &sect;668.15 or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the standards of administrative capability under &sect;668.16 (in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case of an institution whose participation has been limited or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspended under subpart G of this part, or voluntarily enters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into provisional certification); or (5) the Secretary receives a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice from the appropriate SPRE that the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation should be withdrawn. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These provisions would conform to the provisions in proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;668.26 governing the end of an institution's participation in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
title IV, HEA program. The first of these circumstances listed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above is purely a clarification of existing practice. The last 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three describe circumstances mandated by the change made to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA by the Amendments of 1992.

The Secretary proposes to redesignate &sect;668.13 as &sect;668.15. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section includes provisions dealing with third-party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicers that were proposed in the NPRM published on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
February 17, 1994 (in part II). The Secretary will not repeat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the discussion of those provisions here. However, this third-party servicer NPRM proposed to apply the general standards
of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial responsibility that are proposed in this NPRM to third-party servicers that contract with lenders or guaranty
agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to administer any aspect of the title IV, HEA programs.

Section 487 of the HEA requires the Secretary to develop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations to determine the financial responsibility of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution as a part of the Secretary's determination that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution is able to participate in a title IV, HEA program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 498 of the HEA mandates some of the standards that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary must use in making a determination of financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility. In general, section 498 of the HEA adopted, with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modifications, the standards used by the Secretary in current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;668.13 of the Student Assistance General Provisions regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to require an institution to demonstrate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it is financially responsible under the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements in this section.

General Standards of Financial Responsibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In paragraph (b) of proposed &sect;668.15, the Secretary would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
list general standards of financial responsibility. The first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
six standards are applicable to all institutions. Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
498(c)(1) of the HEA specifies that an institution's financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility must be determined based on whether the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution is able to provide the services that the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claims to provide, to provide administrative resources necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to comply with Title IV, HEA program requirements, and to meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all of the institution's financial obligations, including refunds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and liabilities and debts incurred in programs administered by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary. These standards were adopted from current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations and the Secretary proposes to continue to use them 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unchanged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to add to the list of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial responsibility requirements for all institutions the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that an institution be current on any debt service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments. An institution normally has variable costs that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fluctuate to meet the demand created by increasing or decreasing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volume in those costs such as those for educational supplies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenses and instructor salaries associated with educating an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increasing or decreasing number of students. Debt service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represents a fixed cost, such as mortgage or lease payments, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution that generally does not fluctuate with that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volume. Thus, in a situation in which an institution is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experiencing a decline in revenue due to a decrease in new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollments, debt service would remain unchanged. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's flexibility to deal financially with the decline is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduced because management typically is unable to adjust the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of payment for debt service without the consent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
creditor to whom the debt is owed. This situation places some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degree of control outside the institution and beyond the scope of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management's ability to deal with a deteriorating situation by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reducing costs. Furthermore, a failure to meet debt service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments might precipitate collective action on the part of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
creditors to place the institution in an involuntary liquidation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situation under Federal bankruptcy laws. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatively, a growing institution usually must take on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more debt to fund its operations. Should the growth fail to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continue, the institution might be unable to service the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increasing debt service associated with its expansion. Thus, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary believes an institution's failure to remain current on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its debt service payments would be a strong indicator of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's inability to meet its financial obligations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 498(c)(5) of the HEA provides that the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must establish requirements for an institution to maintain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient cash reserves to ensure repayment of any required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refunds. Section 498(c)(5) of the HEA also provides for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exemption to this requirement which is discussed below under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceptions to the general standards of financial responsibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to require an institution to maintain, at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all times, a minimum cash reserve of at least 10 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's total deferred tuition income at the end of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's most recent fiscal year for repayment of refunds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cash reserve would have to be maintained in a cash reserve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
account and would have to consist of cash or cash equivalents, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those terms are defined in accordance with generally acceptable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accounting principles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that it would be unreasonable and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unduly burdensome to require an institution to calculate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage of its cash reserve on a continual basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Secretary would require an institution to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine its total deferred income at the end of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's fiscal year and calculate the percentage based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that total. Once that percentage is determined, the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have to maintain that amount of cash reserve at all times 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
until a new calculation is performed at the end of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's subsequent fiscal year. The calculation would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on the institution's total deferred tuition income because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deferred tuition income is an indicator of the value of services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the institution will provide for the coming year. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary requests comment on a comparable way to determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate level for the cash reserve. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ten percent of this amount represents roughly the equivalent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a month's worth of an institution's revenue. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considers this amount a reasonable amount for an institution to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have available to pay refunds in the event of the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
precipitous closure. Generally, under this proposal, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution would demonstrate its compliance with this provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
once a year with the submission of the institution's audited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial statements. However, because an institution would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected to maintain this cash reserve at all times, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary would reserve the right to evaluate an institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with the requirement at any time. Finally, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal to allow cash equivalents to be included in the cash 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reserve is consistent with generally accepted accounting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles.

Finally, the Secretary proposes that, in order to be financially responsible, an institution must not have as part
of its audit report for its most recently completed fiscal year any of the following. First, the institution's audit
would not contain a statement by the accountant acknowledging substantial doubt about the institution's ability
to continue operating as a going concern. A ``going concern'' statement is a professional opinion rendered by an independent
certified public accountant, commenting on the institution's unstable financial condition and informing the reader
of the possibility that the institution may not survive the coming fiscal year. Although such a ``going concern''
statement is rarely issued, its presence attests to a concern held by the auditor that the institution's ability to
continue operating is uncertain. The Secretary believes that if an auditor, after close examination of the institution's
operations, concludes that such a statement is warranted, this is cause for the Department to protect its interest
in the Title IV, HEA program funds administered by the institution by requiring the institution to be subject to the
appropriate remedies for establishing financial responsibility, or to be subject to provisional certification
or the proceedings in subpart G of these regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the institution's audit could not contain a finding of unauthorized use of donor restricted net assets to
meet current operating expenses. Unauthorized use of donor restricted net assets is a violation of the restrictions
placed on donations by the donor. Any donor-restricted funds are placed in an endowment fund to be used for specific
purposes, such as providing scholarships. Donor restricted net assets are most commonly found at nonprofit institutions.
The Secretary believes that if this money is transferred to current funds or total net assets for current operating
expenses, this is not only an indication of extremely impaired cash flow, but also a violation of an institution's
responsibility as a fiduciary of Title IV, HEA program funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, the institution's audit could not contain a disclaimed or adverse opinion by the accountant. A disclaimed
or adverse opinion is an indicator that the auditor is unable to perform a complete audit of the institution with the
assurance that the audit presents a reliable presentation of the institution's financial condition. An audit submitted
with such a disclaimer or limitation would cause the institution's financial report to be rejected by the Secretary.
Such a statement in the auditor's report is an indication that the financial statement was not prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles as required in current regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute authorizes the Secretary to prescribe criteria for evaluating operating losses, net worth, asset to
liabilities ratios and operating fund deficits. The Secretary's goal in developing these proposed regulations
is to ensure that institutions are capable to operate as a fiduciary of Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds based on a sufficient financial base to properly provide education and meet the institution's financial obligations.
The Secretary, therefore, proposes to amend the current factors of financial responsibility section to establish
new financial responsibility standards as a means of further refining the above requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes that, as in the past, failure to meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any one of the factors may result in initiation of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative proceeding to limit, suspend, fine or terminate an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution. Because some of these proposed factors are more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stringent than those currently found in the regulations, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary recognizes that an institution may need a sufficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of time to adjust its operations in order to come into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with these proposed factors, if they are adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this proposal, the Secretary may provisionally certify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions that did not meet these proposed standards to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide them with this additional period of time to comply, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided that the institution shows that it would have met the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Technical Amendments of 1993 require the Secretary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
take into account an institution's total financial circumstances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in making a determination of an institution's financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility. The Secretary believes that these proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors evaluate, both directly and indirectly, the overall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
soundness of an institution's financial condition for the period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covered by its audited financial statements and, therefore, take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into account an institution's total financial condition as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by the Technical Amendments of 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Technical Amendments of 1993 require that criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developed for the determination of an institution's financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility take into account any differences in generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accepted accounting principles, including required financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements, that are applicable to for-profit and nonprofit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions. Therefore, in addition to general standards that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all institutions would be required to meet, the Secretary has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed standards applicable specifically to for-profit, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonprofit, and public institutions that the Secretary believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicate an equal level of financial responsibility. At the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggestion of some of the negotiators, the proposed specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards of financial responsibility have been organized by type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of institution; i.e., for-profit, nonprofit, and public.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Due to differences in legal and reporting entity, mission, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and accounting format for nonprofit entities and for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
profit-seeking entities, there are differing tests of financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility to be applied. Evaluating a nonprofit entity's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overall financial condition is more complicated because there is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no commonly accepted standard of acceptable financial condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generally, a measure of an institution's financial condition is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measure of an institution's solvency, or the ability of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to adequately cover its expenditures with revenues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining an institution's financial condition, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary believes it is necessary to look at the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
short-term solvency and long-term solvency, which is the ability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an institution to support an adequate level of services over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the long run, withstanding economic disruption and meeting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changing demands for services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With accounting for for-profit entities, analysis of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial statements provides an understanding of an institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial condition through comparisons of key financial ratios 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that measure the institution's ability to remain solvent while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuing to provide educational services at acceptable levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Examination of financial information from nonprofit entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires a review of other organizational factors that measure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ability of the institution to provide educational services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using a larger and more complex source of funds. It is therefore 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to differentiate the standards that are applicable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
profit-seeking entities from the standards that are applicable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonprofit entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary will first address the specific standards for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for-profit institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to require that a for-profit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution have, at the end of its latest fiscal year, a ratio 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of current assets to current liabilities of at least 1.25:1. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commonly used means of determining whether or not the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has sufficient short-term solvency is use of the ratio of current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assets to current liabilities. For the past fourteen years the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department has used a current assets to current liabilities ratio 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of at least 1:1 as an indicator of financial responsibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This means that the institution has current assets at least equal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to their current liabilities. In theory, this would indicate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that an institution has sufficient resources to handle not only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
debt service, but also other liabilities for at least the coming 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiscal year. The higher the amount of assets, the better the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liquidity position of the institution and, therefore, the better 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution will be able to handle unforeseen economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions. The Secretary believes that the current 1:1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benchmark offers little or no indication of adequate short-term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solvency. A 1.25:1 benchmark has, therefore, been proposed for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for-profit institutions. Cash is now required to be a component. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that the proposed increase in current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assets will help to ensure that institutions have sufficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resources to provide worthwhile education and training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary is proposing a higher ratio of current assets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to current liabilities ratio for for-profit institutions than for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonprofit institutions. The Secretary believes that a higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current ratio is necessary for for-profit institutions because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they will be less likely, in the event of hampered liquidity, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
draw on fund-raising as a source of cash. This rationale is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed later as part of the discussion of the proposed ratio 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of current assets to current liabilities for nonprofit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to exclude from the calculation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this ratio for for-profit institutions, uncollateralized loans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receivable from owners and related parties. Uncollateralized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related party loans are loans that have been made to affiliates, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officers, or employees and have not been secured by tangible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assets. In accordance with Accounting Research Bulletin 43 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ARB43), chapter 3A, paragraph 6, the concept of current assets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contemplates the exclusion from that classification of such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resources as ``*&blank;*&blank;* (c) receivables arising from unusual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transactions (such as the sale of capital assets, or loans or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advances to affiliates, officers, or employees) that are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected to be received within twelve (12) months''. In the event 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that certain financial statements present these types of loans on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the balance sheet, they will be disregarded by the Secretary in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
computation of the current ratio. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, because the proposed cash reserve requirement may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause a portion of the institution's cash reserves to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classified as a restricted asset, which would, under generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accepted accounting principles, be excluded from classification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as current assets, the Secretary's proposal specifies that, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for-profit institutions, the cash reserves may be included in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's current assets in calculating the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current assets to current liabilities ratio. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that it is appropriate to permit for-profit institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to treat the cash reserves as current assets because the funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are held for the benefit of the students, and inclusion of those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amounts toward demonstrating a 1.25:1 current ratio still leaves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution with sufficient unrestricted assets to pay all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current expenses.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes that a for-profit institution is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financially responsible if it has not had operating losses over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both of its two latest fiscal years that cause an operating loss 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeding 10 percent of the institution's previous year's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tangible net worth for its latest fiscal year. While it may not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be unusual for an institution to record a loss in any fiscal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year, this loss is not harmful so long as the loss is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excessive, is not indicative of a deteriorating trend in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's financial condition, and the institution otherwise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meets the factors substantiating its financial strength. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary proposes to define an operating loss, for purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these provisions, as total net income minus extraordinary gains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or losses, income or losses from discontinued operations, prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period adjustments, and the cumulative effect of changes in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accounting principle, estimate, or reporting entity. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary proposes that the calculation of tangible net worth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall exclude all assets defined as intangible in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally accepted accounting principles. The Secretary believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this standard will measure whether a profit-seeking entity is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating from current cash flow to the extent possible. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aggregate residual effect of these activities on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organization's individual net assets is represented, along with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any interfund transfers that may have taken place during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes that a for-profit institution is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financially responsible if it had, for its latest fiscal year, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
positive tangible net worth. The Secretary proposes that, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes of this section, a positive tangible net worth occurs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when the institution's tangible assets exceed its liabilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the Secretary proposes that the calculation of tangible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
net worth shall exclude all assets defined as intangible in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applying this proposed standard, the Secretary could consider the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect of extraordinary gains or losses resulting from unusual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and infrequent events, and could take into consideration the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle, estimate or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting entity to the extent that such a change results in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more accurate representation of the institution's financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
position in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles. For the past fourteen years, the Department has had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a standard for net worth that states that an institution is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financially responsible if it has a deficit net worth (i.e., the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's liabilities exceed its assets.), a measure of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
long-term solvency. Therefore, an institution with a net worth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of zero meets this current requirement. The proposed change from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalizing a deficit net worth to requiring a positive net worth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is only a technical change in form that should affect few, if any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By excluding all assets classified as intangible, all assets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as goodwill, organization costs, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covenants-not-to-compete, which have little market value in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination of an institution's overall solvency will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eliminated in the calculation of net worth. In purchasing a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business, the new owner pays an amount and allocates the market 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value to individual tangible assets in order to prepare financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements. After applying the proper market value to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various assets, any residual amount that appears on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's balance sheet as goodwill, organization costs, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covenant-not-to-compete, is classified as an intangible asset. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the Secretary's intent to identify those institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that do not have sufficient capital assets. For example, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
businesses that operate on month-to-month leases with minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capital actually invested in the business are a potential risk to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students, and ultimately to the taxpayers in terms of possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collapse and bailout. In these cases loans to students are often 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automatically discharged in accordance with provisions in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA. Preventing institutions that have no real assets from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participating in the programs should enhance the gatekeeping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the case of nonprofit institutions, the Secretary has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developed standards in accordance with Statement of Financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accounting Standards No. 117 (FAS 117) that was issued in June 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993 by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). FAS 117 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
altered the reporting format for not-for-profit organizations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after the negotiated rulemaking process was already well 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
underway. FAS 117 is effective for annual financial statements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994, except 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for organizations with less than $5 million in total assets and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less than $1 million in annual expenses. For those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organizations, the Statement is effective for fiscal years 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beginning after December 15, 1995 with earlier application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encouraged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to require a nonprofit institution to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepare a classified statement of financial position in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide the Secretary with the financial information necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine the institution's financial responsibility under these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations. The Secretary proposes that, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternatively, a nonprofit institution could provide this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information as footnotes to the audit. Although FAS 117 does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require a nonprofit institution to submit a classified statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of financial position prior to published implementation dates, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not prohibit the institution from doing so. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notes that a financial statement that is not classified is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
structured to provide the financial information necessary for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary to determine an institution's compliance with these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations; however, the information could be included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as footnotes to the audit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes that a nonprofit institution is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financially responsible if it cannot demonstrate, at the end of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its latest fiscal year, a ratio of current assets to current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liabilities of at least 1:1. The Secretary proposes to not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit a nonprofit institution to include the cash reserves in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution's current assets. The Secretary believes that, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the proposed current assets to current liabilities ratio 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a nonprofit institution is 1:1, if the institution used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated reserve funds to meet this ratio, there would be no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assurance of solvency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The importance of a higher current ratio for for-profit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions lies in the fact that they are not as likely to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
able to draw on fund raising as a source of cash in the event of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hampered liquidity because donors are less likely to contribute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds to a for-profit institution where those contributions would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be tax deductible. Many nonprofit institutions have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient support in the community and from friends and alumni 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who are willing to donate to the institution. The cash intake of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for-profit institutions is therefore limited to cash generated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through profitability, whereas nonprofit institutions have an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional source of cash. Endowments, even when restricted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functions such as providing scholarships, are awarded and may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken into cash from operations. Consistent profitable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations result in a better liquidity position for for-profit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions, whereas consistent profitable operations are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary for a nonprofit to remain viable. In addition, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inherent in a nonprofit institution that its final cash position 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not reflect a profit. In the nonprofit industry, the financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manager has limited authority. The financial manager may make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendations, but the ultimate authority lies with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governing board. There is, therefore, less control in the hands 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of financial managers and a corresponding decrease in their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability to control a liquidity situation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lack of liquidity means that the institution is unable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service its current debt. This can lead to the forced sale of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
long-term investments and assets. To the owners of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution, a lack of liquidity will mean reduced profitability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or it may mean loss of control or loss of the entire capital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investment. To creditors of the enterprise, it means slow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection of principal and interest due or even loss of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amounts due them. Students of these institutions can also be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected by a short-term poor financial condition. These effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may take the form of inability of the institution to perform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their contract, inability to make refunds due to students or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lenders, or the loss of supplier relationships. Suppliers are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interested in an institution's liquidity position, and if it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found to be inadequate, it may cease to do business with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes that a nonprofit institution is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financially responsible if it has had a decrease in total net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assets at the end of its latest fiscal year of such significance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that, if continued, would result in a ratio current assets to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current liabilities of less than 1:1. Under this proposal, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary could consider the effect of extraordinary gains or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
losses resulting from unusual and infrequent events, and could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
take into consideration the cumulative effect of a change in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accounting principle, estimate or reporting entity to the extent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that such a change results in a more accurate representation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution's financial position in accordance with generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accepted accounting principles. For purposes of this proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis, the Secretary could exclude unrealized gains and losses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on investments that have been reported as changes in unrestricted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
net assets. The standard was revised to reflect the changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brought about with the issuance of FASB 117 and in order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide parity with the for-profit institutions. The concept of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
net worth, as it applies to profit-seeking entities, does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exist for a not-for-profit entity. Upon implementation of FASB 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
117, fund accounting will no longer be used for colleges and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
universities, but these entities will adopt a format that is more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar to the format for-profit entities have been using. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
term ``fund balance'' will no longer apply, but will be replaced by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total net assets, divided into unrestricted, temporarily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restricted and permanently restricted assets. For institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not required to implement FAS 117 prior to the effective date of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these regulations, the regulations applying to nonprofits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently found in 34 CFR 668.13(c), ``the institution shall not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a deficit current unrestricted fund balance'', will remain in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect until the institution adopts FAS 117. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary requests comments on whether the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should determine a nonprofit institution to be financially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible even if it does not meet these requirements if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution has an acceptable ``bond rating''. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggests that a type of acceptable bond rating may be a current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general obligation or general obligation equivalent debt rating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(because such a rating is backed by the full resources of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution) by a nationally recognized debt rating organization, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved by the Secretary, that is at least investment grade. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes that a public institution is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financially responsible only if the institution has its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liabilities backed by the full faith and credit of the State, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by an equivalent government. The Secretary is aware that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accounting principles for public institutions differ from those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for for-profit and nonprofit institutions. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solicits comments on other acceptable measures of a public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's financial responsibility that take the applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accounting principles into account.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to remove from the factors of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial responsibility the provisions in current &sect;668.13 (c)(4) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (d)(2) governing the effect on an institution's financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility of criminal conduct and fraud involving Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds. Those provisions have been superseded by a similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory provision that is addressed in the discussion on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;668.14 governing program participation agreements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;668.15(c)(2), an institution would not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered financially responsible, despite meeting all other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of this proposed section, if: (1) The institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been limited, suspended, terminated, or entered into a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
settlement agreement, to resolve such an action by the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or a guaranty agency within the preceding five years; (2) the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution had an audit finding during its two most recent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
audits, or a program review finding during its two most recent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program reviews, that resulted in the institution's being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to repay an amount greater than five percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA funds that the institution received for any award 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year covered by the audit or the program review; or (3) the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution failed to address satisfactorily any compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problems identified in program review or audit reports based upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a final decision of the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The consequences of this proposed provision are described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more fully earlier in this preamble in the discussion on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisional certification. Essentially, institutions that fall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into one of these categories not only would not be considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financially responsible, but could not be provisionally certified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without the submission of certain financial guarantees or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personal assumptions of liability arising from participation in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Title IV, HEA programs.

Exceptions to the General Standards of Financial Responsibility

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Amendments of 1992, as amended by the Technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendments of 1993, provide that the Secretary shall determine an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to be financially responsible even though it does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet certain general standards of financial responsibility, under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 498(c)(5)(B) of the HEA provides that the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall establish a process whereby an institution is exempt from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cash reserve requirement if the institution is located in, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and is legally authorized to operate within, a State that has a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tuition recovery fund that ensures that the institution is able 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to pay all required refunds and the institution contributes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that tuition recovery fund. The Secretary proposes that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution is exempt from the proposed cash reserve requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if it meets these conditions; however, the Secretary proposes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stipulate that a State's tuition recovery fund must be acceptable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Secretary. The Secretary would like to ensure that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State's tuition recovery fund truly has the resources to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment of all required refunds if necessary. To this end, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary would expect States to provide as much information as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible to demonstrate that their tuition recovery fund can pay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all required refunds on behalf of an institution that closed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
precipitously. The Secretary invites comment on what specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards should be used to measure the acceptability of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State's tuition recovery fund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 498(c)(3) of the HEA provides that an institution is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financially responsible even though it does not meet the other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general standards of financial responsibility, under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following circumstances. First, an institution that is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financially responsible under the general standards of financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility (except the cash reserve requirement) is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financially responsible if the institution submits to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary third-party financial guarantees, such as performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bonds or letters of credit payable to the Secretary, that equal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not less than one-half of the annual potential Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program liabilities of the institution. The Secretary proposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a letter of credit that is payable to the Secretary and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective for a period of time as determined by the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be the only acceptable type of third-party guarantee for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this requirement. The determination by the Secretary that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment from a third-party guarantee requires that funds become 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately available to make refunds or to reimburse the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary for debts incurred in the programs. It has been the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's experience that letters of credit are the only method 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by which funds do become immediately available; however, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary requests comments on other standard forms of publicly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guaranteed security that would provide the same level of security 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Secretary. The Secretary notes that an institution is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liable for all mishandled Title IV, HEA program funds that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receives. Further, the Secretary believes that the total Title 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IV, HEA program funds received by an institution during the last 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete award year is the best indicator of the amount of Title 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IV, HEA program assistance that the institution will receive for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the next award year. Therefore, the Secretary proposes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require an institution to submit a letter of credit equal to not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less than one-half of the Title IV, HEA program funds received by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution during the last complete award year for which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
figures are available in order to meet this requirement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, the Technical Amendments of 1993 provide that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution that is not financially responsible under the general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards of financial responsibility (except the cash reserve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement) is financially responsible if it establishes to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfaction of the Secretary, with the support of a financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement audited by an independent certified accountant with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally accepted accounting standards, that the institution has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient resources to ensure against the precipitous closure of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution, including the ability to meet all of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial obligations, including refunds of institutional charges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and repayments to the Secretary for liabilities and debts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incurred in programs administered by the Secretary. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary proposes to restate the statute, modifying it only to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
propose to require that the financial statement be submitted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with the proposed requirements for documentation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial responsibility that will be discussed later. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Technical Amendments of 1993 further provide that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution is not required to meet the general standards of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial responsibility (except for the cash reserve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement) if the institution is an institution that provides a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2-year or 4-year educational program for which the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
awards an associate or baccalaureate degree that demonstrates to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the satisfaction of the Secretary that there is not reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
doubt as to its continued solvency and ability to deliver quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
educational services, it is current in its payment of all current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liabilities, including student refunds, repayments to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary, payroll, and payment of trade creditors and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withholding taxes, and it has substantial equity in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school-occupied facilities, the acquisition of which was the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
direct cause of its failure to meet the current operating ratio 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement. The Secretary proposes to restate the statute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without modification.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 498(c)(4) of the HEA provides that the determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an institution's financial responsibility be based on an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
audited and certified financial statement of the institution or, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where appropriate, its parent corporation, conducted by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualified independent organization or person in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards established by the American Institute of Certified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Accountants. The statement must be submitted to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary when the institution is applying to begin or continue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. The statute further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides that the Secretary may require the submission of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional audits if the first submission does not establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with the general standards of financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility. Although audited financial statements should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rendered in a uniform manner, there is some leeway with regards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to contents of the statements. The Secretary proposes to require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions to submit financial statements on an annual basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within four months after the end of the institution's fiscal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year. The Secretary believes that four months from the end of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's fiscal year is a sufficient period of time for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to submit a financial statement. The Secretary also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clarifies that, upon request, the institution must provide or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise make available the accountant's work papers in order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that all information relevant to preparing an audited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial statement is readily available. Institutions are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
already required to provide access to such information pursuant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to current &sect;668.23, and the Secretary proposes to reference that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
access to records in this proposed section. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposes that an institution may be granted a filing extension to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an institution upon a showing of good cause. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intends that this extension would be granted on an infrequent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis, as the Secretary believes it is imperative to have the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial information from the institution that most accurately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflects the current financial situation of the institution.

Section 668.16&blank;Standards of Administrative Capability
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to redesignate &sect;668.14 as &sect;668.16. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In matters not governed by specific provisions, section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
487(c)(1)(B) of the HEA provides for the establishment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards of administrative capability for participating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions that include any matter the Secretary deems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary for the sound administration of the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. Section 498(d) of the HEA, which was added by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendments of 1992, authorizes the Secretary to establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures and requirements relating to administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability, including the consideration of past performance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions or individuals in control of those institutions and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintenance of records. In addition, section 498(d) authorizes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary to establish other reasonable procedures that will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contribute to ensuring that institutions will be administratively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given this framework, the Secretary proposes to strengthen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and modify the administrative capability standards in the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations by making significant, substantive changes to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative standards as well as some technical changes; the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant proposed changes to the current regulations are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to clarify the Secretary's current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principle that an institution must demonstrate that it is capable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of meeting each of the administrative standards in this section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be considered administratively capable. During negotiated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking, alternatives to requiring that institutions meet each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative standard were discussed. Among the options 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered were that the various factors be ``weighted,'' i.e., the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary would identify which factors he considered to be the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most critical and would incur the greatest penalty if they were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not met. Some of the negotiators suggested that the various 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors be used only as indicators of capability; that is, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary would be required to review each institution that did 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not comply with one or more standard to determine the seriousness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of noncompliance. However, the negotiators did not reach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consensus on an approach. Therefore, the Secretary is proposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that to be fully certified as meeting the standards in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section (as well as the other standards in Subpart B of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations) an institution must demonstrate that it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administratively capable by meeting all the administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. An institution that fails to demonstrate compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with one or two administrative standards could be certified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisionally (see the earlier discussion on provisional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification) if the Secretary were to determine the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capable of meeting all the standards within a specific time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period and that the noncompliance did not necessitate taking a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stronger sanction such as a fine, limitation, suspension, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
termination proceeding against the institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, an initial applicant would not be able to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate compliance with all standards prior to participation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Secretary expects such an institution to demonstrate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it is capable of complying with all the standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Secretary currently provisionally certifies an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial applicant if the Secretary determines that the applicant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is capable of meeting the current standards within a specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of time. The Secretary will continue this practice, using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any additional standards proposed in this section if they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted in final. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to make explicit the requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that, to be considered administratively capable, an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must administer all the Title IV, HEA programs in which it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participates in accordance with all applicable statutory and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory provisions and special arrangements, agreements, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limitations. This expectation has been implicit. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary believes it is important to lay out this standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
together with all the other administrative standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Secretary proposes to clarify what is meant by a capable individual who is responsible for administering the Title
IV, HEA programs. It is important for each institution that is currently participating or seeking to participate
in the Title IV, HEA programs to demonstrate that it has staff who are capable of administering the programs properly.
While obviously a number of factors should be considered in determining what constitutes ``capable,'' the Secretary
believes that one factor that should be addressed in regulations is whether a financial aid administrator has been
certified by his or her State to have that capability. This factor would apply in a State that requires financial aid
administrators to be certified. The Secretary also proposes to consider whether an individual has successfully
completed Title IV, HEA program training that the Secretary has provided or approved. The Secretary is aware that
some professional organizations provide high caliber training in various aspects of the administration of the Title
IV, HEA programs and wishes to allow for acceptance of that outside training to meet this requirement in the future.
The Secretary welcomes comments on what elements and safeguards should be present in an acceptable training program
for financial aid administrators. While adequate experience and training are major considerations in evaluating
compliance with this standard, the Secretary welcomes suggestions regarding any other appropriate factors that
the Department of Education should take into account in determining an individual's capability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to clarify the factors that are considered in determining whether a financial aid office is
adequately staffed. The Secretary proposes to specify that in looking at the amount of funds administered by the institution,
the Secretary would also consider the number of students who receive any student financial assistance at the institution
as it has a direct bearing on whether an office is adequately staffed. The Secretary also proposes to add consideration
of the degree of office automation in the financial aid office. While the Secretary has always considered the extent
to which financial aid processing is automated in assessing the adequacy of financial aid offices, the Secretary
believes it is helpful to acknowledge specifically in the regulations the bearing the degree of office automation
has on the staffing levels of financial aid offices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the negotiated rulemaking sessions, discussions were held regarding the possible development of specific
staffing levels, such as ratios of financial aid staff to the number of financial aid recipients at an institution,
for determining the adequacy of the financial aid office of an institution participating in the Title IV, HEA programs
for the first time, an institution that undergoes a change of ownership resulting in a change of control, and an institution
that has exhibited administrative difficulty with other standards in this section. The Secretary believes that
it is not necessary to prescribe specific staffing levels for participating institutions that have not experienced
administrative problems. However, the Secretary agreed to solicit comments on the need for an additional method
to assess staffing levels of other institutions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An institution participating in the Title IV, HEA programs for the first time has neither the experience in dealing
with large numbers of financial aid recipients nor a record of administering those programs that can be evaluated.
During discussions at the negotiated rulemaking session, it was suggested that it might be necessary to prescribe
a specific number of staff for the institution's financial aid office that could serve as a guide for determining whether
the institution can handle the volume of financial aid applications and funds it expects to receive. This standard
would be required until the Secretary is able to judge the institution's actual administration of the programs. Similarly,
there is no assurance that an institution that changes ownership will operate with the same staff and procedures and
at the same level of funding as was the case under the previous ownership. Thus, that institution's former track record
could not be relied upon to predict its continued administrative capability and there might be a need to be able to evaluate
the adequacy of current or anticipated staffing levels using specific numbers or ratios, just as the Department would
evaluate those of a new participating institution. Finally, if an institution has documented problems or indicators
of trouble in administering the Title IV, HEA programs, these problems could well be caused by inadequate staffing
levels in the institution's financial aid office. Requirements for financial aid staff to be maintained at specific
levels might need to be imposed upon the institution. To address the problems and administer the Title IV, HEA programs
correctly, it is logical to expect an institution to meet minimum staffing levels that might be adopted.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary solicits comments on other ways of measuring staff adequacy at newly participating institutions,
institutions that change ownership resulting in a change of control and participating institutions with documented
administrative problems as well as any other categories of institutions that should be subject to requirements for
specific staffing levels. The Secretary further invites comment on how such considerations as the size of the institution,
and the volume of Title IV, HEA program funds administered by the institution should determine the number or ratio
of financial aid staff that the Secretary should prescribe. For example, the Secretary wishes to know whether a reasonable
ratio of staff to applicants or recipients can be established, and, if so, what that ratio might be. The Secretary understands
the difficulty inherent in strict application of a quantitative formula; nevertheless, concern was expressed at
the negotiated rulemaking sessions about having an adequate basis on which to make fair, worthwhile, and consistent
judgments of administrative capability. The Secretary recognizes that appropriate staffing levels must include
staff not only in the financial aid office but also in the business office or other offices within an institution, and
that the use of third-party servicers and office automation have a bearing on those levels. The Secretary asks commenters
to address these factors in their recommendations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to require that to be considered administratively capable, an institution have written procedures,
or other written information covering, at a minimum, the nature and frequency of communication of information among
all the offices that have an impact on the administration of the Title IV, HEA programs and the responsibilities of
various offices with respect to the awarding and delivery of Title IV, HEA program funds and reports to the Secretary.
The Secretary encourages institutions to have specific written procedures where possible, preferably in procedural
manuals, for this purpose. However, the Secretary recognizes that some of the information might be found in catalogs,
student or administrative handbooks, or other sources. The Secretary is proposing to add these provisions because
audits and program reviews of Title IV, HEA programs administered by institutions have shown that lack of written
procedures in these key areas is frequently a contributing factor to a lack of proper controls, resulting in overawards
and inadequate accounting of expenditures. To ensure that only eligible students receive funds and in the correct
amount, and that borrowers are tracked accurately and timely, it is essential that each institution be clear about
how and when pertinent information is transmitted from one office to another. The proposed addition to the regulations
includes examples of the types of information to be transmitted. Similarly, it is critical that each office that is
responsible for the approval and disbursement or delivery of Title IV, HEA funds have in writing that office's responsibilities
and reporting requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to clarify what constitutes division of the authorizing and disbursing or delivering functions
by adding an example. In the past, there has been virtually no real separation of these duties in some institutions;
this situation has presented an opportunity for significant abuse. It is important that two different individuals
authorize and disburse or deliver payment, and that an individual performing one of these functions not have control
over the work activities of the person or persons performing the other. To guard against collusion, it is also critical
that the individuals not be members of the same family or exercise substantial control over the institution through
a combined ownership interest in the institution. The terms 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
substantial control
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ownership interest
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 are currently defined in &sect;668.13. The Secretary considers two individuals to exercise substantial control
through a ``combined'' ownership interest if the individuals hold 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
together
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at least a 25 percent ownership interest in the institution. Thus, an institution would be precluded from having one
individual with a 10 percent ownership interest who awards Title IV, HEA program assistance and another individual
with a 15 percent ownership interest who disburses the funds. This concept is designed to allow for those employees
who participate to a moderate degree in a profit-sharing plan to be employed in one of the capacities described in this
provision without having a detrimental impact on the institution's administrative capability. Finally, the Secretary
wishes to clarify that, under both current regulations and the proposed regulations, it is acceptable for a check
that is to be disbursed or delivered to a student by another office to pass through the office that authorizes payment,
as long as the office that authorizes payment does no more than deliver the check to the office responsible for disbursement
or delivery to the student.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to make explicit that record-keeping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is a basic standard of administrative capability. Those new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions that do not have adequate record-keeping capability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not be approved to participate in the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. The record-keeping capability of participating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions would be evaluated when the institutions seek 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
renewal of their program participation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to revise the satisfactory progress 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards to require that the maximum time frame for completion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an undergraduate program be no longer than 150 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published length of the educational program and that increments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the maximum time frame not exceed the lesser of one academic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year or one-half the published length of the educational program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The establishment of the maximum time frame must, as usual, take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into account a student's enrollment status. Thus, an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that offers a four-year degree program (as listed in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's catalog) would have to establish a maximum time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frame of no more than six years for completion of the program by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a full-time student. The time frame could be proportionally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
longer for a half-time student. The Secretary emphasizes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this requirement would set an upper limit on the period of time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for which a student may receive Title IV, HEA program aid. An 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution would not be required to expel or otherwise remove a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student from the educational program after the expiration of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum time frame (unless, of course, the institution has a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar requirement for students who do not receive Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program assistance). The Secretary has a longstanding policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under which 150 percent of the length of an educational program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is considered to be a reasonable period in which a serious 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student should be able to complete the program. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notes that this proposed time frame is also consistent with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposals made by the NPRM implementing the Student Right-to-Know 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions in section 485(a) of the HEA (57 FR 30826). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary does not believe that Title IV, HEA program aid should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be provided beyond the point at which a student can reasonably be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected to complete his or her educational objective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to expand and clarify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for reporting information about possible fraud or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
illegal misconduct related to the Title IV, HEA programs. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations would eliminate the current provision for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to refer suspected instances of fraud or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criminal misconduct involving Title IV, HEA program assistance to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a State or local law enforcement agency rather than the Office of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Inspector General (OIG), if more appropriate. Instead, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations would require the institution to notify only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the OIG. The proposed regulations would also remove a related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement_that the institution report to the OIG, for each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar year, all relevant referrals to State or local law 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement agencies, as this would no longer be necessary if all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referrals were made directly to the OIG. Upon receipt of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information, the OIG will notify and work with the appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officials to resolve the issue. The Secretary is proposing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amend this section to streamline the referral process and reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the burden of reporting information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, under this provision governing the reporting of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instances of suspected fraud and criminal misconduct, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions are required to report only information regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicants for Title IV, HEA program assistance. Another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed change would expand the reporting requirement with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to both the types of misconduct to be reported and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals and entities involved in the misconduct. In addition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the information currently required, an institution would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to report information regarding illegal conduct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involving the eligibility and funding of the institution and its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students through Title IV, HEA programs believed by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to have been committed by any employee, third-party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicer, or other agent of the institution that acts in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capacity that involves the administration of the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. This provision would specify that illegal conduct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would include possible fraud, misrepresentation, conversion or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
breach of fiduciary responsibility, or any other illegal conduct. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes it is important to investigate any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible illegal misconduct (i.e., misconduct where formal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criminal charges have not been brought) in addition to possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criminal misconduct. The intent of this expansion is to specify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that institutions should report not only acts that constitute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fraud or criminal conduct, but any and all other illegal conduct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involving Title IV, HEA programs in which an employee or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party servicer might have engaged.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to modifying and expanding some of the existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative capability standards, and making others explicit, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary proposes to expand the administrative capability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards to include the general areas that SPREs will review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when they become operational. The Secretary realizes that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SPRE review standards must be developed in consultation with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions located in the State and will apply only to those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions that trigger reviews; therefore, those standards may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differ greatly from those proposed here for purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluating an institution's administrative capability. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary believes that these areas of review have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant bearing on an institution's administrative capability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and therefore should be incorporated in the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative capability standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary's overriding concern is that the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have sufficient information on which to make a determination that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a new or currently participating institution is administering or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is capable of administering the Title IV, HEA programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiently, effectively, and correctly. With this in mind, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary solicits comments on specific ways to quantify these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions (for example, what a ``significant number of students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with special needs'' is) and whether each of these added 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements should be made applicable to all institutions or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether these provisions should be made applicable only to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions that meet specific criteria or thresholds, e.g., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions with short-term programs, a history of high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withdrawal rates, high default rates, student complaints, etc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the Secretary is proposing to require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions that enroll significant numbers of students with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
special needs to have and implement a plan that provides access 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to adequate support services for those students. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that an institution that cannot provide adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
peripheral support should not enroll those special-needs students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in significant numbers. In evaluating administrative capability, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary has looked historically at withdrawal rates. High 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withdrawal rates often result in refund and default problems in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the FFEL programs. Some institutions have high withdrawal rates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because they have recruited students who were not able to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete the program. Student withdrawal for academic reasons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been addressed by changes to the ability-to-benefit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions: students who do not have a high school diploma or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognized equivalent now need to pass an independently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administered, approved examination. However, other students who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been admitted have had the academic capability to succeed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but have been unable to complete the program because of other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors, such as lack of child care, or changes in child care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arrangements, or lack of adequate transportation. Some of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negotiators provided the Secretary with examples of students who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could not complete a course of study because of a lack of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information about how to access adequate support services, who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise may not have enrolled in those programs if accurate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information about the restricted availability of those services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
had been disclosed. For example, if a school enrolls a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant number of students who have small children and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, need someone to look after their children while they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are in classes and studying, or students who have no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transportation of their own, it is incumbent upon the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to work with these students to ensure they have access to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ancillary services required in order for them to complete their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education or training. The institution may, but need not, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actually provide the specific services, such as child care, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must, at a minimum, provide adequate guidance and access to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enable their students to overcome barriers to attendance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary is proposing that affected institutions have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan, which they may be asked to submit, to demonstrate that they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet this provision. However, the Secretary is interested in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receiving suggestions about other ways to address the problem of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions that recruit and enroll significant numbers of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students who need support services without informing those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students about access to the support services. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solicits comments regarding how to determine what constitutes a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``significant number'' of students with special needs and what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
special needs should be included. Further, the Secretary would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
like to receive proposals for alternate means of addressing this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue.

The Secretary proposes to require each institution to have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures for receiving, investigating, and resolving student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaints. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to require that if the stated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objectives of an educational program are to prepare students for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gainful employment, the institution must be able to show that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is a reasonable relationship between the length of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program and entry level requirements for employment. In addition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to supporting the length of a program, the institution should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
able to substantiate the need for the number of hours of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training. The Secretary proposes to consider the relationship 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between the quantity of training provided in the program and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entry-level requirements to be reasonable if the number of clock 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours in the program does not exceed by more than 50 percent any

State requirement for the minimum number of clock hours necessary

to train the student in the occupation for which the program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepares the student. For example, the Secretary is aware of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution that sought approval of a 600-hour program when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
state in which the institution is located requires only 40 hours 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of training for entry level positions for which the program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided training. The Secretary believes that in situations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as this, the onus is on the institution to demonstrate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value of the longer program. The Secretary believes that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excessive length of programs requires a student to incur 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional unnecessary debt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A corollary requirement is that the need for the training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided is established. Over the past several years, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary has been made aware of many schools that have provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three to six months of training for entry-level jobs, some of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which required no external training before employment, as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employers have internal training programs or provide on-the-job 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training. As a basic tenet of student financial assistance is to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enable students who would not otherwise be able to afford needed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training or education to enroll in an appropriate program, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary believes that if an institution is administering the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA programs adequately, it can demonstrate that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training it provides is needed. The Secretary solicits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggestions on the most appropriate documentation to show the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need for the training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to add to the administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability standards the requirement that the institution make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information on job availability and state licensing requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to students in occupational, professional and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vocational educational programs. The Secretary believes that, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order for a prospective occupational, professional or vocational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education student and financial aid applicant to make an informed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision about enrollment and use of student financial assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a particular program, the applicant must have access to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accurate, up-to-date information on the job market for that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
field, and the availability of specific jobs for which he or she 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be adequately prepared after completion of the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, the applicant should have access to information on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extent to which the educational or training program addresses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
state licensing standards, so the informed student can determine, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with reasonable assurance, that necessary topics are covered in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the program and the extent to which additional information, not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary for state licensure, is covered. The Secretary notes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that this information may be obtained by the institution from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other Federal and State sources, such as Employment Service or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State occupational coordinating committees. An institution would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be required to produce this information on its own. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to include within the administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability standards a requirement that the institution have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advertising, promotion, and student recruitment practices that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accurately reflect the content and objectives of the educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs offered by the institution. The Secretary believes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to administer the Title IV, HEA programs in a responsible manner, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution must advertise its programs and the financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance available in an accurate manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to specify that an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide all required program and fiscal reports and financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements in a timely manner. The Secretary believes strongly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that adequate, timely submission of accurate reports is an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
essential element in the proper administration of the Title IV, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA programs. The failure to meet requirements for submission of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports is an indication that an institution's administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability is impaired. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to include as a specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative standard the requirement that an institution have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no outstanding liabilities owed to the Secretary unless the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution has made satisfactory arrangements to repay those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liabilities and is honoring those arrangements. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that unless a participating institution demonstrates it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has met all its programmatic, contractual, and fiscal obligations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the past, and has taken positive steps to rectify problems and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liabilities in the past, there is no reason to presume that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution has the capability and willingness to administer the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA programs responsibly in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to take into account whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant problems have been identified in final reports and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determinations issued by the Secretary, the OIG, accrediting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies, SPREs, guaranty agencies, and State authorizing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies and findings in criminal, civil, or administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proceedings, in addition to financial and compliance audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports and program review reports, in assessing an institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative capability. The Secretary believes that pertinent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information from any of the agencies or proceedings identified is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relevant to determining whether an institution is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administratively capable. An institution should be considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administratively capable only if there is no evidence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant problems in those reviews or proceedings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to add to the administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability standards, the prohibition against debarments, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspensions, and causes of debarment or suspension under E.O. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12549 and the FAR, 48 CFR subpart 9.4. The Secretary proposes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amend this section to provide that an institution would not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered administratively capable if (1) cause exists for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
debarring the institution under 34 CFR 85.305, or for suspending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution under 34 CFR 85.405, (2) any principal (as that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
term is used in 34 CFR part 85) of the institution is debarred or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspended, or (3) the institution is an affiliate (as that term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is used in 34 CFR part 85) of any person so debarred or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspended. Under these changes, the Secretary would not certify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the administrative capability of an institution that fits into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any of these categories. The Secretary would not permit such an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to begin participation in a Title IV, HEA program, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the Secretary would require a participating institution to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rectify the problem that adversely affects the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative capability. A participating institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inability or unwillingness to rectify the problem would warrant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initiation of an emergency action, limitation, suspension, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
termination proceeding against the institution under subpart G. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary expects that such a proceeding would be combined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a debarment or suspension proceeding under 34 CFR part 85. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These changes are needed to establish appropriate safeguards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to protect the Title IV, HEA programs when serious questions are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
raised about the honesty and lawfulness of the conduct of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's owners, officers, directors, management, employees, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or affiliates whose duties involve the administration of or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
influence over those programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to require that an institution comply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with any standards regarding completion and placement rates and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pass rates on State licensing examinations established by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State in which an institution is located as a standard of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative capability. The Secretary supports the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development of appropriate standards by each State, as individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States will be able to address local concerns and conditions in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the development of standards. In the absence of such a State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard, the Secretary believes an institution must comply with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate standards regarding completion rates, placement rates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and pass rates on required State examinations, as established by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary, in consultation with institutions located in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to require as a standard for full 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation in the Title IV, HEA programs that institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have default rates that do not exceed 20 percent for the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stafford Loan and Federal SLS programs, and default rates that do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not exceed 15 percent for the Federal Perkins Loan program. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Federal Stafford Loan and Federal SLS programs, a 20 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trigger is currently used as an indicator of impaired 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative capability. For the Federal Perkins Loan program, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary has used a 20 percent trigger as an indicator of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impaired administrative capability. The Secretary is proposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to change this figure to 15 percent for consistency with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory requirement of section 461(g) of the HEA that requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an institution with a cohort default rate of 15 percent in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Perkins Loan program to establish a default management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan pursuant to regulations. Under this proposal, institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applying for participation under a change of ownership or for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
renewal of their participation with default rates exceeding these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed amounts would be provisionally certified for a lack of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative capability if no other serious administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability problems were identified that warranted denying the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application. The Secretary notes that, under this proposal, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution applying for a renewal of participation that has a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
default rate under the Federal Stafford Loan programs that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeds 20 percent could submit information demonstrating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mitigating circumstances as provided in &sect;668.15 of current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations to demonstrate that the institution's default rate is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not a basis for denial of full participation. If no other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
serious administrative capability problems were identified that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warrant denying the application for full participation, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution with default rates over these triggers could receive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full participation if it successfully showed that those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mitigating circumstances existed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the Secretary is proposing that an institution would not be considered administratively capable if
it has a withdrawal rate of more than 33 percent. This change from the current regulations, under which the Secretary
considers withdrawal rates of more than 33 percent as an indicator of problems in administrative capability, would
become, like the other standards in this section, absolute requirements rather than mere indicators. The calculation
of this withdrawal rate is currently made using the formula on the application for participation in the Title IV, HEA
programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary is proposing these changes to the current default rate and withdrawal rate requirements because the
Secretary believes that these rates are appropriate measures of an institution's past administrative performance;
an institution that administers the Title IV, HEA programs correctly will, absent mitigating circumstances for
its Federal Stafford Loan and Federal SLS programs default rate, have default rates and withdrawal rates below these
percentages.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary understands that some currently participating institutions have rates in excess of these levels.
Therefore, the Secretary anticipates that when these institutions next undergo a reevaluation of their institutional
eligibility, administrative capability, and financial responsibility, some of them would be determined not to
be administratively capable purely for failure to meet these standards, even if they meet all the other financial
responsibility and administrative capability standards in these proposed regulations. In those cases, if there
are no other significant problems, these institutions could be granted provisional certification so they could
continue to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs for a limited time on a limited basis to allow them to bring their
default or withdrawal rates or both down to an acceptable level. However, an institution with a high withdrawal rate
applying for participation in the Title IV, HEA programs for the first time would not be approved to participate in
the Title IV, HEA programs. In addition to these default rates the Secretary plans to establish an appropriate default
rate applicable to the FDSL Program and solicits comments on what that should be. For example, comments are requested
on whether FDSL Program default rate thresholds should be developed to take into consideration students who are using
income contingent repayment.

Because of the changes described above in proposed &sect;668.16 concerning the effect of default and withdrawal
rates on an institution's administrative capability, the remaining provisions in current &sect;668.15 would address
default reduction measures for institutions with high Federal Stafford loan and Federal SLS default rates. Therefore,
the Secretary proposes to redesignate current &sect;668.15 as &sect;668.17 and rename it ``Default reduction measures.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to clarify that the Secretary notifies an institution of its Federal Stafford loan and Federal
SLS cohort default rate if that rate exceeds 20 percent for any fiscal year before the Secretary takes an action against
the institution. This change merely reflects the Secretary's current practice.

The Secretary proposes to remove the option to require an institution with a Federal Stafford loan and Federal SLS
cohort default rate that exceeds 20 percent for any fiscal year to submit to the Secretary and guaranty agencies the
specific information described in current &sect;668.15(b)(2)(ii) concerning pass rates, job placement rates,
and completion rates. These changes are consistent with earlier statutory and regulatory revisions to current &sect;668.15
and because the Secretary rarely asks institutions to submit this information. The Secretary would reserve the right
to request any information the Secretary deems necessary to make a preliminary determination as to the appropriate
action to be taken by the Secretary regarding the institution.

Default Management Plan
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to clarify requirements for implementation of default management plans for institutions
with Federal Stafford loan and Federal SLS cohort default rates greater than 20 percent for any fiscal year. The Secretary
has required implementation of a default management plan for institutions with cohort default rates greater than
20 percent since the implementation of the default reduction initiative in final regulations published June 5, 1989
(54 FR 24114). In the preamble to the June 5, 1989, final regulations, the Secretary stated that, in accordance with
current &sect;668.15(e), an institution with a default rate over 20 percent could be required to implement a default
management plan. The proposed provision specifies that, for an institution with a Federal Stafford loan and Federal
SLS cohort default rates greater than 20 percent or less than or equal to 40 percent for any fiscal year, the institution
would have to submit a default management plan that implements the measures described in appendix D to this part. An
institution could only implement a default management plan that deviates from the measures in appendix D if the institution
submits a justification for the deviation that is approved by the Secretary. An institution with a Federal Stafford
loan and Federal SLS cohort default rate that exceeds 40 percent for any fiscal year, and, therefore, is subject to
a limitation, suspension, or termination action under subpart G, would have to implement all of the default reduction
measures described in appendix D to this part no later than 60 days after the institution receives the Secretary's
notification of the institutions cohort default rate. The institution would not be required to submit any written
plans to the Secretary or a guaranty agency unless specifically requested to do so by the Secretary or guaranty agency.

End of Participation

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 435(a)(2) of the HEA provides that an institution's participation in the FFEL programs ends if the Secretary
determines that the institution's cohort default rate for each of the three most recent fiscal years for which the
Secretary has determined the institution's rate is equal to or greater than the applicable threshold rates. Section
435(a)(2)(B) of the HEA sets the threshold rate for fiscal year 1994 and all subsequent fiscal years at 25 percent.
Consistent with current regulations, institutions may appeal such loss of participation by demonstrating that
mitigating circumstances as found in current &sect;668.15 are present.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, an institution may not participate in the FFEL programs beginning eight calendar days after the date the
Secretary notifies the institution that its cohort default rate exceeds the specified thresholds. The Secretary
proposes to change this provision to require that an institution may not participate in the FFEL program beginning
with the date that the institution receives notification from the Secretary that its cohort default rate exceeds
the specified thresholds. The Secretary does not believe it is appropriate to continue to allow an institution that
has lost its participation due to a high default rate to have the benefit of further Title IV, HEA program funds unless
it successfully appeals. The Secretary proposes to make corresponding changes throughout this section.

Appeal Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Technical Amendments of 1993 amended section 435(a) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(m) of the HEA as those sections relate to institutional appeals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of cohort default rates. These amendments are not reflected in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this NPRM but will be addressed separately. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary proposes to remove the provision that provides that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution may appeal its loss of participation in the FFEL 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs under the provisions of this section on the grounds that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution has reduced its cohort default rate for each of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the two most recent fiscal years for which the Secretary has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculated a cohort default rate for that institution by 50 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of the amount by which its cohort default rate for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previous year exceeds the applicable threshold percentage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in this section. This provision is no longer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable because it was limited to notices of loss of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility that were received by an institution in the fiscal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year that ended September 30, 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current regulations allow an institution to appeal its loss 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of participation in the FFEL programs under the provisions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section on the grounds that, for any twenty-four month 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period ending not more than six months prior to the date the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution submits its appeal, two-thirds or more of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's students who are enrolled on at least a half-time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis are individuals from disadvantaged economic backgrounds as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established by documentary evidence submitted by the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as a Pell Grant Index of zero, or an AGI of less than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poverty level, as determined by criteria developed by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department of Health and Human Services. The Secretary proposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the term ``such as'' be eliminated to reflect the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practice; i.e., the institution must establish the grounds for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its appeal based only on the information specified in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. The Department would only accept the specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence listed in the regulations although the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations suggest that other evidence is acceptable. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change reflects the current practice of the Secretary. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary solicits comment on other acceptable forms of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

cohort default rate 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 435(m) of the HEA. In accordance with the statute, as in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the past, for any fiscal year in which 30 or more current and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
former students at the institution enter repayment on Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stafford or Federal SLS program loans received for attendance at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution, the cohort default rate is the percentage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those current and former students who enter repayment in that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiscal year on Federal Stafford or Federal SLS program loans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received for attendance at that institution who default before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the end of the following fiscal year. Formerly, for any fiscal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year in which fewer than 30 of the institution's current and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
former students entered repayment on a Federal Stafford or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal SLS loans received for attendance at the institution, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cohort default rate was the average over the three most recent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiscal years of the rates calculated in the manner described for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any fiscal year in which 30 or more current and former students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enter repayment on a Federal Stafford or Federal SLS program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan. The HEA now requires that, for any fiscal year in which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fewer than 30 of the institution's current and former students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enter repayment, the cohort default rate is the percentage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those current and former students who entered repayment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Stafford loans or Federal SLS loans in any of the three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most recent fiscal years who default before the end of the fiscal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year in which they entered repayment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Technical Amendments of 1993 changed section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
435(m)(1)(B) of the HEA to make clear that the issue of improper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan servicing is only part of the appeal process and does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relate to the Secretary's initial release of cohort default 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates. Thus, in issuing the rates initially, the Secretary is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not obligated to consider allegations of improper loan servicing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to amend the regulations to reflect this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change by removing the requirement that the Secretary must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclude any loans that, due to improper servicing or collection, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would result in an inaccurate or incomplete calculation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cohort default rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 435(m) of the HEA requires the addition of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that a Federal SLS loan not be considered to enter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repayment until after the borrower has ceased to be enrolled in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an educational program leading to a degree or certificate at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible institution on at least a half-time basis (as determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the institution) and ceased to be in a period of forbearance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on that enrollment. Section 435(m) further requires that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each eligible lender of a Federal SLS loan to provide the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guaranty agency with the information necessary to determine when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the loan entered repayment for purposes of this definition and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires the guaranty agency to provide that information to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary.

The Amendments of 1992 added section 484B to the HEA to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require an institution to have in place, as of July 23, 1992, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fair and equitable institutional refund policy as promulgated in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that section. The fair and equitable refund requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prescribed by law are similar to the fair and equitable refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements prescribed by &sect;682.606 of the FFEL program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations for institutions that participate in the FFEL 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. The HEA extends this requirement to institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participating in any Title IV, HEA program and makes various 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this fair and equitable refund policy, an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must make a refund of unearned tuition, fees, room and board, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other charges to a student who received Title IV, HEA program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance (including PLUS loans received on behalf of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student) if the student does not register for the period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollment for which the student was charged or if the student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withdraws, drops out, or is expelled from the institution before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completing the period of enrollment for which he or she was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interpretation of the applicability of a fair and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equitable refund policy was the subject of extensive discussions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
among the negotiators. The HEA specifically mandates a refund to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any student who received Title IV HEA program assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, at issue during the negotiations was the fairness and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equity in having a refund policy for students who receive Title 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IV, HEA program assistance that is different from the refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy for those students enrolled in the same educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program who do not receive Title IV, HEA program assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several negotiators felt that requiring institutions to apply the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund requirements found in this proposed section to all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students who attend an institution would be an unauthorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intrusion by the Secretary into the administrative decisions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an institution. Many negotiators felt that compliance with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund requirement that is applicable to all students would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
too costly for an institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Secretary proposes to define a fair and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equitable refund policy only with respect to students who receive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA program assistance. Although the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposes to limit the scope of this provision to those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipients, under this proposed provision an institution would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be prohibited from adopting these refund requirements for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to require that an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide a written statement containing its refund policy to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prospective students and make its policy known to currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrolled students. This proposal is based upon requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently prescribed by &sect;682.606 of the FFEL program regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to expand this FFEL provision to require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the written statement must be clear and conspicuous and must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include information on the allocation of refunds and repayments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to sources of aid. In keeping with current FFEL program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, the Secretary proposes that the written statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include examples of the application of the refund policy. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement would be met if the institution informs students in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the written statement that examples are available and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution makes the examples readily available to the student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As in the current FFEL program regulations, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposes to require an institution to provide the written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement to prospective students. Section 668.41(b) of current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations defines a ``prospective student'' as an individual who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has contacted an institution participating in any Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program for the purpose of requesting information concerning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
admission to the institution. The Secretary believes that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student is a ``prospective student'' if he or she is not enrolled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in an institution and has not entered into any contractual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement or incurred a financial obligation to attend an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution. Therefore, the Secretary proposes to require an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to provide this written statement to a student prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the earlier of the student's enrollment or the execution of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the student's enrollment agreement. If the institution's refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy changes, the institution would have to ensure that all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students are made aware of the new policy and advise the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently enrolled students of any changes that the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to apply to those students for their current enrollment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary believes that some institutions have assessed excessive equipment charges that have increased the
total aid received. For example, some students have been charged as much as ten or fifteen times an institution's documented
equipment costs for kits students were required to purchase. If the calculation of a refund includes equipment charges
with such an extreme price mark-up, the amount of money an institution would be permitted to keep is greatly inflated.
To help curb this abuse, the Secretary is proposing to require an institution to publish in its school catalog or other
information provided to its students, the cost to the student of required supplies and equipment. Further, the Secretary
proposes to require an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to substantiate to Department officials, upon the request of the Secretary, that the costs are reasonably
related to the costs of providing the supplies and equipment to students. This provision would not require the institution
to provide this cost substantiation to students, but would permit the Secretary to obtain information regarding
the cost of required supplies and equipment to determine whether an abuse in this area is occurring or has occurred.
For example, this information may be routinely reviewed during a program review. If the charges for equipment and
supplies appear to be unreasonable, the institution would be required to show that its charges were reasonably related
to the cost of providing those items. Under this proposal, an institution would not be expected to provide this information
to the Secretary as a regularly scheduled submission, but only upon request from the Department of Education.

Fair and Equitable Refund Policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 484B of the HEA defines a fair and equitable refund policy to be one that provides for at least the largest of
the amounts provided under: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The requirements of applicable State law; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The specific refund requirements established by the institution's nationally recognized accrediting agency
and approved by the Secretary; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund calculation described in the statute for students attending the institution for the first time, except that
this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund calculation does not apply for any student whose withdrawal date is after the 60 percent point in time in the
period of enrollment for which the student has been charged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary intends to clarify that an accrediting agency's refund policy must contain specific standards. Refund
``guidelines'' developed by an accrediting agency (for example, an accrediting agency refund policy that only requires
an institution to develop its own fair and equitable refund policy) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not be considered to have standards. Obviously, an institution would not be considered to be in compliance with
a State's or an approved accrediting agency's refund policy if the institution adopts a refund policy that is merely
similar to the State's or accrediting agency's but does not incorporate all the required standards. This policy is
consistent with the current provisions of the FFEL program regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary recognizes that there may be situations where an institution's State and accrediting agency do not
have specific refund policies. If a student is not entitled to a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund, no specific standard would then exist under the law to ensure that the student received a fair and equitable
refund. Because the Secretary believes that all recipients of Title IV, HEA program assistance should be treated
fairly, the Secretary is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing to require an institution to provide a refund to a student that is the larger of the institution's refund
policy or the specific refund standards contained in appendix A to this part if an institution's State and accrediting
agency do not have refund standards and the student is not entitled to a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund. The NPRM published on January 24, 1994 to implement the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accrediting agency provisions in subpart 2 of part H of the HEA proposes that the Secretary will not recognize an accrediting
agency unless the agency has a refund policy that provides for a fair and equitable refund to a student. The Secretary
notes that if this provision of the accreditation agency NPRM is adopted in final regulations, there would not be a
need for the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appendix A requirement once all accrediting agencies have been reviewed and recognized by the Secretary.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The refund policy proposed to be adopted as appendix A is derived from the guidelines developed by the National Association
of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO). Currently, under the FFEL program regulations, an institution
must follow the guidelines developed by NACUBO and restated in appendix A to the FFEL program regulations (or refund
policy standards set by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
another association of institutions of postsecondary education and approved by the Secretary) if neither an institution's
State nor its accrediting agency have refund standards. While the NACUBO standards identify policy standards that
institutions should have for the refund of student charges, the Secretary's proposed appendix A establishes policy
standards that institutions must have for the refund of student charges. The Secretary has always considered these
standards as mandatory for purposes of the FFEL program regulations and is, therefore, making that interpretation
clear in these proposed regulations. Further, the Secretary's proposed appendix A to this part would mandate the
percentage of tuition charges that must be returned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to a student who withdraws from an institution at various intervals during the refund period. In the development of
the actual refund calculation for this policy, the Secretary adapted a proportionate calculation that is similar
to refund policies used by proprietary institutions. The Secretary believes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this refund schedule provides a fairer allocation of resources between the institution and the Title IV, HEA programs
than exists under the shorter refund periods often found at traditional colleges and universities. This proposed
refund policy is not normally as generous to the student as the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund policy prescribed by the statute, because the affected students would not be first time students and, therefore,
would not be entitled to the full protection of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund policy. Under the standards in appendix A, a student who submits written notice of withdrawal up to one week
before the first day of class would receive a refund of 100 percent of tuition charges. The refund would be reduced to
at least 90 percent if the student submits written notice of withdrawal between the end 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the 100 percent period and the first 10 percent of the period for which the student was charged. A student would receive
at least a 50 percent refund if he or she withdraws between the first 10 percent and the first 25 percent of the period
for which the student was charged. Finally, a student would receive at least a 25 percent refund if he or she withdraws
between the first 25 percent and the first 50 percent of the period for which the student was charged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a part of the refund policy in proposed appendix A, the Secretary would allow an institution to subtract from the
refund to a student any charges for equipment (including books and supplies) if there is a separate charge for the equipment
and the student actually obtains the equipment but the student fails to return the equipment within 20 days after his
or her withdrawal. This provision is discussed further in the explanation on 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refunds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An institution must determine whether a student withdrew prior to the 60 percent point in time in the period of enrollment
for which the student has been charged when determining whether the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund calculation is applicable to a student. The Secretary proposes to define ``the 60 percent point in time in the
period of enrollment for which the student has been charged'' based upon whether the educational program in which
the student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is enrolled is measured in credit hours or clock hours. In the case of an educational program that is measured in credit
hours, this point would be the point in calendar time when 60 percent of the period of enrollment for which the student
has been charged has elapsed. In the case of an educational program that is measured in clock hours, this point would
be the point in time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when the student completes 60 percent of the clock hours scheduled for the period of enrollment for which the student
is charged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For instance, if the student's period of enrollment in an educational program that is measured in credit hours is scheduled
to last 5 months (20 weeks), the 60 percent point of the period is at 12 weeks. However, in the case of a program measured
in clock hours, the Secretary believes that it is more accurate to use the number of completed clock hours to determine
the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage of enrollment. For instance, if the student is scheduled to complete 900 clock hours, the 60 percent point
of the period of enrollment occurs when the student has completed 540 clock hours. The Secretary wishes to emphasize
that the definition of the determination of the 60 percent point in time in the period of enrollment for which the student
has been charged is different from the determination of ``the portion of the period of period of enrollment for which
the student has been charged that remains'' that is used to calculate the refund after the institution has determined
that the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund calculation is to be used. The proposed definition of the latter term will be discussed later. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining the largest refund to a student, the Secretary proposes to require an institution to determine the
largest refund for each student. An institution would not be permitted to determine which refund is generally the
most generous and use that refund calculation for all students. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary believes that current computer technology enables an institution to automate this determination through
the use of computer software.

pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 regulations found in the FFEL program regulations, institutions have been advised to follow guidance given for implementation
of the FFEL program regulations as ``safe-harbor'' guidance for implementation of the statutory requirements for

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refunds. The Secretary intends that final regulations for

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refunds developed as a result of this NPRM and any guidance given for implementation of these regulations will replace

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund policy for an institution that is required to use a

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund policy because the institution has a cohort default rate that exceeds 30 percent under the FFEL programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund,'' as defined in statute, is required for a student attending an institution for the first time, unless another
applicable refund is greater. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund may not be less than that portion of the tuition, fees, room, board, and other charges assessed the student by
the institution equal to the portion of the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged that remains
on the withdrawal date. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund is then rounded downward to the nearest 10 percent of that period. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund is then reduced for any unpaid charges and a reasonable administrative fee. The administrative fee may not
exceed the lesser of one hundred dollars or five percent of the tuition, fees, room and board, and other charges assessed
the student. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to permit institutions to subtract certain amounts of institutional charges from the refund
to the student. The Secretary wishes to clarify that these proposed regulations would permit an institution to subtract
charges or portion of charges from a

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund only if the charges are included in the calculation of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the statute, an institution may subtract any unpaid charges owed to the institution by the student. The Secretary
is proposing to define unpaid charges by using the definition for an ``unpaid amount of a scheduled cash payment''
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 8, 1993 (58 FR 32188). Although those final regulations discussed the unpaid amount of a scheduled cash payment
as being excluded from the amount the institution may retain for institutional charges, rather than for the purpose
of excluding any unpaid balance from the refund to the student, the Secretary believes it is appropriate to adopt the
same definition to define these unpaid charges. In accordance with the current regulations, a student's scheduled
cash payment would be defined as the amount of institutional charges that is not paid for by financial aid. An institution
could count any late disbursements of Title IV aid as financial aid for this purpose (i.e., the amount of the late disbursement
would not be included as part of the student's scheduled cash payment.) Any amount of the scheduled cash payment that
has not been paid would be the amount of unpaid charges owed by the student. The treatment of unpaid charges for refunds
other than 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refunds is addressed later in this discussion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute also permits an institution to subtract a reasonable administrative fee from the refund owed to a student.
This administrative fee must be a real charge and documented as such. An institution may not automatically subtract
the lesser of five percent of the tuition, fees, room and board, and other charges assessed the student or one hundred
dollars if no such administrative fee actually exists.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to add to the list of permitted subtractions from the refund to a student any application fee
charged by the institution. The Secretary believes that an application fee is a fee incurred separately from a student's
charges for an enrollment period, and therefore, should not be included in the refund to the student. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, for institutions whose students are issued meal credits that can be spent irregularly throughout the
enrollment period (e.g., coupons or meal tokens) the Secretary proposes to allow an institution to deduct from the
refund owed under this paragraph the portion of ``board'' charges (i.e., meal tickets) that has been expended by the
student that exceeds the portion attributable to the period for which the student attended at the time of withdrawal.
For example, if a student withdrew at the 50 percent point in time in the period of enrollment for which the student has
been charged but had used 60 percent of the meal tickets, the institution could subtract from the refund to the student
the value of the meal tickets attributable to that 10 percent of the period of enrollment that the student did not attend.
If a student used less than the attributable value of the meal tickets at the time of his or her withdrawal, an institution
would not be permitted to subtract any amount from the refund to the student. An institution would not be permitted
to subtract any amount from the refund to the student in cases where students have unlimited use of meal tickets.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary intends to continue the current policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding the inclusion of books, supplies, and other equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refund calculation consistent with guidance given 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to institutions that were required to use a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy because the institution had a default rate that exceeds 30 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent and was required to calculate a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refund for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student who received a loan under the FFEL programs. As is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently the case, an institution is required to include the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full amount of charges for equipment in the calculation of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refund if a separate charge exists for the equipment by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution or if the institution requires the student to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchase the equipment from a certain vendor. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that by charging students a separate equipment charge or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by requiring students to purchase the equipment from a single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vendor (for example, a school book store) the equipment charges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are being mandated by the institution and should be treated as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutional costs. In effect, the institution is the sole 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source of the equipment. If an institution does not have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate charge for equipment and the student has the option of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchasing the equipment from more than one source, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution would not have to include the equipment charge in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refund calculation. An institution would have to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
able to demonstrate that its students have the option of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchasing the equipment from other sources that are easily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accessible to the student and that the students are advised that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an option is available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to allow an institution to subtract 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the refund to a student any charges for equipment (including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
books and supplies) that a student could have returned for credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but did not do so. Under this provision, there would have to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a separate charge for the equipment, and the student must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actually have obtained the equipment but failed to return the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment within 20 days after his or her withdrawal. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision was suggested by one of the negotiators and is based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon California law. By consensus of the negotiators, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision would be extended to situations where the equipment and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplies are sold by an affiliate or related entity of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution. If the student does not return the equipment, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution could subtract from the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refund owed to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student the documented cost to the institution of equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issued to the student. The student would be liable for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount, if any, by which the documented cost for equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeds the amount of the student's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this proposal, if some or all of the equipment is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actually received by the student, the institution would have to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refund calculation 100 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount paid for that portion of the equipment. Further, if an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution gives a student the option to return the equipment, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution would not be permitted to subtract the cost of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the equipment from the refund to the student if the student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chooses to return the equipment and does so within 20 days of his 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or her withdrawal. The Secretary believes that 20 days provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the student with a sufficient period of time to return equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without delaying the refund to the student. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes that any equipment returned by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student must be in good condition allowing for reasonable wear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and tear. The Secretary notes that there may be restrictions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under State laws that prevent an institution from accepting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned equipment due to health and sanitary reasons. Other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions might also limit the return of equipment. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, a workbook that has been written in or a damaged text 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
book might not be reusable. The Secretary solicits comments on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether this provision should be expanded to identify other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions that could affect the institution's ability to reissue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary notes that, because an institution must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include the charges listed above in the calculation of a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refund and is then permitted to subtract the charges or a portion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the charges from this refund, in many cases it appears that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution could retain more than the actual charge to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student. For example, if an institution that charges a $100 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative fee calculates a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refund to a student, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portion of the $100 charge would be refunded to the student in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refund formula, and a portion of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charge would be retained by the institution. Yet, in addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution could then be permitted to subtract the full $100 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the refund to the student. The Secretary requests comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on whether it may be more appropriate to require institutions to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclude these charges from the refund calculation entirely rather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than subtracting the charge after performing the calculation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also requests comment on whether some other means 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be adopted to eliminate this potential ``double counting'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of charges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of determining a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refund, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposes to exclude from the ``room charges'' that are to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the refund calculation, any room charges for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
off-campus housing that are passed through the institution in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their entirety to an entity that is not under the control of, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related to, or affiliated with the institution. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognizes that an institution may enter into an agreement with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an outside agency to provide lodging for students. Under such an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arrangement, the institution is merely a conduit that passes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
room charges along to the other entity, yet those charges appear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as institutional charges on student accounts. In these cases, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the independence of the entities and the students' continuing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
right to occupy the housing after the students withdraw warrant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the exclusion of the room charges from the refund calculation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also proposes to exclude from the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refund calculation charges for group health insurance that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandatory for all students in the calculation of a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refund so long as the coverage remains in effect for the students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
throughout the period for which the student was charged. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary notes that the inclusion of these group health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insurance charges in the refund calculation could cancel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insurance coverage that might otherwise be extended to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student beyond the student's withdrawal date.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to define a student attending an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution for the first time as a student who has not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously attended at least one class at the institution. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student who received a refund of 100 percent of his or her 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tuition and fees (less any permitted administrative fee) under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution's refund policy for previous attendance at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution would also be considered a first-time student. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that a first-time student at an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution is a student who is attending that institution, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opposed to any institution, for the first time. Therefore, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the student has not previously attended at least one class at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific institution, the Secretary would consider the student to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be attending that institution for the first time. If a student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transfers to another institution, he or she would count as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first-time student at the new institution, if he or she has not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously attended at least one class at the new institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a student attends an institution, withdraws from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution (and receives less than a 100 percent refund), and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
then returns to the same institution, the student would not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treated as a first-time student for his or her second period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attendance. The Secretary believes that if a student has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously received a 100 percent refund at an institution, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes of this definition, the student should be treated as if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
he or she had not previously attended the institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes that a student should remain a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first-time student until the student withdraws from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution after attending at least one class, or completes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of enrollment for which he or she has been charged, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whichever occurs first. Therefore, the shortest amount of time a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student could remain a first-time student is the period until he 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or she withdraws after attending one class. The longest amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of time a student could remain a first-time student is the period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
until his or her completion of the period of enrollment for which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
he or she has been charged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to adopt for all the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs the requirement currently found in the FFEL program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations that an institution's payment to a lender of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portion of a refund allocable to a Title IV, HEA program cannot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be delayed because of a delay in the return of equipment. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision would apply to the portion of the refund due to any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the actual calculation of a refund under the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund provisions of section 484B of the HEA, the amount of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund is based on ``the portion of the period of enrollment for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the student has been charged that remains [after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student stopped attending].'' Under the law, ``the portion of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of enrollment for which the student has been charged that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remains'' in an educational program measured in credit hours is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined by dividing the number of weeks that the student did 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not complete by the total number of weeks in the program. For a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clock-hour program, the determination is made by dividing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of clock hours not completed by the total number of clock 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours. For a correspondence program, the determination is made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by dividing the number of lessons not completed by the total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of lessons. The Secretary has merely repeated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
language here. The Secretary would like to note that ``the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portion of the period of enrollment for which the student has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been charged that remains'' is used to calculate the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund to a student and is distinct from the determination of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
60 percent point in time in the period of enrollment for which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the student has been charged that is used to determine whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund calculation is applicable. The definition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``the 60 percent point in time in the period of enrollment for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the student has been charged'' was discussed earlier in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summary.

Period of Enrollment for Which the Student Has Been Charged
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Generally, the Secretary proposes to define ``the period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollment for which the student has been charged,'' as the actual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period for which an institution charges a student. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary proposes to establish a minimum period of enrollment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for which the student has been charged to prevent institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from establishing very short periods to minimize the program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charges that would be subject to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refunds for first-time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students. In the case of an educational program that is measured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in credit hours and uses semesters, trimesters, quarters, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other academic terms, the minimum period would be the semester, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trimester, quarter, or other academic term. In the case of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
educational program that is measured in credit hours and does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use semesters, trimesters, quarters, or other academic terms, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an educational program that is measured in clock hours, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum period would be the lesser of the length of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
educational program or an academic year. This proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition is based on the current policy for the FFEL programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that sets minimum certification periods for loans. This policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was designed partly to prevent institutions from circumventing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the refund provisions currently found in &sect;668.22. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invites comments on whether other safeguards are needed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevent institutions from circumventing the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary notes that there may be institutions that use different periods for categories of charges. For example,
an institution may charge by the academic year for tuition, but by the academic term for books and supplies. The Secretary,
therefore, proposes that, for purposes of determining refunds under this section, ``the period of enrollment for
which the student has been charged'' is the longest period for which the student is charged. The institution must include
any charges assessed the student for that period of enrollment or any portion of that period of enrollment in calculating
the refund. In the example above, since the institution charged for the entire academic year for tuition, the institution
would have to determine the actual total charge for books and supplies for the academic year in order to determine the
refund to the student. If, in the example above, the institution did not charge for books and supplies after the first
academic term, the institution would only include the charges for the first academic term when calculating the refund
for the academic year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also proposes to use the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged, instead of the payment
period concept currently used, to determine the return of refunds and repayments to the Title IV, HEA programs. In
doing away with the concept of a payment period for purposes of the calculation of refunds, the Secretary also proposes
to do away with the practice of attributing Title IV, HEA program assistance when determining the return of refunds
and repayments to the Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary believes that the premise for the calculation of a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund, (i.e., the refund is to be determined for the percentage of a period of enrollment for which the student has
been charged that remains) dictates that the institution should look at the amount of Title IV, HEA program assistance
received for that same percentage of the period. The Secretary believes that adopting the use of the period of enrollment
for which the student has been charged to determine the return of all refunds and repayments to the Title IV, HEA programs
greatly simplifies these determinations.

The Secretary proposes to restructure and revise the current provisions relating to overpayments and the repayments
to Title IV, HEA programs of institutional refunds and overpayments. This preamble addresses those areas of these
current provisions that have been significantly revised. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No changes are proposed to the procedures by which an institution determines if a student has received an overpayment
for noninstitutional costs.

The Secretary proposes to remove the fraction that is currently used to determine the portion of the refund that an
institution must return to the Title IV, HEA programs. Section 485 of the HEA now specifies the order of return of refunds
to the Title IV, HEA programs. Further, the Technical Amendments of 1993 changed section 485 of the HEA to specify that
an institution is to return a refund to other sources of student assistance only after the refund has been returned
to the Title IV, HEA programs (see the discussion below concerning allocations.) The Secretary proposes to make a
conforming change by removing the fraction currently used to determine the portion of an overpayment that an institution
must return to the Title IV, HEA programs.

The June 8, 1993, final regulations modified the definition of institutional refund to require an institution to
exclude any unpaid charges owed to the institution by a student in determining the amount the institution may retain
for institutional charges. These proposed regulations would retain this provision. However, because the HEA now
specifies that an institution is permitted to subtract any unpaid charges owed by a student from the calculated refund
to the student in calculating a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refund, the requirements of the June 8, 1993, final regulations regarding the treatment of unpaid charges have been
superseded and are inapplicable only in this case. That is, the institution is not required to exclude any unpaid balance
owed to the institution by the student when the institution determines the amount the institution may retain for institutional
charges when calculating a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refund under section 484B of the HEA. The Secretary notes that the requirements of &sect;668.22 of the June 8, 1993,
final regulations continue to be in effect for all other refunds calculated in accordance with section 484B of the
HEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes that if the amount of a refund owed to a student is $25 or less, the institution would not be required
to pay the refund. The Secretary believes that the administrative cost to institutions to make refunds of such a small
amount may be greater than the refunds themselves. This consideration is of particular concern at institutions that
have low tuition charges resulting in small refunds that are administratively burdensome and costly to the institution.

Allocation of Refunds and Overpayments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 485 of the HEA specifies the order of return of refunds to the various sources of aid and to the student. A refund
owed to a student who received funds under any Title IV, HEA program is to be returned to the Title IV, HEA programs from
which the student received aid in the following order until the amounts received by the student from those programs
are eliminated. (1) The FFEL programs; (2) The FDSL Program; (3) The Federal Perkins Loan Program; (4) The Federal
Pell Grant Program; (5) The FSEOG Program; (6) All other sources of aid; (7) The student. The Secretary proposes to
make clear the longstanding policy that, after balances resulting from the FSEOG Program are eliminated, balances
on aid received from all other Title IV, HEA programs must be eliminated before the State and private sources of aid
are refunded. For consistency and to reduce administrative burden, the Secretary proposes to apply this order of
return to repayment of overpayments also except that, in accordance with current regulations, no amount of a repayment
may be allocated to the Federal Stafford Loan, Federal PLUS, and Federal SLS programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also would make clear that refunds would be returned to eliminate outstanding balances of Title IV,
HEA program aid received for the period of enrollment for which the refunds are made. The Secretary does not believe
that refunds should be used to eliminate, for example, outstanding balances on loans made for prior years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 485 of the HEA does not specify an order of return for refunds under the FFEL programs. The Secretary proposes
a specified order of return for FFEL program funds. Refunds would be returned to eliminate outstanding balances on:
(1) Federal SLS loans; (2) unsubsidized Federal Stafford loans; (3) subsidized Federal Stafford loans; and (4) Federal
PLUS loans, in that order. The Secretary believes that this order is beneficial to the student and that by mandating
the order of return of FFEL program funds, the interest of the student would be protected. The Secretary wishes to clarify
that when returning any FFEL program funds, an institution may return the gross amount of a loan (including the guaranty
and origination fee) if the institution so chooses, to serve as a deterrent to default on the small remaining amount.
This ``extra'' amount would be used to reduce the next source of aid on the list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary wishes to clarify that this order must be used if Title IV, HEA program funds are received, whether they
are applied toward institutional charges or disbursed to the student for living expenses. Even if all Title IV, HEA
program funds are disbursed to the student for living expenses, if a refund is owed when the student withdraws from
the institution, the refund must first be returned to the Title IV, HEA programs from which the student received aid
in the order specified.

The Secretary proposes to apply to all the Title IV, HEA programs the definition (with some revisions) of ``withdrawal
date'' that currently applies to the FFEL programs. Only significant revisions are discussed. The definition of
``drop out date'' found in the current &sect;668.22 would be incorporated into this definition. Currently, the FFEL
program regulations define the withdrawal date for a student who has not returned to an institution after the expiration
of an approved leave of absence as the first day of the leave of absence. The Secretary proposes to use, instead, the
last recorded date of class attendance by a student, as documented by the institution. The negotiators reached consensus
that it is fair to define the withdrawal date for a student who failed to return from an approved leave of absence in the
same way as the withdrawal date is defined for a student who drops out, because the student's period of attendance was
only extended on the understanding that he or she would be returning by a specified date. Further, the Secretary proposes
to clarify that a student who returns to an institution after the expiration of a leave of absence during an award year
or, for the FFEL programs, during a period of enrollment in which the student was granted the leave of absence, the student
may not receive additional Title IV, HEA program assistance for coursework that he or she has not completed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the FFEL program regulations define the withdrawal date for a student who is enrolled in an educational
program that consists predominantly of correspondence courses as 60 days after the due date of a required lesson that
the student failed to submit in accordance with the established schedule for lessons. The Secretary believes it is
more reasonable to define the withdrawal date in this case as the date of the last submission of a lesson by the student
if the student failed to submit the subsequent lesson in accordance with the established schedule for lessons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to add the requirement that a leave of absence may not exceed the length of time between the beginning
of the leave of absence and the institution's next period of enrollment, if the institution's next period of enrollment
after the start of the leave of absence begins more than thirty days after the beginning of the leave of absence due to
a period of nonenrollment (i.e., summer break) that prevents a student from enrolling in any coursework. The Secretary
proposes to add this provision to address graduate programs that do not have summer school sessions, thereby preventing
students from re-enrolling during this time. As the determination of a student's withdrawal date is necessary to
determine when a refund must be paid to a student, the Secretary believes it would be unfair to penalize an institution
for failure to pay timely refunds to a student who is deemed to have ``withdrawn'' only because he or she cannot return
to the institution from a leave of absence because classes are not in session. This provision would not additionally
limit the length of a student's leave of absence which could be up to sixty days or six months under the specified conditions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary notes that this proposed definition of a leave of absence is a departure from current Federal Pell Grant
Program policy. Currently, for purposes of the Federal Pell Grant Program, a student who is granted a leave of absence
is considered to be no longer enrolled in the institution. The Secretary specifically request comments on the effects
of this proposed change on institutional procedures in relation to the Federal Pell Grant Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to require an institution to pay a refund to a student within a specified period of time. The
Secretary believes that 30 days is a sufficient period of time for an institution to complete the administrative procedures
necessary for payment of a refund to a student. This requirement would be in addition to other requirements, which
would not change, for timely payment of refunds to a lender under the FFEL programs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section includes provisions dealing with third-party servicers that were proposed in the NPRM published on
February 17, 1994 (in part II). The Secretary will not repeat the discussion of those provisions here. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to extend the requirements of this section to foreign institutions as that term would be defined
in 34 CFR 600.52 of the regulations governing institutional eligibility under the HEA, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 10, 1994 (59 FR 6446). Participating institutions, like institutions in the United States, would accordingly
be required to have compliance audits performed, be subject to program reviews and other investigations, and maintain
records under the provisions of this section. The Secretary believes these steps provide the best means for evaluating
a foreign institution's compliance with the requirements for participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 487(c) of the HEA requires the Secretary to prescribe regulations as may be necessary to provide for a compliance
audit of an institution with regard to any funds received under the Title IV, HEA programs on at least an annual basis.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary notes that, currently, the Department of Education could not properly and effectively review the volume
of audits that the Department would receive if every institution submitted an audit report on at least an annual basis.
The Secretary is concerned that an effort that extensive could diminish the resources needed to concentrate on timely
review of those institutions that pose the greatest financial risk to the government and the taxpayer. The Secretary
proposes to exempt from some or all of the audit requirements of this section certain categories of institutions that
pose no serious threat to the integrity of the Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary proposes that an institution,
other than an institution that is participating in the Title IV, HEA programs for the first time, have the audit performed
at least once every two years if it meets the following conditions: (1) The institution received less than $100,000
in total annual funding under the Title IV, HEA programs for the period covered by the audit; or (2) the institution
had no deficiencies identified in the audit report most recently submitted to the Department if that audit report
was submitted in a timely fashion. The Secretary bases this amount on the amount that would exempt entities from the
audit requirements of the Single Audit Act. The Secretary also believes that an institution that had no deficiencies
identified in its most recently submitted audit report will continue to perform at a level that does not warrant as
great a degree of oversight. In addition, an institution would not be required to have a compliance audit for any year
in which the institution receives less than $25,000 in total annual funding under the Title IV, HEA programs. This
proposal would establish in regulations the Secretary's current practice. Institutions that do not handle large
amounts of Title IV, HEA program funds do not put a large amount of Title IV, HEA program funds at risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary notes that in spite of these exemptions the Secretary would reserve the right to require an institution
to have a compliance audit performed annually from any institution as the Secretary deems necessary. Further, the
Secretary proposes to require an institution participating in the Title IV, HEA programs for the first time to have
an audit performed at least once a year for the first five years of its participation. The Secretary believes it is important
to monitor an institution more closely if the institution has not previously participated in the programs and has
not had an opportunity to establish a record of consistent compliance with Title IV, HEA program requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 487(c) of the HEA requires that an audit performed in accordance with this section must cover the period since
the most recent audit. The Secretary proposes to specify, for clarification, that an institution's first audit for
a Title IV, HEA program must cover the institution's activities from the beginning of the institution's participation
in that program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rather than continuing to specify deadlines in regulations for the submission of audit reports, the Secretary proposes
to require an institution to submit its audit to the Department's Inspector General by the deadlines established
in the audit guides developed by the Department's Office of Inspector General. Beyond establishing deadlines for
the submission of audit reports, these guides will provide for certain extensions beyond establishing deadlines
for valid reasons. These guides are developed in consultation with the academic community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 487(c) of the HEA requires the Secretary to make the results of compliance audits available to cognizant guaranty
agencies and eligible lenders under the FFEL programs, State agencies, and designated SPREs. The Secretary proposes
to add nationally recognized accrediting agencies to this list, because of the role of accrediting agencies in assisting
the Secretary with regard to institutional participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary proposes to
require institutions to provide copies of their audit reports to these entities upon request.

The Secretary proposes to add a requirement that specifies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that an institution must establish and maintain, on a current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis, financial and other institutional records necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine the institutional eligibility, financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility, and administrative capability of the institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes it is essential for the Department to have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
access to this information when evaluating an institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with the requirements of the provisions governing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutional eligibility, financial responsibility, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative capability of the institution. Further, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution needs to maintain this information because, under its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program participation agreement, the institution must agree to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make the information available to appropriate authorities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified there (see the discussion on proposed &sect;668.14). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to require that all records required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the applicable Title IV, HEA program regulations be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retained by the institution for at least five years from the time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the record is established unless specific program regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require that a record be kept for a period of time longer than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
five years. Five years is the standard period of time that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions are required to keep most records under the Title 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IV, HEA programs. The Secretary believes that this is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable period of time to require institutions to maintain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most records so that the Department is able to evaluate the past 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Secretary proposes to clarify the purpose of the section

an institution's participation ends under a variety of

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to specify that an institution's

Secretary has determined that the institution's cohort default 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate, for each of the three most recent fiscal years for which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary has determined the institution's rate, is equal to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or greater than the threshold rates listed under proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;668.17(c)(2). This change simply makes the provisions of

proposed &sect;668.26 consistent with those of proposed &sect;668.17. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Secretary proposes to specify that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's participation ends on the date that the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receives a notice from the appropriate SPRE that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's participation should be withdrawn. This change is

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to add to the requirements for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution when the institution's participation in a Title IV, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA program ends, that the institution shall, if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's participation in the NEISP or SSIG Program ended,

inform immediately the State in which the institution is located

of that fact. Further, notwithstanding the requirements for the

treatment of Title IV, HEA program funds found in this section, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution must follow the instructions of that State

concerning the end of that participation. The Secretary also

the case of an institution that fails to qualify for provisional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification because the institution does not meet the factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of financial responsibility. In addition, the procedures under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section would not apply in the case of an institution where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution's period of provisional certification has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expired, nor would they apply in the case of an institution that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has its provisional certification revoked. These changes are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to make the scope of Subpart G of these regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with provisions in section 498(g) and (h) of the HEA.

Section 487(c)(7) of the HEA provides that, if, in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
course of any audit conducted after December 31, 1988 pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the audit requirements of section 487(c) of the HEA and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department regulations implementing those requirements, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department discovers or is informed of any Title IV, HEA program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance (specifically, Federal Pell Grant Program funds) that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an institution has provided to its students in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program requirements, but the institution has not previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received credit or reimbursement for these disbursements, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution may offset the amount of those disbursements against 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liabilities owed under the audit, or if no liabilities arise from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the audit, may receive reimbursement from the Department for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those amounts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HEA requires that the development of NPRMs for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation of changes made by the Amendments to Parts B 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Federal Family Education Loan programs), G (general provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relating to the student assistance programs) or H (Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Integrity Triad) of Title IV of the HEA, is subject to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negotiated rulemaking process. Although this provision relates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly to the Federal Pell Grant Program, it is contained in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part G of the HEA. Therefore, it has been included in this NPRM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instead of the Federal Pell Grant Program NPRM, which was not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to the negotiated rulemaking process.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes that, notwithstanding the regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for submission of reports, if an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution has provided Federal Pell Grants in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Federal Pell Grant Program regulations, but has not received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit or payment for those grants, the institution may receive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment or a reduction in accountability for those grants. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution would have to demonstrate that it qualifies for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit or payment by means of a finding contained in an audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report as initially submitted to the Department that was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted after December 31, 1988. The audit would have to have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been timely submitted in accordance with 34 CFR 668.23(c), with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to grants made during the period of that audit. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary specifies that, in determining whether the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualifies for a payment or reduction in accountability, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary would take into account any liabilities of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution arising from that audit or any other source. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary collects those liabilities by offset in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
34 CFR part 30. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential costs associated with the proposed regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are those resulting from statutory requirements and those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this program effectively and efficiently. Burdens specifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with information collection requirements, if any, are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified and explained elsewhere in this preamble under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heading 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantitative and qualitative_of these proposed regulations, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary has determined that the benefits of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations justify the costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary has also determined that this regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governments in the exercise of their governmental function. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist the Department in complying with the specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of Executive Order 12866, the Secretary invites 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any potential costs or increase potential benefits resulting from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these proposed regulations without impeding the effective and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficient administration of the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of small entities. The small entities affected by these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations are small institutions of postsecondary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education. These regulations make modifications that reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential abuse in the Title IV, HEA programs. These changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not impose excessive regulatory burdens or require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unnecessary Federal supervision. The regulations would impose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimal requirements to ensure the proper expenditure of program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
668.17, 668.22, 668.23, 668.26, 690.83 and Appendix A contain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information collection requirements. As required by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, the Department of Education will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submit a copy of these sections to the Office of Management and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Budget (OMB) for its review. (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This NPRM contains provisions that would affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
postsecondary institutions who wish to participate in the Title 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IV student financial assistance programs. Annual public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting and recordkeeping burden contained in the collection of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information proposed in these regulations is estimated to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10,488 hours, including the time for searching existing data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, completing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and reviewing the collection of information, and submitting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the information collection requirements should direct them to the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provisional certification. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The Secretary may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisionally certify an institution if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The institution seeks initial participation in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA program; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The Secretary is determining for the first time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether the institution meets the factors of financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability under &sect;668.16;

the factors of financial responsibility under &sect;668.15 or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards of administrative capability under &sect;668.16; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Whose participation has been limited or suspended under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart G of this part, or voluntarily enters into provisional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The institution seeks a renewal of participation in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(vi) The institution is a participating institution that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was accredited or preaccredited by a nationally recognized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accrediting agency on the day before the Secretary withdrew the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's recognition of that agency according to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions contained in 34 CFR part 603. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the Secretary provisionally certifies an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution, the Secretary also specifies the period for which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution may participate in a Title IV, HEA program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(3) and (4) of this section, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a provisionally certified institution's period of participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expires_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Not later than 12 months from the date on which the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided for in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary provisionally certifies an institution, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may specify a shorter period of participation for that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) For the purposes of this section, ``provisional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

institution to meet in order for the institution to participate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under provisional certification.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of

institution that_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Fails to meet the general standards of financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility in &sect;668.15(b), unless the institution_

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it has sufficient financial and administrative resources to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in the Title IV, HEA programs under a funding

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Demonstrates that it has met all of its financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

not limited to) the payment of required refunds and repayments to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary for liabilities and debts incurred in programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administered by the Secretary; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Is not financially responsible under &sect;668.15(c)(2), or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been determined not to be financially responsible under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;668.15 at any time during the five-year period preceding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's decision to certify the institution provisionally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unless_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The institution, or one or more persons or entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the Secretary determines under the provisions of &sect;668.15 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exercise substantial control over the institution, or both, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submit to the Secretary financial guarantees in an amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined by the Secretary to be sufficient to satisfy the

institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) One or more persons or entities that the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determines under the provisions of &sect;668.15 exercise substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control over the institution agree to be jointly or severally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liable for any liabilities arising from the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation in the Title IV, HEA programs and civil and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Revocation of provisional certification. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) If, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before the expiration of a provisionally certified institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of participation in a Title IV, HEA program, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determines that the institution is unable to meet its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities under its program participation agreement, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary may revoke the institution's provisional certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for participation in that program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2)(i) If the Secretary revokes the provisional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification of an institution under paragraph (e)(1) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, the Secretary sends the institution a notice by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registered mail, return receipt requested. The Secretary also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may transmit the notice by other, more expeditious means, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practical. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The revocation takes effect on the date that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary mails the notice to the institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The notice states the basis for the revocation, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consequences of the revocation to the institution, and that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution may request the Secretary to reconsider the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revocation. The consequences of a revocation are described in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;668.26. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3)(i) An institution may request reconsideration of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revocation under this section by submitting to the Secretary, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within 20 days of the institution's receipt of the Secretary's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice, written evidence that the revocation is unwarranted. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution must file the request with the Secretary by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hand-delivery, mail, or facsimile transmission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The filing date of the request is the date on which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the request is_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Hand-delivered; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Mailed; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Sent by facsimile transmission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Documents filed by facsimile transmission must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transmitted to the Secretary in accordance with instructions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided by the Secretary in the notice of revocation. An 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution filing by facsimile transmission is responsible for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confirming that a complete and legible copy of the document was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The Secretary discourages the use of facsimile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transmission for documents longer than five pages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4)(i) The Secretary promptly considers an institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request for reconsideration of a revocation and notifies the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution, by registered mail, return receipt requested, of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's final decision. The Secretary also may transmit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice by other, more expeditious means, if practical. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the Secretary determines that the revocation is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warranted, the Secretary's notice informs the institution that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution may apply for reinstatement of participation only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after the later of the expiration of_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Eighteen months after the effective date of the revocation; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) A debarment or suspension of the institution under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12549 or the Federal Acquisition Regulations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If the Secretary determines that the revocation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution's provisional certification is unwarranted, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's notice informs the institution that the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisional certification is reinstated, effective on the date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the Secretary's original revocation notice was mailed, for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified period of time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5)(i) The mailing date of a notice of revocation or a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request for reconsideration of a revocation is the date evidenced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the original receipt of mailing from the U.S. Postal Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The date on which a request for reconsideration of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revocation is submitted is_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) If the request was sent by a delivery service other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than the U.S. Postal Service, the date evidenced on the original 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receipt by that service; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) If the request was sent by facsimile transmission, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date that the document is recorded as received by facsimile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment that receives the transmission.

with the Secretary, on a form approved by the Secretary. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program participation agreement conditions the initial and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continued participation of an eligible institution in any Title 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IV, HEA program upon compliance with the provisions of this part, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To begin and to continue to participate in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any Title IV, HEA program, an institution must demonstrate to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary that the institution is financially responsible under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the requirements established in this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General standards of financial responsibility. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general, the Secretary considers an institution to be financially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible only if it_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Is able to provide the services described in its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
official publications and statements; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Is able to provide the administrative resources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to comply with the requirements of this subpart; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Is able to meet all of its financial obligations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including but not limited to_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Refunds that it is required to make; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Repayments to the Secretary for liabilities and debts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incurred in programs administered by the Secretary; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Is current on any debt service payments; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Maintains, at all times, a minimum cash reserve equal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to at least 10 percent of the institution's total deferred 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tuition income at the end of the institution's most recent fiscal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year for repayment of refunds. The cash reserve must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintained in a cash reserve account, consisting of cash or cash 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalents as defined in accordance with generally accepted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accounting principles; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Has not had, as part of the audit report for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's most recently completed fiscal year_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A statement by the accountant acknowledging substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
doubt about the institution's ability to continue operation as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
going concern; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A finding of unauthorized use of donor restricted net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assets to meet current operating expenses; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A disclaimed or adverse opinion by the accountant; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) For a for-profit institution_(i) Demonstrates at the end of its latest fiscal year, a ratio of current assets to
current liabilities of at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.25:1. For purposes of this section, the calculation of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ratio must exclude uncollateralized loans receivable from owners 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and related parties. Should application of paragraph (b)(5) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section cause a portion of the institution's cash reserves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be classified as a restricted asset, those cash reserves may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be included in current assets in calculating the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current ratio; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Has not had operating losses over both of its two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
latest fiscal years that causes an operating loss exceeding 10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of the institution's previous year's tangible net worth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for its latest fiscal year. For purposes of this subsection, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating loss will be calculated by subtracting from total net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income: extraordinary gains or losses; income or losses from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discontinued operations; prior period adjustments; and, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle, estimate or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting entity. The calculation of tangible net worth must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclude all assets defined as intangible in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally accepted accounting principles; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Had, for its latest fiscal year, a positive tangible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
net worth. For purposes of this section, a positive tangible net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
worth occurs if the institution's tangible assets exceed its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liabilities. The calculation of tangible net worth must exclude 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all assets defined as intangible in accordance with generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accepted accounting principles. In applying this standard, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary may consider the effect of extraordinary gains or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
losses resulting from unusual and infrequent events, and may take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into consideration the cumulative effect of changes in accounting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principle, estimate or reporting entity to the extent that such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change results in a more accurate representation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's financial position in accordance with generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accepted accounting principles; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) For a nonprofit institution_(i) Prepares a classified statement of financial position in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles or provides the required information as footnotes to the audit; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Demonstrates at the end of its latest fiscal year, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ratio of current assets to current liabilities of at least 1:1; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Has not had, at the end of its latest fiscal year, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decrease in total net assets of such significance that, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continued, would result in a ratio of current assets to current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liabilities of less than 1:1. The Secretary may consider the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect of extraordinary gains or losses resulting from unusual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and infrequent events, and may take into consideration the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, estimate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or reporting entity to the extent that such a change results in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more accurate representation of the institution's financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
position in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles. For purposes of this analysis, the Secretary may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclude unrealized gains and losses on investments that have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reported as changes in unrestricted net assets; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) For a public institution, has its liabilities backed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the full faith and credit of a State, or by an equivalent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governmental entity.

 (1) An institution is not required to meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Is located in, and is legally authorized to operate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within, a State that has a tuition recovery fund that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable to the Secretary and ensures that the institution is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
able to pay all required refunds; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Contributes to that tuition recovery fund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

the institution, including the ability to meet all of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial obligations, including refunds of institutional charges

 (1) The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary determines whether an institution is financially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible under this section by evaluating documents submitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the institution and information obtained from other sources, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including outside sources of credit information. To enable the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary to make this determination, the institution shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submit to the Secretary for its two latest complete fiscal years, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a set of financial statements of the institution, prepared in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate to that institution as established by the American 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Institute of Certified Public Accountants, audited by an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
independent certified public accountant in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally accepted auditing standards, and accordingly including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such tests of the institution's accounting records and such other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
auditing procedures that the independent auditor considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary in the circumstances. The Secretary may also require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution to submit or otherwise make available the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accountant's work papers. If an institution submits audited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consolidated financial statements of its parent corporation for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary to use in determining the institution's level of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial responsibility, the consolidated financial statements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be supplemented with consolidating schedules showing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consolidation of each of the parent corporation's subsidiaries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(each separate institution participating in the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs must be shown separately), intercompany eliminating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entries, and derived consolidated totals. The Secretary may also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require the institution to submit additional substantive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An institution shall submit the documents required in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (e)(1) of this section annually within four months 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after the end of the institution's fiscal year, unless the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary requests a more frequent submission. Upon a showing of

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To begin and to continue to participate in any Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program, an institution shall demonstrate to the Secretary that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution is capable of adequately administering that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program under each of the standards established in this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary considers an institution to have that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative capability if the institution_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Administers the Title IV, HEA programs in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with any statutory provisions of or applicable to Title IV of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA, any regulatory provisions prescribed under that statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority, or any applicable special arrangement, agreement or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limitation; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(1) Designates a capable individual to be responsible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for administering all the Title IV, HEA programs in which it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participates and for coordinating those programs with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's other Federal and non-Federal programs of student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial assistance. The Secretary considers an individual to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be ``capable'' under this paragraph if the individual is certified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the State in which the institution is located, if the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires certification of financial aid administrators. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary may consider other factors in determining whether an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual is capable, including, but not limited to, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual's successful completion of Title IV, HEA program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training provided or approved by the Secretary; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Uses an adequate number of qualified persons to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administer the Title IV, HEA programs in which the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participates. The Secretary considers the following factors to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine whether an institution uses an adequate number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualified persons_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The number and types of programs in which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution participates; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The number of applications evaluated; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The number of students who receive any student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial assistance at the institution and the amount of funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administered; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The financial aid delivery system used by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The degree of office automation used by the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the administration of the Title IV, HEA programs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Communicates to the individual designated to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible for administering Title IV, HEA programs, all the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information received by any institutional office that bears on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student's eligibility for Title IV, HEA program assistance; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Has written procedures for or written information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicating_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The nature and frequency of communication of pertinent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information among all the offices that have an impact on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administration of the Title IV, HEA programs. Examples of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information may include information on a student's admissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
status, enrollment status, attendance (if applicable), prior or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concurrent attendance at another postsecondary institution, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(ii) The responsibilities of the various offices with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to the approval, disbursement, and delivery of Title IV, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports to the Secretary; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c)(1) Administers Title IV, HEA programs with adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
checks and balances in its system of internal controls; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Divides the functions of authorizing payments and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disbursing or delivering funds so that no office has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility for both functions with respect to any particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student aided under the programs. For example, the functions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorizing payments and disbursing or delivering funds must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
divided so that for any particular student aided under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs, the two functions are carried out by at least two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organizationally independent individuals who are not members of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the same family, as defined in &sect;668.15, or who do not together 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards for measuring whether an otherwise eligible student is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintaining satisfactory progress in his or her educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. The Secretary considers an institution's standards to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be reasonable if the standards_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Conform with the standards of satisfactory progress of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the nationally recognized accrediting agency that accredits or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preaccredits the institution, if the institution is accredited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or preaccredited, and if the agency has those standards; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For a student enrolled in an eligible program who is to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receive assistance under a Title IV, HEA program, are the same as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or stricter than the institution's standards for a student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrolled in the same educational program who is not receiving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance under a Title IV, HEA program; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Include the following elements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Grades, work projects completed, or comparable factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are measurable against a norm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A maximum time frame in which a student must complete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
his or her educational program. The time frame must be_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Based on the student's enrollment status; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) For an undergraduate program, no longer than 150 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of the published length of the educational program; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Divided into increments, not to exceed the lesser of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one academic year or one-half the published length of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
educational program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A schedule established by the institution designating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the minimum percentage or amount of work that a student must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
successfully complete at the end of each increment to complete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
his or her educational program within the maximum time frame. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) A determination at the end of each increment by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution whether the student has successfully completed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate percentage or amount of work according to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established schedule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Consistent application of standards to all students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within categories of students, e.g., full-time, part-time, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undergraduate, and graduate students, and educational programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established by the institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Specific policies defining the effect of course 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incompletes, withdrawals, repetitions, and noncredit remedial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
courses on satisfactory progress. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Specific procedures under which a student may appeal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a determination that the student is not making satisfactory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
progress. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) Specific procedures for reinstatement of aid; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Meet or exceed the requirements of &sect;668.7(c); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Develops and applies an adequate system to identify and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resolve discrepancies in the information that the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receives from different sources with respect to a student's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application for financial aid under Title IV, HEA programs. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining whether the institution's system is adequate, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary considers whether the institution obtains and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviews_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) All student aid applications, need analysis documents, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statements of Educational Purpose, Statements of Registration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Status, and eligibility notification documents presented by or on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
behalf of each applicant; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Any documents, including any copies of State and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal income tax returns, that are normally collected by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to verify information received from the student or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other sources; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Any other information normally available to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution regarding a student's citizenship, previous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
educational experience, or other factors relating to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student's eligibility for funds under the Title IV, HEA programs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Refers to the Office of Inspector General of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department of Education for investigation_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) After conducting the review of an application provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for under paragraph (f) of this section, any information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicating that an applicant for Title IV, HEA program assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may have engaged in fraud or other criminal misconduct in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
connection with his or her application. The type of information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that an institution must refer is that which is relevant to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility of the applicant for Title IV, HEA program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance, or the amount of the assistance. Examples of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
type of information are_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) False claims of independent student status; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(2) Any information indicating that any employee, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party servicer, or other agent of the institution that acts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a capacity that involves the administration of the Title IV, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA programs, or the receipt of funds under those programs, may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have engaged in fraud, misrepresentation, conversion or breach of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiduciary responsibility, or other illegal conduct involving the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV, HEA programs. The type of information that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution must refer is that which is relevant to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility and funding of the institution and its students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through the Title IV, HEA programs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Provides adequate financial aid counseling to eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students who apply for Title IV, HEA program assistance. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining whether an institution provides adequate counseling, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary considers whether its counseling includes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information regarding_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The source and amount of each type of aid offered; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The method by which aid is determined and disbursed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delivered, or applied to a student's account; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The rights and responsibilities of the student with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to enrollment at the institution and receipt of financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aid. This information includes the institution's refund policy, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its standards of satisfactory progress, and other conditions that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may alter the student's aid package;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Has and implements a plan, designed by the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the student population served by the institution, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrates that for an institution that enrolls a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of students with special support service needs (including, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but not limited to, child care and transportation), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution has provided these students with information about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
how to access to appropriate support services that will foster 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the students' opportunity to complete the educational program; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) Has procedures for receiving, investigating, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resolving student complaints; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) If the stated objectives of an educational program of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution are to prepare a student for gainful employment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a recognized occupation_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Demonstrates a reasonable relationship between the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
length of the program and entry level requirements for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognized occupation for which the program prepares the student. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary considers the relationship to be reasonable if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of clock hours provided in the program does not exceed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more than 50 percent the minimum number of clock hours required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for training in the recognized occupation for which the program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepares the student, as established by the State in which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program is offered, if the State has established such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Establishes the need for the training for the student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The relationship of mandatory and elective course 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
components of occupational, professional, and vocational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
educational programs to specific licensure standards of the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in which the institution is located in specific occupations; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(m) Has advertising, promotion, and student recruitment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practices that accurately reflect the content and objectives of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the educational programs offered by the institution; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(n) Has provided all program and fiscal reports and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial statements required for compliance with the provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Default rates.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the Federal Stafford loan and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal SLS cohort default rate for an institution exceeds 20 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent for any fiscal year, the Secretary notifies the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution of that rate and may, after consultation as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary deems appropriate with cognizant guaranty agencies take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one or more of the following actions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Initiate a proceeding under Subpart G of this part to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit, suspend, or terminate the participation of the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Title IV, HEA programs, if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The institution's Federal Stafford loan and Federal SLS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cohort default rate exceeds 40 percent for any fiscal year after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1989 and has not been reduced by an increment of at least 5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent from its rate for the previous fiscal year (e.g., a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
50-percent rate was not reduced to 45 percent or below); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The institution's Federal Stafford loan and Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SLS cohort default rate exceeds_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) 60 percent for fiscal year 1989; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) 55 percent for fiscal year 1990; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) 50 percent for fiscal year 1991; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) 40 percent for any fiscal year after fiscal year 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) To help the Secretary make a preliminary determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as to the appropriate action to be taken by the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding the institution, require the institution to submit to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary and one or more guaranty agencies, as defined in 34 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFR 682, any information relating to that determination, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonably required by the Secretary, within a time frame 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Default management plan.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the Federal Stafford loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Federal SLS cohort default rate for an institution_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Is greater than 20 percent but less than or equal to 40 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent, the institution must submit a default management plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that implements the measures described in appendix D of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part. An institution that wishes to submit a default management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan that deviates from the measures described in appendix D of this part must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submit a justification for the deviation that includes a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rationale explaining why the measures from which the plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deviates are not appropriate for the institution's specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situation. The institution must implement the default management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan upon notification from the Secretary that the plan has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Exceeds 40 percent for any fiscal year, the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must implement all of the default management reduction measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in appendix D of this part no later than 60 days after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution receives the Secretary's notification of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's cohort default rate. An institution is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to submit any written plans to the Secretary or a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guaranty agency unless the Secretary or guaranty agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically requests the institution to do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
End of participation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Except as provided in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (c)(6) of this section, an institution's participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the FFEL programs ends if the Secretary determines that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's cohort default rate, for each of the three most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recent fiscal years for which the Secretary has determined the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's rate, is equal to or greater than the applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threshold rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For purposes of the determinations made under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the threshold rates are_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 35 percent for each of fiscal years 1991 and 1992; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 30 percent for fiscal year 1993; and

Secretary that its cohort default rate exceeds the thresholds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and continuing_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) For the remainder of the fiscal year in which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary determines that the institution's participation has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ended under paragraph (c)(1) of this section; and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) An institution whose participation in the FFEL programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ends under paragraph (c)(1) of this section may not participate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the FFEL programs until the institution_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Receives notification from the Secretary that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice ending the institution's participation is withdrawn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to paragraph (d)(6) of this section; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Following the period described in paragraph (c)(3) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section, satisfies the Secretary that the institution meets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all requirements for participation in the FFEL programs and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
executes a new agreement with the Secretary for participation in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the FFEL programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) If the Secretary withdraws the notification of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's loss of participation pursuant to paragraph (d)(6) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section, the participation of the institution is restored 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective as of the date that the institution received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification from the Secretary of the loss of participation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Until July 1, 1994, the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section do not apply to a historically black college or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Assistance Act of 1978 (25 U.S.C. 1801(a)(4)), or a Navajo community college under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Navajo Community College Act (25 U.S.C. 640a&hyph;640c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7)(i) If the Secretary's designated department official 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receives written notice from an institution whose participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ends under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, within seven 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar days from the date on which the institution receives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification from the Secretary that its cohort default rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeds the thresholds specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, that the institution intends to appeal the end of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation under paragraph (d) of this section, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution may, notwithstanding &sect;668.26(d) continue to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in the FFEL programs until no later than the 30th 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar day following the date on which the institution receives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification from the Secretary that its cohort default rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

which the institution receives notification from the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that its cohort default rate exceeds the thresholds specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the institution may, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notwithstanding &sect;668.26(d), continue to participate in the FFEL 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs after that date, until the Secretary issues a decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the institution's appeal, if the institution, by the 30th 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar day following the date on which the institution receives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification from the Secretary that its cohort default rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeds the thresholds specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, files an appeal that is complete in all respects in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeal of an institution relying on paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section is not considered incomplete by virtue of a guaranty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's not having yet complied with_or having failed to comply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with_34 CFR 682.401(b)(14), which requires the agency to respond 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to an institution's request for verification of data within 15 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
working days, if the institution submitted that request within 10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
working days from the date on which the institution received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification from the Secretary that its cohort default rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeds the thresholds specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, and the institution simultaneously submitted a copy of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that request to the Secretary's designated Department official. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the institution receives the guaranty agency's response, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete its appeal, the institution must submit the verified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data to the Secretary's designated Department official within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
five working days in order to continue participating in the FFEL 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs until the Secretary issues a decision on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's appeal.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section by submitting an appeal in writing to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's designated Department official that is postmarked no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
later than 30 days after it receives notification of its loss of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation. The institution may appeal on the grounds that_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i)(A) The calculation of the institution's cohort default 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate for any of the three fiscal years relevant to the end of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation is not accurate; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) A recalculation with corrected data verified by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cognizant guaranty agency or agencies would produce a cohort 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
default rate for any of those fiscal years that is below the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
originally scheduled, at the time of enrollment, to complete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their programs within the relevant twenty-four month period, with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the number of these students who received a degree, certificate, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or other recognized educational credential from the institution; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transferred from the institution to a higher level educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program at another institution for which the prior program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided substantial preparation; or, at the end of the twenty-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
four month period, remained enrolled and were making satisfactory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
academic progress toward completion of their educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. The calculation does not include students who did not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete their programs because they left the institution to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
serve in the armed forces; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) The institution had a placement rate of two-thirds or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more with respect to its former students who received a degree, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certificate, or other recognized educational credential from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution in any twenty-four month period ending not more than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
six months prior to the date the institution submits its appeal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rate is calculated by determining the percentage of all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those students who, based on evidence submitted by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution, are on that date employed, or had been employed for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at least 13 weeks following receipt of the credential from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution, in the occupation for which the institution provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training, or are enrolled or had been enrolled for at least 13 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weeks following receipt of the credential from the institution, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a higher level educational program at another institution for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the prior educational program provided substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(A) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, a student is originally scheduled, at the time of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollment, to complete the educational program on the date when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the student will have been enrolled in the program for the amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of time normally required to complete the program. The ``amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of time normally required to complete the program'' is the period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of time specified in the institution's enrollment contract, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
catalog, or other materials, for completion of the program by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full-time student, or the period of time between the date of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollment and the anticipated graduation date appearing on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student's loan application, if any, whichever is less. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) An appeal submitted under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section is considered to be filed in a timely manner if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution submits a letter of appeal by the 30-day deadline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notifying the Secretary's designated department official that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is appealing on this basis, including with that letter a copy of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution's request to each cognizant guaranty agency for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verification of the cohort default rate data, and submits the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verified data to the Secretary's designated Department official 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within five working days of its receipt from the guaranty agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's appeal is not considered complete until the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution submits the verified data to the Secretary's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated Department official. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The Secretary issues a decision on the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeal within 45 days after the institution submits a complete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeal that addresses the applicable criteria in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's designated Department official. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The Secretary's decision is based on the consideration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of written material submitted by the institution. No oral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing is provided.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(B) In determining the number of students who default 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before the end of that following fiscal year, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes only loans for which the Secretary or a guaranty agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has paid claims for insurance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) (A) In the case of a student who has attended and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrowed at more than one institution, the student (and his or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
her subsequent repayment or default) is attributed to each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution for attendance at which the student received a loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that entered repayment in the fiscal year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) A loan on which a payment is made by the institution, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its owner, agent, contractor, employee, or any other affiliated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entity or individual, in order to avoid default by the borrower, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is considered as in default for purposes of this definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Any loan that has been rehabilitated under section 428F 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the HEA before the end of that following fiscal year is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered as in default for purposes of this definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) For the purposes of this definition, a loan made in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with section 428A of the HEA (or a Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consolidation Loan a portion of which is used to repay a Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SLS loan) shall not be considered to enter repayment until after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the borrower has ceased to be enrolled in an educational program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leading to a degree, certificate, or other recognized educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credential at the participating institution on at least a half-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time basis (as determined by the institution) and ceased to be in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a period of forbearance based on such enrollment. Each eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lender of a loan made under section 428A (or a Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consolidation Loan a portion of which is used to repay a Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SLS loan) of the HEA shall provide the guaranty agency with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information necessary to determine when the loan entered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repayment for purposes of this definition, and the guaranty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency shall provide that information to the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) (A) A cohort default rate of an institution applies to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all locations of the institution as the institution exists on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first day of the fiscal year for which the rate is calculated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) A cohort default rate of an institution applies to all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
locations of the institution from the date the institution is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notified of that rate until the institution is notified by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary that the rate no longer applies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) (A) For an institution that changes its status from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that of a location of one institution to that of a free-standing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution, the Secretary determines the cohort default rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on the institution's status as of October 1 of the fiscal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year for which a cohort default rate is being calculated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) For an institution that changes its status from that of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a free-standing institution to that of a location of another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution, the Secretary determines the cohort default rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on the combined number of students who enter repayment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the applicable fiscal year and the combined number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students who default during the applicable fiscal years from both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the former free-standing institution and the other institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This cohort default rate applies to the new, consolidated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution and all of its current locations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(C) For free-standing institutions that merge to form a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new, consolidated institution, the Secretary determines the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cohort default rate based on the combined number of students who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enter repayment during the applicable fiscal year and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combined number of students who default during the applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiscal years from all of the institutions that are merging. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cohort default rate applies to the new consolidated institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) For a location of one institution that becomes a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
location of another institution, the Secretary determines the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cohort default rate based on the combined number of students who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enter repayment during the applicable fiscal year and the number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of students who default during the applicable fiscal years from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both of the institutions in their entirety, not limited solely to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the respective locations.

Federal SLS Program participation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loses its participation in the Federal SLS Program if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary determines that the institution's cohort default rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the most recent fiscal year for which that rate is available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is equal to or greater than 30 percent. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's loss of participation does not apply to a student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who is not an undergraduate student or who has received a Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SLS loan previously for enrollment in the same educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program at the institution (except that previous receipt of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal SLS loan shall not qualify a student for a Federal SLS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan with respect to an extension of the duration of that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
behalf of the student if the student_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

or otherwise fails to complete the program on or after his or her 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first day of class of the period of enrollment for which he or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
she was charged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The institution shall provide a clear and conspicuous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written statement containing its refund policy, including the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation of refunds and repayments to sources of aid, together 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with examples of the application of this policy, to a prospective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student prior to the earlier of the student's enrollment or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
execution of the student's enrollment agreement. The institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall make its policy known to currently enrolled students. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution shall include in its statement the procedures that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student must follow to obtain a refund, but the institution shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
return the portion of a refund allocable to the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the student follows those procedures or not. If the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes its refund policy, the institution shall ensure that all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students are made aware of the new policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The institution shall publish the costs of required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplies and equipment and shall substantiate to the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon request that the costs are reasonably related to the cost of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing the supplies and equipment to students.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pro rata refund, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
as used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section, means a refund by an institution to a student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attending that institution for the first time of not less than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that portion of the tuition, fees, room, board, and other charges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessed the student by the institution equal to the portion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that remains on the withdrawal date, rounded downward to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nearest 10 percent of that period, less_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) (A) Any unpaid amount of a scheduled cash payment for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A scheduled cash payment is the amount of institutional charges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is not paid for by financial aid for the period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollment for which the student has been charged exclusive of_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) Any amount scheduled to be paid by Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program assistance that the student has been awarded that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payable to the student even though the student has withdrawn; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) Late disbursements of loans made under the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stafford Loan, Federal SLS, and Federal PLUS programs in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with 34 CFR 682.207(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The unpaid amount of a scheduled cash payment is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
computed by subtracting the amount paid by the student for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of enrollment for which the student has been charged from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the scheduled cash payment for the period of enrollment for which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the student has been charged; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A reasonable administrative fee not to exceed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lesser of_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Five percent of the tuition, fees, room and board, and

other charges assessed the student; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) One hundred dollars; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Any application fee charged by the institution; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The portion of ``board'' charges (i.e., meal tickets) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that have been expended by the student that exceed the portion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attributable to the period for which the student attended at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time of withdrawal. The institution must include in the refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any unexpended ``board'' credits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) (i) For purposes of this section, ``other charges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessed the student by the institution'' include, but are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited to, charges for any equipment (including books and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplies) issued by an institution to the student. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution may deduct from the refund owed under this paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the documented cost to the institution of equipment issued to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student if the institution specifies in the enrollment agreement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a separate charge for equipment which the student actually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtains or if the institution refers the student to a vendor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operated by an affiliated or related entity and the student does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not return the equipment in good condition, allowing for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable wear and tear, within 20 days following the date of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the student's withdrawal. The student shall be liable for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount, if any, by which the documented cost for equipment not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned in good condition exceeds the refund under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph. Equipment is not considered to be returned in good 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition if the equipment cannot be reused because of clearly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognized health and sanitary reasons, and this fact is clearly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and conspicuously disclosed in the enrollment agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) An institution may not delay its payment of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portion of a refund allocable under this section to a Title IV, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA program or a lender under 34 CFR 682.607 by reason of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process for return of equipment prescribed in paragraph (c)(4)(i) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For purposes of this section_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) ``Room'' charges do not include charges that are passed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through the institution from an entity that is not under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control of, related to, or affiliated with the institution; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) ``Other charges assessed the student by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution'' do not include fees for group health insurance, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this insurance is required for all students and the purchased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coverage remains in effect for the student throughout the period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for which the student was charged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) (i) For purposes of this section, a student attending an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution for the first time is a student who_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Has not previously attended at least one class at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Received a refund of 100 percent of his or her tuition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and fees (less any permitted administrative fee) under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's refund policy for previous attendance at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A student remains a first-time student until the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student either_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Withdraws, drops out, or is expelled from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution after attending at least one class; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Completes the period of enrollment for which he or she 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been charged.

(5) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, ``the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portion of the period of enrollment for which the student has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been charged that remains'' is determined_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) In the case of an educational program that is measured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in credit hours, by dividing the total number of weeks comprising 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into the number of weeks remaining in that period as of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student's withdrawal date; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In the case of an educational program that is measured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in clock hours, by dividing the total number of clock hours 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comprising the period of enrollment for which the student has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been charged into the number of scheduled clock hours remaining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be completed by the student in that period as of the student's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withdrawal date; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) In the case of an educational program that consists 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
predominantly of correspondence courses, by dividing the total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of lessons comprising the period of enrollment for which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the student has been charged into the number of lessons not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted by the student. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Period of enrollment for which the student has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charged. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) For purposes of this section, ``the period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollment for which the student has been charged,'' means the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actual period for which an institution charges a student, except 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the minimum period must be_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) In the case of an educational program that is measured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in credit hours and uses semesters, trimesters, quarters, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other academic terms, the semester, trimester, quarter or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
academic term; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In the case of an educational program that is measured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in credit hours and does not use semesters, trimesters, quarters, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or other academic terms, or an educational program that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measured in clock hours, the lesser of the length of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
educational program or an academic year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If an institution charges by different periods for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different charges, the ``period of enrollment for which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student has been charged'' for purposes of this section is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
longest period for which the student is charged. The institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must include any charges assessed the student for the period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollment or any portion of that period of enrollment when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculating the refund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e)

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) An institution shall determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether a student has received an overpayment for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noninstitutional costs for the period of enrollment for which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student has been charged if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The student officially withdraws, drops out, or is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expelled on or after his or her first day of class of that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The student received Title IV, HEA program assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other than from the FWS, Federal Stafford Loan, Federal PLUS, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal SLS Program for that period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) (i) To determine if the student owes an overpayment, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution shall subtract the noninstitutional costs that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student incurred for that portion of the period of enrollment for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the student has been charged from the amount of all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance (other than from the FWS, Federal Stafford Loan, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal PLUS, or Federal SLS Program) that the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disbursed to the student. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Noninstitutional costs may include, but are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited to, room and board for which the student does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract with the institution, books, supplies, transportation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and miscellaneous expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Repayments to Title IV, HEA programs of institutional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refunds and overpayments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1)(i) An institution shall return a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portion of the refund calculated in accordance with paragraph (b) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section to the Title IV, HEA programs if the student to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whom the refund is owed received assistance under any Title IV, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA program other than the FWS Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The portion of the refund that an institution shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
return to the Title IV, HEA programs may not exceed the amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance that the student received under the Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs other than under the FWS Program for the period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollment for which the student has been charged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

refund required under paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(1)(iii) of this section_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) An institutional refund means the amount paid for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutional charges for the period of enrollment for which the

student has been charged minus the amount that the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may retain under paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portion of the period of enrollment for which the student has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been charged that the student was actually enrolled at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) An institution may not include any unpaid amount of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scheduled cash payment in determining the amount that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution may retain for institutional charges. A scheduled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cash payment is the amount of institutional charges that has not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been paid by financial aid for the period of enrollment for which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the student has been charged, exclusive of_

(A) Any amount scheduled to be paid by Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program assistance that the student has been awarded that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payable to the student even though the student has withdrawn; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Late disbursements of loans made under the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stafford, Federal SLS, and Federal PLUS programs in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with 34 CFR 682.207(d); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) In determining the amount that the institution may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retain for the portion of the period of enrollment for which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student has been charged during which the student was actually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrolled, an institution shall_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Compute the unpaid amount of a scheduled cash payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by subtracting the amount paid by the student for that period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollment for which the student has been charged from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scheduled cash payment for the period of enrollment for which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student has been charged; and

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) Except as

provided in paragraphs (i)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section, a

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lesson that he or she submitted, a desire to continue in the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollment after the start of the leave of absence begins more

administrative capability contained in subpart B of this part; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

payments and payments by way of reimbursements).

16. A new Appendix A to Part 668 is added to read as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
Appendix A to Part 668_Standards for Acceptable Refund Policies by
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Participating Institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of &sect;668.22(b)(1)(iv)(A), the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considers an institution to have a fair and equitable refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy if the institution uses a policy that meets the minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of this appendix. These requirements are a modified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
version of guidelines developed by the National Association of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
College and University Business Officers. These requirements do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not affect an institution's obligation to comply with other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department of Education regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(I) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The governing board of the institution must review and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approve the schedule of all institutional charges and refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policies applicable to students. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The pricing of services and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund policies have important consequences to students, parents, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution, and society; as such, pricing and refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policies must receive board attention and approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(II) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The institution must seek consumer views in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process of establishing and amending charge and refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
structures. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Decisions regarding institutional funds are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ultimately the sole responsibility of the institution's legally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated fund custodians. However, consumer concerns do affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision making, and involving consumers in decision making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related to charges and refunds is an essential approach for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessing student needs and creating public awareness of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutional requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(III) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The institution must publish a current schedule of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all student charges (including the costs of required supplies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment), publish a statement of the purpose for such charges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and related refund policies, have those statements readily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available free of charge to current and prospective students, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantiate that the costs of required supplies and equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are reasonably related to the cost of providing the supplies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment to the students. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Students and parents have a right to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
know what charges they will be expected to pay and what will or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not be refunded. They also have a right to know what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services accompany payment of the charges. Informational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials published free for students and prospective students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are ideal for this purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(IV) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The institution must clearly designate all optional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charges as ``optional'' in all published schedules and related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Charges that are mandatory and charges that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
optional must be plainly differentiated in all printed materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statements accompanying the schedule may include institutional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
endorsements of the optional program or service. The institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must state clearly in its schedule if a charge is optional for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some students but required for others. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(V) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The institution must clearly identify charges and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deposits that are nonrefundable as ``nonrefundable'' on all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published schedules. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Institutions determine on an individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis which of their charges are refundable or nonrefundable. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general, admission fees, application fees, laboratory fees, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility and student activity fees, and other similar charges are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not refundable. These fees are generally charged to cover the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost of activities such as processing applications and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student information, reserving academic positions and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishing the limits of institutional programs and services, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reserving housing space, and otherwise setting the fixed costs of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution for the coming academic periods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Institutions determine on an individual basis which of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deposits are refundable or nonrefundable. Some deposits will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonrefundable or will be credited to a student's account (e.g., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tuition deposits). Others are refundable according to the terms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the deposit agreement (e.g., deposits for breakage). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(VI) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The institution must refund housing rental charges, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less a deposit, as long as written notification of cancellation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is made prior to a well-publicized date that provides reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to make the space available to other students.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written notification on or before the beginning of the term of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the contract is necessary to ensure utilization of housing units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the term of the contract, room charges are generally not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refundable. However, based on the program offered, space 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
availability, debt service requirements, State and local laws, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and other individual circumstances, institutions may provide for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some more flexible refund guideline for housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(VII) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The institution must refund board charges in full, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less a deposit, if written notification of cancellation is made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to a well-publicized date that falls on or before the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beginning of the term of the contract. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Subsequent board charges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be refunded on a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
basis. It is reasonable to make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a refund for those goods and services not consumed. The deposit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should reflect that portion of an institution's costs that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fixed for the term of the contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(VIII) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The institutional refund policy must include the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following requirements: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. The institution must refund 100 percent of the tuition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charges, less an administrative fee that does not exceed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lesser of $100 or 5 percent of the tuition, if the student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submits written notice of cancellation on or before one week 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preceding the first day of classes for the period of enrollment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for which the student was charged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. The institution must refund at least 90 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tuition charges if the student submits written notice of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cancellation between the end of the period of time specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(VIII) A. and the end of the first 10 percent (in time) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of enrollment for which the student was charged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. The institution must refund at least 50 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tuition charges if the student submits written notice of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cancellation between the end of the first 10 percent (in time) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the period of enrollment for which the student was charged and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the end of the first 25 percent (in time) of that period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. The institution must refund at least 25 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tuition charges if the student submits written notice of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cancellation between the end of the first 25 percent (in time) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the period of enrollment for which the student was charged and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the end of the first 50 percent (in time) of the period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. The institution may deduct from the refund owed under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this paragraph the documented cost to the institution of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment issued to the student if the institution specifies in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the enrollment agreement a separate charge for equipment that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student actually obtains or if the institution refers the student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to a vendor operated by an affiliated or related entity and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student does not return the equipment in good condition, allowing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for reasonable wear and tear, within 20 days following the date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the student's withdrawal. The student shall be liable for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount, if any, by which the documented cost for equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeds the refund under this paragraph. Equipment is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered to be returned in good condition if the equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cannot be reused because of clearly recognized health and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitary reasons, and this fact is clearly and conspicuously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosed in the enrollment agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(IX) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The institution must assess no penalty charges where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution, as opposed to the student, is in error. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Penalty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charges, such as those involving late registration fees, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change-of-schedule fees, and late payment fees, must not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessed if it is determined that the student is not responsible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the action causing the charges to be levied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(X) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The institution must advise students that any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notifications of withdrawal or cancellation and requests for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund must be in writing and addressed to the designated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution officer. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A student's written notification of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withdrawal or cancellation and request for a refund provides an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accurate record of transactions and also ensures that the request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be processed on a timely basis. Acceptance of oral requests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is an undesirable practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(XI) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The institution must pay or credit refunds due in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with &sect;668.22(h)(4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(XII) The institution must publicize, as a part of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dissemination of information on charges and refunds, that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeals process exists for students or parents who believe that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual circumstances warrant exceptions from published 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy. The informational materials must include the name, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
title, and address of the official responsible for handling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeals. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Although charges and refund policies should reflect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extensive consideration of student and institutional needs, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not be possible to encompass in these structures the variety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of personal circumstances that may exist or develop. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Institutions are required to provide a system of due process to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their students, and charges and refund policies are legitimately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a part of that process. Students and parents should be informed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regularly of procedures for requesting information concerning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceptions to published policies.

(e) (1) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a), (b), (c) (1) or (2), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or (d) of this section, if an institution demonstrates to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfaction of the Secretary that the institution has provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Pell Grants in accordance with this part but has not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received credit or payment for those grants, the institution may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receive payment or a reduction in accountability for those grants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The institution must demonstrate that it qualifies for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a credit or payment by means of a finding contained in an audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report as initially submitted to the Department that was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted after December 31, 1988 and timely submitted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with 34 CFR 668.23(c), with respect to grants made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the period of that audit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In determining whether the institution qualifies for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment or reduction in accountability, the Secretary takes into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
account any liabilities of the institution arising from that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
audit or any other source. The Secretary collects those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liabilities by offset in accordance with 34 CFR part 30.

I. Academic Year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Section 481(d)(2) of the HEA provides that an ``academic year'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must require a minimum of 30 weeks of instruction time in which a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student is expected to complete at least 24 semester or trimester 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours or 36 quarter hours at an institution that measures program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
length in credit hours or at least 900 clock hours at an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution that measures program length in clock hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community's views: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. How should prorations be calculated? For example, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22 weeks are offered, how does an institution determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portion of an academic year that applies? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Prorations of an academic year in educational programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shorter than an academic year should be based solely on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the number of credit or clock hours provided, without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regard to the number of weeks required. Proration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should not be used for educational programs of one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
academic year or longer. Attempts to prorate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
length of an academic year using both weeks and credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or clock hours would be inconsistent and confusing, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because credit or clock hours are not always evenly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributed over the calendar length of an educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Prorations should be based on the minimum number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clock or credit hours that a full-time student in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible program is scheduled to take in an academic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year. Prorations should not be based on the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weeks in the academic year. A minority opposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inclusion of a reference to ``eligible program'' in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendation. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. What is a week? How should portions of a week be treated? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A week should include any week during a portion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the educational process takes place. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A majority of participants recommended that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructional week be defined in terms of a fixed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard of clock hours of instruction. Thus, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, if regulations define an instructional week as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the completion of 30 clock hours, a student who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completes 90 clock hours of instruction in two calendar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weeks should be considered to have completed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent of three instructional weeks. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A week should be defined as a seven-day period that can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
begin on any day of the week. The seven-day periods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continue for 30 periods of time. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A ``week'' should be defined as either each seven-day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period within an enrollment period; or each seven-day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period (within an enrollment period) during which any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instruction occurred. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. What is instructional time? Should periods provided for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
orientation, testing, and vacation count? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Instructional time should be measured on the basis of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar weeks that begin on Monday and end on Sunday. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Instructional time should consist of a period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuous enrollment beginning with the first week of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classes and ending with the conclusion of the period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollment, including any normally scheduled breaks in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the academic calendar. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Instructional time should include time spent reading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and taking examinations. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The interests of students, institutions, and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constituents need to be considered in determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructional time. Some participants recommended that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the determination be left to accrediting agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other participants recommended that the determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be left to the Secretary. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. What consideration should be given to programs with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condensed class schedules, or to weekend programs? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Because instructional time should be measured on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis of periods of continuous enrollment, special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration for condensed schedules or weekend 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs is unnecessary. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The interests of students, institutions, and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constituents need to be considered in determining how 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to treat condensed schedules and weekend programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some participants recommended that the determination be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
left to accrediting agencies. Other participants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended that the determination be left to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Condensed programs that include the equivalent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workload of a regular academic-year program should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered to meet the definition of academic year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
5. How does the new definition affect less-than-full-time students? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The definition does not affect part-time students. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A student who completes fewer than the required minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of clock or credit hours during the 30-week 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period should be considered less-than-full-time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The length of the academic year is irrelevant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining the enrollment status of students. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Enrollment status is determined by the length of time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(in terms of credit or clock hours) that a student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
takes to complete a ``program.'' [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=3 -->
II. Eligible Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
A. Effective July 1, 1993, section 481(b) and (c) of the HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require a proprietary institution of higher education or a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
postsecondary vocational institution to provide an eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program of training that prepares students for gainful employment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a recognized occupation. Section 481(e) of the HEA requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an eligible program to consist of at least 600 clock hours, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16 semester hours, or 24 quarter hours offered during a minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 15 weeks, if the program admits students who have not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completed the equivalent of an associate degree. An eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program must consist of at least 300 clock hours, eight semester 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours, or 12 quarter hours offered during a minimum of ten weeks, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the program is an undergraduate program requiring the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent of an associate degree for admission or if the program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is a graduate or professional program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary is required to develop regulations to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine the quality of educational programs of less than 600 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clock hours. Those regulations must, at a minimum, require those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
educational programs to have verified completion and placement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates of at least 70 percent. An educational program of more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 300 clock hours and less than 600 clock hours that meets the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's regulations qualifies for eligibility under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Family Education Loan programs even if the educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program is not an undergraduate program requiring the equivalent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an associate degree for admission, and even if the educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program is not a graduate or professional program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community's views: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. What is the equivalent of an associates degree? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An associates degree should be a degree which meets the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degree requirements of any State for an associate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degree. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An associates degree should represent the completion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any educational program that meets State licensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements and that equals at least the length of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
typical associate degree program. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An associates degree should represent the completion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any educational program leading to a vocational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objective if the program is at least 1,800 clock hours, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(60 or 48) semester hours, or (90 or 64) quarter hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(The variation in credit hours depends on whether the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negotiators decide to use the number of credits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to earn an associate degree or the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credits required for completion of at least two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
academic years.) [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An associates degree should represent the completion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an educational program that is at least two academic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years in length. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An associates degree should represent the completion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an educational program leading to licensure in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occupation, if a community college offers an associate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degree program for that occupation. [Kansas City]

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
&bull;An associates degree should be determined by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional judgment of the Secretary. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An associates degree should be determined by an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's State licensing agency. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An associates degree should consist of previous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training in the same field of study as that for which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the eligible program prepares training. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An associates degree should, for occupations with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apprenticeship programs, require the completion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
five-year apprenticeship programs. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An associates degree should represent the completion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the equivalent of two years of successful academic work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a postsecondary environment or a professional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
license that required a specific period of training and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perhaps work experience. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An associates degree should represent the completion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the equivalent of at least two academic years of study, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to compliance with applicable State laws and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An associates degree should represent the completion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
60 semester hours or the equivalent. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. What are other measures of ``quality'' for programs of less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 600 hours? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An educational program should be considered to satisfy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary's quality measures if a program that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepares students for State licensure in an occupation; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a program that prepares students for certification by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nationally recognized professional or industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
association; or a program that is approved by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nationally recognized accrediting agency or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
association. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;No additional measures should be included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[New York, Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. How should the required job placement and graduation rates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be calculated? How often should the rates be calculated? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The methodology and timing for the calculations should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be identical to those required under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Education Act and the Student Right-to-Know and Campus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Security Act. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Calculation of completion rates should be based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formula used under the Student Right-to-Know and Campus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Security Act, except that the calculation should not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include time-specific constraints. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Calculation of placement rates should be based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formula used under the Student Right-to-Know and Campus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Security Act, except that only completers should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
counted in the denominator. No time frame should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used in the calculation. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Regulations should define completion rate, graduation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate, and full-time employment (which should specify a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of time in a job). [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Calculations should be based over a two-three year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period to reflect long-term trends and avert the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse impact of short-term problems such as those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
caused by economic conditions. Institutions that fall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below the minimum rates ought to be provided appeal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Because there are many State regulations and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accrediting agency standards governing this area, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions should be allowed to follow the most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restrictive ones. Institutions following the most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restrictive regulations and standards should not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to maintain multiple sets of documentation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrating compliance with a variety of regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and standards. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The cohort for calculation of placement rates should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include placement in jobs related to the occupation for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which students are trained. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In calculating placement rates, students should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
counted as employed if they obtain jobs within 180 days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of graduation. Students should be counted as employed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if they obtain jobs in the field for which they were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trained or a related field. Students (such as those in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuing education or in the military) who are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
looking for a job should be excluded from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculation. The calculation should be based on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage of graduates. Incarcerated or physically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incapacitated students should be excluded from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculation. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. What documentation is required to support the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completion and job placement rates? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Documentation should be identical to that required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technology Education Act and the Student Right-to-Know 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Campus Security Act. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Documentation should be any documentation required by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution's State or accrediting agency. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates can be verified through required compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
audits. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Calculations should be included in the Fiscal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operations Report and Application to Participate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(FISAP) for the campus-based programs. The time-frame 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for reporting this data should be relatively short, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that the data is relevant. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A student's placement information should be maintained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in each student's file. Placement information should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be available for the purposes of audits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Institutions should maintain employment records on file 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to confirm placements. Employment records should not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be submitted to the Department of Education. [Atlanta]

Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution. [Kansas City]

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Should there be a standard information-sharing format? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;There should be a standard information sharing format 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided that the institution is allowed to report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using its accounting system. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;There needs to be a standard information sharing format 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that can be completed readily and corresponds to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's fiscal year. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Department should provide a single form that can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used for all agencies. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Section 487(a)(8)(B) requires institutions that advertise job 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
placement rates to make available to prospective students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relevant State licensing requirements for any job for which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
course of instruction is designed to prepare the student. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community's views: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. How often should institutions be required to update 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensing data? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Institutions should update the data whenever State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensing agencies require that updates or regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must occur. [San Francisco, Kansas City, Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Information always needs to be current. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Should there be a standard format for providing this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information to prospective students? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A typical brochure should be used to convey information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to students. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;There should not be a standard format for providing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this information to prospective students. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[Kansas City, New York, Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The institution should use the States required format 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for providing consumer data to students. If the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary requires additional information, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information should be consistent with the formats that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution already uses. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. Section 487(a)(13) provides that an institution may not deny 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal financial aid to an eligible student because the student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is studying abroad in a program approved for credit by the home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community's views: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Should a consortium agreement be required? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A consortium agreement should not be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[Kansas City, San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A consortium agreement should be used for pre-approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
work. Institutions need to ensure that two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions are not giving aid at the same time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A consortium agreement should be required if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student is paying tuition at the home institution and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
second institution is involved. Otherwise no consortium agreement should be required. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Does the study-abroad program have to be part of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student's program at the home institution? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The study abroad program need not be a part of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student's program at the home institution, but must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
count toward a degree at the institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The study abroad program should be a part of the

3. How should the term ``approved for credit'' be defined? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The term ``approved for credit'' should mean that credits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are fully transferable (accepted for credit) into an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible program offered by the home institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;``Approved for credit'' should mean used toward a degree 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as defined by the institution. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;``Approved for credit'' should mean that it is determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in advance that the credit is accepted at the home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Should a standard format be developed for institutions to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report study abroad programs? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A standard format for institutions to report study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
abroad programs is not needed. It does not appear that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any reporting is required. [Kansas City, New York, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
San Francisco, Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. Section 487(a)(14)(A) requires a new institution or an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution that undergoes a change of ownership or changes its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
status as a parent or subordinate institution to develop a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Default Management Plan to participate in the FFEL program. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary must approve the plan and the plan must be implemented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for two years after the institution is initially certified as an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible institution or for two years after its change of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ownership or status. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community's views: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Should the criteria in Appendix D of current regulations be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used as the basis for the Secretary's approval of default plans? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Unless otherwise required, an institution should use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix D or submit any other approved default 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management plan. [Kansas City, Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If a new institution uses Appendix D, it is subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
things it can't do as a new institution. What is in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix D that isn't in the new regulations already? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New institutions will certify that they will adopt the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stipulated plan they have in place (that has approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the appropriate State and or accrediting body.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Should there be other criteria? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Other criteria should include: a) more follow up once 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the student leaves the institution; and b) additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooperation with all partners in the program, i.e., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lenders, institutions, and secondary markets. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department should reassess the method for determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cohort default rate. It is not fair for most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;No other criteria is needed. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. Section 487(a)(18)(A) requires an institution that offers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
athletically-related student aid to compile annually data on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenses and revenues of athletic activities and expenses and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revenues of the institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. How should the terms ``revenues'' and ``expenses'' be defined? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;There should be coordination with NCAA regulations and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
audit guides. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Institutions should be allowed to use the accounting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles and terms they are currently using to define 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``revenues'' and ``expenses.'' [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F. Section 487(a)(19) provides that if a student is unable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet his or her financial obligation to the institution because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a delay in the disbursement of proceeds of a Title IV, HEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program loan (due to compliance with Title IV requirements or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delays attributable to the institution), the institution may not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalize the student in any way, including assessing a late fee; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
denying the student access to class, the library, or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities; or requiring that the student borrow additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. How should the term ``denial of access to classes'' be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpreted? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;``Denial of access'' should mean the student is not given 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
access to equipment or supplies. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. What should be considered as a condition to meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of a ``delay in the delivery of proceeds?''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
&bull;This section should not apply to: 1) delays by lenders

or guarantors in delivering loan proceeds which are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
caused by the necessity of complying with Title IV 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements; and 2) delays attributable to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student's not providing information by known, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published, or noticed deadlines, that the institution, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lender, or guarantor must have in order to comply with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV requirements. (Example, IRS 1040 forms for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verification.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary should regulate in such a way that it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clear that institutions may charge reasonable interest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on unpaid bills where the delay in Title IV delivery is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attributed to the student or an agency other than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;This section does not address delays for which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student has not met public deadlines or performed all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligations necessary to ensure the delivery of timely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aid. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If the student does not provide documents, it is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable. It should relate only to a 30 day delayed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disbursement. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;No constraints should be put on a student for the delay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of that portion of tuition covered by the first-time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stafford loan or in the case of institutional delay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Consideration should be given to the laws of various 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
states since they differ as to when a student must meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
his or her financial obligation at an institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. If a delay is caused by the lender or institution can the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guarantee agency take actions that are prohibited under other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;No, a guaranty agency should not be allowed to take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action if the delay is caused by the lender or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;G. Section 487(a)(20) prohibits an institution from paying a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commission, bonus or other incentive payment based directly or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any person or entity engaged in any student recruiting or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
admission activities or in making decisions regarding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
awarding of student financial assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community's views: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. How should the Department determine that an institution is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not providing commissions, bonuses, and other incentive payments? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Compliance should be determined through the audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process. Auditors check employment and payroll 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records. [San Francisco, Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. If an institution awards merit pay to salaried employees in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increments as the student successfully completes portions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
course, graduates, or gets placed in a job, would the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be in compliance? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Institutions should be allowed to provide merit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incentives to employees as long as it cannot be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attached to the enrollment process (i.e., servicing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retaining, and placing students after the first day of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
class at the institution.) [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Salaried employees should be rewarded for retention. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any compensation (non-salaried) for the enrollment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial aid students is illegal. There appears to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opposition to compensating for the ``warm body count'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and financial aid packages, but it does seem that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statute allows for a legitimate basis for compensation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above base salary for areas such as retention, however 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined, and/or completion rates. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;As the intent appears to be elimination of head count 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recruitment commissions, bonuses on merit pay may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made as long as they are not made solely as the basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of recruitment of the student. The Department should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
define who is an employee. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The institution would be in compliance if an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution awards merit pay to salaried employees in

increments as the student successfully completes

portions or the course, graduates, or gets placed in a

IV. Annual Audits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
A. The Secretary is authorized to prescribe regulations for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutional and third-party servicer audits. Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
487(c)(1)(A)(i) requires an annual audit of the financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition of the institution in its entirety and an annual audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the institution's compliance with the requirements governing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Title IV programs. The institution must make these audits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to cognizant guaranty agencies, eligible lenders, State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies, and the State review entities designated under subpart 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1 of part H of Title IV of the HEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community's views: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. To what extent, if any, should the annual audit requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be waived or limited? Should this requirement for annual audits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be waived for institutions participating in the Quality Assurance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Annual financial audit should be waived in all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instances except in the case of new institutions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions undergoing a change in ownership, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions with a cohort default rate in excess of 25 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent for one year, and institutions that did not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfy all factors of financial responsibility in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their most recent financial statement issued to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department. Furthermore, institutions would be required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to submit no more than two consecutive annual audits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before being considered released from the annual audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Annual compliance audit should be waived for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions except in the case of new institutions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions undergoing a change of ownership, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions which have undergone a compliance audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the past three years which resulted in Title IV 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liabilities in excess of one percent of Title IV funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disbursed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A further suggestion was made to truncate the audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements if the Secretary continues to require an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual audit. A minority of the group felt that annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
audits, both financial and compliance, should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required and not waived. Those institutions that meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality assurance criteria would be required to submit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a short form audit on a biannual basis. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;No further burden should be placed on institutions than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their State already requires or than the IRS requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of them. If someone else wants the audit, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department should be responsible for distributing them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There should be diminishing filing requirements based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon performance evaluation factors and general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
longevity of institutions to exempt an institution from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an annual audit. A minority suggested that pledged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assets be accepted at some level in lieu of a certified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual audit. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The annual audit requirement could be waived in certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas, e.g., the institution could be exempt from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student compliance components but not from a financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
audit if the institution is in the quality assurance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Department should develop a set of guidelines that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would permit exemptions. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. How should guaranty agencies, lenders, and other parties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request audit information from institutions? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An audit correction action plan should be sent to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guaranty agencies and lenders. Requests should be in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
writing with explanations of why the request is made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Freedom of Information Act procedures could be used. Requests should be made to the appropriate official on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
campus. Information may not be given to any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party without the approval of the institution.

V. Institutional Refund Policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 484B(b)(2) requires that each institution participating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in any Title IV, HEA program shall have a fair and equitable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund policy under which the institution refunds unearned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tuition, fees, room and board, and other charges, to a student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who received Title IV assistance (including Federal PLUS loans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received on the student's behalf) for a student who does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
register for the period of attendance for which assistance was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended or withdraws or otherwise fails to complete the period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of enrollment for which assistance is provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An institution's refund policy is considered to be fair and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equitable if the policy provides for a refund in an amount of at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least the largest of the amounts provided under_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The requirements of applicable State law; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The specific refund standards established by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's nationally recognized accrediting agency if those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards are approved by the Secretary; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
refund calculation described in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statute for any student whose withdrawal date is on or before the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
60 percent point in time in the period of enrollment for which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the student has been charged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
refund,'' means a refund by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to a student attending that institution for the first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time of not less than that portion of the tuition, fees, room, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
board, and other charges assessed the student by the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equal to the portion of the period of enrollment for which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student has been charged that remains on the last recorded day of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attendance by the student, rounded downward to the nearest 10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of that period, less any unpaid charges owed by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student for the period of enrollment for which the student has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been charged, and less a reasonable administrative fee not to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceed the lesser of five percent of the tuition, fees, room and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
board, and other charges assessed the student, or $100. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``The portion of the period of enrollment for which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student has been charged that remains,'' is determined_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In the case of an educational program that is measured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in credit hours, by dividing the total number of weeks comprising 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into the number of weeks remaining in that period as of the last 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recorded day of attendance by the student; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In the case of an educational program that is measured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in clock hours, by dividing the total number of clock hours 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comprising the period of enrollment for which the student has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been charged into the number of clock hours remaining to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completed by the student in that period as of the last recorded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
day of attendance by the student; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In the case of a correspondence program, by dividing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the total number of lessons comprising the period of enrollment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for which the student has been charged into the number of lessons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not submitted by the student.

Issues that the community was asked to address and the

community's views: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. How should the ``60 percent point in time'' be determined?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attendance?

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
&bull;The ``60 percent point in time'' should be based on scheduled time in the program, not on actual attendance.
[Kansas City, San Francisco, Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In the absence of formal withdrawal by the student, it is up to the institution to devise a mechanism to determine
the last date of attendance. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. How should the term ``student who is attending the institution for the first time'' be defined? Should this mean
the first time ever or the first time at the institution? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Only first year, first-time students should be considered ``first time.'' [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;``A student who is attending such institution for the first time'' should be defined as the first time ever rather
than the first time at an institution. Some attendees favored defining ``first time'' as the first time at the institution.
Pro ration should continue until the student finishes his or her first period of enrollment for which they have been
charged, or until the student has withdrawn from that term, class, or program for which they have been charged. If the
student re-enters the institution, they would not be considered a first time student. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;``First-time student'' is a student at that particular institution in their first scheduled period of enrollment
for which the student has been charged. [New York, Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;``First-time student'' should be defined as a student enrolled for the first time at the institution in an eligible
program. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The regulations should not determine a minimum program length to consider a student as attending at a prior
institution or current institution. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If a student enrolls for any period of time, drops out, then returns, they are not considered enrolled for the
first time for the second enrollment period. If standard terms of enrollment are used, the student should be considered
first time for the first term of enrollment for which they were charged. If standard terms are not used, the lesser of
60 percent of the first academic year or 60 percent of the program should be used. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. How should the term ``period of enrollment for which the student has been charged'' be defined? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The term ``period of enrollment for which the student has been charged'' should be left to the institution to
define based on scheduled time. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The ``period of enrollment for which the student has been charged'' should be defined based on full charges
for the increment of the enrollment period defined by the institution as the ``period for charges.'' [Kansas City]

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The ``period of enrollment for which the student has been charged'' should be defined as the length of time for
which the student was initially charged. For example, for an institution that charges by semester, the first semester
the student was charged is the relevant period of enrollment. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The ``period of enrollment for which the student has been charged'' should be defined as a minimum of one academic
term, quarter, or semester or, for clock hour institutions, as a minimum of one-third of an academic year. If the institution
charges for a full program, the length of the program should be defined as an academic period. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The ``period of enrollment for which the student has been charged'' should be defined as the length for which
a student would be eligible to receive Title IV assistance. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Should the regulations address specific requirements regarding the treatment of equipment or book costs to be
included in pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund calculations? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Books and supplies should be excluded from the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 calculation. Only fees for services rendered over time, e.g., lab fees, should be included. Exclude ``up front''
fees (application) and books, supplies, and equipment up to a certain dollar amount. There is a difference between
a service fee and a purchase of supplies, equipment, and books. Purchases should be excluded. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The regulations should state that equipment, books supplies, telephone charges, parking fines, etc. should
not be included with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 requirements. [Kansas City, Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Charges for equipment, instructional materials, etc. should not be included in the calculation for refund
purposes if separately charged by the institution. [San Francisco]

&bull;If books and supplies are provided by the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Certain fees assessed by the institution should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

not realize the benefits over the enrollment period to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include one time charges, i.e., application fee, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
orientation charges, testing fees, and deferred payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fees. Other charges assessed by the institution should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be excluded from the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 refund when the student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not realize the benefit over the enrollment period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to include fines, penalties, and individual charges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i.e., parking fines, and health center charges.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Books and supplies should not be included in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund unless they are considered a mandatory charge by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution (i.e, not when the student has the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
option of buying from the institution or some other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source.) [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If all equipment and books are purchased at one time or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issued to the student before he or she terminates his 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or her enrollment, the cost should be included in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund. The institution should charge the whole amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which is not returnable. Equipment must be returned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and able to be used again. If equipment has not yet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been issued, the student would be eligible for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100 percent refund. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Should the regulations address a time frame for student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refunds? Should the regulations have a minimum program length 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a student must complete before the student will not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered to be attending ``for the first time?'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The time frame for all refunds should be uniformly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
60 days from the date the institution becomes aware 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a student has withdrawn. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The regulations should indicate the time frame for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issuing student refunds to be the same as current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund requirements- within 60 days of determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a refund is in order. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Refunds should be made 30 days from date of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Regulations should not address a time frame for refunds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since it is already addressed by the State or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accrediting agencies. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Should the regulations address how institutions will account 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for credit balances? Should these funds be kept in a restrictive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
account rather than the institution's general operating account? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The regulations should not address how institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
account for credit balances nor restrictive or general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating accounts. A minority of the group felt that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students with a baccalaureate degree should be exempt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the language. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The group recommends that regulations remain silent on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the method by which institutions account for credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
balances. [San Francisco, Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;After all returns have been made to the Federal program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from which the funds came, there should be a reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of time for the student to request his account 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
balance if there are educational costs outstanding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Since the statute would imply than an institution is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to calculate all three policies and make the payment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the one most generous, should the institution be allowed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine which is generally most generous an make that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
official refund policy? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Institutions should be allowed to determine the refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy that is generally most generous and use that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy. Institutions would define ``generally most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generous.'' [Kansas City, San Francisco, Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Department should issue guidelines for institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to use in determining which method to use. If the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions use average costs in awarding and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packaging, average costs should be used in refunds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Institutions should not be allowed to determine which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund is ``generally most generous.'' This is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inconsistent with the statute. The statute does, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, permit institution to develop an algorithm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that integrates the three refund policies and yields 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the calculation ``most generous'' to each individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student. The requirements should apply only to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculation of refunds for students who are recipients 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of financial aid under Title IV. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. How should ``fair and equitable'' be defined? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Fair and equitable'' should be defined as most generous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the student. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;It is not necessary to define ``fair and equitable'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separately from the requirements of the statute and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. The Student Commission addresses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequately the definition of ``fair and equitable.''

1. Should regulations require institutions to publicize how

&bull;Regulations should require institutions to publicize

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Institutions should not have to publicize how refunds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be processed and what funds students are entitled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to receive in the event the institution closes. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not a consumer information issue. This is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information to be disbursed if the institution closes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information should be available to students upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request. A statement could be put in the catalog that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will lead the student to ask relevant questions. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department should work with State Agencies to develop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plans that should be made available to students on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request. There is very little probability that certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strong institutions will close. All institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should not be required to disclose this.

deterrent to default on the small remaining amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This should be done at the institution's discretion.

Institutions should not be required to pay back money

they have not received, i.e., guaranty and origination

fees. Institution should be permitted to include these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fees if they choose. [San Francisco]

5. How should the guaranty agencies monitor students to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

&bull;Guaranty agency monitoring of students to ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multiple FFEL funds are treated as one for the purpose

of billing and deferments from one lender should be

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community's views: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. What information should the Secretary require on the form to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplement the specific information required by the statute? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Information should include documentation of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's accreditation or preaccreditation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degree-granting authority, authority to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
postsecondary education, and State licensure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;With one exception, participants were satisfied that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information currently collected on the Department's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application forms is adequate, and new requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would needlessly add burden. One participant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended a separate application for proprietary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Specific categories should be established for different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
types of institutions and academic functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information should include the names and social 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
security numbers of key administrative personnel and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
board members. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Provided that new information required by statute is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collected (financial statements, description of student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aid processing at the institution, information on main 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and branch campuses, and information on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's third-party servicers), information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently collected is sufficient. However, additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information should be collected on whether an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's owner has had substantial control over a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closed institution that owes refunds to students or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lenders. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Should the Audit Guide be revised to require the auditor to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verify the information on the application form? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Participants recommended no changes in the audit guide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[Kansas City, New York, San Francisco, Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A minority of participants indicated that there should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be changes, without specifying what changes are needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Section 498(c)(1) addresses financial responsibilities and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires an institution to show that it is able to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promised services, to provide administrative resources necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to Title IV duties, and the meet all of its financial obligations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including refunds and repayments to the Secretary for Title IV 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liabilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community's views: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. What information should be required from an institution to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit the Secretary to determine that the institution provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the services described in its official publications and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;No additional information needs to be collected from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions. [Kansas City, San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If the Secretary needs additional information, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary should be able to collect it from data made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available through State and accrediting functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[Kansas City, New York, Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The best way to obtain information would be through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site visits. [New York, Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Department needs to take action on institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with failing financial statements, rather than simply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collect them. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The establishment of uniform financial standards would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be difficult, because different standards need to apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to different types of institutions. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

2. What supporting information should be submitted to establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that an institution has the administrative resources to comply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with its program responsibilities? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The financial information concerning each branch campus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an institution should be evaluated, without simply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relying on the financial information of an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a whole. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Employee biographies with social security numbers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be provided. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. What level of financial resources are needed to demonstrate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that an institution can meet potential refund and repayment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligations, and should institutions be required to set aside 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds for these purposes? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An institution should be able to provide for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment of refunds that could occur over a 30-day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period, but the institution should not be required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
set aside funds specifically for this purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The statutory provisions for institutions to maintain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cash reserves unless they are covered by State tuition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery plans should be sufficient. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;No requirements are necessary. The Department should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have the discretion to review and establish amounts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when necessary. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. Section 498(c)(2) requires that, notwithstanding section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
498(c)(1), if an institution fails to meet the criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prescribed by the Secretary with respect to operating losses, net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
worth, asset-to-liabilities ratios, or operating fund deficits, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution must provide the Secretary with satisfactory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence of its financial responsibility in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 498(c)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community's views: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. What standards should be set for each of these criteria? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;One standard should not be applicable to all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Institutions should be allowed to explain their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial statements before decisions in this area are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reached. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The institutions financial condition should be examined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over a certain time period so that decisions regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its financial responsibility are based on a trend. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Department should particularly consider an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's statement of cash flow. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Ratios that are used to measure stability in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business world should be used. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Current standards should be used with Departmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discretion. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Standards for these criteria should be: a ratio of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assets to liabilities of 1:1, showing a positive net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
worth, and not having two consecutive years of negative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating cash flow or its equivalent for fund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accounting purposes. These should be indicators of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial responsibility, not absolute minimums. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importance of each criteria should be given its proper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weight. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. Section 498(c)(3) provides that the Secretary may find an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to be financially responsible, notwithstanding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failure under 498(c)(1) and 498(c)(2), if the institution; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Provides third-party guarantees of at least one-half of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual potential liabilities, (2) is backed by the full faith and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit of a State or its equivalent, (3) establishes that it is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
going concern capable of meeting all its obligations, or (4) has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
met comparable standards set by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community's views: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. What type of third-party guarantees will be acceptable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Acceptable third-party guarantees should include bonds, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutional collateral, or a tuition recovery fund. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Acceptable third-party guarantees should include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance bonds, letters of credit, or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comparable instruments. [Kansas City, Atlanta]

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
&bull;Acceptable third-party guarantees should include performance bonds, letters of credit, third-party escrow
arrangements, and certificates of deposit. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Under what conditions will each type of instrument be used? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;These measures should be used for institutions that close or institutions that don't properly repay any required
refunds. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;These measures should be used only if the institution can find no other way to prove its financial status. The
institution should have an opportunity to negotiate with the Department before the third-party guarantees are imposed.
[Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;These measures should be used anytime the Secretary determines that the institution is not meeting its financial
responsibilities. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;These measures should be used if an institution fails to satisfy a liability established by the Secretary after
an administrative review process. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. How does the Secretary determine the amount equal to one-half of the annual potential liabilities of an institution,
which is the minimum guarantee amount? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;This should be determined based on the institution's retention or refund history. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The annual potential liability should be defined as the sum of the difference between charges paid by the student
(regardless of the source of payment) and the pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 amounts earned by the institution according to its applicable refund policy. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The annual potential liability should be based upon the institution's annual Title IV funds multiplied by
one-half of its withdrawal rate. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. What standards will be used to determine when guarantees in excess of the minimum amount will be required for an institution
that fails to demonstrate financial responsibility? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Guarantees in excess of the minimum amount should be required if the institution must also have funds to make
teach out arrangements. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Guarantees in excess of the minimum amount should not be imposed. [Kansas City, Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Guarantees in excess of the minimum amount should be required when the institution cannot meet its current
financial obligations. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. How can an institution that does not demonstrate financial responsibility otherwise show that it is capable of
meeting all of its financial obligations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;All factors must be analyzed as a whole. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Department should use the process used by accrediting agencies to determine financial responsibility.
[New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Institutions should be considered financially responsible if they are on reimbursement. [Kansas City, Atlanta]

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Institutions should be considered financially responsible if they are funded through an escrow arrangement.
[San Francisco, Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. Section 498(c)(4) provides that the determination that an institution has met certain standards of financial
responsibility will be based on an audited and certified financial statement, done in accordance with standards
of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Additional audits may be required.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. When would the Secretary require additional audits, and what additional items should be required for such audits?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Department should be able to request a more detailed audit of a particular segment of the audited financial
statement. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Department should take into account the cost of requests for additional information. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Department should be able to request the more frequent submission of audited financial statements in cases
of fraud, abuse, or a negative program review finding. For additional submissions requested at the Secretary's discretion,
it is suggested that the Secretary be willing to look at something other than a full audited financial statement. [Kansas
City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;At the discretion of the Secretary, additional reports could include CPA prepared 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
pro forma 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
statements, cash forecasts, enrollment forecasts, and operating budgets with comparisons of actual to budget.
[San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;There should be no need for interim reports since they are now required annually. If interim information is
requested, it should be unaudited. However, if an institution is seeking relief from a previously imposed fiscal
restriction before its next scheduled statement, the interim statement should be audited. [Atlanta]

2. What guidelines and time periods should be set for provisional certification? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Each institution should be treated on a case-by-case basis subject to the Secretary's discretion. [New York]

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A two-year time period should be used for provisional certification. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The time period should not exceed three-years and the institution should have the ability to achieve full certification
sooner. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F. Section 498(c)(5) provides that an institution must maintain sufficient cash reserves to ensure repayment of
any required refunds. Institutions that participate in and contribute to a State tuition recovery fund would be exempt
from this requirement.

: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. What are sufficient cash reserves? How are they measured, what types of funds may be included, and how are they protected
from use for other purposes? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Sufficient cash reserves should be defined as a certain percent of unearned tuition based on the institution's
refund history and established only when there is an indication of a problem or high-risk institution. This could
be part of provisional certification. [New York]

&bull;Sufficient cash reserves should be defined as 100 percent of any unearned tuition liability from Title IV awards.
A minority of the group thought an amount to cover loans where the loan guarantee might be invalidated because of fraud
should also be included. Cash reserves should include cash, accounts receivable, and liquid assets that can be converted
to cash within 30 days. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If the institution has been timely (60 days) in processing refunds for one year, no cash reserves should be required.
If the institution has not been timely, an increasing percentage should be reserved based on the total Title IV funds
processed by the institution. The regulations should be written to provide incentives for institutions with a good
performance record. The Department should take into account whether the refunds were delinquent because of personnel
problems as compared to a poor financial position. When an institution is required to reserve cash, any earnings should
accrue to the institution. Letters of credit should be permitted as a substitute for a cash reserve. [San Francisco]

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A cash reserve is sufficient if it equals anticipated refund to be paid during a 30 day period based on the average
of refunds paid during the preceding 12 month period. Cash reserves are defined as cash and cash equivalents plus other
current assets that can be converted to cash within 30 days. Segregation of the cash reserve is not required by law nor
is it desirable. [Atlanta]

2. What are the components of a state tuition recovery fund that demonstrates that an institution contributing to
the fund will be able to pay refunds? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If an institution contributes to a State tuition recovery fund they should be exempt automatically from this
requirement. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The components of a State tuition recovery fund that will demonstrate that an institution contributing to
the fund will be able to pay refunds are those tuition recovery components that will pay a lender the required refund
and/or pay the student the required refund. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. What information must institutions provide to permit the Secretary to determine that an institution will be able
to use the tuition recovery fund to pay refunds if the institution itself is unable to do so? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An institution should provide a letter from the State that confirms that they will be able to use the State tuition
recovery fund to pay refunds. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An institution should provide a description of the legal structure of the fund and audited financial statements
so the Secretary may determine that the institution will be able to use the tuition recovery fund. [San Francisco]

tuition recovery funds if that meets the requirements that permit

an institution's participation in that fund to operate in lieu of

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[New York, San Francisco, Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

G. Section 498(d) authorizes the Secretary to establish

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. What measures of past performance will be used, and what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time periods should be included in the review? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;No other standards of administrative capability or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial responsibility should be considered. There 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is an inundation of oversight responsibility and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements placed on institutions is sufficient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[Kansas City, San Francisco, Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In certain cases, institutional administrators should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet a minimum experience requirement (e.g., five years 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of prior experience in administration.) [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;School owners, corporate directors and officers, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the chief school administrator should be required to

monitor and investigate school compliance, take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whatever steps are within the person's authority to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect the correction of non-compliance, and report to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Department, the accrediting agency, and the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensing agency any non-compliance that has not been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrected. California law requires this.

[San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The current &sect;668.14 and &sect;668.15 should be used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measure administrative capability with the exception of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the withdrawal rates. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A minority of the group recommended that the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
look into all complaints filed against institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the local law enforcement authorities even though 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the complaint may not warrant pulling of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's license or loss of accreditation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Department should look at the past two audits to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
see that performance reviews have corrected all the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies as a basis that the institution is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administratively capable. This should not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined arbitrarily, but should be determined by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Research data is needed to establish a basis for past 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance. Other measures of past performance that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be used: Placement, default and withdrawal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates, past performance reviews and implementation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendations, personnel turnover, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
faculty/student ratio. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Default rates, course completion and withdrawal rates, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and job placement rates must be considered together. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These should be triggers that, in certain combinations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should cause more review of administrative capability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mitigating circumstances must be considered.

applicable to all institutions. No new standards

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Student or consumer complaints against an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be taken into consideration if a pattern of

legitimate complaints indicate a need for review by an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outside entity. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;There should be no standard measure of an institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative capability with respect to student or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer complaints against an institution. The

Department should review trends and the nature of

complaints. [San Francisco]

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Should the Secretary adopt rules addressing the length of a

period of eligibility and if so what should these standards be?

&bull;Any schedule developed for the review of institutions

for this purpose should be published. [New York]

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Regulations and standards in this area are not

necessary; the statute is specific enough.

[San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In cases where the eligibility process requires a site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
visit, and the Secretary is unable to perform the site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
visit in a timely manner, eligibility should continue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beyond the expiration date until the eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process is completed. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Section 498(h) provides that the Secretary may provisionally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certify an institution for not more than one year for initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification, or three years under certain conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provisional certification may be withdrawn if the institution is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unable to meet its responsibilities. Also, if an accrediting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's recognition is withdrawn, the Secretary may continue the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility of accredited institutions for up to 18 months.

Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community's views: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. What standards should be used to determine whether an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution may be granted provisionally certification? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An institution could be provisionally certified if it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not meet the third criterion for financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility in section 498(c) of the HEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;For an initial application, the Secretary should rely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the statutory language. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An institution should be provisionally certified if it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is unable to meet a regulatory standard for a reason 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beyond the institution's control. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Secretary should use the same standards that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used for determining financial responsibility and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative capability. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An institution that meets all requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification other than the completion of a required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site visit should be provisionally certified if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary is unable to conduct the site visit in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timely manner. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. What procedures and standards should the Secretary use to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decide whether an institution that has received provisional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification is unable to meet its responsibilities? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Before revoking an institution's participation, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary should conduct proceedings for a hearing, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should provisionally certify an institution until the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completion of those proceedings. [New York] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Secretary should use the same standards that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used for determining financial responsibility and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative capability. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Secretary should use the results of audits, audited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial statements, and program reviews to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether to certify an institution provisionally and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conduct a site visit at the institution. [Atlanta] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Under what circumstances should the Secretary continue the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility of accredited institutions where their accrediting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency loses its recognition? Should the period of extension be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the same for all institutions? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;According to a minority of participants, an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified as having administrative capability problems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be provisionally certified for no more than one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year. [Kansas City] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;All institutions should be provisionally certified for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18 months, and the Secretary should ensure that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process is available for such institutions to become 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accredited by another agency. [San Francisco] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Eligibility should be continued in all cases and for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the same period of time for all institutions. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary should notify an institution promptly of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's action, the institution should promptly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply for accreditation with another agency and notify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution of that fact, and the institution

should make a good-faith effort to expedite its

accreditation. [Atlanta]
