SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Forest Service will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to document the analysis and disclose the
environmental impacts of proposed actions to salvage harvest timber and improve productivity of stands of trees
in portions of the Muddy Creek, Twelvemile Creek, Sixmile Creek, and Ferron Creek Drainages. The project is located
approximately 10 air miles southeast of Manti, Utah.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The entire proposal area involves some 30,000 acres of which approximately 10,000 acres is forested with an Engelmann
spruce cover type. A bark beetle epidemic has affected the major portion of this type. the need for the proposal is established
by the silvicultural condition of the affected timber stands and forest goals as outlined in the Manti-La Sal National
Forest Land and Resource Management Plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Six areas that were inventoried as roadless as part of the RARE II evaluation are adjacent to and in some cases overlap
the proposal. These areas were released back to full Multiple Use management by the Utah Wilderness Act and were evaluated
for a variety of designations in the Forest's analysis during the Forest Land and Resource Plan process which was completed
in 1986. The current analysis will document effects that would substantially alter the undeveloped character of
these areas.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This EIS will tier to the final EIS for the Manti-La Sal National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan).
The Manti-La Sal Forest Plan provides the overall guidance (Goals, Objectives, Standards, and Management Area Direction)
to achieve the Desired Future Condition for the area being analyzed, and contains specific management area prescriptions
for the entire Forest.

A National forest Management Act Analysis for this proposal was completed in 1993. As a result of that analysis and
additional scoping the Manti-La Sal concluded the proposal may have a significant effect on the roadless character
of some of the surrounding areas, and because of the scope of the project size it was decided to prepare this EIS. The
previous scoping and analysis also identified the following potential issues related to the proposed action:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
What will be the effects of the proposal on the habitats, behavior, and local population of certain wildlife species?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
What effect will the proposed activities have on the access, quality, and safety of the recreational opportunities
of the area?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
How will the proposal alter the present visual quality?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
What will be the effects of the proposal on cultural resources?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
How will potential build up of dead, down, woody, ground fuels be effected by the proposal?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
How will the proposal contribute to a healthy, productive forest that will economically provide timber for the market
place on a sustainable basis for the present and the future?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
What effect will the proposal have on the transportation systems presently serving the area?

The Forest Service is seeking information and comments from Federal, State, and local agencies as well as individuals
and organizations who may be interested in, or affected by the proposed action. The Forest Service invites written
comments and suggestions on the issues related to the proposal and the area being analyzed. Information received
will be used in preparation of the Draft EIS and Final EIS. For most effective use, comments should be submitted to the
Forest Service within 30 days from the date of publication of this Notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Preparation of the EIS will include the following steps:

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Define the purpose of and need for action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Identify potential issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Eliminate issues of minor importance or those that have been covered by previous and relevant environmental analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Select issues to be analyzed in depth.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Identify reasonable alternatives to the proposed action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Describe the affected environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Identify the potential environmental effects of the alternatives.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Steps 2, 3, and 4 will be completed through the scoping process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Step 5 will consider a range of alternatives developed from the key issues. One of these will be the ``No Action'' alternative.
Other alternatives will consider various methods, levels and locations of harvest, regeneration, and related road
development/improvement in response to issues, and non-timber objectives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Step 6 will describe the physical attributes of the area to be affected by this proposal, with special attention to
the environmental factors that could be adversely affected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Step 7 will analyze the environmental effects of each alternative. This analysis will be consistent with management
direction outlined in the Forest Plan. The direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of each alternative will be analyzed
and documented. In addition, the site specific mitigation measures for each alternative will be identified and the
effectiveness of these mitigation measures will be disclosed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The approximate boundary of the area covered for this analysis will be from the southern Forest boundary along White
Mountain north along Skyline Drive to the Ferron and Sixmile drainages.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed management activities would be administered by the Sanpete and Ferron Ranger Districts of the Manti-La
Sal National Forest in Sanpete and Sevier Counties, Utah.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency representatives and other interested people are invited to visit with Forest Service officials at any time
during the EIS process. Two specific time periods are identified for the receipt of formal comments on the analysis.
The two comment periods are, (1) during the scoping process, the next 30 days following publication of this Notice
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and (2) during the formal review period of the Draft EIS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Draft EIS is estimated to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and available for public review
in June, 1994. At this time the EPA will publish an availability notice of the Draft EIS in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The comment period on the Draft EIS will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection Agency's notice of availability
appears in the Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. It is very important that those interested in this proposed action participate at that time. To be the most helpful,
comments on the Draft EIS should be as specific as possible and may address the adequacy of the statement or the merits
of the alternatives discussed (See The Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural
provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, Federal court decisions have established that reviewers of draft environmental impact statements
must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts
an agency to the reviewers' position and contentions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns related to the proposed action, comments
on the Draft EIS should be as specific as possible. Referring to specific pages or chapters of the Draft EIS is most helpful.
Comments may also address the adequacy of the Draft EIS or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed
in the statement. (Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing
the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act, 40 CFR 1503.3, in addressing these points.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final EIS is expected to be released September 16, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Forest Supervisor for the Manti-La Sal National Forest, who is the responsible official for the EIS, will then
make a decision regarding this proposal, after considering the comments, responses, and environmental consequences
discussed in the Final Environmental Impact Statement, and applicable laws, regulations, and policies. The reasons
for the decision will be documented in a Record of Decisions.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In response to requests from interested parties, the Department of Commerce has conducted administrative reviews
of the antidumping duty orders on antifriction bearings (other than tapered roller bearings) and parts thereof from
France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Singapore, Sweden, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. The classes or kinds of merchandise
covered by these orders are ball bearings, cylindrical roller bearings, and spherical plain bearings. The reviews
cover 38 manufacturers/exporters and the period May 1, 1992, through April 30, 1993 (the POR). Although we initiated
reviews for nine other manufacturers/exporters, we are terminating the reviews because the requests for these reviews
were withdrawn in a timely manner. As a result of these reviews, the Department has preliminarily determined the weighted-average
dumping margins for the reviewed firms to range from 0.37 percent to 132.25 percent for BBs, from zero to 51.82 percent
for CRBs, and from zero to 92.00 percent for SPBs.

Specifically, these orders cover BBs, CRBs, and SPBs from France, Germany, and Japan; BBs and CRBs from Italy, Sweden,
and the U.K.; and BBs from Singapore and Thailand. On June 28, 1993, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(c)(1993), we initiated
administrative reviews of those orders for the period May 1, 1992, through April 30, 1993 (58 FR 34563). The Department
is now conducting these administrative reviews in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended
(the Tariff Act). These reviews cover the following firms and classes or kinds of merchandise:

Subsequent to the publication of our initiation notice, we received timely withdrawals of review requests for INA
(France), SNECMA (France and Italy), Asahi Seiko (Japan), Fujino Iron Works (Japan), Tottori Yamakei Bearing Seisakusho
(Japan), and Revolvo (U.K.). Because there were no other requests for review of these companies from any other interested
parties, we are terminating the reviews with respect to these companies, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(a)(5).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On January 13, 1994, GMN also requested that the Department allow GMN to withdraw its request for review and terminate
the review of the order on BBs from Germany with respect to GMN. Although its request to withdraw was submitted well
after the deadline for doing so, GMN claimed that the circumstances of the firm's bankruptcy rendered it unable to
proceed further with the review. After giving careful consideration to GMN's circumstances, we find that it would
be inappropriate to terminate the review. GMN's request to terminate the review was submitted during the verification
process, which is an advanced stage of the review process, and at a point at which it had become clear that the company
would be unable to complete verification successfully. Furthermore, a domestic interested party objected to termination
of the review at that stage. Therefore, we are not terminating the review of GMN.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, we initiated reviews for SST Bearing Corp. (SST), and Peer International (Peer) with respect to subject
merchandise from Japan. SST informed us that it neither produced AFBs in Japan nor exported Japanese-produced bearings
to the United States. Peer informed us that although it is a reseller of Japanese-made bearings, all of its suppliers
had knowledge at the time of sale that the merchandise was destined for the United States. Consequently, Peer is not
a reseller as defined in 19 CFR 353.2(s) because its sales cannot be used to calculate the U.S. price. Therefore, we
are preliminarily terminating the reviews with respect to SST and Peer. If we obtain any information that contradicts
these companies' assertions, we will complete the reviews with respect to these companies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Best Information Available
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In accordance with section 776(c) of the Tariff Act, we have preliminarily determined that the use of best information
available (BIA) is appropriate for certain firms. The Department's regulations provide that we may take into account
whether a party refuses to provide information in determining what is the best information available (19 CFR 353.37(b)).
For purposes of these reviews and in accordance with past Commerce practice, we have used the most adverse BIA_generally
the highest rate for any company for the class or kind of merchandise from the same country from this or any prior segment
of the proceeding, including the less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation_whenever a company refused to cooperate
with the Department or otherwise significantly impeded the proceeding. When a company substantially cooperated
with our requests for information, but failed to provide all information requested in a timely manner or in the form
requested, we used as BIA the higher of (1) the highest rate (including the ``all others'' rate) ever applicable to
the firm for the same class or kind of merchandise from the same country from either the LTFV investigation or a prior
administrative review; or (2) the highest calculated rate in this review for any firm for the class or kind of merchandise
from the same country (see Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews and Revocation in Part of an Antidumping
Duty Order, 58 FR 39728 (July 26, 1993)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because Franke &amp; Heydrich, General Bearing Corp., and SNFA failed to respond to the Department's questionnaire,
we have used the highest rate ever found for each relevant class or kind of merchandise and country of origin. Also,
because GMN had substantially cooperated with our requests for information, but was unable to complete verification,
we used as BIA its highest previous rate, in this case the rate from the LTFV investigation.

Intent to Revoke
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The following firms have submitted requests, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.25(b), to revoke the orders covering the
indicated merchandise:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In accordance with 19 CFR 353.25(a)(2)(iii), these requests were accompanied by certifications from the firms that
they had not sold the relevant class or kind of merchandise at less than fair value for a three-year period including
this review period, and will not do so in the future. Each of these firms also agreed to its immediate reinstatement
in the relevant antidumping orders, as long as it is subject to those orders, if the Department concludes under 19 CFR
353.22(f) that, subsequent to revocation, it sold the subject merchandise at less than fair value.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the two prior reviews of these orders, we determined that SPBs from France sold by SKF, BBs from Germany sold by NTN
Kugellagerfabrik and GMN, CRBs from Italy sold by SKF, and BBs, CRBs, and SPBs from Japan sold by Honda were not sold
at less than fair value. In this review, we preliminarily determine that these firms, with the exception of NTN Germany
and GMN, have not sold these products at less than fair value, which will satisfy the three-year period of no sales at
less than fair value, if these preliminary findings are affirmed in our final results. Therefore, we intend to revoke
the orders with respect to the following firms and merchandise:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
With respect to SPBs from Japan sold by NTN and BBs from Germany sold by NTN and GMN, we have not established that there
has been a three-year period of sales at not less than fair value. The final results of the previous administrative
review indicated the existence of dumping margins on NTN's sales of SPBs from Japan (see Final Results of Antidumping
Duty Administrative Reviews and Revocation in Part of an Antidumping Duty Order, 58 FR 39729, July 26, 1993). In addition,
we preliminarily determine in this review that there are dumping margins on NTN's sales of BBs from Germany. Therefore,
we do not intend to revoke the orders on SPBs from Japan with respect to NTN or on BBs from Germany with respect to NTN.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concerning GMN, as BIA, (see ``Best Information Available'' section above), we have preliminarily determined that
dumping margins exist on GMN's sales of BBs from Germany during the 1992&hyph;93 review period. Furthermore, on February
10, 1994, the company withdrew its request for revocation. Therefore, we do not intend to revoke the order on BBs from
Germany with respect to GMN.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In calculating United States price (USP), the Department used purchase price (PP) or exporter's sales price (ESP),
as defined in section 772 of the Tariff Act, as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to the extremely large number of transactions that occurred during the POR and the resulting administrative burden
involved in calculating individual margins for all of these transactions, we sampled sales to calculate USP, in accordance
with section 777A of the Tariff Act. When a firm made more than 2,000 ESP sales transactions to the United States for
a particular class or kind of merchandise, we reviewed ESP sales which occurred during sample weeks. We selected one
week from each two-month period in the review period, for a total of six weeks, and analyzed each transaction made in
those six weeks. The sample weeks included May 31&hyph;June 6, 1992; July 26&hyph;August 1, 1992; October 18&hyph;24,
1992; November 22&hyph;28, 1992; February 14&hyph;20, 1993; and April 18&hyph;24, 1993. We reviewed all PP sales
transactions during the POR because there were few PP sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States price was based on the packed f.o.b., c.i.f., or delivered price to unrelated purchasers in, or for exportation
to, the United States. We made deductions, as appropriate, from PP and ESP for movement expenses, discounts and rebates.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We made additional deductions from ESP for direct selling expenses, indirect selling expenses, and repacking in
the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We made an addition to USP for value-added taxes (VAT) in accordance with section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Tariff Act. In
making our adjustment for VAT, we followed the instructions of the United States Court of International Trade (CIT)
in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Federal Mogul Corp. and The Torrington Co.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
United States,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Slip Op. 93&hyph;194 (CIT October 7, 1993). The Department added to USP the result of multiplying the foreign market
tax rate by the price of the United States merchandise at the same point in the chain of commerce that the foreign market
tax was applied to foreign market sales. The Department also adjusted the tax amount calculated for USP and the amount
of tax included in foreign market value (FMV). We deducted the portions of the foreign market tax and the USP tax that
are the result of expenses that are included in the foreign market price used to calculate foreign market tax and in
the United States price used to calculate the USP tax. Because these expenses are later deducted to calculate FMV and
USP, these adjustments are necessary to prevent our new methodology for calculating the USP tax from creating dumping
margins where no margins would exist if no taxes were levied upon foreign market sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to subject merchandise to which value was added in the United States, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 parts of bearings that were imported and further processed into finished bearings by U.S. affiliates of foreign exporters,
prior to sale to unrelated U.S. customers, we deducted any increased value in accordance with section 772(e)(3) of
the Tariff Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those bearings otherwise subject to the order that are incorporated into nonbearing products, which collectively
comprise less than one percent of the value of the finished products sold to unrelated customers in the United States,
are not subject to the assessment of antidumping duties. In Roller Chain, Other Than Bicycle, from Japan (48 FR 51801;
November 14, 1983), roller chain, which was subject to an antidumping duty order, was imported by a related party and
incorporated into finished motorcycles. The finished motorcycles were the first articles of commerce sold by the
subject producer to unrelated purchasers in the United States. Because the roller chain did not constitute a significant
percentage of the value of the completed product, the Department found that a USP could not reasonably be determined
for the roller chain. The Department, therefore, did not assess dumping duties on these transactions. We have applied
this same principle to these reviews.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The home market was viable for all companies and all classes or kinds of merchandise. The Department used home market
prices or constructed value (CV), as defined in section 773 of the Tariff Act, as appropriate, to calculate foreign
market value (FMV). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to the extremely large number of transactions that occurred during the POR and the resulting administrative burden
involved in examining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all of these transactions, we sampled sales to calculate FMV, in accordance with section 777A of the Tariff Act. When
a firm had more than 2,000 home market sales transactions for a particular class or kind of merchandise, we used sales
from sample months that corresponded to the sample weeks selected for U.S. sales sampling plus one contemporaneous
month prior to the POR and one following the POR. The sample months included March, June, July, October, and November
of 1992, and February, April, and June of 1993.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, the Department relies on monthly weighted-average prices in the calculation of FMV in administrative
reviews. Because of the significant volume of home market sales involved in these reviews, we examined whether it
was appropriate to average, in accordance with section 777A of the Tariff Act, all of each respondent's home market
sales on an annual basis. In this case, the use of POR weighted-average prices results in significant time and resource
savings for the Department. To determine whether a POR weighted-average price was representative of the transactions
under consideration, we performed a three-step test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We first compared each monthly weighted-average home market price for each model with the weighted-average POR price
of that model. We calculated the proportion of each model's sales whose POR weighted-average price did not vary meaningfully
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 was within plus or minus 10 percent) from the monthly weighted-average prices. We did this for each model within each
class or kind of merchandise. We then compared the volume of sales of all models within each class or kind of merchandise
whose POR weighted-average price did not vary meaningfully from the monthly weighted-average price with the total
volume of sales of that class or kind of merchandise. If the POR weighted-average price of at least 90 percent of sales
in each class or kind of merchandise did not vary meaningfully from the monthly weighted-average price, we considered
the POR weighted-average prices to be representative of the transactions under consideration. Finally, we tested
whether there was any correlation between fluctuations in price and time for the home market sales. Where the correlation
coefficient was less than 0.05 (where a coefficient approaching 1.0 means a direct relation between price and time,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that prices consistently rise from month to month, and a coefficient approaching zero means no relation between prices
and time), we concluded that there was no significant relation between price and time. We calculated a weighted-average
POR FMV only for those classes or kinds that satisfied our three-step test for the factors of price, volume, and time.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We compared U.S. sales with sales of such or similar merchandise in the home market. We considered all non-identical
products within a bearing family to be equally similar. As defined in the questionnaire, a bearing family consists
of all bearings within a class or kind of merchandise that are the same in the following physical characteristics:
load direction, bearing design, number of rows of rolling elements, precision rating, dynamic load rating, and outer
diameter, inner diameter, and width. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Home market prices were based on the packed, ex-factory or delivered prices to related or unrelated purchasers in
the home market. Where applicable, we made adjustments for movement expenses, differences in cost attributable
to differences in physical characteristics of the merchandise, and differences in packing. We also made adjustments
for differences in circumstances of sale in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56. For comparisons to PP sales, we deducted
home market direct selling expenses and added U.S. direct selling expenses. For comparisons to ESP sales, we deducted
home market direct selling expenses. We also made adjustments, where applicable, for home market indirect selling
expenses to offset U.S. commissions in PP and ESP calculations and to offset U.S. indirect selling expenses deducted
in ESP calculations, but not exceeding the amount of the indirect U.S. expenses. For comparisons to both ESP and PP
sales, we adjusted for VAT using the methodology detailed in the ``United States Price'' section of this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We used sales to related customers only where we determined such sales were made at arm's length, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at prices comparable to prices at which the firm sold identical merchandise to unrelated customers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where we found home market sales below the cost of production in the previous administrative review period, we concluded
that reasonable grounds exist to believe or suspect that home market sales during the POR were made at prices below
the cost of production, and we therefore initiated cost investigations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 773(b) of the Tariff Act, in determining whether to disregard home market sales made at
prices below the cost of production, we examined whether such sales were made in substantial quantities over an extended
period of time. When less than 10 percent of the home market sales of a particular model were at prices below the cost
of production, we found that substantial quantities of such sales were not made and did not disregard any sales of that
model. When 10 percent or more, but not more than 90 percent, of the home market sales of a particular model were determined
to be below cost, we determined that substantial quantities of such sales were made and excluded the below-cost home
market sales from our calculation of FMV provided that these below-cost sales were made over an extended period of
time. When more than 90 percent of the home market sales of a particular model were made below cost over an extended period
of time, we disregarded all home market sales of that model from our calculation of FMV and went to CV. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To determine if sales below cost had been made over an extended period of time, we compared the number of months in which
sales below cost had occurred for a particular model to the number of months in which the model was sold. If the model
was sold in three or fewer months, we did not find that below-cost sales were made over an extended period of time unless
there were sales below cost of that model in each month. If a model was sold in more than three months, we did not find that
below-cost sales were made over an extended period of time unless there were sales below cost in at least three of the
months in which the model was sold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since none of the respondents has submitted information indicating that any of its sales below cost were at prices
which would have permitted ``recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time in the normal course of trade,''
within the meaning of section 773(b)(2) of the Tariff Act, we were unable to conclude that the costs of production of
such sales were recovered within a reasonable period. As a result, we disregarded below-cost sales when the conditions
described above were met.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Home market sales of obsolete merchandise and distress sales were not disregarded in our cost analysis unless there
was documented information on the record demonstrating that such sales were outside the ordinary course of trade.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to FAG Germany, we disregarded certain sales reported by the company in its home market database. The
disregarded sales pertain to two unrelated German resellers of FAG bearings. Although FAG reported that it did not
know whether these resellers sold its bearings in Germany or abroad, we preliminarily determine, based on the following
information obtained at verification, that FAG, at a minimum, should have known that the two resellers would export
its bearings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At verification, we found that FAG referred, both orally and in its records, to these resellers as ``indirect exporters.''
We learned that one FAG subsidiary sold to one of these resellers from its export price list, rather than from its domestic
price list. Finally, we contacted one of the resellers independently and were told that it only sells in export markets
and that its suppliers were aware of this. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During verification, we inquired of other German producers/exporters about potential sales to ``indirect exporters.''
We did not obtain conclusive evidence that reported home market sales were in fact export sales. However, if we obtain
additional information indicating that other producers reported home market sales that we ultimately conclude
were export sales, we will delete these sales from their home market databases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 773(a)(2) of the Tariff Act, we used constructed value as the basis for FMV when there were
no usable sales of such or similar merchandise for comparison. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We calculated CV in accordance with section 773(e) of the Tariff Act. We included the cost of materials, fabrication,
general expenses, profit and packing. To calculate CV we used: (1) actual general expenses, or the statutory minimum
of 10 percent of materials and fabrication, whichever was greater; (2) actual profit or the statutory minimum of 8
percent of materials, fabrication costs and general expenses, whichever was greater; and (3) packing costs for merchandise
exported to the United States. Where appropriate, we made adjustments to CV in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56, for differences
in circumstances of sale. For comparisons to PP sales, we deducted home market direct selling expenses and added U.S.
direct selling expenses. For comparisons to ESP sales, we deducted home market direct selling expenses. We also made
adjustments, where applicable, for home market indirect selling expenses to offset U.S. commissions in PP and ESP
calculations. For comparisons involving ESP transactions, we made further deductions for constructed value for
indirect selling expenses in the home market, capped by the indirect selling expenses incurred on ESP sales in accordance
with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(2).

The Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries.
Because sampling prevents calculation of duties on an entry-by-entry basis, we will

calculate an importer-specific

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 duty assessment rate for each class or kind of merchandise based on the ratio of the total value of antidumping duties
calculated for the examined sales made during the POR to the total customs value of the sales used to calculate those
duties. This rate will be assessed uniformly on all entries of that particular importer made during the POR. (This
is equivalent to dividing the total value of antidumping duties, which are calculated by taking the difference between
statutory FMV and statutory USP, by the total statutory USP value of the sales compared, and adjusting the result by
the average difference between USP and customs value for all merchandise examined during the POR.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 rate, we will calculate an average per-unit dollar amount of antidumping duty based on all sales examined during the
POR. We will instruct the Customs Service to assess this average amount on all units included in each entry made by the
particular importer during the POR. The Department will issue appropriate appraisement instructions directly
to the Customs Service upon completion of these reviews.

Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise
entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of the final results of these
administrative reviews, as provided by section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act: (1) the cash deposit rates for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewed companies will be those rates established in the final results of these reviews; (2) for previously reviewed
or investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the company-specific rate published
for the most recent period; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this review, a prior review, or the original LTFV
investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent period
for the manufacturer of the merchandise; and (4) the cash deposit rate for all other manufacturers or exporters will
continue to be the ``all others'' rate made effective by the final results of the most recent administrative reviews
of the orders (see Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews and Revocation in Part of an Antidumping
Duty Order, 58 FR 39729, July 26, 1993). As noted in those previous final results, these rates are the ``all others''
rates from the relevant LTFV investigations. These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until
publication of the final results of the next administrative reviews. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice also serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file
a certificate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review
period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These administrative reviews and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On July 26, 1993, the Department of Commerce published the final results of its administrative reviews of the antidumping
duty orders on antifriction bearings (other than tapered roller bearings) and parts thereof from France, Germany,
Italy, Japan, Romania, Singapore, Sweden, Thailand and the United Kingdom. The classes or kinds of merchandise covered
by these reviews are ball bearings and parts thereof, cylindrical roller bearings and parts thereof, and spherical
plain bearings and parts thereof. The reviews covered 41 manufacturers/exporters and the period May 1, 1991 through
April 30, 1992. Based on the correction of ministerial errors, we are amending the final results with respect to Japanese
ball bearings, cylindrical roller bearings and spherical plain bearings sold by one company.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 26, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the final results of its administrative reviews of the antidumping duty orders on antifriction bearings (other than
tapered roller bearings) and parts thereof (AFBs) from France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Romania, Singapore, Sweden,
Thailand and the United Kingdom (58 FR 39729). The classes or kinds of merchandise covered by these reviews were ball
bearings and parts thereof (BBs), cylindrical roller bearings and parts thereof (CRBs), and spherical plain bearings
and parts thereof (SPBs). The reviews covered 41 manufacturers/exporters and the period May 1, 1991 through April
30, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After publication of our final results, we received timely allegations of ministerial errors from Honda Motor Company
concerning the final results for AFBs from Japan sold by Honda. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We agree with one of these allegations and have made the necessary correction. Specifically, Honda had submitted
two sets of home market data. Although we had intended in our final results to use only certain portions of each of these
datasets, we used the wrong portions in our final results. We have therefore corrected our analysis by using the correct
portions of Honda's submitted home market datasets.

Amended Final Results of Reviews 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of our corrections of ministerial errors, we have determined the following percentage weighted-average
margins to exist for the period May 1, 1991 through April 30, 1992:

The Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries.
Individual differences between United States price and foreign market value may vary from the percentages stated
above. The Department will issue appraisement instructions on each exporter directly to the Customs Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for cash deposit purposes, the Department will require a cash deposit of zero for all entries of the above merchandise
from Honda. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These deposit requirements are effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise entered, or withdrawn from
warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of this notice and shall remain in effect until publication
of the final results of the next administrative reviews. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice also serves as a reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate

The Petition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 31, 1994, we received a petition filed in proper form by the member companies of the Fresh Garlic Producers
Association (collectively petitioner). In accordance with 19 CFR 353.12, the petitioner alleges that fresh garlic
from the People's Republic of China (PRC) is being, or is likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value
within the meaning of section 731 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), and that these imports materially
injure, or threaten material injury to, a United States industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner has stated that it has standing to file the petition because it is an interested party, as defined under
section 771(9)(C) of the Act, and because the petition is filed on behalf of the U.S. industry producing the product
subject to this investigation. If any interested party, as described under paragraphs (C), (D), (E), or (F) of section
771(9) of the Act, wishes to register support for, or opposition to, this petition, it should file a written notification
with the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Scope of Investigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The products covered by this investigation are all grades of fresh garlic, whether or not chilled or frozen, and include
whole garlic, whole garlic that has been separated into constituent cloves (cracked garlic), and peeled garlic (skin
removed), whether or not packed in any substance. The differences between the grades are based on color, size, sheathing
and level of decay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fresh garlic is used principally as a food product and for seasoning. Fresh garlic, whether or not chilled or frozen,
is currently classifiable under subheadings 0703.20.0000, 0710.80.7060, and 0710.80.9750 of the Harmonized Tariff
Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes,
our written description of the scope of this proceeding is dispositive.

United States Price and Foreign Market Value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioner based United States price (USP) on October 1993 invoices from U.S. importers of the subject merchandise
from the PRC. In calculating USP, petitioner deducted amounts for the following: U.S. duties, ocean freight, marine
insurance, foreign inland freight expenses, brokers' commission, harbor maintenance and U.S. merchandise processing
fees, and commissions charged by the U.S. importers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioner alleges that the PRC is a non-market economy (NME) country within the meaning of section 773(c) of the Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has determined the PRC to be an NME, within the meaning of section 771(18)(A) of the Act, in previous
cases (see e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Certain Compact Ductile Iron Waterworks Fittings
and Accessories Thereof from the PRC, 58 FR 37908 (July 14, 1993). In accordance with 771(18)(C) of the Act, that determination
continues to apply for purposes of this initiation. In the course of this investigation, parties will have the opportunity
to address this NME determination and provide relevant information and argument on this issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, because of the extent of central government control in an NME, the Department considers that a single antidumping
margin, should there be one, is appropriate for all exporters from the NME. Only if individual NME exporters are free
of central government ownership and can demonstrate an absence of central governmental control with respect to the
pricing of exports, both in law and in fact, will they be considered eligible for separate, owner-specific deposit
rates. (See Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Helical Spring Lock Washers from the People's Republic
of China, 58 FR 48833 (September 20, 1993) for a discussion of the information the Department considers appropriate
to warrant calculation of separate rates.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioner based foreign market value on the PRC's factors of production for producing the subject merchandise.
To value the factors of production, petitioner used India as a surrogate country. Petitioner argues that India is
a country at a comparable level of economic development as the PRC and India is a significant producer of comparable
merchandise pursuant to section 773(c)(4) of the Act. Further, India's garlic production is labor intensive and
relies on rudimentary agricultural techniques similar to agricultural methods used in the PRC. For purposes of this
initiation, we have accepted India as an appropriate surrogate country selection. There appear to be no other countries
with comparable economies to the PRC that produce the subject merchandise. In addition, the Department has used India
as an appropriate surrogate country selection in other investigations involving merchandise from the PRC. (See
Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Sulfanilic Acid from the People's Republic of China (57 FR 29705,
July 6, 1992).

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioner first attempted to value the factors of production using Indian information. Where this was not possible,
petitioner valued the factors of production using the U.S. industry's costs, where it was determined that this provided
a reasonable basis upon which to value certain factors of production. Petitioner valued the factors of production
of the subject merchandise in the PRC as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;For material costs (seed and fertilizer), petitioner relied on Indian factors based on its foreign market
research, using public information whenever possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;For most labor costs (seed cracking, field preparation, planting, weed control, fertilization, irrigation,
digging, windrowing and harvesting), petitioner relied on an industry expert's estimate of Chinese factors which
was based on the expert's knowledge of the Chinese industry and the expert's own experience with nonmechanized garlic
production, using public information whenever possible. Petitioner valued such labor costs on the basis of Indian
production experience as developed in its foreign market research. For other labor costs related to hauling, sorting,
grading, inspecting, and shrinkage, petitioner relied on the U.S. industry's cost-per-pound for these operations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Petitioner added an amount for all other manufacturing costs and related overhead equal to 10 percent of direct
material and labor costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Petitioner added an amount for shrinkage loss of 7 percent of the cost of production, based on U.S. experience.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;For selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&amp;A), petitioner used the statutory minimum of ten
percent of the cost of production. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;For profit, petitioner used the statutory minimum of eight percent of the cost of manufacture plus SG&amp;A.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Petitioner added an amount for packing based on the average, actual experience of the U.S. industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on petitioner's calculations, the dumping margins range from 266.73 to 376.67 percent. For purposes of this
initiation, no adjustments were made to petitioner's calculations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We have examined the petition on fresh garlic and have found that the petition meets the requirements of section 732(b)
of the Act. Therefore, we are initiating an antidumping duty investigation to determine whether imports of fresh
garlic from the PRC are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value.

The ITC will determine by March 17, 1994, whether there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States
is materially injured, or is threatened with material injury, by reason of imports of fresh garlic from the PRC. A negative
ITC determination will result in a termination of the investigation; otherwise, the investigation will proceed
according to statutory and regulatory time limits.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 17, 1993, Koyo Seiko Company Ltd. and Koyo Corporation of U.S.A. (Koyo) requested that the Department
of Commerce (the Department) issue a ruling that Koyo's imported forgings, including tower forgings, hot forgings,
and cold forgings, be found outside the scope of the antidumping duty order on tapered roller bearings and parts thereof
from Japan (52 FR 37352, October 6, 1987). The Department initiated its scope inquiry on September 28, 1993, and granted
interested parties an opportunity to comment on whether these forgings fall within the scope of the order. We received
comments on November 15, 1993, from the petitioner, the Timken Company, and rebuttal comments from Koyo on November
22, 1993. Due to the significant difficulty presented by this scope inquiry, we have determined that it is appropriate
to issue a preliminary determination, in accordance with the Department's regulations (19 CFR 353.29(d)(3) (1993)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Koyo requested the scope ruling in response to a change in the U.S. Customs classification of Koyo's imported forgings.
At the time of the original investigation, Koyo's imported forgings were classified as forgings under the Tariff
Schedules of the United States (TSUS) 606.7340. When the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) replaced the TSUS in 1989
and a specific provision for forgings ceased to exist, Koyo classified its forgings as ``semifinished steel'' under
HTS 7224.90, and later, based on the advice of a Customs port, as ``steel articles'' under HTS 7326.19. Customs recently
examined the subject forgings and informed Koyo that it considers them to be ``parts of tapered roller bearings (TRBs)''
under HTS 8482.99. Customs generally classifies an article as a ``part'' of another article if that is its chief or
principal use. Based on this general principle, Customs determined that under the HTS Koyo's forged rings should
be classified as TRB parts as long as they are chiefly used for incorporation into TRBs. Although Koyo's scope clarification
request was prompted at least in part by the action of Customs, neither classification choices made by producers nor
classification decisions made by Customs determine the scope of antidumping duty orders. Rather, the scope of antidumping
duty orders is determined by the Department at the time of the original investigation and issuance of an order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 19 CFR 353.29(i)(1), in analyzing the scope request in this proceeding, the Department took into
account the descriptions of the merchandise contained in the petition, the initial investigation, and the determinations
of the Department and the International Trade Commission (ITC). The regulations provide that if the Department determines
these descriptions are ambiguous, it will further consider the factors provided for under 19 CFR 353.29(i)(2), known
commonly as Diversified Products criteria (see

Koyo makes the forgings at issue from bearing grade steel bar, which is sheared, pierced, and extruded into the shape
of the forging. The forgings are not machined in any way prior to exportation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We note that the term ``forgings'' covers a broad spectrum of products. The Summaries of Trade and Tariff Information
(Schedule 6, Volume 4) identifies two basic types of forgings in its description of the product. Open-die forgings
are large shapes produced by hammering or pressing heated ingots, blooms, billets, slabs, or bars on regulation press-and-hammer
forging equipment with dies that are flat or slightly shaped. Closed-die or drop forgings are small- or medium-size
shapes forged by using dies accurately formed to the size and shape of the desired finished product. Open-die forgings
require machining to acquire the desired dimensions of the finished product. Closed-die forgings require little
or no subsequent machining and are generally considered parts for import classification purposes. The forgings
at issue have not been categorized as either open-die or closed-die forgings.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The merchandise covered by this petition is all tapered roller bearings, tapered rollers and other parts thereof
(both finished and unfinished) including, but not limited to, single-row, multiple-row (e.g., two-, four-), and
thrust bearings and self-contained bearing packages (generally pre-set, pre-sealed, and pre-greased), but only
to the extent that such merchandise is not presently covered by an outstanding antidumping duty order or finding in
the United States.

In the petition, Timken stressed that it had identified TSUS numbers to the best of its ability, but that it did not intend
that products under other classification numbers be excluded from the scope if they fell within the description of
the product in the petition. Timken argues that the language of the petition unambiguously includes Koyo's forgings,
since the petition requested coverage for all unfinished TRB parts not included in the A&hyph;588&hyph;054 finding
which covers TRBs four inches or less in outside diameter. Timken takes the position that the instant forgings fall
under the category of unfinished parts and they should properly have been classified that way. The fact that they were
not named specifically in the petition does not imply that Timken did not intend to include them. Timken states that
it was impossible for it to name each item that might be considered a TRB part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Koyo, however, claims that since the petition never mentioned forgings, they were not included. In its ruling request
Koyo argues that forgings are outside the scope of the order because they are ``precursor materials'' that have not
yet begun the manufacturing process. Koyo claims that including forgings would be tantamount to including bearing
grade steel in the scope of the order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's position is that the petition clearly includes unfinished TRB parts in its scope. However, the language
in the petition is ambiguous with respect to whether forgings are considered unfinished parts.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The products covered by the preliminary and final determinations and the order as it was published in 1987 are ``tapered
roller bearings and parts thereof, currently classified under Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS) item
numbers 680.30 and 680.39; flange, take-up cartridge, and hanger units incorporating tapered roller bearings,
currently classified under TSUS item number 661.10; and tapered roller housings (except pillow blocks) incorporating
tapered rollers, with or without spindles, whether or not for automotive use, and currently classified under TSUS
item number 692.32 or elsewhere in the TSUS. Products subject to the outstanding antidumping duty order covering
certain tapered roller bearings from Japan (T.D. 76&hyph;227, 41 FR 34974) were not included within the scope of this
investigation'' (see Antidumping Duty Order: Tapered Roller Bearings and Parts Thereof, Finished and Unfinished,
from Japan, 52 FR 37352, October 6, 1987). At issue is whether forgings should be considered unfinished parts within
the scope of the order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Timken claims that at the time of the order Koyo's imported forgings should have properly been classified as TRB parts,
and that they are clearly included within the scope of the order. Koyo argues that the language of the order unambiguously
excludes forgings, since at the time of the investigation Koyo was importing forgings under TSUS 606.7340 as ``non-machined
steel forgings'', a provision not mentioned in the order. Koyo clearly stated in each of the first three administrative
reviews that it considered its imported forgings to be outside the scope of the order, and neither the Department nor
the petitioner objected. Therefore, Koyo argues that forgings have been considered outside the scope since the order
was published.

The Department's position is that, absent the rare case in which there is no narrative description of the subject merchandise,
any TSUS or HTS numbers mentioned in the scope of an order are for reference only, and do not limit the scope in any way.
The Department's position in this respect is supported by the fact that the scope description for each of the administrative
reviews has contained a statement to the effect that the Customs classification numbers are provided for reference
purposes only. However, the language used in the order to describe the products is ambiguous with respect to forgings,
since forgings are not mentioned and there is no explicit indication of what products are included as unfinished parts.
Moreover, while Koyo stated in its review responses that it did not report forgings, it is not apparent from these statements
the form the imports took. As was described earlier, the term ``forgings'' covers a wide range of products. The question
this scope inquiry poses for the Department is whether the instant forgings are advanced to the point that the Department
considers them TRB parts.

The ITC's Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The International Trade Commission's (ITC) questionnaires in the investigation defined unfinished parts as ``*&blank;*&blank;*
those that have been shaped sufficiently that they may be used only in the manufacture of tapered roller bearings.''
(p. 5). Likewise, the ITC considered whether to treat unfinished parts as separate like products in its final determination.
It rejected Koyo's request to consider each of the following groups as discrete like products: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. ``Precursor materials'' (i.e., unfinished forged rings) and ``finished bulk parts'' (i.e., rollers and cages)
of tapered roller bearings; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Unfinished tapered roller bearing components (i.e._unfinished outer rings and inner rings); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Finished tapered roller bearings.

(Tapered Roller Bearings and Parts Thereof, and Certain Housings Incorporating Tapered Rollers, from Japan, Inv.
No. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;343 (Final), USITC Pub 2020, September 1987, p. 5). The ITC reasoned that all parts are destined
to become complete, finished TRBs and that neither finished nor unfinished parts have commercial value except as
components of TRBs. To the extent that the ITC considered the items in this list a single like product, this statement
suggests that the ITC considered forged rings to be unfinished parts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ITC also states in its final determination that: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Unfinished bearing components are the cones, cups, and rollers that have been green machined and heat treated, but
that require final finishing *&blank;*&blank;* Green machining is an industry term that relates to the machining
operations performed on the raw materials prior to heat treatment for cups, cones, and rollers. (p. A&hyph;8) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
However, Timken points out that the ITC was discussing cups and cones made from tubing rather than forgings, and argues
that the ITC's view that green machining is the first stage in the production process applies only to tubing. Timken
claims that, in the bar-based manufacturing process Koyo uses, the first step in production is forging. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This is consistent with an ITC footnote (p. A&hyph;8) that the forging process is used instead of green machining,
indicating that at least some of the green machining necessary on rings cut from tube steel is not necessary on forgings.
Although the ITC considered green machining to be the turning point in Timken's tube-based production process, the
distinction is blurred when forgings are used. Since forging can accomplish some of the same results as green machining,
the ITC's description of the production process does not necessarily imply that forged rings are outside the scope
of the order.

Diversified Products Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While stages of production can be helpful in determining when raw material becomes an unfinished part, the descriptions
of the merchandise in the petition and the Department's determinations are ambiguous with respect to the question
of whether these forgings are unfinished parts. The ITC's final determination, though not perfectly clear, points
toward the conclusion that forgings are within the scope of the order. However, because there is some ambiguity, the
Department considered it appropriate to analyze the Diversified Products criteria. The four additional criteria
the Department considered in determining if forgings are within the order are listed at 19 CFR 353.29(i)(2): (1) the
physical characteristics of the product; (2) the expectations of the ultimate purchasers; (3) the ultimate use of
the product; and (4) the channels of trade.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Physical Characteristics 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Timken points out that forgings are similar in size and shape to finished cups and cones. However, Koyo argues that
there are dramatic differences between forgings and finished cups and cones. Some forgings are split in two to form
both the cup and the cone. In the manufacturing steps that take place during the turning process, between 24% and 30%
of the steel is removed from a forging, resulting in a green machined ring with the specific dimensions and tolerance
of the finished cup or cone, or inner and outer raceways. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Koyo argues further that the forged rings are most similar to steel tube rings, which undergo the same processes (green
machining, heat treatment, polishing, and grinding) before becoming a finished TRB part. Koyo states that ``both
rings cut from tube and forged rings are intermediate donut-shaped pieces of steel that are first produced from steel
bar and later further processed into parts for bearings'' (Koyo's letter to the Department, November 22, 1993, p.4).
Both parties agree that rings cut from tube are outside the scope of the order, as indicated by Koyo's statement to that
effect on page 24 of its letter and Timken's reference to rings cut from tube as raw material (p.23). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, Timken points out that the forgings in question are a much more processed product than rings cut from tube
steel. Forged rings have the approximate shapes of the cups and cones that they will be turned into. Indeed, forging
gives them much of the definition that green machining would otherwise give. As a result, the forgings are effectively
dedicated to use as TRB parts. Conversely, rings cut from tube steel bear little resemblance to cups or cones. Tube
rings lose 50% to 75% of the weight of the ring during green machining, and can only be considered TRB parts after this
process takes place. Given the advanced shape that forging gives the components, and the consequent reduction in
green machining, the green machining process does not appear determinative in this case. Rather, it is the advanced
physical characteristics of the component forgings that are definitive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department preliminarily determines that forged rings are more processed than rings from tube stock, and, as
such, are physically distinct from rings cut from tube steel. While some final machining is necessary, the forging
process used in this case effectively transforms the metal input into a product sufficiently advanced in state that
it is essentially a TRB component. Consequently, an examination of physical characteristics indicates that forgings
are included in the scope of the order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Channels of Trade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The forgings at issue are either produced by Koyo or purchased from steel forgers and sold by Koyo to AKBMC, its related
subsidiary. Forgings move through the same channel of trade as unfinished parts, namely, to bearings producers for
incorporation into tapered roller or antifriction bearings. Therefore, the Department preliminarily determines
that the channels of trade criterion indicates that forgings are within the scope of the order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Expectations of the Ultimate Purchaser 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The forgings in question are imported into the United States for use in the production of TRBs. Timken points out that
these forgings have undergone initial processing which renders them dedicated to use in a limited range of part numbers.
Timken notes that the bearings producers who purchase these forgings have no expected use other than the production
of finished bearings. Koyo submits, however, that finding forgings to be within the scope of the order based on the
expectation criterion is comparable to concluding that bearing grade steel is also within the scope, since it too
is imported for use in production of TRBs and has almost no alternative uses. Koyo argues further that rings cut from
tube steel, which are outside the scope, are also limited to use in a specific range of models.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department notes that although the expectations of the purchasers of bearing grade steel and of rings cut from
tube steel are the same as those of purchasers of in-scope TRB parts, no one argues that bearing grade steel or rings
cut from tube are steel are covered by the order. Moreover, bearing steel might be destined for bearing-related production
but it has not been advanced to the point of dedicating it to a TRB component, finished or unfinished. By the same token,
it is also possible that some rings cut from tube steel may not necessarily be intended for use in TRBs. However, the
forgings in question have been advanced to the point that some use other than a TRB component is highly unlikely. Because
the expectation of the parties importing the instant forgings is to make TRBs, the Department's position is that this
criterion indicates that forgings are within the scope of the order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Ultimate Use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Timken points out that forgings are more dedicated to use in TRBs than rings cut from tube steel, since these forgings
more closely approximate the dimensions of the finished cup or cone and do not require as extensive a turning process
as steel tube rings. Koyo contends that a ring cut from steel tube is as dedicated to use in TRBs as a forging is, because
both are made from bearing grade steel, which Koyo claims is too expensive to be used for other purposes. Furthermore,
Koyo argues, a steel tube ring and these forgings are equally limited in the range of bearings for which they can be used.
However, Koyo uses the overwhelming portion of its imported forgings in the production of TRBs. Koyo suggests that
it is possible to use some of the forgings to make both TRB and ball bearing parts (Koyo submitted an example of a ball
bearing and a TRB that have inner rings made from the same forged ring), and it is theoretically possible for the manufacturer
to use a forging originally intended for use in a TRB to produce a ball bearing instead, if production needs change after
importation. In practice, this possibility is seldom realized because it is not cost efficient to create a forging
with multiple uses. Forgings are used to limit the amount of machining that is necessary. The very concept of forging
embodies shaping a blank to the degree that it appears dedicated to one product.

The Department preliminarily determines that since the instant forgings appear dedicated to the production of TRBs,
these forgings are essentially parts of TRBs. Therefore, the ultimate use criterion indicates that these forgings
are within the scope of the order.

Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on our analysis of the comments provided by interested parties on the language of the petition and the determinations
of the ITC and the Department, and on the physical characteristics, channels of trade, expectations of the ultimate
purchasers, and the ultimate use of the product, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.29(i), we preliminarily determine
that such forgings are the same class or kind of merchandise as unfinished TRB parts, and therefore are within the scope
of the order on tapered roller bearings and parts thereof from Japan. The Department preliminarily determines these
forgings to be within the scope based on the totality of the facts presented above and especially for the following
reasons: (1) the ITC clearly includes precursor materials such as forgings within its definition of like product;
(2) the physical characteristics, channels of trade, ultimate use of forgings, and expectations of ultimate purchasers
indicate that such forgings are within the scope of the order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We invite interested parties to comment on this preliminary determination no later than March 18, 1994. Rebuttal
comments are due no later than March 25, 1994. The Department will consider such comments in reaching its final determination.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This preliminary scope ruling is in accordance with 19 CFR 353.29(d)(3).

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Energy announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(5), it is making a discretionary financial assistance
award based on the criterion set forth at 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(A) to Urban Energy and Transportation Corporation
(UETC) under Cooperative Agreement Number DE&hyph;FC01&hyph;94EW54065. Estimated total funding in the amount
of $15,000,000 will be provided to obtain local officials' participation and expertise in transportation activities
including collection and dissemination of information, conducting regional and national workshops, providing
technical assistance, and identification and analyses of issues related to transportation of hazardous materials
through large urban areas. This activity will promote better understanding of local views concerning clean-up technologies,
emergency management and training issues, and transportation operations and outreach. As a result, this will enable
DOE to develop programs that will better meet those local needs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Energy has determined in accordance with 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(A) that UETC will provide continued
activity which is necessary to the satisfactory completion of an activity presently being funded by DOE, and for which
competition for support would have a significant adverse effect on continuity or completion of the activity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed effort is to establish and maintain networks of senior decision-makers from local communities who are
responsible for or concerned about technology development, transportation, and emergency issues associated with
energy-related facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
UETC has a vast array of techniques to accomplish the objectives of the proposed project, including professional
techniques in structured meeting design and facilitation, information dissemination through printed products
such as newsletters and electronic media, opinion surveys, planning and program evaluation, and public and institutional
involvement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The anticipated period of performance is 60 months from the effective date of award.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The subject study represents a review and evaluation of readily available pertinent technical reports which were
discussed among the participating agencies during the course of the preparation of the study from October to December
1992. After reviewing the hazards posed by plutonium, applicable transportation safety and physical protection
regulations, pertinent research and experience, and contingency plans, the agencies participating in this study
conclude that plutonium can be shipped safely by sea. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Public Law 102&hyph;486 also requires the preparation and submittal to Congress of an Implementation Plan that describes
the plan for implementing the recommendations contained in the study. The Implementation Plan must be submitted
to Congress and made available for public viewing 90 days after issuance of the study. Subsequent to enactment of the
legislation calling for this study and Implementation Plan, and subsequent to preparation of the study, several
individual members of Congress have raised additional concerns relating to the shipment of radioactive materials
by sea. These concerns include the safety of shipment of other material proposed to be shipped (e.g., glassified high-level
nuclear waste and mixed oxide fuel), as well as the need to evaluate risk assessment elements. These elements are shipping
routes, adequacy of the revised International Maritime Organization code for radioactive shipments, the consequences
and probability of the ``maximum credible accident'' in shipping by sea, and the examination of threats of sabotage
and terrorism. The participating Federal agencies will address these additional concerns in the Implementation
Plan to the extent that they relate to the recommendations in the study. Where certain issues raised do not fall within
the framework of the study and Implementation Plan, the agencies will ensure that they are addressed through direct
communication with the members of Congress who raised them.

Take notice that Florida Power Corporation (``Florida Power'') on February 8, 1994 tendered for filing a wholesale
change in its full requirements, partial requirements and transmission rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rates filed herein reflect a pre-filing settlement agreement between the Company and its wholesale customers
that have participated in the Company's recent wholesale rate proceedings. Under that agreement, the rates for all
classes of service except transmission service on a 1994 test year basis will increase on March 2, 1994, in the amount
of (i) $9.9 million as compared to the 1993 settlement rates pending for approval by the Commission in Docket No. ER93&hyph;299&hyph;000,
or (ii) $7.6 million as compared to the existing rates to be replaced by those 1993 settlement rates. The rates for transmission
service on a 1994 test year basis will decrease on March 2, 1994, in the amount of (i) $l.l millon as compared to the 1993
settlement rates pending for approval or (ii) $1.8 million as compared to the existing rates to be replaced by those
1993 settlement rates. The rates for transmission service on a 1994 test year basis will subsequently increase on
May 1, 1994, in an amount of $1.0 million as compared with the March 2, 1994 level rates. The settlement rates are extended
to all wholesale customers not participating in the pre-filing settlement agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Florida Power requests that the Commission waive the 60 day minimum notice requirement of the Federal Power Act to
achieve the March 2, 1994 effective date for the rate changes proposed for that date for (1) the parties to the pre-filing
settlement agreement, (2) customers not parties to the pre-filing settlement agreement but consenting to the pre-filing
settlement procedures and (3) any other customers who do not oppose the March 2, 1994 requested effective date. Florida
Power further requests that the Commission establish an effective date of April 9, 1994, 60 days from the date of the
filing, for any customers who oppose the March 2, 1994 effective date. The Company further requests that the rate increases
proposed for March 2, 1994, April 9, 1994, if applicable, and May 1, 1994 be permitted to become effective without suspension
or, if suspended, that the suspension be for the minimum one day period.

Northern estimates the cost of these facilities to be $6,065,000 which would be financed with internally generated
funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Northern proposes to construct the facilities to provide additional capacity on Northern's mainline north between
its Owatonna Compressor Station (Owatonna) in Steele County, Minnesota and its North Branch Compressor Station
in Chicago County, Minnesota to serve additional market requirements of 19,788 Mcf of natural gas per day requested
by Minnegasco and Great Plains during a thirty day open season from November 10, 1993 to December 9, 1993. Northern
states that the Alexandria Branchline loop is required to meet Minnegasco's increased requirements served from
the branchline. Northern states that the mainline facilities would increase the capacity of the mainline north of
Owatonna by 19,288 Mcf of natural gas per day and is required for the 1994&hyph;95 heating season. The balance would
be transported through existing capacity, it is indicated.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Take notice that on February 14, 1994, Chandeleur Pipe Line Company (Chandeleur), P.O. Box 740339, New Orleans, LA
70174, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;233&hyph;000 an application pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act
for a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the increase of maximum operating pressures and
total system maximum capacity of its pipeline, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the
Commission and open to public inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chandeleur states that it consists of a 79.9 mile 12-inch mainline, a parallel 82.3 mile 16-inch mainline (which loops
the 12-inch line) and an 11.3 mile 12-inch lateral gas supply pipeline. The maximum operating pressure of the 12-inch
mainline is 1100 psig. The maximum operating pressure of the 16-inch mainline 1000 psig. The maximum operating pressure
of the 12-inch lateral is 1318 psig. The current authorized system capacity is 205,000 Mcf per day, with maximum capacity
of 240,000 Mcf per day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, Chandeleur requests authorization to increase the maximum operating pressures of both its 12-inch
and 16-inch mainlines to 1200 psig. Chandeleur states that it has recently completed a new interconnection with Texas
Eastern Transmission Corporation's (``TETCO'') 24-inch mainline in offshore Louisiana in OCS Breton Sound Block
42 for the purpose of allowing Chandeleur's shippers to transport gas into TETCO's system, thereby increasing the
shippers' delivery options. Chandeleur states that TETCO's maximum operating pressure is 1200 psig. To allow delivery
of natural gas from Chandeleur into TETCO's 24-inch mainline when TETCO is operating at maximum pressure, Chandeleur
states that its maximum operating pressure must match TETCO's and therefore must be increased to 1200 psig.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chandeleur states that the requested increase in pressure to 1200 psig is within maximum allowable operating pressures
for Chandeleur's pipeline as established by the Department of Transportation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chandeleur states that the requested increase in operating pressure and maximum capacity will allow its current
and future shippers to increase the amount of gas they can transport to existing markets and to new markets which are
not now economically accessible through Chandeleur.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before March 3,
1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest
in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 and 18 CFR
385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will
be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties
to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or participate as a party in any hearing therein
must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and
Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application
if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter
finds that a grant of the certificate is required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene
is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of
such hearing will be duly given.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for Chandeleur to appear
or be represented at the hearing.

I. EPAct's IRP Reporting Requirements of DOE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct) contains several requirements of DOE to report to the President and Congress
on the status and likely impacts of electric and gas IRP development across the nation. These IRP-related reporting
requirements can be found in EPAct, Title I_Energy Efficiency, Subtitle B_Utilities, Sections 111(e) and 115(e).
The purpose of this notice is to obtain information relevant to the IRP evaluation and small business impact reporting
requirements by soliciting the opinions of IRP stakeholders concerning the impact of IRP on electricity costs to
consumers, reliability of electric service, dependence on particular energy sources, and small businesses engaged
in providing energy services. In the near-term, DOE must satisfy these EPAct requirements which call for DOE to prepare
this report to the President and Congress within two years of EPAct's enactment. The report must contain, among other
IRP-related items, an evaluation which determines:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 -->
&bull;Whether and to what extent IRP (electric only) is likely to result in_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Higher or lower electricity costs to an electric utility's ultimate consumers or to classes or groups of such consumers;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Enhanced or reduced reliability of electric service; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Increased or decreased dependence on particular energy resources; as well as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The competitive impact of implementation of energy conservation, energy efficiency, and other DSM programs
by utilities (electric and gas) on small businesses engaged in the design, sale, supply, installation, or servicing
of similar energy conservation, energy efficiency, or other DSM measures; and whether any unfair, deceptive, or
predatory acts exist, or are likely to exist, from implementation of such programs.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The DOE IRP Program will also use responses to this request for providing insight into the direction of the Program's
longer-term research agenda related to assessing the national impacts of IRP. Responses to this request will be analyzed
and reported by the staff of DOE's Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) Program, which is under the auspices of the Office
of Utility Technologies which is under the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable
Energy. This summary will characterize what various groups believe to be the likely impacts of electric IRP on the
nation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
II. Purpose of Request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The overall legislative intent of Subsection 111 of EPAct is to promote energy efficiency, in particular by encouraging
utilities and States to adopt the planning principles of IRP. The legislative intent of the requirements to report
the impact of IRP on electricity costs to consumers, reliability of electric service, and dependence on particular
energy resources is to assess the likely results of IRP implementation against the intended purpose and goals of EPAct's
IRP-related provisions. It is also the intent of the provision to determine the competitive impacts of the energy
conservation, energy efficiency, and other demand-side management programs of electric and gas utilities on small
businesses to ensure that State regulatory commissions are considering the impact which expanded DSM programs may
have on small businesses already engaged in similar activities, and are implementing measures to assure that utility
actions will not provide utilities with an unfair competitive advantage over such small businesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DOE's IRP Program is responsible for this report. The program views the Federal role in IRP development as a collector
of important data, a conduit of the lessons learned by experienced IRP practitioners to new IRP adopters, a developer
of new tools and data bases and monitorer of the outcomes of IRP processes around the country. Among the priorities
in this effort is the fulfillment of these EPAct reporting requirements concerning the likely impacts of IRP on the
nation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Submitting this report to the President and Congress will be a component of a continuing effort by DOE's IRP Program
to monitor and evaluate the impact of IRP on the nation's States, utilities and consumers. The IRP Program views as
part of its role to think critically about IRP and its expected benefits. Because DOE implements national energy policies
that emphasize IRP as a potential solution to some of the problems affecting the nation's utility energy services,
an assessment as to whether and to what extent IRP is providing overall benefit to the nation, as it is practiced, is
a necessary and important DOE responsibility.

III. Definitions of IRP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
To ensure that all respondents to this notice have a common understanding of DOE's perspective on the role of IRP in
utility planning, DOE offers the following to define IRP's scope and parameters and to describe the characteristics
which distinguish IRP from traditional planning approaches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Traditional planning techniques used by utilities once focus only on investing in supply-side resources to satisfy
customers' needs. A distinguishing factor of the IRP process is that it includes both supply- and demand-side resources
in meeting demands for utility energy services. According to Section 111 of EPAct, IRP for electric utility service
is: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 -->
A planning and selection process for new energy resources that evaluates the full range of alternatives, including
new generating capacity, power purchases, energy conservation and efficiency, cogeneration and district heating
and cooling applications, and renewable energy resources, in order to provide adequate and reliable service to its
customers at the lowest system cost.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In addition to promoting a mix of alternative resources, IRP infuses the interests of all stakeholders: Utilities,
ratepayers, regulators, stockholders, and interest groups. The following explanation of IRP, also taken from EPAct
Section 111, reflects the idea that IRP is a process that evaluates the issues raised by different stakeholders. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 -->
The Process [will] take into account necessary features for system operation, such as diversity, reliability, dispatchability,
and other factors of risk; [will] take into account the ability to verify energy savings achieved through energy conservation
and efficiency and the projected durability of such savings measured over time; [and will] treat demand and supply
resources on a consistent and integrated basis.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The DOE approach to IRP for utility and State energy planning is to treat all options_supply, storage, delivery, and
demand-side_on a consistent basis using a systems approach without preconceptions or bias for or against any particular
option, fuel type, or form of ownership. The following characteristics distinguish IRP from traditional planning
techniques. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 -->
1. IRP examines the full range of energy and capacity resources including demand-side management programs, transmission
and distribution systems, and non-traditional supply alternatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. IRP gives consideration to the full range of economic, environmental, social, and technological factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. IRP facilitates public involvement in utility planning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. IRP facilitates consideration of the risks and uncertainties posed by different resource portfolios and by external
factors such as fluctuations in energy prices and economic conditions.

IV. Nature of Information Sought 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
DOE urges those interested in responding to this notice to consider the provided definition of IRP and its characteristics
and to consider the following list of questions. DOE is also interested in gauging the evolution of IRP practices around
the nation, particularly as those practices apply to the significant changes that are likely to occur in the utility
services industry over the next several years. Therefore, DOE urges respondents to also consider each of the following
questions and explain how they might answer those questions five years from now. Respondents are asked to please include
their underlying assumptions which accompany their opinions on the future status and likely impact of IRP. This information
will enhance DOE's ability to accurately interpret the response and compare it to the opinions of other respondents.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Has the implementation of IRP changed (or is likely to change) the per unit cost as well as the total bill for electricity
for consumers from pre-IRP levels? How, if at all, have different consumer classes or groups experienced (or are likely
to experience) changes in the cost of their electric service as a result of IRP? Are these changes good or bad and why?
What characteristics of IRP are most responsible for the changes in electricity costs which you have cited for the

 Title II of the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978 (FUA), as amended (42 U.S.C. 8301 et seq.), provides that
no new baseload electric powerplant may be constructed or operated without the capability to use coal or another alternate
fuel as a primary energy source. In order to meet the requirement of coal capability, the owner or operator of such facilities
proposing to use natural gas or petroleum as its primary energy source shall certify, pursuant to FUA section 201(d),
to the Secretary of Energy prior to construction, or prior to operation as a base load powerplant, that such powerplant
has the capability to use coal or another alternate fuel. Such certification establishes compliance with section
201(a) on the day it is filed with the Secretary. The Secretary is required to publish a notice in the

 Effective February 28, 1994, the EPA is announcing the availability of a new edition of its National Directory of AHERA
Accredited Courses (NDAAC). This publication, updated quarterly, provides information to the public about training
providers and courses approved for accreditation purposes pursuant to the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act
(AHERA). As a nationwide listing of approved asbestos training programs and courses, the NDAAC has replaced the similar
listing which was formerly published quarterly by EPA in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. The February 28, 1994, directory, which supersedes the version released on November 30, 1993, may be ordered through
the NDAAC Clearinghouse along with a variety of related reports.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to AHERA, as amended by the Asbestos School Hazard Abatement Reauthorization Act (ASHARA), contractors
who prepare management plans for schools, inspect for asbestos in schools or public and commercial buildings, or
design or conduct response actions with respect to friable asbestos-containing materials in schools or public and
commercial buildings, are required to obtain accreditation by completing prescribed training requirements. EPA
therefore maintains a current national listing of AHERA-accredited courses and approved training providers so
that this information will be readily available to assist the public in accessing these training programs and obtaining
the necessary accreditation. The information is also maintained so that the Agency and approved state accreditation
and licensing programs will have a reliable means of identifying and verifying the approval status of training courses
and organizations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Previously, EPA had published this listing in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

even though the legislative mandate had expired. The NDAAC fulfills the public need for this information while at
the same time, it reduces EPA cost and improves the service's capabilities.

Description:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Administration on Children, Youth and Families (ACYF) will conduct A Descriptive Study of the Head Start Health
Component. The study, conducted in 80 Head Start centers around the country, will include interviews with 1200 parents
who have a 4-year-old child in Head Start, with a review of the Head Start health records of these children. There will
also be interviews with the key Head Start staff responsible for administration and implementation of the Health
Component.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During Phase I of the study, a Technical Advisory Panel, consisting of experts in the four health domains, assisted
in developing the sampling, data collection and analysis plans, as well as the data collection instruments. In Phase
II, the research team will collect health screening, examination, referral, treatment and services data for 15 randomly
selected four-year-old children at each of the 80 participating Head Start centers, also selected at random from
around the country. All data collection must be completed prior to the end of the Head Start academic year. These data
will be analyzed to provide a description of how this nationwide sample of programs is implementing the Head Start
Health Component.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund), as amended by
the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA), requires that ATSDR and the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) annually revise the Priority List of Hazardous Substances to include additional substances most commonly
found at facilities on the CERCLA National Priorities List (NPL). This announcement provides notice that the agencies
have developed and are making available a revised CERCLA Priority List of 275 Hazardous Substances, based on the most
recent information available to ATSDR and EPA. This revised priority list includes newly listed substances which
have been determined to pose the most significant potential threat to human health at or around NPL hazardous waste
sites. Each substance on the priority list is a candidate to become the subject of a toxicological profile prepared
by ATSDR and subsequent identification of priority data needs.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 CERCLA establishes certain requirements for ATSDR and EPA with regard to hazardous substances which are most commonly
found at facilities on the CERCLA NPL. Section 104(i)(2) of CERCLA, as amended (42 U.S.C. 9604(i)(2)), requires that
the two agencies prepare a list, in order of priority, of at least 100 hazardous substances that are most commonly found
at facilities on the NPL and which, in their sole discretion, are determined to pose the most significant potential
threat to human health (see 52 FR 12866, April 17, 1987). CERCLA also requires the agencies to revise the priority list
to include 100 or more additional hazardous substances (see 53 FR 41280, October 20, 1988), and to include at least
25 additional hazardous substances in each of the three successive years following the 1988 revision (see 54 FR 43619,
October 26, 1989; 55 FR 42067, October 17, 1990; 56 FR 52166, October 17, 1991). CERCLA also requires that ATSDR and
EPA shall, not less often than once every year thereafter, revise the list to include additional hazardous substances
which are determined to pose the most significant potential threat to human health. Each substance on the CERCLA priority
list of hazardous substances is a candidate to become the subject of a toxicological profile prepared by ATSDR and
the subsequent identification of priority data needs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The previous priority lists of hazardous substances were based on the most comprehensive and relevant information
available when the lists were developed. More comprehensive sources of information on the frequency of occurrence
and the potential for human exposure of substances at NPL sites became available for use in the 1991 priority list with
the development of ATSDR's HazDat database; additional information from HazDat has become available for this year's
listing activity. In the initial listing activities (1987&hyph;1990), new substances were added to the end of the
list, without a comparative reranking. A notice announcing the intention of ATSDR and EPA to revise and rerank the
priority list of hazardous substances was published on June 27, 1991 (56 FR 29485). In this year's listing activity,
as in the previous two years, new candidate substances (substances found at three or more NPL sites) were assigned
a toxicity/environmental score (TES) using the EPA Reportable Quantity methodology, and were added to the pool of
substances previously considered for the annual list. All substances were then evaluated together for consideration
on the priority list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The approach used to generate the 1991 revised priority list was summarized in the ``Revised Priority List of Hazardous
Substances'' (56 FR 52166, October 17, 1991). Using the same approach, and the same algorithm this year, over 700 candidate
substances have been ranked to create the current list of 275 substances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The additional information used in this year's listing activity was entered into ATSDR's HazDat database since the
development of the 1992 Priority List of Hazardous Substances. As with other site-specific information used in the
listing activity, this information has been collected from ATSDR Public Health Assessments and from site file data
packages used in the development of Public Health Assessments. The new information includes more recent NPL frequency
of occurrence data, additional concentration data, and more information on exposure or potential exposure to substances
present at NPL sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At this time the list includes 275 substances which ATSDR and EPA have determined to pose the most significant potential
threat to human health based on the criteria of CERCLA section 104(i)(2) (42 U.S.C. 9604(i)(2)). All candidate substances
have been analyzed and ranked with the current algorithm, and may become the subject of toxicological profiles in
the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The addition of approximately 12,800 contaminant data records (for air, water and soil) to the HazDat database since
October 1992 has allowed the agencies to better assess the potential for human exposure to substances at NPL hazardous
waste sites. With this additional data, 10 new candidate substances have been added to the list, and 13 substances
under consideration last year have moved onto the list. Accordingly, 23 substances have been replaced on the list
of the 275 substances. These changes in the order of substances appearing on the CERCLA priority list of hazardous
substances will be reflected in the program activities which rely on the list for future direction. For example, Dicofol
moved up significantly (to number 107) on the 1993 list when compared to last year's list. As a result it will be included
in the pool of substances that may become the subject of new toxicological profiles in the next fiscal year. Similarly,
alpha-Endosulfan (number 33) moved well into the range of those substances to be considered for the development of
updated toxicological profiles (CERCLA also requires ATSDR to evaluate new information on profiled substances
for potential revision every three years). These changes reflect the dynamic nature of scientific data on substances
present at NPL (and other) hazardous waste sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This annual evaluation activity and announcement of a revised priority list of hazardous substances fulfills the
conditions of CERCLA section 104(i), as amended, which requires ATSDR and EPA to revise the list yearly to include
additional hazardous substances. The agencies intend to revise the list of hazardous substances annually thereafter
to reflect changes and improvements in data collection and availability. Additional information on the methodology
used in the development of the CERCLA Priority List of Hazardous Substances can be found in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 FDA has established a videoconferencing facility for general use by FDA. The facility, which became operational
on June 1, 1993, is located in rm. 13B&hyph;37 in the Parklawn Bldg., 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. The facility
has a capacity for 25 to 30 people and can be used to conduct videoconferences with FDA. The establishment of the facility
culminates a 3-year project by FDA and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association to improve communications
between the agency and interested parties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency does not intend to restrict the use of the videoconferencing facility to any specific purpose. The facility
can be used to expedite meetings with the public and regulated industries, or to facilitate training and internal
FDA meetings. In addition to improving communications, FDA believes that the facility may even shorten FDA review
times for applications because the facility can be used to facilitate prompt resolution of specific issues. Videoconferencing
will also facilitate broader participation by industry staff in FDA meetings and make meetings more productive.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Policies and Procedures for Use
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has established videoconferencing as an optional means of communicating with FDA. The decision on whether to
conduct a face-to-face meeting or videoconference, or a combination of meetings and videoconferences, must be agreed
to by both the agency and the interested party. Use of the videoconferencing facility is not intended to limit, in any
way, either face-to-face, telephone, written, or any other type of interaction involving FDA personnel. In fact,
videoconferences can be used to supplement face-to-face meetings and enable more persons outside the Rockville,
MD area to participate in discussions with FDA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All existing confidentiality rules that apply to face-to-face meetings also apply to videoconferences. The transmission
signal between the videoconferencing sites is conducted through cables and is scrambled to provide security. Ordinarily,
there will be no videotaping of videoconferences, but videotaping may be permitted if all parties agree to videotaping
before the videoconference is held. FDA will not permit videoconferences to be broadcasted, however, because some
information presented at such meetings may be confidential or otherwise protected from disclosure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All current FDA procedures for conducting meetings will apply to videoconferences. Because some participants may
not always be in view of the camera, FDA recommends that each videoconference begin by introducing or identifying
all participants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA will schedule videoconferences in response to a specific request. The request should be made to the contact person
listed above. FDA recommends that parties request a videoconference at least several weeks in advance, and there
is no time limit on how far in advance a videoconference may be scheduled.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Scheduling will be done on a first-come, first-served basis. FDA will consider the geographical location of the parties
when scheduling a videoconference; thus, for example, FDA will schedule morning meetings with parties in the Eastern
United States, and schedule afternoon meetings with parties in the Western United States. The agency does not intend
to establish prereserved blocks of time for parties in the Western United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once a videoconference has been scheduled, the agency will not reschedule the videoconference except in emergencies.
This policy is in consideration of the substantial amount of scheduling and preparation involved in setting up a videoconference.
Additionally, videoconferencing should be reserved for meetings that are likely to run at least 30 minutes. If a videoconference
extends beyond its scheduled time, the videoconference may be extended, provided the facility is still available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agenda and all materials planned to be presented during a videoconference should be sent to the Project Management

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The IRTA Program is designed to provide opportunities for developmental training and practical research experience
in the laboratories of the NIH. Training fellowships are available to postdoctoral scientists at the beginning stages
of their professional research careers, and to high school, college, graduate and professional (e.g. medical dental,
etc.) school students pursuing studies in academic disciplines related to biomedical research. Candidates must
be U.S. citizens, noncitizen nationals of the United States, or individuals lawfully admitted for permanent residence
in the U.S. Applicants may not be excluded from consideration for the IRTA Program on the basis of race, color, religion,
sex, handicap, age, national origin, political affiliation, or any other nonmerit factor. Subject to the availability
of funds, IRTA Fellowship awards are made on the basis of NIH's assessment of the mutuality of research interests,
the qualifications of the candidates, and their potential to benefit from the training assignment. Recipient are
not Federal employees.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Postdoctoral Fellowships are awarded to promising physicians and Ph.D. level investigators, to enhance their research
capabilities in the early postdoctoral stage of their careers. Postdoctoral Fellowships may be awarded to individuals
with Ph.D., M.D., D.D.S., D.M.D., D.V.M., or equivalent degrees, and five years or less of relevant postdoctoral
research experience. Awards are made initially for one or two years, and may be renewed in one-year increments up to
a maximum of five years in the Program. Initial stipends range between $25,000 and $30,000 per annum for investigators
with less than one year of postdoctoral experience, between $26,500 and $32,000 per annum for investigators with
one to two years of postdoctoral experience, between $28,000 and $34,000 per annum for investigators with two to three
years of postdoctoral experience, between $29,500 and $36,000 per annuam for investigators with three to four years
of postdoctoral experience, and between $31,000 and $38,000 for investigators with four to five years of postdoctoral
experience.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Predoctoral Fellowships are awarded to students enrolled in Ph.D., M.D., D.D.S., D.M.D., D.V.M., or equivalent
degree programs at fully accredited U.S. universities. Predoctoral Fellowships are designed to support a period
of full-time research training in NIH laboratories, undertaken as an integral part of participants' academic program.
Awards are generally granted for the purpose of developing and writing a thesis in an NIH intramural laboratory, although
other academically related training may occasionally be supported. For students pursuing a degree for which a thesis
is not required (e.g., M.D., D.V.M., etc.), a full-time training program in biomedical research will be designed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Students must be admitted to graduate or professional school and be a doctoral degree candidate before they can be
considered. Normally, most students will have completed their first year of graduate course work before beginning
the Program. Written agreement from the school is required. Predoctoral IRTA Fellows are normally expected to devote
full-time to their NIH training assignments. IRTA awards are not intended as grants to support academic training
and Predoctoral IRTA Fellows are normally expected to pay any university tuition, fees, or other costs themselves.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Predoctoral awards are made initially for one or two years, and may be renewed in one-year increments. The maximum
duration is normally three years or until students receive their doctoral degree, whichever comes first. In individual
cases, renewals beyond three years may be approved provided the student is making reasonable and acceptable progress
towards obtaining the doctoral degree.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3600&hyph;3619), the Department is authorized to investigate complaints alleging
discrimination in housing. Section 810(f) of the Fair Housing Act requires the Department to refer complaints to
agencies that have ``substantially equivalent'' fair housing standards, as determined and certified by the Department.
The certification standards and procedures are set forth in 24 CFR part 115. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP), the regulations for which are codified in 24 CFR part 111, the Department
may provide assistance to ``substantially equivalent'' State and local agencies. This assistance is designed to
provide support for complaint processing, training, technical assistance, data and information systems, and other
fair housing projects. The regulations in 24 CFR part 111 provide for FHAP funding to be announced through a Notice
of Funding Availability (NOFA) published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the regulations in part 111 provide for the announcement of the availability of FHAP funding through a NOFA
(and 24 CFR part 12 also makes note of the NOFA requirement), FHAP is not a competitive program. FHAP funds are not awarded
on the basis of a competition. Accordingly, a waiver of the requirement to make FHAP funding available through a NOFA
was requested and granted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the requirements of section 106 of the HUD Reform Act of 1989 (42 U.S.C. 3535(q)(g)), the Secretary,
on June 2, 1993, waived the FHAP NOFA requirement set forth in 24 CFR part 12 on the basis that the FHAP is not a competitive
program. The Department intends to amend 24 CFR part 12 to reflect the fact that FHAP is not a competitive program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the requirements of section 102(a)(4)(C) of the HUD Reform Act of 1989, the names and addresses
of the substantially equivalent agencies which received FHAP funds for FY 1992, on a noncompetitive basis, and the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The memorandum of understanding (MOU) establishing Federal jurisdictional boundaries for offshore facilities,
including pipelines, became effective on February 3, 1994. The MOU divides the responsibilities associated with
oil-spill prevention and control, response planning, and response equipment inspection for offshore facilities.
The MOU is among the Department of the Interior (DOI), Department of Transportation (DOT), and the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coast line marks the boundary that determines which agency is responsible for a facility. The MMS of the DOI is responsible
for offshore facilities, including pipelines but not deepwater ports, located seaward of the coast line. The EPA
is responsible for non-transportation-related offshore facilities located landward of the coast line. The U.S.
Coast Guard and the Research and Special Programs Administration of the DOT will handle transportation-related
offshore facilities, including pipelines, located landward of the coast line.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any exceptions to the MOU will be determined on a facility-specific basis, and the affected parties will be notified.

Executive Order (E.O.) 12777 (56 FR 54757) delegated to DOI, DOT, and EPA various responsibilities identified in
the Clean Water Act (CWA), as amended by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (Public Law 101&hyph;380). The E.O. 12777 assigned
the responsibilities associated with oil-spill prevention and control, contingency planning, and response equipment
inspection for offshore facilities to DOI. However, section 311(a)(11) of the CWA defines ``offshore facility''
to include facilities of any kind located in, on, or under navigable waters of the United States. By using this definition,
the traditional DOI role of regulating facilities in the Outer Continental Shelf is expanded by E.O. 12777 to include
inland lakes, rivers, streams, and any other inland waters. Without this MOU, as many as four Federal agencies could
have overlapping responsibilities for some coastal facilities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To avoid any confusion caused by the definition of ``offshore facility'', MMS coordinated an effort to establish
jurisdictional boundaries for oil-spill prevention and control, response planning, and response equipment inspection
activities. Pursuant to section 2(i) of E.O. 12777, the Secretary of the Interior redelegated those functions vested
in DOI to give EPA non-transportation-related offshore facilities located landward of the coast line and give DOT
transportation-related offshore facilities landward of the coast line. The divisions agreed to in the MOU (Appendix
A) is more consistent with traditional agency expertise and jurisdiction. This MOU does not include jurisdictional
boundaries for oil-spill financial responsibility.

Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) establishes the jurisdictional responsibilities for offshore facilities,
including pipelines, pursuant to section 311 (j)(1)(c), (j)(5), and (j)(6)(A) of the Clean Water Act (CWA), as amended
by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (Public Law 101&hyph;380). The Secretary of the Department of the Interior (DOI),
Secretary of Department of Transportation (DOT), and Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
agree to the division of responsibilities set forth below for spill prevention and control, response planning, and
equipment inspection activities pursuant to those provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order (E.O.) 12777 (56 FR 54757) delegates to DOI, DOT, and EPA various responsibilities identified in
section 311(j) of the CWA. Sections 2(b)(3), 2(d)(3), and 2(e)(3) of E.O. 12777 assigned to DOI spill prevention and
control, contingency planning, and equipment inspection activities associated with offshore facilities. Section
311(a)(11) defines the term ``offshore facility'' to include facilities of any kind located in, on, or under navigable
waters of the United States. By using this definition, the traditional DOI role of regulating facilities on the Outer
Continental Shelf is expanded by E.O. 12777 to include inland lakes, rivers, streams, and any other inland waters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 -->
Responsibilities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 2(i) of E.O. 12777, DOI redelegates, and EPA and DOT agree to assume, the functions vested in DOI
by sections 2(b)(3), 2(d)(3), and 2(e)(3) of E.O. 12777 as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of this MOU, the term ``coast line'' shall be defined as in the Submerged Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1301(c))
to mean ``the line of ordinary low water along that portion of the coast which is in direct contact with the open sea and
the line marking the seaward limit of inland waters.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. To EPA, DOI redelegates responsibility for non-transportation-related offshore facilities located landward
of the coast line.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. To DOT, DOI redelegates responsibility for transportation-related facilities, including pipelines, located

Notice is hereby given in accordance with provisions of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act,
25 U.S.C. 3003(d), of the completion of the inventory of human remains from Hawaii in the possession of the Peabody
Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The human remains came to the Peabody Museum as part of 16 collections between 1867 and 1959. There are no associated
funerary objects. A detailed inventory and assessment of the human remains has been made by the staff of the Peabody
Museum in consultation with representatives of

place, Maui County.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Five crania (16&hyph;8&hyph;70/59641&hyph;59645) from the beach beyond Diamond Sand Dunes Hill, Oahu.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Six crania (23&hyph;5&hyph;70/60363&hyph;60368) found during the excavation of a canal in Waikiki, Oahu.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two almost complete skeletons and fragmentary postcranial remains from five more individuals (23&hyph;5&hyph;70/60369&hyph;60372)
found while excavating for a sewer system in Honolulu County, Oahu.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three partial crania and six crania (36&hyph;4&hyph;70/N1324&hyph;N1332) from lava caves near Honolulu, Oahu.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four crania and three fragmentary crania (85&hyph;7&hyph;70/37592&hyph;37397a) that, from circumstantial documentary
evidence, may come from Oahu.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One cranium, one partial cranium and one partial cranium with two right femurs (86&hyph;58&hyph;70/61492&hyph;61494)
from Honolulu, Oahu.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Twenty seven crania (00/N939; 16&hyph;8&hyph;70/59646; 20&hyph;4&hyph;70/59931 and 59932; 50&hyph;70&hyph;70/N7476;
59&hyph;27&hyph;70/N8615&hyph;N8620; 80&hyph;25&hyph;70/23503&hyph;23517), fragmentary appendicular
elements (27&hyph;5&hyph;70/60797), and twenty four mandibles (00/N1013; 80&hyph;25&hyph;70/23519) are attributed
to Hawai'i with no further information. Six of these crania (59&hyph;27&hyph;70/N8615&hyph;N8620) came to the
Peabody Museum from the Warren Anatomical Museum.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the Museum have determined pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2) that
there is a relationship of shared group identity which can be reasonably traced between these remains and present-day
Native Hawaiian organizations.

Notice is hereby given in accordance with provisions of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act,
25 U.S.C. 3003(d), of the completion of the inventory of human remains and funerary objects from Hawaii in the control
of the U.S. Marine Corps Air Station, Kaneohe Bay. The remains are curated in the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum, Honolulu,
HI.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A detailed inventory and assessment of these human remains and funerary objects has been made for the U.S. Marine Corps
by the staff of the Bishop Museum, in consultation with representatives of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

and the Office of Hawaiian Affairs. The latter two organizations qualify as Native Hawaiian organizations as defined
in 25 U.S.C. 3001(11).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The human remains and funerary objects represent a minimum of 1582 individuals and 281 funerary objects recovered
from the Mokapu Peninsula, U.S. Marine Corps Air Station, Kaneohe Bay, Island of Oahu, and curated at the Bishop Museum.
The majority of the remains were recovered during archaeological excavations conducted in 1938&hyph;1940 by Gordon
T. Bowles (University of Hawaii) and Kenneth P. Emory (Bishop Museum), and in 1957 by Robert N. Bowen (University of
Hawaii). The rest of the remains were recovered from inadvertent discoveries and archaeological monitoring of construction
activities on the peninsula.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A minimum of 1,544 individuals were recovered from pre-contact (prior to 1778) graves. A number of these individuals
were represented by incomplete sets of skeletal remains, and several of the isolated individuals represented secondarily
deposited incomplete sets of remains removed from their original context. The pre-contact funerary objects included

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Aleurites moluccana) nuts, and the bones of fish, birds, pigs, dogs, and turtles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A minimum of 38 individuals were recovered from post-Contact (after 1778) graves during a construction project in
1975. The post-Contact funerary objects included

bottle fragments, a metal ring, ivory beads, bone and glass, metal nails, and metal parts of a smoking pipe. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the Bishop Museum report of the results of the inventory and assessment, officials of the U.S. Marine Corps
have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity which can be
reasonably traced between these remains and present-day Native Hawaiian organizations. U.S. Marine Corps officials,
based on the Bishop Museum report, determined that no lineal descendants of the human remains could be identified.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The objectives of the conference are to give the licensees and the public insight into our approach to safety regulations
and to provide a forum for feedback from those in attendance on their concerns about our overall approach, as well as
feedback on differences that may exist on technical issues. NRC staff will provide information regarding on-going
programs and potential new initiatives as a basis for discussion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Discussions will proceed from general (i.e., the plenary sessions) to specific (i.e., the breakout sessions), with
emphasis on plant operations and the NRC view of these operations based on experience in carrying out its regulatory
mission. Four plenary sessions are planned, three of which will be followed by breakout sessions that will include
presentations by the NRC staff and industry representatives.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Detroit Edison Company (the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License No. NPF&hyph;43 which authorizes
operation of the Fermi 2 Nuclear Plant at steady-state reactor power levels not in excess of 3430 megawatts thermal.
The Fermi 2 facility is a boiling water reactor located at the licensee's site in Monroe County, Michigan. The license
provides, among other things, that it is subject to all rules, regulations, and Orders of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(the Commission) now or hereafter in effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
II
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph III.A.6.(b) of Appendix J to 10 CFR part 50 requires, in part, that if two consecutive periodic Type A tests
fail to meet the applicable acceptable criteria in III.A.5.(b), a Type A test shall be performed at each refueling
shutdown or approximately every 18 months, whichever occurs first, until two consecutive Type A tests meet the acceptance
criteria, after which the normal inspection interval specified in III.D may be resumed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a), the NRC may grant exemptions from the requirements of the regulations (1) which are authorized
by law, will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety, and are consistent with the common defense and
security; and (2) where special circumstances are present.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
III
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated May 24, 1993, the licensee requested a one-time exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR part 50, Appendix
J, III.A.6.(b) identified above, which were in effect due to ``As-Found'' Type A failure in 1989 and 1992. The licensee
has verified that Type C leakage rates were the reason for the ``As-Found'' failures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The two ``As-Found'' Type A failures were caused by the addition of Type C penalties. The licensee indicated that to
date all containment deficiencies have been identified during Type C testing and; therefore, it is proposed that
Type C testing be relied upon in lieu of the increased frequency Type A test. Fermi 2 has established stringent LLRT
[local leak rate test] administrative leak rate acceptance criteria on a per valve basis, based on ASME Code guidance,
individual valve test maintenance history, design, function, and service. Test acceptance criteria range from
0.20 scfh [standard cubic feet per hour] to 15.00 scfh. This ensures valve leak tight integrity is maintained from
Type A test to Type A test. The licensee indicated that if valves are repaired when they exceed their individual administrative
acceptance criteria, and corrective modifications or replacement are implemented, the overall containment integrity
will be assured with future integrated leak rate tests (ILRTs) meeting their ``As-Found'' acceptance criteria.
The licensee indicated that the implementation of the proposed Corrective Action Plan and continued Type C leakage
testing provide reasonable assurance that the underlying purpose of Appendix J is being met. For details concerning
the licensee's corrective actions for the previous Type C valve leakage, see the staff's Safety Evaluation dated
February 22, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information Notice (IN) No. 85&hyph;71, ``Containment Integrated Leak Rate Tests,'' states that if Type B and C local
leakage rates constitute an identified contributor to the failure of the ``As-Found'' Type A test, the licensee may
submit a Corrective Action Plan with an alternate leakage test program proposal as an exemption request. If the submittal
is approved and an exemption granted, the licensee may implement the corrective action and alternate leakage rate
test program in lieu of the required increase in Type A test frequency incurred after the failure of two successive
Type A tests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
IV
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, the Commission concluded that the licensee's Corrective Action Plan and proposed alternative test
schedule are acceptable and that a Type A test during refueling outage four (RFO 4) is not necessary. The licensee has
identified the problem penetrations that caused previous Type A failures in 1989 and 1992, and has implemented corrective
actions to address these problems. There is reasonable assurance that the containment leakage-limiting function
will be maintained. The normal Type A test schedule in Section III.D of Appendix J (three tests in 10 years) will require
the next Type A test to be performed during RFO 5.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The special circumstances for granting this exemption pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12 have also been identified. As stated
in part in 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii), special circumstances are present when application of the regulation in the particular
circumstances is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule. The purpose of Section III.A.6.(b)
of Appendix J is to establish an increased testing frequency for Type A tests, where previous testing has demonstrated
unsatisfactory performance, in order to provide increased assurance that previous problems have been corrected.
After two consecutive tests at the increased testing frequency pass, the normal testing frequency of Section III.D.
may be resumed. By verifying that previous Type A test failures were due to Type C leakage and by implementing a Corrective
Action Plan to effectively correct previous Type C failure, the licensee has provided additional assurance that
containment integrity will be maintained. Consequently, the Commission concludes that the special circumstances
of 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii) exist in that application of the regulation in these particular circumstances is not necessary
to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
V
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, this exemption as described in Section
III above is authorized by law, will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety, and is consistent with
the common defense and security. The Commission further determines that special circumstances as provided in 10
CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii) are present justifying the exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Commission hereby grants a one-time exemption as described in Section III above from the requirement
in 10 CFR part 50, Appendix J, III.A.6.(b) to perform Type A containment ILRTs at an increased test frequency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this exemption will have no significant
impact on the environment (59 FR 6977).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This exemption is effective upon issuance.

1. Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated July 21, 1993, Kennecott Uranium Company, holder of Source Material License SUA&hyph;1350 for the
Sweetwater Uranium Mill, requested an amendment to License Condition No. 10.6 to allow for disposal of byproduct
material from U.S. Energy's Green Mountain Ion Exchange Facility, which is being decommissioned.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

2. Reason for Request to Amend License
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Kennecott Uranium Company's Sweetwater Mill is currently in a standby status. As a result, License Condition No.
10.6 limits disposal in the tailings impoundment to byproduct material in the form of debris generated by routine
site maintenance. Kennecott has requested that the license condition be amended to allow for disposal of byproduct
material from U.S. Energy Corporation's Green Mountain Ion Exchange Facility. This material is characterized as
byproduct material as defined in 10 CFR 40.4.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon completion of the NRC staff's review of Kennecott's request, notice of the action to be taken regarding the amendment
request will be published in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Public Service Company of Colorado (PSC or the licensee) is the holder of Possession-Only License (POL) No. DPR&hyph;34,
which authorizes possession and maintenance of the Fort St. Vrain Nuclear Generating Station (FSV). The license
provides, among other things, that the plant is subject to all rules, regulations, and Orders of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission now or hereafter in effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSV is a high-temperature, gas-cooled reactor that is located at the licensee's site in Weld County, Colorado. FSV
operated from January 31, 1974, to August 18, 1989. PSC shut down FSV due to control rod drive failures, and subsequently
made the shut down permanent due to a discovery of degradation of the steam generator ring headers. On November 5, 1990,
PSC submitted a Decommissioning Plan (DP) pursuant to 10 CFR 50.82 that proposed dismantling of FSV. On May 21, 1991,
the NRC revised License No. DPR&hyph;34 to POL that allows possession but not operation of FSV. The DP was approved
by NRC Order dated November 23, 1993. PSC is activately dismantling FSV. In addition, FSV has been defueled and all
fuel was transferred to the PSC Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation (ISFSI) The ISFSI is licensed under 10
CFR part 72.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated February 25, 1993, the licensee requested a reduction in their primary financial coverage and an exemption
from participation in the industry retrospective rating plan for secondary level coverage as required in 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The justification presented by the licensee for the exemption request is that FSV is not authorized to operate, all
nuclear fuel has been removed from the reactor facility and transferred to the ISFSI, and the risk of accidents resulting
in a radiological release is now considerably less than during plant operation. The licensee contends that, with
all nuclear fuel removed from the reactor facility, the potential accidents as evaluated in the FSV DP only involve
events such as fires, electrical power outages, and the dropping of activated or contaminated materials during dismantling.
PSC concludes that these events result in doses to an individual located at the emergency planning zone boundary that
are orders of magnitude below 10 CFR part 100 guidelines, and are a small fraction of U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency's ``Protective Action Guidelines.'' The NRC staff Safety Evaluation of the FSV DP (NRC Decommissioning Order
dated November 23, 1992) confirmed the PSC conclusion.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the possession-only license and the decommissioning order prohibits operation of FSV, and all spent fuel
has been transferred from the reactor, the licensee contended that FSV is outside the ambit of 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4)
and that 10 CFR 140.12 applies with its minimum requirement of $4,500,000 for financial protection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the licensee indicated that it believed that reduced financial protection is warranted and that $50,000,000
in primary financial protection provides adequate coverage for liability stemming from any potential accident.
PSC also cited the FSV DP to demonstrate that there were no credible accidents associated with FSV that are comparable,
in consequence or severity, to the design basis accidents of an operating facility. PSC concluded that the requested
$50,000,000 in primary financial protection insurance coverage is adequate for any fire, accident, or other hazardous
event that could credibly occur while decommissioning FSV.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PSC concluded that the requirement for secondary insurance only applies to plants licensed to operate and is not applicable
to FSV. PSC stated that it should not be unfairly burdened with financial liability at another nuclear facility because
potential damages from an accident at FSV are reduced to the extent that it could not benefit from the secondary protection.
The NRC staff independently evaluated the legal and technical issues associated with the application of the Price-Anderson
Act to permanently shutdown reactors in SECY&hyph;93&hyph;127, ``Financial Protection Required of Licensees
of Large Nuclear Power Plants During Decommissioning,'' May 10, 1993. In this evaluation, the staff concluded that
the NRC has discretionary authority to respond to licensee requests for reduction in the level of primary financial
protection and withdrawal from participation in the industry retrospective rating plan. Lastly, the staff concluded
that accidents and hazards insured against under Price-Anderson go beyond design basis accidents and beyond those
considered ``credible'' as that term is used in 10 CFR part 100 and in interpreting the application of that regulation.
The Commission issued a Staff Requirements Memorandum (SRM) based on SECY&hyph;93&hyph;127 on July 13, 1993. In
the SRM, the Commission approved the staff's recommendation to permit, through the exemption process, a reduction
of primary level coverage to $100,000,000 and a withdrawal from participation in the secondary financial protection
layer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the exercise of its discretionary authority, the NRC may, so long as a potential hazard exists at a permanently shutdown
reactor, require the full amount of primary financial protection and full participation in the industry retrospective
rating plan. At such time that the hazard is determined to no longer exist, the NRC may reduce the amount of primary financial
protection and permit the licensee to withdraw from participation in the industry retrospective rating plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the legislative history does not explicitly consider the potential hazards that might exist after termination
of operation, the staff generically evaluated the offsite consequences associated with normal and abnormal operations,
design basis accidents, and beyond design basis accidents for reactors that have been permanently defueled and shutdown.
The staff concluded that, aside from the handling, storage, and transportation of radioactive materials, no reasonably
conceivable potential accident exists at FSV that could cause significant offsite damage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A severe transportation accident could potentially result in local contamination requiring cleanup and offsite
liabilities resulting from traffic disruption and loss of use. This type of accident would warrant maintaining some
level of liability insurance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The most significant accident sequence for a permanently defueled and shut down reactor with no fuel onsite involves
a fire or the dropping of contaminated or activated components during decommissioning operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff independently evaluated the legal and technical justifications for the exemption presented by PSC.
The NRC recognizes that FSV is: (1) Permanently shutdown; (2) defueled; (3) licensed with ``possession only'' status
under a decommissioning order and an amended license that does not permit fuel at the reactor facility; and (4) actively
being dismantled. The staff concurred with the PSC's evaluation of credible accidents at FSV and their minimal associated
offsite consequences. The licensee identified need for continuing liability coverage, $50,000,000, was limited
to liability stemming from any fire, accident, or other hazardous events. However, coverage needs associated with
transportation of radioactive materials or precautionary evacuations were not identified. Although the licensee
presented legal views and opinions regarding the applicability of 10 CFR 140.12 versus 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4), the staff
did not concur with these legal views and opinions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee also contended that compliance with existing regulations would result in potential payment of retrospective
assessments under the secondary indemnity plan and payments of insurance premiums under the primary financial protection
plan. These payments would constitute an ``unfair burden'' to the licensee and its ratepayers. The staff recognizes
that relief from financial protection requirements is warranted because the potential hazards and consequences
associated with a permanently shut down reactor with no spent fuel are greatly reduced, and that a permanently shut
down reactor does not contribute a level of risk to the participants in the secondary pool proportionate to that of
an operating reactor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The staff, on its own initiative, did consider liability coverage needs associated with decommissioning activities
and transportation of radioactive materials. The results of our evaluation, as embodied in the July 13, 1993, SRM,
based on SECY&hyph;93&hyph;127, allow a reduction in the amount of financial protection required of licensees of
large nuclear plants that have been prematurely shut down. FSV meets the criterion established in SECY&hyph;93&hyph;127
for relief from financial protection requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the licensee requested a new primary financial protection coverage level of $50,000,000, the staff has
also concluded that claims settlement experience at the Three Mile Island Unit 2 (TMI&hyph;2) (an accident which
did not result in a significant release of radioactivity) provides a reasonable basis for establishing the appropriate
level of primary insurance coverage. Because TMI&hyph;2 claims have reached $60,000,000 and a large number of TMI&hyph;2
claims are still unsettled, the staff concluded that a level of $100,000,000 for primary financial protection coverage
is warranted. This level of primary insurance coverage is consistent with the SRM dated July 13, 1993.

The staff, based on its independent evaluation as embodied in the July 13, 1993, SRM on SECY&hyph;93&hyph;127 ``Financial
Protection Required of Licensees of Large Nuclear Power Plants During Decommissioning,'' has concluded that sufficient
bases exist for our approval of relief from the financial protection requirements for the FSV. The staff has also concluded
that granting the proposed exemption does not increase the probability or consequences of any accidents or reduce
the margin of safety at this facility.

Based on Sections III and IV above, the NRC has determined, that pursuant to 10 CFR 140.8, that this exemption is authorized
by law and is otherwise in the public interest. Therefore, the NRC grants an exemption from the requirements from 10
CFR 140.11(a)(4) to the extent that primary financial protection in the amount of $100,000,000 shall be maintained
and that an exemption from participation in the industry retrospective rating plan (secondary level financial protection)
is granted for FSV. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the NRC has determined that the granting of this exemption will not have a significant effect

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1377 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (19 U.S.C. 3106) requires the U.S. Trade Representative
(USTR) to review annually the operation and effectiveness of each telecommunications trade agreement in force between
the United States and another country or countries, and to determine whether any act, policy, or practice of the foreign
country that entered into the agreement (1) is not in compliance with the terms of the agreement, or (2) otherwise denies,
within the context of the agreement, mutually advantageous market opportunities to U.S. telecommunications products
and services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 1377, USTR has determined that certain practices of Japan with respect to cellular telephone
products and services are not in compliance with Japan's commitments under a June 28, 1989 agreement on third party
radio and cellular telecommunications equipment. Section 1377 requires this affirmative determination to be treated
as an affirmative determination under section 304(a)(1)(A) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2414(a)(1)(A)).
Accordingly, USTR will request the section 301 Committee to recommend what action, if any, should be taken under section
301 (19 U.S.C. 2411). USTR will publish notice of any proposed action and will provide an opportunity for interested
persons to present views.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This determination is the second affirmative determination under section 1377 on this issue. In the first determination,
made on April 28, 1989 (54 FR 19624), USTR found that, for the reasons cited below, Japan was not in compliance with agreements
on third party radio and cellular telecommunications equipment encompassed in a series of letters and joint communications
between the United States and Japan pursuant to the ``MOSS'' (Market-Oriented Sector-Selective) discussions that
took place between 1985 and 1987.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Specifically, USTR found that the Japanese Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) had declined to license
the operation in the Tokyo and Nagoya area of a cellular telephone system based on U.S. technology. This system was
licensed in the rest of Japan, but subscribers to the system could not use their cellular telephones in the Tokyo-Nagoya
area, i.e. they could not ``roam'' into Tokyo-Nagoya. Users of competing Japanese-technology cellular systems
could ``roam'' throughout the country. USTR determined that the failure to approve operation of a U.S. technology-based
system in the Tokyo-Nagoya area was inconsistent with the MOSS agreements, in which the Government of Japan committed
to take measures with respect to roaming in Tokyo-Nagoya by users of the U.S. technology-based system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following that determination, consultations led to the June 28, 1989 third party radio and cellular agreement that
is the subject of this determination. In the 1989 agreement, the Government of Japan committed to measures to enable
users of the U.S. technology-based system to roam in the Tokyo-Nagoya region. In the agreement, Japan reaffirmed
its commitment to the principle of ``comparable market access.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its review of the 1989 agreement, USTR found the following. To install the U.S. technology-based system in the Tokyo-Nagoya
region, MPT selected, notwithstanding concerns expressed by USTR and U.S. industry, a company that operates a competing
system in the Tokyo-Nagoya area using Japanese technology. This company has substantially delayed installing the
U.S. technology-based system in Tokyo. Nearly five years after the 1989 agreement, and nine years after the MOSS discussions
began, the new system covers only 40 percent of the Tokyo-Nagoya area. As a result, because users of the U.S. technology-based
system still are unable to roam throughout Tokyo-Nagoya, the U.S. technology-based system does not have comparable
market access with the Japanese systems, which offer full geographic coverage.

USTR has consulted with other executive agencies and the private sector during this review, and has had discussions
with the Japanese Government regarding this agreement on more than seven occasions between July, 1993 and February
15, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of this review, USTR has determined that MPT's failure to ensure full coverage for the U.S. technology-based
system in the Tokyo-Nagoya area nearly five years after the 1989 third party radio and cellular agreement is inconsistent
with the terms of that agreement, and denies, within the context of the terms of that agreement, mutually advantageous
market opportunities in Japan for telecommunications products and services of the United States.

On October 25, 1993, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange``) submitted to the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (``Act'')

<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 a proposal to amend paragraph (g)(1) of Exchange Rule 17.50, ``Imposition of Fines for Minor Rule Violations,'' to
establish a separate fine schedule for position limit violations which occur in non-CBOE member customer accounts
carried by CBOE member firms, including the accounts of non-member broker-dealers.

The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33291 (December 6, 1993),
58 FR 65207. No comments were received on the proposed rule change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, paragraph (g)(1) of Exchange Rule 17.50 provides the following fine schedule for persons who violate
the position limits established in CBOE Rule 4.11, ``Position Limits,'' and 24.4, ``Position Limits for Board-Based
Index Options:'' (1) A letter of caution plus $1 per contract over 5% of the applicable limit for one to three position
limit violations within one calendar year; (2) $1 per contract over the limit for four to six position limit violations
within one calendar year; and (3) $5 per contract over the applicable limit for seven or more position limit violations
within one calendar year. The CBOE proposes to amend paragraph (g)(1) to establish a separate fine schedule for position
limit violations which occur in non-CBOE member customer accounts (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
accounts of customers who are not CBOE members) carried by CBOE member firms, including the accounts of non-member
broker-dealers. The proposal will increase the number of cumulative infractions that may occur in non-member customer
accounts before a fine is triggered. Specifically, under new subparagraph (a), the following fines, which will be
imposed on CBOE member firms, will apply to position limit violations occurring in non-member customer accounts:
(1) A letter of caution for position limit violations up to 5% in excess of the applicable limit plus $1 per contract
above that level for one to six violations within one calendar year; (2) $1 per contract over the applicable limit for
seven to 12 position limit violations within one calendar year; and (3) $5 per contract over the applicable limit for
13 or more position limit violations within one calendar year. In calculating the fine thresholds for each CBOE member,
all non-member customer account position limit violations occurring within a single calendar year in all of the member's
non-member customer accounts will be added together.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Exchange proposes to rephrase the current language of subparagraph (b) to indicate more clearly
that a letter of caution is given for position limit violations of up to 5% of the applicable limit for one to three position
limit violations occurring within a single calendar year, and that a fine of $1 per contract applies to violations
exceeding that limit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange believes that the proposal accommodates key monitoring-related differences between non-member customer
accounts and the accounts of members. The CBOE states that although CBOE members are well positioned generally to
prevent, or to detect and promptly correct, position limit infractions in their own accounts or in accounts they carry
for CBOE market makers, the CBOE and its member are positioned less effectively to monitor the aggregate trading commitments
of non-CBOE broker-dealers or customers and to ensure the prompt correction of position limit violations by such
persons. The CBOE states that factors such as customers trading through multiple firms, customers entering into
Clearing Member Trade Assignment (``CMTA'') agreements,
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 firms having multiple registered representatives, and investment advisors managing several accounts make it more
difficult as a practical matter for member firms to prevent, or to detect and correct, a position limit violation by
a customer, including a broker-dealer ``customer,'' who is not a CBOE member. As a result, the CBOE believes that the
fine tiers suitable with respect to CBOE members' own accounts can be inappropriately strict when applied to firms
carrying a number of non-member customer accounts.

The CMTA is a process offered by the Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') which enables an OCC clearing member to
have trades executed on its behalf on an exchange without holding exchange membership. In order to participate in
this process, the OCC clearing member who has authorized an exchange member to execute trades on its behalf must file
a CMTA agreement with the OCC.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange believes that the proposal will permit the effective enforcement of the Exchange's position limit rules
while taking into account compliance and monitoring realities. The CBOE states that situations involving numerous
violations and/or substantial overages will continue to be referred to the CBOE's Business Conduct Committee (``BCC'')
for appropriate sanctions on a case by case basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of section 6(b)(5) in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just
and equitable principles of trade, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. In addition, the
Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with the section 6(b)(6) requirement that the rules of an exchange
provide that its members, and persons associated with its members, be appropriately disciplined for violation of
the rules of the exchange. Specifically, the Commission believes that the proposal, in this limited context, should
provide the CBOE with a prompt and effective means to enforce compliance with position limits while taking into account
the difficulties of CBOE members in detecting and correcting position limit infractions by non-member customers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission believes that the CBOE's proposal strikes a reasonable balance between the Exchange's need to enforce
its position limit rules and its desire to take into consideration the difficulties of CBOE members in detecting position
limit violations that occur in non-member customer accounts. Further, the Commission believes that the revised
fine schedule will prove sufficient to deter position limit violations. In this regard, by tallying the infractions
in all of a member's non-member customer accounts cumulatively for purposes of the fine schedule, the proposal will
require members to continually monitor compliance for position limit violations in non-member customer accounts.
In addition, the Commission notes that the CBOE plans to refer cases involving numerous violations and/or substantial
overages to the Exchange's BCC, thus providing the Exchange with the flexibility to impose a stricter sanction for
more egregious infractions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds that the CBOE's rephrasing of the current language of new subparagraph (b) is consistent with
the Act in that it clarifies Exchange Rule 17.50(b), thereby facilitating the enforcement of the rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;93&hyph;48) is approved.

Exchange Rule 96 currently prohibits a member registered as a Competitive Trader

 or Registered Competitive Market Maker (``RCMM'')
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 from initiating, while on the Floor of the Exchange, the purchase or sale, for his own account or his member organization's

A Competitive Trader is a NYSE member who is authorized to initiate proprietary transactions on the Floor of the Exchange
but who is not registered as a specialist, odd-lot dealer or Registered Competitive Market Maker. See NYSE Rules 111

of the Act. See also SEC Rule 11a1&hyph;1(T). In addition, the NYSE requires that 75 percent of a Competitive Trader's
monthly transactions must be stabilizing transactions under the tick-test. See NYSE Rule 112(d).

1. Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rule 96 was adopted in the mid-1930's after extensive investigations and public hearings by the Commission concerning
manipulative practices and ``pool'' operations involving the use of options. At present, Rule 96 prohibits a member
registered as a Competitive Trader or RCMM from initiating, while on the Floor, the purchase or sale, for his own account
or his member organization's account, of any stock in which he has an option position, or in which he knows his firm has
an option position. Rule 96 does not prohibit a Competitive Trader or RCMM from trading in options; rather, the rule
simply provides that such members may not initiate a proprietary trade in a stock on the Floor where they have an option
position in the stock. Rule 96 currently applies to all options, including those traded over-the-counter (``OTC
options``) and listed options.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the proposed rule change is to remove the prohibition in Rule 96 as to listed options. Thus, under the
proposed rule change, a Competitive Trader or RCMM would be permitted to initiate a proprietary purchase or sale of
stock on the Floor where he has a listed option position in that stock, but not where he has an OTC option position in that
stock.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is appropriate for three reasons:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) By removing a restraint on members' initiating transactions on the Floor, the proposed rule change can be expected
to add to the depth and liquidity of the Exchange market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Listed options are substantially different from the OTC options which Rule 96 was originally intended to regulate,
and any regulatory concerns that might arise as to listed options can be addressed by monitoring and surveillance
of revised Rule 96.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The proposed rule change will remove a competitive barrier to fair competition, since no other professionals
are subject to comparable restrictions.

Enhancement to the Exchange Market
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange established the membership categories of Competitive Trader and RCMM to provide a means whereby members,
subject to certain conditions, could add to the quality of the Exchange market by initiating proprietary transactions
on the Floor. The current restriction in Rule 96 defeats this purpose in some instances by precluding Floor professionals
from initiating such Floor transactions in any stock where they have an option position overlying such stock (or where
they know their member organization has such an option position).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange believes the proposed rule change will further the purposes of Rule 107 by facilitating RCMM participation
as dealers on the Exchange. Currently, the prohibition in Rule 96 conflicts with the purposes of Rule 107 by effectively
precluding RCMMs from participating as dealers in any stock where they have an option positin in that stock. By deleting
the prohibition in Rule 96 as to listed options, the proposed rule change will eliminate this barrier to RCMM dealer
participation, thereby permitting RCMMs to add to the depth and liquidity of the Exchange market in situation where
they currently may not do so.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a similar vein, the proposed rule change will facilitate transactions by Competitive Traders on the Floor by permitting
them to initiate such transactions in a stock where they have an option position in such stock. This enhanced ability
to initiate transactions on the Floor will, as with RCMMs, add to the depth and liquidity of the Exchange market.

Regulatory Concerns
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rule 96 was adopted in the mid-1930's to regulate trading where members have a position in OTC options, not listed options,
and the trading abuses in the OTC market that gave rise to Rule 96 are simply not present with respect to today's closely
surveilled trading in listed options. The Exchange believes that regulatory concerns as to listed option trading
can be addressed by monitoring and surveillance of revised Rule 96.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange notes that if the prohibition in Rule 96 were to be removed as to listed options, RCMMs and Competitive
Traders would remain subject to the restrictions on members' on-Floor proprietary transactions stated in Rules
108 and 112,
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 and thus would not be in any greater position to exploit their alleged time and place advantage over public investors.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Rule 108, an on-Floor order placed by a member to establish or increase a position in the member's proprietary
account is not entitled to priority, or precedence based on size, over an off-Floor order placed by a public customer.
On-Floor and off-floor are defined in rule 112; that rule also prohibits frontrunning of block transactions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Removal of Barrier to Fair Competition
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange notes that off-Floor professionals (including specialists and market makers on regional exchanges)
are not subject to any restrictions in effacing off-Floor proprietary trades in a stock where they have an option position
(whether a listed or OTC option) in that stock. Thus, off-Floor professional can be said to enjoy a significant competitive
advantage over Floor professionals on the Exchange, who are restricted in their on-Floor proprietary transactions
in a stock where they have an option position in that stock.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange acknowledges that a floor professional my initiate an off-Floor order in a stock where he has an option
position in that stock. However, a significant reason why Competitive Traders and RCMMs become registered as such
is to be able, in the routine conduct of their business, to initiate proprietary trades 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
on the Floor rather than ``upstairs.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Thus, the ability of Floor professionals to initiate off-Floor orders in a stock in which they have an option position
is largely meaningless when viewed in the context of the way such professionals routinely conduct their business.
The Exchange does not believe that any viewed in the context of the way such professionals routinely conduct their
business, when off-Floor professionals are not subject to comparable restrictions in the routine conduct of their
business.

SEC Staff Comments on SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;76&hyph;54
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to proposed changes to Rules 96, 102, and 105 that were submitted in file No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;76&hyph;54,
the SEC staff suggested that the Exchange's proposals be revised so that Floor professionals would be permitted to
use listed options only for hedging purposes.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Most of the SEC staff's comments were directed specifically at specialists' trading of specialty stock options pursuant
to Rule 105.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The NYSE submitted File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;76&hyph;54 to the Commission on October 22, 1976. The proposed rule
change was noticed for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release 12924 (October 27, 1976), 41 FR 48430 (November
3, 1976). The file, like other options proposals that raised significant regulatory issues, became dormant during
the ``options moratorium'' in order to allow the Commission to complete its Special Study of the Options Markets.
Shortly thereafter, the NYSE refiled its proposals to amend Rule 96 (File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;82&hyph;19) and
Rules 102 and 105 (File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;82&hyph;20). In early 1985, the Commission approved the latter rule
filing, thereby permitting NYSE specialists to trade options on their specialty stock but, consistent with the staff's
earlier comments, only for hedging purposes. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 21710 (February 4, 1985), 50 FR 5708 (February 11, 1985). The amendments to Rule
96, however, were noticed but never received Commission approval. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 20006 (July 26, 1983), 48 FR 35217 (August 3, 1983). On March 15, 1993, the NYSE
withdrew File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;82&hyph;19 and resubmitted the substance of that proposal as this File No.
SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;93&hyph;17.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While Rule 105 permits specialists to use listed options to offset the risks of making markets in stocks in which they
are registered, the Exchange does not believe that it would be appropriate to re-structure Rule 96 along the lines
of Rule 105. A ``hedging limitation'' in such a re-structured version of Rule 96 would have the effect of requiring
Competitive Traders and RCMMs to use listed options only to offset the risk of loss in stock positions which they acquired
as a result of orders in such stocks that were initiated on the Floor. In practice, such a limitation would be even more
restrictive than the current regulation, which, as noted above, permits Floor professionals to trade in listed options,
but simply precludes them from initiating an order on the Floor in a stock which underlies such option position. The
Exchange does not believe that making Rule 96 even more stringent than it is today would serve any valid regulatory
purpose.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, Rule 96 does not prohibit a Competitive Trader or RCMM from trading in options, but provides only that
he may not initiate a proprietary order on the Floor in any stock where he has an option position in that stock. The Exchange
does not believe that any sort of ``reverse hedging limitation'' in Rule 96 would make sense because it would mean,
in effect, that a Competitive Trader or RCMM could initiate a proprietary trade on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Floor if necessary to hedge an option position. However, the primary dealings of RCMMs and Competitive Traders are
in stocks, not the overlying options. In the Exchange's view, a ``reverse hedging limitation'' in Rule 96 would bear
no relation to the practical business dealings of RCMMs and Competitive Traders, and would constitute an unnecessary
burden of over-regulation given the minimal potential for trading abuse.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Statutory Basis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statutory bases for the proposed rule change are sections 6(b)(5), 6(b)(8) and 11A(a)(1)(c)(ii) of the Act. By
removing the prohibition on Competitive Traders and RCMMs initiating proprietary transactions on the Floor in a
stock where they have a listed option position in such stock, and thereby permitting such members to add to the depth
and liquidity of the Exchange market in situations where they may not currently do so, the proposed rule change will
have the effect of ``facilitating transactions in securities'' and will ``perfect the mechanism of a free and open
market,'' as called for in section 6(b)(5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To the extent that the proposed rule change permits Floor professionals to initiate transactions on a more equal regulatory
footing with other securities professionals, the proposed rule change is designed to eliminate unfair discrimination
between brokers or dealers, as called for in section 6(b)(5); to remove a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as called for in section 6(b)(8); and to promote fair competition among brokers
and dealers, as called for in section 11A(a)(1)(C)(ii).

The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary

other securities professionals.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicant is an internally managed, diversified closed-end registered investment company. As of December 31,
1993, applicant had outstanding 3,875,600 shares of common stock. Applicant's common stock is quoted on the NASDAQ
National Market System.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Before March 26, 1993, applicant was licensed to operate as a small business investment company (``SBIC'') under
the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended, and provided long-term, primarily variable rate, secured
loans to finance the growth, expansion, and modernization of small businesses. Applicant was granted an exemption
from various provisions of the Act and the rules thereunder to permit it to create a holding company structure.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The purpose of the holding company structure was to allow applicant to expand its business beyond that of an SBIC. Although
applicant is no longer an SBIC, it will continue to provide secured loans to finance the growth, expansion, and modernization
of small business entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5. To induce key employees to remain in the employ of applicant and its subsidiaries and to increase the incentive and
personal interest of such employees in the welfare of applicant and its subsidiaries, applicant's Board of Directors
on August 25, 1993, approved the 1993 Incentive Stock Option Plan (the ``Plan''). Applicant's shareholders subsequently
approved the Plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The Plan, which is substantially similar to the previous plans, provides for the grant of options to purchase a maximum
of 100,000 shares of applicant's common stock. Applicant has agreed not to issue more than 85,672 shares under the
Plan, so that the total number of shares that may be issued under all of applicant's incentive stock option plans will
not exceed 7.5% of applicant's currently issued and outstanding shares without a subsequent SEC order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Only key employees of applicant and its subsidiaries will be eligible to receive options. The Plan provides that
if an option granted under the Plan expires or is terminated unexercised, the shares of common stock covered by that
option will again be available for the grant of new options under the Plan. In addition, the Plan provides that not more
than 29,985 shares may be issued to one participant through the exercise of options granted under the Plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Applicant currently has five key employees (its three executive officers, its controller, and its general counsel),
who serve in identical capacities with the Subsidiary. Applicant anticipates that options to purchase shares of
common stock under the Plan will be granted to applicant's three executive officers when and if the requested order
is received. The number and specific terms of the options to be granted to such persons have not yet been determined.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Applicant's executive officers not only have the responsibility for making applicant's investments, but also
for making all executive and operational decisions. As the executive officers of applicant, their performance directly
affects applicant's performance and the value of applicant's common stock. To a lesser extent, the performance of
applicant's controller and its general counsel, who participate in operational decisions, but do not make executive
decisions, also directly affects the value of applicant's common stock. The performance of applicant's other employees
does not directly affect applicant's performance. It therefore would be inconsistent with the purposes of the Plan
to grant such employees stock options, since no matter how competently they performed their duties, their performance
probably would not affect the value of applicant's common stock.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. The Plan will be administered by the Compensation Committee of applicant's Board of Directors. The Compensation
Committee consists of five directors of applicant, a majority of whose members are not ``interested persons'' of
applicant, as defined in section 2(a)(19). Members of the Compensation Committee may not receive options under the
Plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. All of the options to be granted pursuant to the Plan will be incentive stock options within the meaning of section
422 (formerly section 422A) of the Code. As incentive stock options, the following restrictions apply:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The Plan must state the aggregate number of shares that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of options and the
class of employees eligible to receive options; the Plan also must be approved by applicant's shareholders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) All options must be granted within ten years of the date the Plan was adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Options may not be exercised more than ten years after the date on which they are granted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The exercise price of the options may not be less than the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of
grant. In accordance with this provision, options will be granted at the last quoted sale price of the underlying stock
on the date of grant or, if there is no sale on such date, the options will be granted at the mean between the closing bid
and asked quotations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Options may not be transferable by an optionee (otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution),
and may be exercised during the lifetime of the optionee only by the optionee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Options may not be granted to persons owning more than 10% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of applicant's
common stock at the time the options are granted.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(g) The aggregate fair market value (determined at the time the option is granted) of the stock with respect to which
options are exercisable for the first time by an individual in any calendar year may not exceed $100,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Stock acquired upon exercise of options may not be sold for two years from the grant date or one year from the exercise
date, whichever is later. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Options may be exercised by the optionee only if the optionee was an employee or officer of applicant during the
entire period commencing with the grant date and ending three months prior to the exercise date, unless termination
of employment is caused by death or disability, in which case the option may be exercised within one year following
termination of employment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. The Plan does not provide for the grant of stock appreciation rights. The Plan does permit the exercise price of
an option to be paid in cash or by tendering previously acquired shares of stock, valued at the fair market value as determined
by the Compensation Committee. In placing a fair market value on previously acquired shares of applicant's common
stock, applicant will use the same standards as are used in determining the fair market value at the time of the grant
of the option. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. The Compensation Committee may determine in its sole discretion that an adjustment in the number or kind of shares
reserved for issuance under the Plan but not yet covered by options or of the stock then subject to options is necessary,
or that an adjustment in the option price in each stock option agreement is necessary because of a change in the number
or kind of outstanding shares of stock of applicant (or of any stock or other securities into which such shares of stock
shall have been changed or for which it shall have been exchanged), whether through reorganization, recapitalization,
stock split, combination of shares, merger or consolidation, or any other change in the number or kind of outstanding
shares of stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. Applicant also has a profit sharing plan qualified under section 401(a) of the Code, which is intended to provide
a source of retirement income for employees. In accordance with the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended, applicant's profit sharing plan does not discriminate in favor of shareholders,
officers, and highly compensated employees as to coverage, benefits, contributions, or otherwise. Applicant to
date has not contributed the maximum permissible amount in any year. The Plan is not a substitute for a profit-sharing
plan qualified under section 401(a), as it is intended to provide incentive compensation and does not establish a
source of income for an employee's retirement years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicant's Legal Conclusions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 18(d) prohibits any registered management investment company from issuing warrants or rights to subscribe
to or purchase its securities except those issued ratably to a class of security holders with an exercise period of
up to 120 days, or in exchange for warrants in connection with a reorganization. The issuance of stock options by applicant
to its employees would not satisfy these statutory exceptions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The issuance of stock options to applicant's employees also would be prohibited under section 23. Section 23(a)
generally prevents a registered closed-end investment company from issuing any of its securities for services or
for property other than cash or securities. Because the issuance of stock options by applicant may constitute the
issuance of securities for services, absent exemptive relief, it would be prohibited by section 23(a). Section 23(b)
prohibits the sale by a closed-end investment company of any stock of which it is the issuer at a price below current
net asset value, except with the consent of a majority of its common stockholders at the time of issuance or under certain
other enumerated circumstances. If the net asset value of applicant's common stock were to increase following the
grant of an option, the option exercise price may be less than the net asset value of a share of applicant's common stock
on the date of exercise. Furthermore, section 23(c) generally prohibits the purchase by a registered closed-end
investment company of any securities of which it is the issuer. Thus, to the extent that payment for stock options with
previously acquired shares of applicant's common stock is considered to be a purchase by applicant of its own securities,
section 23(c) would prohibit the transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Section 17(d) and rule 17d&hyph;1(a) thereunder also prohibit an affiliated person of a registered investment
company from participating in, or offering a transaction in connection with, any joint enterprise or other joint
arrangement or profit-sharing plan in which the registered company is a participant unless an order permitting the
transaction has been granted by the SEC. Paragraph (c) of rule 17d&hyph;1 includes stock option plans in the definition
of joint enterprise, joint arrangement or profit-sharing plan prohibited by section 17(d). These provisions therefore
may prohibit any stock option plan absent an order from the SEC.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Although applicant is engaged primarily in the business of making loans to small businesses, it is no longer an SBIC
and therefore is unable to rely on an existing SEC order permitting SBICs to issue stock options to their employees
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 or on rule 17d&hyph;1(d)(4). Additionally, both the order and the rule specifically provide that the options granted
must be ``qualified stock options'' under former section 422 of the Code and must conform to the requirements of 13
CFR 805(b) adopted by the Small Business Administration. ``Qualified stock options'' were eliminated in 1976. Thus,
although the incentive stock options provided for in the Plan have many of the same characteristics as qualified stock
options under former section 422, they have some minor differences, which are fully described in the application.
Applicant is also unable to rely upon a similar order granted to the Association of Publicly Traded Investment Funds
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 because the order does not extend to registered closed-end investment companies that are engaged primarily in the
business of making loans to small businesses.

5. Section 6(c) provides that the SEC may grant an exemption from the provisions of the Act if such exemption is necessary
or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes intended by
the policy and provisions of the Act. Rule 17d&hyph;1(b) requires the SEC, in passing upon an application regarding
a joint enterprise, joint arrangement or profit-sharing plan, to consider whether the participation of the investment
company in the transaction is consistent with the policies and purposes of the Act and the extent to which such participation
is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants. Section 23(c)(3) requires the SEC
to insure that repurchases by closed-end funds of their own securities are on a basis which does not unfairly discriminate
against any holders of the class of securities to be purchased.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Applicant submits that the limitations on the requested order will provide protection to investors against dilution
of their 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
interests that are similar to those the SEC previously has found consistent with the purposes and policies of the Act
and even greater than those Congress imposed on stock options to be issued by business development companies. The
Plan has been approved by applicant's shareholders, and any options granted under the Plan must be approved by a majority
of applicant's directors who are not interested persons of applicant and who cannot participate in the Plan. In addition,
the total percentage of shares that could be issued under the Plan, the 1987 Plan, and the 1990 Plan will be limited to
7.5% of the outstanding shares of applicant's common stock.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Applicant states that the abuses and adverse effects of investment company stock options would have no applicability
to stock options granted under the Plan. The limited stock options that could be granted under the Plan would offer
no opportunity for any change in control of applicant or quick sale at a profit. Additionally, the options themselves
would not be transferable. Moreover, the existence and nature of the stock options granted by applicant would be fully
disclosed in accordance with the standards or guidelines adopted by the Financial Accounting Standards Board for
operating companies and the requirements of the SEC, and will be neither so extensive nor so complex as to make the financial
statements of applicant or management remuneration more difficult to understand.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Applicant's investments (other than investments in idle funds) are in small businesses, the securities of which
will not be publicly traded. In addition, all of applicant's investments in small businesses consist of non-convertible
secured loans. Under these circumstances, applicant believes that it is difficult to conceive a scenario in which
applicant's portfolio investments could create a short-term artificial increase in the price of applicant's stock.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
9. Applicant submits that, in the event this application is granted, any adverse impact on investor interests protected
by the Act will be minimal, and further, will be more than outweighed by the benefits to investors that will result from
permitting applicant to compete for top quality personnel on a more equal footing with its competitors. Applicant
competes primarily with banks and other entities that are not investment companies registered under the Act. These
organizations are able to offer stock options to employees and have an advantage over applicant in attracting and
retaining highly qualified personnel. In order for applicant to compete on a more equal basis with such organizations,
it has to have personnel as competent as such organizations, and in order to attract and retain such personnel, applicant
must be able to offer comparable compensation packages.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. For the foregoing reasons, applicant believes that the applicant satisfies the standards for relief set forth
in sections 6(c), 17(d), and 23(c) of the Act and rule 17d&hyph;1 thereunder.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Applicant's directors, including a majority of the directors who are not interested persons of applicant, will
review periodically the potential impact that the grant or exercise of stock options could have on applicant's earnings
and net asset value per share, such review to take place prior to any decisions to grant stock options, but in no event
less frequently than annually. Adequate procedures and records will be maintained to permit such review by applicant's
directors, and the directors will have the authority to take appropriate steps if necessary to ensure that neither
the grant nor the exercise of stock options would have an effect contrary to the interests of investors in these areas.
The directors' authority will include, in addition to the authority to prevent or limit the grant of additional stock
options, the authority to limit the number of stock options exercised in a given period of time if the directors conclude
that the effect on applicant's expenses or earnings would be contrary to the interests of investors or that net asset
value per share might be excessively diluted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. No more than 85,672 shares will be issued pursuant to the Plan, absent a subsequent exemptive order from the SEC with
respect to the remaining 14,328 shares authorized under the Plan.

DQE, Inc. et al. (70&hyph;8096)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DQE, Inc. (``DQE''), P.O. Box 68, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15230&hyph;0068, and its wholly owned subsidiary company,
Duquesne Enterprises, Inc. (``DE''), Grant Building, 330 Grant Street, suite 2420, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219,
both Pennsylvania public-utility holding companies exempt from registration under section 3(a)(1) of the Act pursuant
to Rule 2, have filed an application under sections 9(a)(2) and 10 of the Act in connection with the acquisition of Allegheny
Development Corporation (``ADC''), a wholly owned subsidiary of DE, that operates an energy services business.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DQE was organized in 1989 for the purpose of becoming a holding company for Duquesne Light Company (``DLC''), an electric
utility company, and other energy-related subsidiaries. DLC is engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution
and sale of electric energy and serves an area of approximately 800 square miles which includes the City of Pittsburgh.
DE's subsidiaries other than ADC are engaged in real estate ventures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1987 a competitive bidding process was initiated by the County of Allegheny, Pennsylvania (``County'') for the
design, installation and operation of facilities to provide a complete energy services package to the new Midfield
Terminal Complex being developed to replace the then existing airline terminal at the Greater Pittsburgh International
Airport (``Airport''). DLC was the supplier of electric energy to the Airport at that time. The applicants state that
DLC, a utility subject to the jurisdiction of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, was not in a position to
submit a competitive bid; however, it was important to participate in the bidding to avoid the loss of a significant
DLC customer when the Airport ceased operation. Consequently, ADC then a wholly-owned subsidiary of DLC, submitted
a bid to the County and was awarded the contract out of a field of 12 bidders. As a result, ADC became a public utility company
within the meaning of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 7, 1989, DLC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of QE by virtue of a merger transaction. ADC was still a wholly-owned
subsidiary of DLC. An Energy Services Agreement (``Agreement'') dated May 31, 1989 between the County and ADC was
entered into on July 27, 1989. In December 1989, DLC distributed all of the stock of ADC to DQE as a dividend and later
in December 1989, DQE contributed the ADC stock to the capital of DE.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agreement requires ADC to supply all of the electrical and thermal requirements of the Midfield Terminal Complex,
including electricity, hot water and chilled water. ADC purchases electricity at tariff rates from DLC and sells
a portion to the County at the unit costs specified in the Agreement. The County also is required to pay to ADC an annual
fixed charge related to ADC's investment in the facilities. The County is the sole customer for the energy services
provided by ADC.

OLS Acquisition Corp., et al. (70&hyph;8311) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OLS Acquisition Corporation (``Acquisition Corp.'') and OLS Energy-Berkeley (``Berkeley''), One Upper Pond Road,
Parsippany, New Jersey 07054, both indirect nonutility subsidiaries of Energy Initiatives, Inc. (``EII''), an
indirect subsidiary of General Public Utilities Corporation, a registered holding company, have filed an application-declaration
pursuant to sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, 12(a), and 12(b) of the Act and Rule 45 thereunder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By order dated August 1, 1989 (HCAR No. 24931), the Commission authorized OLS Power Limited Partnership, a Delaware
limited partnership and an indirect subsidiary of EII, to, among other things, acquire indirectly through Acquisition
Corp. all of the outstanding common stock of OLS-Energy-Chino, a California corporation (``Chino''), OLS Energy-Camarillo,
a California corporation (``Camarillo''), and Berkeley. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Berkeley, Chino and Camarillo are each lessees, pursuant to leases (``Leases'') with General Electric Capital Corporation
or a wholly owned subsidiary (collectively, ``GECC'') of operating cogeneration facilities (``Facilities'')
located in California, which are all qualifying facilities under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978.
The Leases expire, in the cases of Chino and Camarillo, on December 31, 2007, and in the case of Berkeley, on August 7,
2007, but may be renewed, subject to certain conditions, for up to 10 years at the lessee's option. Rent payable during
such renewal term would be the then fair market rent for the respective Facility, or, for an initial three year renewal
term, an amount which has been agreed upon if the renewal option which provides for payment of rent in such agreed upon
amount is elected by the lessee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the time of the acquisition, Berkeley, Chino and Camarillo each were parties to revolving credit agreements (``Credit
Agreement(s)'') with FECC that provided for the short-term working capital requirements of their respective Facilities.
Berkeley, Chino and Camarillo have issued secured promissory notes to GECC evidencing these borrowings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the acquisition, each company was unable to generate sufficient revenue from sales of steam and electricity
to pay its operating expenses and rent under its Lease on a current basis. In order to remedy the problem, the OLS Companies
ultimately reached agreement with GECC and their host institutions to restructure their Leases and the energy services
agreements under which they sell electricity and steam to their host institutions (``Energy Services Agreements'').

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 30, 1991, Chino and Camarillo entered into agreements with GECC and their respective host institutions
which, among other things, reduced the rent payable to GECC under their respective Leases, increased the amount each
could borrow and reduced the rate of interest payable under their respective Credit Agreements and reduced certain
rebates payable to their host institutions under their respective Energy Service Agreements. The amendments to
Chino's and Camarillo's Credit Agreements were authorized by orders of the Commission dated February 9, 1990 and
December 26, 1990 (HCAR Nos. 25038 and 25230). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Pursuant to authorization granted in five previous orders of the Commission issued from 1990 through 1992, Berkeley
has previously amended its Credit Agreement to, among other things, increase the aggregate amount of the borrowings
which may be outstanding at any time from $1 million to $1.25 million, extend the time period for borrowings to December
31, 1994, and reduce the rate of interest from 5% over the prime rate, as defined, to 3% over the prime rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to negotiations with GECC and the University of California at Berkeley (``University''), where the Berkeley
Facility is located, Berkeley now proposes to restructure (``Restructure'') the Lease with GECC as well as the Energy
Services Agreement with the University and related agreements. Berkeley also proposes to further amend the Credit
Agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Restructure contemplates, among other things, that (i) rent payable to GECC under Berkeley's Lease will be reduced,
effective December 31, 1993, by approximately $780,000 per year and will be payable quarterly in amounts which track
expected revenue, rather than semi-annually in equal payments, and (ii) rebates payable to the University under
the Energy Services Agreement will be reduced or deferred to increase the cash retained by Berkeley to pay operating
expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of the Restructure, Berkeley proposes to borrow, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent,
up to an aggregate amount outstanding of $1 million under a loan facility (``Overhaul Loan Facility'') as part of the
Berkeley Credit Agreement with GECC. The Overhaul Loan Facility would be used to fund the cost of major repairs, nonroutine
maintenance activities and overhauls of its Facility; provided that the initial advance under the Overhaul Loan
Facility may be used to pay amounts due fuel suppliers and the operator of the Facility, costs incurred to consummate
the Restructure, prepayments of working capital advances and rent under Lease.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Borrowings under the Overhaul Loan Facility may be made from time to time until August 7, 2007, and would bear interest
at a rate per annum of 3% in excess of the rate of interest per annum publicly announced by Morgan Guaranty Trust Company
as its commercial reference rate, or certain substantially equivalent rates of interest per annum if Morgan Guaranty
Trust Company ceases to announce such a rate of interest. Borrowings would be repayable on a fixed amortization schedule
over the lesser of three years or the remaining term of Berkeley's restructured Lease (August 7, 2007).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The obligation of GECC to make each loan under the Overhaul Loan Facility would be subject, among other conditions,
to the delivery of certain documentation, the absence of a material adverse change in the financial condition of Berkeley,
the showing by Berkeley in form and substance satisfactory to GECC that Berkeley will have sufficient cash to repay
the loan and the absence of a default under, among other agreements, the amended Lease and the amended Credit Agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Berkeley also proposes to make the following amendments to the Credit Agreement: (1) Provide for the Overhaul Loan
Facility with GECC and borrow thereunder from time to time prior to August 7, 2007 in amounts of up to $1 million at any
time outstanding and issue to GECC its promissory note evidencing such borrowings; (2) change the aggregate amount
of the borrowings which may be outstanding at any time thereunder to the lesser of $1.25 million or $1.5 million less
the aggregate face amount of outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement; (3) extend until August
7, 2007, which is the end of the term of Berkeley's restructured lease, for borrowings to be made and letters of credit
to be outstanding under the Credit Agreement; (4) provide that borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be made only
upon the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, such as certain documentation and the absence of a default
under, among other agreements, the amended lease and the amended Credit Agreement; and (5) provide for an origination
fee of $2,500 for the issuance of letters of credit in replacement of those presently outstanding under the Credit
Agreement, plus an annual fee of 1% per annum of the face amount of any such replacement letter of credit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Acquisition Corp. also proposes to enter into a pledge agreement with U.S. Trust Company of New York, the owner trustee
and lessor or Berkeley's facility under its lease, pledging Berkeley's stock as security for Berkeley's obligations
under its amended Credit Agreement and in connection with the Restructure. Outstanding borrowings under the amended
Credit Agreement would be required to be repaid in full annually and the amended Credit Agreement would contain certain
other mandatory and optional prepayment provisions.

Applicants propose to effect such redemptions by issuing new preferred stock with a lower dividend rate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants will not enter into the proposed refunding transactions unless, in each instance, the estimated present
value savings derived from the net difference between interest payments on the new issue of comparable securities
and on the securities to be refunded is, on an after tax basis, greater than the present value of all redemption and issuing
costs, assuming an appropriate discount rate. The discount rate used shall be the estimated after tax interest rate
on the securities to be issued.

Applicant's Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicant is a diversified open-end management investment company organized as a Massachusetts business trust.
On November 21, 1989, applicant filed a notification of registration pursuant to section 8(a) of the Act and a registration
statement pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933. The registration statement became effective on January 11, 1990,
and applicant commenced its initial public offering shortly thereafter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. On June 11, 1993, applicant's board of directors approved a plan of reorganization whereby applicant agreed to
transfer substantially all of its assets to Smith Barney Shearson Aggressive Growth Fund Inc. (the ``Acquiring Fund''),
in exchange for shares of beneficial interest of the Acquiring Fund and the assumption by the Acquiring Fund of certain
liabilities of applicant. In accordance with rule 17a&hyph;8 of the Act, applicant's directors determined that
the sale of applicant's assets to the Acquiring Fund was in the best interests of applicant's shareholders, and that
the interests of the existing shareholders would not be diluted as a result.

1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicant and the Acquiring Fund may be deemed to be affiliated persons of each other by reason of having a common investment
adviser. Although purchases and sales between affiliated persons generally are prohibited by section 17(a) of the
Act, rule 17a&hyph;8 provides an exemption for certain purchases and sales among investment companies that are affiliated
persons of each other solely by reason of having a common investment adviser, common directors, and/or common officers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. In approving the reorganization, the directors considered various factors, including, (a) the generally similar
investment objectives and policies of applicant and the Acquiring Fund, (b) the fact that the funds have the same investment
adviser, administrator, custodian, and transfer agent, (c) the significant savings in expenses for application's
shareholders, and (d) the fact that the larger asset base of the combined funds should result in further reduction
of expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Proxy materials soliciting shareholder approval of the reorganization were distributed to applicant's shareholders
of record on or about August 18, 1993. Preliminary and definitive copies of the proxy materials were filed with the
SEC. Applicant's shareholders approved the reorganization at a special meeting held on October 12, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. As of October 15, 1993 (the ``Closing Date''), applicant had 2,634,771 and 48,102 shares of Class A and Class B, respectively,
outstanding, having a net asset value of $26,604,523 and $482,443, respectively, and a per share net asset value of
$10.10 and $10.03, respectively. On the Closing Date, the reorganization was consummated. Applicant transferred
all, or substantially all, of its assets and certain stated liabilities to the Acquiring Fund. In exchange, the shareholders
of applicant received shares of the Acquiring Fund having an aggregate net asset value equal to the aggregate net asset
value of their investment in applicant. Holders of Class A shares of applicant received Class A shares of the Acquiring
Fund, and holders of Class B shares of applicant received Class B shares of the Acquiring Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. On the Closing Date, applicant paid a capital gain distribution of $0.5240 per share which, together with all previous
such dividends, had the effect of distributing to its shareholders all of its respective investment company taxable
income for the taxable year ending on or prior to the Closing Date (computed without regard to any deduction for dividends
paid) and all of its respective net capital gain realized in the taxable year ending on or prior to the Closing Date (after
reduction for any capital loss carry forward).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The expenses in connection with the reorganization consisted of legal, accounting, printing, and administrative
expenses totalling approximately $20,000. These expenses were borne by applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. As of the date of the application, applicant had no shareholders, assets, or liabilities. Applicant is not a party
to any litigation or administrative proceedings. Applicant is not presently engaged in, nor does it propose to engage
in, any business activities other than those necessary for the winding up of its affairs.

Safeguards: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Computers provide privacy and access limitations by requiring a user name and password match. Access to decentralized
segments are similarly controlled. Only those personnel with a need to have access to the system are given user names
and passwords. The magnetic tape backups have limited access in that users must justify the need and obtain tape numbers
and volume identifiers from a central source before they are provided data tapes. Paper record and microfilm records
are in limited access areas in locking storage cabinets.

Retention and disposal: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Leave and Earnings Statements, and pay records are microfilmed and retained on site four years, then archived at the
Federal Record Center, and destroyed when 50 years old. The official copy of the personnel record is maintained in
the Official Officer Service Records, DOT/CG 626 for active duty officers, the Enlisted Personnel Record System,
DOT/CG 629 for active duty enlisted personnel or the Official Coast Guard Reserve Service Record, OST/CG 576 for inactive
duty reservists. Duplicate magnetic copies of the pay and personnel record are retained at an off site facility for
a useful life of seven years. Paper records for waivers and remissions are retained on site six years three months after
the determination and then destroyed. Paper records to determine legal sufficiency for garnishment are retained
on site six years three months after the member separates from the service or the garnishment is terminated and then
destroyed.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice announces that the FAA finds that the noise exposure maps submitted for Saipan International Airport
are in compliance with applicable requirements of part 150 effective February 14, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 103 of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the Act''),
an airport operator may submit to the FAA noise exposure maps which meet applicable regulations and which depict noncompatible
land uses as of the date of submission of such maps, a description of projected aircraft operations, and the ways in
which such operations will affect such maps. The Act requires such maps to be developed in consultation with interested
and affected parties in the local community, government agencies, and persons using the airport.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An airport operator who has submitted noise exposure maps that are found by FAA to be in compliance with the requirements
of Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) part 150, promulgated pursuant to title I of the Act, may submit a noise compatibility
program for FAA approval which sets forth the measures the operator has taken or proposes for the reduction of existing
noncompatible uses and for the prevention of the introduction of additional noncompatible uses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has completed its review of the noise exposure maps and related descriptions submitted by the Commonwealth
Ports Authority. The specific maps under consideration are Figures 4&hyph;1 and 6&hyph;2 in the submission. The
FAA has determined that these maps for Saipan International Airport are in compliance with applicable requirements.
This determination is effective on February 14, 1994. FAA's determination on an airport operator's noise exposure
maps is limited to a finding that the maps were developed in accordance with the procedures contained in appendix A
of FAR part 150. Such determination does not constitute approval of the applicant's data, information or plans, or
a commitment to approve a noise compatibility program or to fund the implementation of that program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If questions arise concerning the precise relationship of specific properties to noise exposure contours depicted
on a noise exposure map submitted under section 103 of the Act, it should be noted that the FAA is not involved in any way
in determining the relative locations of specific properties with regard to the depicted noise contours, or in interpreting
the noise exposure maps to resolve questions concerning, for example, which properties should be covered by the provisions
of section 107 of the Act. These functions are inseparable from the ultimate land use control and planning responsibilities
of local government. These local responsibilities are not changed in any way under part 150 or through FAA's review
of noise exposure maps. Therefore, the responsibility for the detailed overlaying of noise exposure contours onto
the maps depicting properties on the surface rests exclusively with the airport operator which submitted those maps,
or with those public agencies and planning agencies with which consultation is required under section 103 of the Act.
FAA has relied on the certification by the airport operator, under &sect;150.21 of FAR part 150, that the statutorily
required consultation has been accomplished.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Technical Standard Order (TSO) is being revised to incorporate standards for Global Positioning System (GPS)
technology into the standards for multi-sensor navigation systems. In December 1992, TSO&hyph;C129 was issued
to provide minimum operational standards for GPS navigation equipment. This TSO established requirements on multi-sensor
equipment that uses GPS as a navigation source. This revision to TSO&hyph;C115a incorporates those criteria in the
multi-sensor standard. No new criteria have been established by these changes. This revision incorporates only
previously published standards into this TSO.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given that the Burlington Northern Railroad Company (BN) has submitted a petition requesting that
the use of ``Bulldog'' Clamps be approved for an additional two years. BN had previously been granted a waiver of the
requirements of portions of the Track Safety Standards (49 CFR part 213) to allow the carrier to apply Bulldog Clamps
to certain internal rail defects in lieu of conventional rail joint bars on certain BN line segments. See 55 FR 50266
and 56 FR 13515. BN is presently required to remove the clamp within five days of its application to the rail. If the internal
defect has not been removed in that time, bolted joint bars have to be applied. In its petition, BN also requests that
the five day period be increased to twenty days.

<USBUREAU>Federal Railroad Administration Petition for Waivers of Compliance</USBUREAU>
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with Title 49 CFR 211.9 and 211.41, notice is hereby given that the Federal Railroad Administration
(FRA) has received a request for waivers of compliance with certain requirements of the Federal safety laws and regulations.
The petition is described below, including the regulatory provisions involved, the nature of the relief being requested
and the petitioner's arguments in favor of relief.

Southern California Regional Rail Authority (SCAX) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Due to the devastation caused by the January 17 earthquake 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Los Angeles, California area, a transportation emergency now exists. To alleviate this situation SCAX has
arranged to lease 25 bi-level passenger cars and 7 power cars from GO Transit of Toronto, Ontario. The SCAX presently
operates 94 bi-level cars over Metrolink, a regional rail network which links downtown Los Angeles and surrounding
counties. The GO Transit cars are nearly identical to the 94 cars purchased by SCAX. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SCAX seeks waivers of compliance from certain sections of the Federal Railroad Administration regulations which
are described herein.

FRA Docket Number SA&hyph;94&hyph;2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SCAX is requesting that it be permitted to operate 25 GO Transit bi-level commuter passenger cars and 7 power cars
which do not fully comply with the Railroad Safety Appliance Standards (49 CFR part 231). Section 231.14(b)(2) (``Passenger-train
cars without platforms'') requires that the top tread of the sill step have a minimum clear depth of 8 inches. Section
231.14(c)(3) requires that the side corner handholds be located specifically in relation to the center line of the
coupler. SCAX says that these safety appliances may not be properly configured.

FRA Docket Number RSGM&hyph;94&hyph;3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SCAX seeks a temporary waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the Safety Glazing Standards (49 CFR part
223) for 25 GO Transit passenger cars and 7 power cars. The glazing material installed in the equipment is manufactured
to CSA-D263&hyph;1972 (ANSI Z.26.1) standards, laminated safety glass suitable for locomotives and railway cars.
The side facing and end facing glazing material is not in compliance with 49 CFR 223.15.

FRA Docket Number RST&hyph;94&hyph;1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SCAX is requesting a waiver of compliance from the requirements of &sect;213.57(b) of the Track Safety Standards
(49 CFR part 213). Section 213.57(b) limits the operation of trains on curved track to speeds which produce no more
than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three 3 inches of underbalance. SCAX requests a waiver to operate their passenger equipment at curving speeds producing
no more than four 4 inches of underbalance. SCAX maintains that curving speeds producing 4 inches of underbalance
still provides a large measure of safety for passenger train operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to the transportation emergency existing in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Los Angeles area, FRA has, on a temporary basis, conditionally waived compliance with the relevant portions of the
rail safety regulations. FRA has, however, reserved the right to withdraw such approval upon receipt by FRA of public
comment raising substantial issues of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties are invited to participate in these proceedings by submitting written reviews, data, or comments.
FRA does not anticipate scheduling a public hearing in connection with these proceedings since the facts do not appear
to warrant a hearing. If any interested party desires an opportunity for oral comments, they should notify FRA, in
writing, before the end of the comment period and specify the basis for their request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All communications concerning these proceedings should identify the appropriate docket number (e.g., Waiver Petition
Docket Number SA&hyph;94&hyph;3) and must be submitted in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Chief Counsel, Federal

before March 29, 1994, will be considered by FRA before final action is taken. Comments received after that date will
be considered as far as practicable. All written communications concerning these proceedings are available for

Part 151 of the Customs Regulations provides for the acceptance at Customs Districts of laboratory analyses and gauging
reports for certain products from Customs accredited commercial laboratories and approved gaugers. Camin Cargo
Control, Inc., a Customs commercial approved gauger and accredited laboratory, has applied to Customs to extend
its Customs gauger approval and certain laboratory accreditations to its Ingleside, Texas facility. Review of the
qualifications of the Ingleside site shows that the extension is warranted and, accordingly, has been granted.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to section 5(v) of the Home Owners' Loan Act, 12 U.S.C. 1464(v), each savings association is required to make
reports of condition to the OTS in a form prescribed by OTS. Section 5(v) further requires that such reports and all
of the information they contain be available to the public unless the Director determines that public disclosure
of a particular item would not protect the safety or soundness of a particular institution or institutions or the Savings
Association Insurance Fund, or would not otherwise be in the public interest. If the Director restricts disclosure
of any item for savings associations generally, that fact and the reason therefor are to be disclosed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 7, 1990, the OTS gave notice that certain information collected on the Thrift Financial Report (TFR) would
not be publicly disclosed.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In that notice, OTS specifically discussed maturity/repricing/rate information collected on Schedule MR and used
to measure interest rate risk. The agency indicated that it would be premature and misleading to release such information
at that time, because it was in the process of expanding and enhancing its collection and analysis of such data. OTS
anticipated that after such enhancements were complete, it might be appropriate to disclose this interest-rate-risk
related schedule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and has replaced Schedule MR with Schedule CMR. As that regulation and schedule have evolved, it has become apparent
to the agency that releasing the information collected on Schedule CMR would not be in the public interest and would
be detrimental to the safety and soundness of the thrift industry.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OTS uses the information collected on Schedule CMR to monitor the interest-rate-risk profiles of both individual
thrifts and the entire industry. Under the new regulation, however, small (under $300 million in assets), highly
capitalized (a risk-based capital ratio in excess of 12 percent) institutions are generally not required to file
Schedule CMR. This exemption covers well over half of the industry. OTS exempted these institutions from the filing
requirements applicable to other savings associations because it believed that they generally held sufficient
capital against potential interest rate risk. OTS encourages these savings associations to voluntarily file Schedule
CMR with the agency to enable it to measure the industry's overall interest rate risk more accurately. The OTS can then
provide these institutions with an assessment of their interest rate risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Making Schedule CMR data publicly available could have several adverse consequences. First, the publication of
data from only those required to file Schedule CMR would give a distorted view of the industry's interest rate risk
profile because such a large portion of the industry is exempt from filing this schedule of the TFR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, OTS is concerned that if Schedule CMR data from individual institutions were made publicly available, current
and potential voluntary filers would be far less likely to file Schedule CMR. In fact, a number of institutions have
indicated that they will not file Schedule CMR voluntarily if the information is disclosed publicly. They have indicated
that information on Schedule CMR has competitive significance. In particular, these institutions are concerned
that disclosure would allow their competitors to gain access to important financial information about their portfolios,
pricing strategies, and risk exposures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If such voluntarily filing thrifts chose not to file Schedule CMR, OTS's ability to measure the interest rate risk
of these institutions would be severely hampered. Because understanding and effectively managing interest rate
risk has historically been, and remains, of critical importance to a healthy thrift industry, OTS believes it is in
the public interest to encourage, not discourage, voluntary reporting of Schedule CMR data by otherwise exempt savings
associations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, if the data from only mandatory filers were made publicly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available, such institutions would be competitively disadvantaged in comparison not only to exempt thrifts, but
also to commercial banks and state-chartered savings banks, who are not required to file similar data with their regulators.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, the OTS has determined not to make publicly available the data of individual institutions reported
on Schedule CMR. The agency, however, does intend to make publicly available aggregate CMR data for selected industry
peer groups.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This NOFA announces a total of $74 million in funding, including FYs 1993 and 1994 appropriations of $25,000,000 and
$25,674,991, respectively, for Family Investment Centers for families living in public and Indian housing. This
program provides grants to public housing agencies and Indian housing authorities (collectively HAs) to provide
families living in public and Indian housing with better access to education and job opportunities to achieve self-sufficiency
and independence. The grants will be of up to three to five years in duration, depending upon the activities undertaken.
Regulations on this program will be published in a consolidated rule on resident initiatives that the Department
anticipates publishing in early 1994.

Paperwork Reduction Act Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The information collection requirements contained in this notice have been submitted to the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) for review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501&hyph;3520). Information on
the estimated public reporting burden was provided for public comment in a separate notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 17, 1994 (59 FR 8012). The Department expects that a control number will be issued by OMB about March 22,
1994, after completion of a 30-day comment period for the paperwork burden notice. The OMB control number, when assigned,
will be announced by separate notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No person may be subjected to a penalty for failure to comply with the information collection requirements until they
have been approved and assigned an OMB control number. The public reporting burden for the collection of information
requirements contained in the February 17 notice is estimated to include the time for reviewing the instructions,
searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection
of information. The February 17 notice invites interested persons to submit comments on the paperwork burden proposals
to Joseph F. Lackey, Jr., OMB Desk Officer, Office of Management and Budget, New Executive Office Building, Washington,
DC 20503.

I. Purpose and Substantive Description 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 22 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437t) provides for the establishment of Family Investment
Centers (FIC). Implementing regulations for the program will be promulgated as part of a consolidated rule on resident
initiatives, which the Department anticipates publishing next year. This NOFA is being issued in conformity with
the statutory requirements before the final rule is in place in order to make funding available as soon as possible.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Allocation Amounts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations
Act, 1993 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;389, approved October 6, 1992), Congress appropriated $25 million for Family Investment
Centers; an additional $25,674,991 is available for the program through an appropriation in the Departments of Veterans
Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;124,
approved October 28, 1993). These amounts are being combined with excess recaptured funds carried over from FY 1993
to make a total of $75 million available for funding Family Investment Center activities. An additional $10 million
may become available pending Secretarial and congressional actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the $75 million total current funds, $74 million is being made available under this NOFA. The Department intends
to use $1 million for purposes of demonstrating ways for families living in public and Indian housing in a neighborhood
undergoing a concentrated effort of local revitalization to gain access to education and employment activities
to achieve self-sufficiency and independence, by enabling HAs to develop facilities for training and support services.
These funds will be used to mobilize public and private resources to expand and improve delivery of services, to provide
funding for essential training and support services that cannot otherwise be funded, to improve the capacity of management
to assess the training and services needs of eligible families, to coordinate the provision of training and services
that meet such needs and to ensure the long-term provision of such training and services. HUD expects that this funding
will demonstrate the importance of comprehensive support services in contributing to the local neighborhood revitalization.
A separate Notice announcing these funds and soliciting public comment is expected to be published soon in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure that the program is implemented on a broad, nationwide basis, each applicant may submit only one application
under this NOFA (published: February 28, 1994. A public housing agency/Indian housing authority (collectively,
HAs) may apply to establish one or more Family Investment Centers for more than one public or Indian housing development;
however the maximum grant amount per applicant under this NOFA is $1 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Overview and Policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The stated purpose of section 22 is: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[T]o provide families living in public housing with better access to educational and employment opportunities to
achieve self-sufficiency and independence by: (a) developing facilities in or near public housing for training
and support services; (b) mobilizing public and private resources to expand and improve the delivery of such services;
(c) providing funding for such essential training and support services that cannot otherwise be funded; and (d) improving
the capacity of management to assess the training and service needs of families, coordinate the provision of training
and services that meet such needs, and ensure the long-term provision of such training and services.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although Section 22 is phrased in terms of families living in public housing, the program is also available to Indian
Housing Authorities (IHAs), because of section 527 of the National Affordable Housing Act (104 Stat. 4216; 42 U.S.C.
1437aa note) (NAHA). Section 527 extends the applicability of many NAHA provisions affecting Title I of the 1937 Act
(including section 515, which added Section 22) to housing operated by an IHA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FIC provides funding to HAs to access educational, housing, or other social service programs to assist public and
Indian housing residents toward self-sufficiency. On May 13, 1993, 33 representatives from public/Indian housing
authorities, resident organizations, and nonprofit housing agencies were convened to discuss and make suggestions
during the design stage of the Family Investment Centers program. The Department envisions that FIC will complement
other self-sufficiency activities, such as the Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) Program (see 58 FR 30858 (May 27, 1993)
for the interim rule that currently governs the FSS programs) and the requirements of Section 3 of the Housing and Urban
Development Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C. 1701u). As an incentive to become self-sufficient, the earnings of public or Indian
Housing families participating in the FIC shall not be treated as income for the purposes of any other program or provision
of State or Federal law, including rent assistance (see Section I.F(5) of this NOFA). The FIC is administered by the
Department's Office of Resident Initiatives in the Office of Public and Indian Housing, with assistance from a network
of Resident Initiatives Coordinators (RICs) in HUD's Regional and Field Offices.

Eligible Applicants.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Funding for this program is limited to public and Indian housing authorities. The factors for award reflect that more
than half of the points possible are for the provision of supportive services, whether provided by the HA or through
partnerships with other social service agencies. Facilities assisted shall be on or near the premises of public or
Indian housing. Two or more HAs may apply jointly if they demonstrate that it is feasible to run the program together;
however, the maximum grant per application under this NOFA is $1,000,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the program is intended to benefit public and Indian housing residents, an applicant that is otherwise eligible
and is combining FIC activities with FSS activities may use FIC funds to serve both HA residents and section 8 families
who are participating in the FSS Program. For all other families using FIC services, costs incurred are to be borne
by other resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To be eligible under this NOFA, a HA cannot have serious unaddressed, outstanding Inspector General audit findings
or fair housing and equal opportunity monitoring review findings or Field Office management review findings. In
addition, the HA must be in compliance with civil rights laws and equal opportunity requirements. A HA will be considered
to be in compliance if:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) As a result of formal administrative proceedings, there are no outstanding findings of noncompliance with civil
rights laws unless the HA is operating in compliance with HUD-approved compliance agreement designed to correct
the area(s) of noncompliance;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) There is no adjudication of a civil rights violation in a civil action brought against it by a private individual,
unless the HA demonstrates that it is operating in compliance with a court order, or implementing a HUD-approved resident

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) There is no deferral of Federal funding based upon civil rights violations;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) HUD has not deferred application processing by HUD under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Attorney General's
Guidelines (28 CFR 50.3) and HUD's Title VI regulations (24 CFR 1.8) and procedures (HUD Handbook 8040.1) [PHAs only]
or under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and HUD regulations (24 CFR 8.57) [PHAs and IHAs];
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) There is no pending civil rights suit brought against the HA by the Department of Justice; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Resident Involvement.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has a longstanding policy of encouraging HAs to promote resident involvement, and to facilitate cooperative
partnerships to achieve specific and mutual goals. Therefore, residents must be included in the planning and implementation
of this program. The HA shall develop a process that assures that RC/RMC/RO representatives and residents are fully
briefed and have an opportunity to comment on the proposed content of the HA's application in response to this NOFA.
The HA shall give full consideration to the comments and concerns of the residents. The process shall include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Informing residents of the selected developments regarding the preparation of the application, and providing

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Training/Employment/Contracting of HA Residents.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (a) Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C. 1701u) (Section 3) requires that programs
of direct financial assistance administered by HUD provide, to the greatest extent feasible, opportunities for
job training and employment to lower income residents in connection with projects in their neighborhoods. For purposes
of training and employment, the HA may offer opportunities to Section 3 residents in the following priority: (i) Residents
of the housing development for which the assistance is being provided; (ii) residents who reside within a project
area as defined in 24 CFR 135.15 and who reside in developments managed by the HA that is expending the assistance; and
(iii) other residents of the Section 3 area. Therefore, at a minimum each HA and each of its contractors and subcontractors
receiving funds under this program shall make best efforts to employ HA residents to provide services and renovation
or conversion work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) For purposes of the requirements under Section 3, a best effort means that the HA shall:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Attempt to recruit HA residents from the appropriate areas through local advertising media, signs placed at the
proposed FIC project site, and community organizations and public or private institutions operating within the
development area. The HA shall include in its outreach and marketing efforts, procedures to attract the least likely
to apply for this program because it includes construction/renovation type of activities, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 low-income households headed by women and persons with disabilities; and

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each application for grant award will be evaluated if it is submitted as required under Section II.B of this NOFA and
meets the eligibility requirements in Section I.E of this NOFA. Applications submitted for funds that include renovation,
conversion, or combination of dwelling unit activities will be competitively selected based on the highest scores
out of a possible 135 points. Applications submitted for funds solely to implement supportive services will be competitively
selected based on the highest scores out of a possible 140 points. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Initially, HUD will distribute funds geographically in order to seek diversity through an appropriate mix of public
and Indian housing authorities. Grants will be awarded to the two highest ranked eligible applicants in each funding
category per HUD region. In addition, grants will be awarded to the two highest ranked eligible IHA applications in
each funding category on a nationwide basis. All of the remaining applications will then be placed in overall nationwide
ranking order, with the remaining funds granted in order of rank until all funds are awarded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD will review and evaluate the application as follows, according to whether the application seeks funds for supportive
services only or for other activities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this notice will not have substantial direct effects on States or their political subdivisions,
or the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities
among the various levels of government. As a result, the notice is not subject to review under the Order. The notice
announces the availability of funds to provide families living in public or Indian housing with better access to education
and job opportunities to achieve self-sufficiency and independence.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this
notice has potential for a significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being. The purpose
of the notice is to provide funding to assist families living in public or Indian housing with better access to education
and job opportunities to achieve self-sufficiency and independence, and, thus, could benefit families significantly.
However, because the impact on families is beneficial, no further review is considered necessary.

E. Section 102 HUD Reform Act: Documentation and Public Access Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD will ensure that documentation and other information regarding each application submitted pursuant to this
NOFA are sufficient to indicate the basis upon which assistance was provided or denied. This material, including
any letters of support, will be made available for public inspection for a five-year period beginning not less than
30 days after the award of the assistance. Material will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information
Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. In addition, HUD will include the recipients
of assistance pursuant to this NOFA in its quarterly

 notice of all recipients of HUD assistance awarded on a competitive basis. (See 24 CFR 12.14(a) and 12.16(b), and the
notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

F. Section 103 of the HUD Reform Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD's regulation implementing section 103 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (42
U.S.C. 3537a) became effective on June 12, 1991. That regulation, codified as 24 CFR part 4, applies to the funding
competition announced today. The requirements of the rule continue to apply until the announcement of the selection
of successful applicants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD employees involved in the review of applications and in the making of funding decisions are restrained by part
4 from providing advance information to any person (other than an authorized employee of HUD) concerning funding
decisions, or from otherwise giving any applicant an unfair competitive advantage. Persons who apply for assistance
in this competition should confine their inquiries to the subject areas permitted under 24 CFR part 4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics (202) 708&hyph;3815 (voice/TDD). (This is
not a toll-free number.) The Office of Ethics can provide information of a general nature to HUD employees, as well.
However, a HUD employee who has specific program questions, such as whether particular subject matter can be discussed
with persons outside the Department, should contact his or her Regional or Field Office Counsel, or Headquarters
counsel for the program to which the question pertains.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
G. Section 112 of the Reform Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3537b) contains two provisions dealing
with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements
on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the
taking of a management action by the Department and those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts
the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of
housing units received or are based on the amount of assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt
of assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 13 was implemented by final rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 17, 1991 (56 FR 22912). If readers are involved in any efforts to influence the Department in these ways, they
are urged to read the final rule, particularly the examples contained in Appendix A of the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any questions about the rule should be directed to the Office of Ethics, room 2158, Department of Housing and Urban
Development, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20410&hyph;3000. Telephone: (202) 708&hyph;3815 (voice/TDD)
(This is not a toll-free number.) Forms necessary for compliance with the rule may be obtained from the local HUD office.

H. Freedom of Information Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applications submitted in response to this NOFA are subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).
To assist the Department in determining whether to release information contained in an application in the event a
FOIA request is received, and applicant may, through clear earmarking, or otherwise, indicate those portions of
its application that it believes should not be disclosed. The applicants's views will be used solely to aid the Department
in preparing its response to a FOIA request; however, the Department is required by the FOIA to make an independent
evaluation of the information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD suggests that an applicant provide a basis, when possible, for its belief that confidential treatment is appropriate;
general assertions or blanket requests for confidentiality, without more information, are of limited value to the
Department in making determinations concerning the release of information under FOIA. The Department is required
to segregate disclosable information from nondisclosable items, so an applicant should be careful to identify each
portion of the application for which confidential treatment is requested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department emphasizes that the presence or absence of comments or earmarking regarding confidential information
will have no bearing on the evaluation of applications submitted in response to this solicitation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of section 319
of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) (the ``Byrd
Amendment'') and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. These authorities prohibit recipients of federal
contracts, grants or loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative branches of the
Federal government in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding
of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification
regarding lobbying. Under 24 CFR part 87, applicants, recipients, and subrecipients of assistance exceeding $100,000
must certify that no federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying activities in connection with the assistance.
The Department has determined that an IHA established by an Indian Tribe as a result of the exercise of its sovereign
power is not subject to the Byrd Amendment, but an IHA established under State law is subject to those requirements
and prohibitions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The goal of the Eisenhower National Program is to support projects of national significance in elementary and secondary
schools in mathematics and science education designed to improve the skills of teachers and the quality of instruction
in these areas and to increase the access of students to that instruction. The program is authorized under title II,
part A, subpart 1, section 2012 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 12, 1993, the Secretary announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 60007) a proposed priority for the Eisenhower National Program in model professional development in the use
of technology for mathematics and science instruction. Now, after considering the intent of the Senate Report that
accompanied the Fiscal Year 1994 Department of Education Appropriations Act, the Secretary has decided to propose
two additional priorities, announced herein. These priorities will serve (1) to encourage the interest and attainments
of female and minority students in mathematics and science and (2) to improve teacher professional development in
environmental education.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary may subsequently conduct an external study or studies of the effectiveness and lessons learned from
projects funded under this program. If he does so, projects will be required to cooperate with the conduct of the study,
by sharing their experiences, project evaluations, and data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding priority 1, the Secretary is concerned that the Nation's schools encourage too few minority and female
students to study and pursue careers in the fields of mathematics and science. The Secretary believes that the well-documented
underrepresentation of minorities and women in these disciplines represents a waste of human talent that the Nation
can ill afford. This priority would therefore support, and learn from, projects that seek to stimulate and sustain
the interest and attainments of female and minority children in mathematics and science. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding priority 2, the Secretary believes that environmental education can stimulate students' interest in
scientific fields and enhance their understanding of these disciplines. The Secretary also believes that environmental
issues are important in their own right and are, therefore, eminently worthy of study. The Secretary finds, however,
that environmental education programs of high quality are available in too few of the Nation's schools, in part because
American teachers have very limited opportunities to increase their knowledge of environmental issues and to learn
the most successful means of providing environmental education. The Secretary proposes, therefore, to support
and learn from projects in professional development for teachers in environmental education. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary draws to the attention of potential applicants responding to priority 2 the National Consortium for
Environmental Education and Training (NCEET) at the University of Michigan, an undertaking funded by the Environmental
Protection Agency under section 5 of the National Environmental Education Act of 1990. NCEET's primary emphasis
is professional development for teachers in environmental education. Potential applicants should consult with
NCEET to ensure that their projects are not duplicative of the National Consortium's efforts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary will announce the final priorities in a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The final priorities will be determined by responses to this notice, available funds, and other considerations
of the Department. Funding of particular projects depends on the availability of funds, the nature of the final priorities,
and the quality of the applications received. The publication of these proposed priorities does not preclude the
Secretary from proposing additional priorities; nor does it limit the Secretary to funding only these priorities,
subject to meeting applicable rulemaking requirements.
